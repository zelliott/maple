zzso psychologists, zzso and economists have long been interested in how individuals weigh information about potential rewarding and aversive stimuli to make decisions and to regulate their zzso However, we know relatively little about how zzso and aversive systems interact in the brain, as most prior studies have investigated only one zzso of zzso Previous work has suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso represents information about the reward value of zzso We therefore investigated whether zzso also represents information about aversive zzso and, if so, whether individual zzso process information about both rewarding and aversive zzso Monkeys performed a trace conditioning task in which different novel abstract visual stimuli zzso zzso zzso predicted the occurrence of one of three zzso stimuli zzso a large liquid zzso a small liquid zzso or an aversive zzso Three lines of evidence suggest that information about rewarding and aversive stimuli zzso in individual zzso in zzso First, zzso zzso often responded to both rewarding and aversive zzso despite their different sensory zzso Second, zzso neural responses to zzso often zzso information about both potential rewarding and aversive zzso even though these stimuli differed in both zzso and sensory zzso Finally, zzso neural responses were correlated with zzso behavioral use of information about both rewarding and aversive zzso zzso These data indicate that processing of zzso and aversive stimuli zzso at the single cell level in zzso providing a possible zzso for executive and emotional processes that require using information from both zzso and aversive zzso
