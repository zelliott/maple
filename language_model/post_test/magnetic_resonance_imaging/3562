zzso zzso is known to be an important cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso are widely used in clinical practice and in the zzso literature to assess the severity of zzso zzso The indication for deepening zzso to treat zzso zzso is also mainly based on the severity of zzso zzso according to zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating the efficacy of the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso and zzso agreements of the zzso and zzso zzso as described by zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

From 50 patients, 50 lateral zzso as well as 50 zzso scans were read twice independently within 4 weeks by 4 surgeons (2 senior and 2 junior zzso Analysis was made according to zzso 4 grades of zzso criteria of zzso zzso as well as zzso between 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso analysis showed fair zzso and zzso agreements zzso while the zzso analysis showed good to excellent agreement zzso The best overall agreement was found for the zzso analysis on zzso scans zzso The lateral zzso tended to underestimate the severity of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is valid for typing zzso zzso and is particularly useful in separating zzso from high-grade zzso
