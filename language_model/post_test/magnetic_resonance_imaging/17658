zzso of this study was to compare the utility of zzso weighted imaging zzso with the established diagnostic techniques CT and fluid attenuated inversion recovery zzso in their detecting capacity of zzso zzso zzso and further to compare the combined zzso zzso data with CT to evaluate whether zzso is more accurate than zzso 

Twenty-five patients with acute zzso underwent CT and zzso within 6 days after symptom zzso zzso pathology for zzso was head trauma zzso zzso aneurysm zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and spontaneous bleeding zzso zzso zzso and CT data were zzso The anatomical distribution of zzso was subdivided into 8 zzso regions with three peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso two central zzso and spaces zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso 

zzso was detected in a total of 146 zzso zzso CT identified 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 129 zzso involved zzso Combined zzso and zzso identified all 146 zzso regions zzso zzso was sensitive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso was particularly sensitive for zzso and zzso zzso 

By combining zzso and zzso zzso yields a distinctly higher detection rate for zzso than CT alone, particularly due to their complementary detection characteristics in different anatomical zzso zzso strength of zzso is high in central areas, whereas zzso shows a better detection rate in peripheral zzso
