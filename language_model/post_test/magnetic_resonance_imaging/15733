zzso zzso zzso in primates contains several functional areas associated with visual control of body zzso zzso arm, hand and zzso which contain zzso tuned to specific depth ranges appropriate for the zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso area zzso is involved in head movements and is selective for motion in zzso around the zzso We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine zzso in the putative human zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso cortex, as a function of viewing distance when multiple cues to target depth were available zzso 1) and when only zzso cues were available zzso zzso In zzso 1, subjects viewed stationary or moving disks presented at three distances (with equal retinal zzso Although zzso in zzso showed no preference for any particular spatial range, the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso with zzso highest for near viewing, moderate for zzso length viewing, and lowest for far zzso In zzso 2, we investigated whether the near response alone zzso of the eyes, accommodation of the lens and zzso zzso was sufficient to elicit this same zzso zzso zzso fixated lights presented at three distances which were illuminated zzso (with zzso and visual angle zzso across zzso zzso displayed the same zzso of zzso zzso as that seen in zzso 1, even with reduced cues to zzso zzso seems to reflect the status of the near response (perhaps driven largely by zzso zzso and may provide areas in the zzso visual stream with spatial information useful for guiding actions toward targets in zzso
