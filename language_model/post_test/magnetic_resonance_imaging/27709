zzso analyses and zzso modeling of human brain function from zzso data frequently require the zzso of regions of interests zzso Several analyses have relied on zzso derived from anatomical or zzso boundaries to specify these zzso yet the suitability of zzso for resting state functional connectivity zzso studies has yet to be zzso This article introduces a zzso method for generating an zzso zzso by zzso whole brain zzso zzso data into zzso coherent regions of homogeneous zzso Several zzso statistics are used to compare zzso zzso as well as determine an adequate number of zzso Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the zzso zzso against four zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Automatic zzso zzso and a random zzso zzso The evaluated anatomical zzso exhibit poor zzso zzso and do not accurately reproduce zzso patterns present at the zzso zzso In general, the proposed functional and random zzso perform zzso for most of the metrics zzso zzso size and hence the number of zzso in a zzso had the greatest impact on their suitability for zzso zzso With 200 or fewer zzso the resulting zzso consist of zzso with zzso zzso and thus offer increased zzso zzso results containing higher numbers of zzso zzso or zzso most accurately represent zzso patterns present at the zzso scale and are preferable when zzso can be sacrificed for zzso The resulting zzso and zzso software have been made publicly available at: zzso
