Multiple sclerosis zzso is an zzso disease of the white matter in the brain that can have a progressive zzso However, the progression of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso might represent a more fundamental change in disease activity, zzso zzso of vulnerable zzso and zzso In zzso this may imply that the major loss of brain tissue structure is caused by a combination of zzso and cellular loss, both of which are likely to cause disability in zzso We used the PET isotope zzso zzso as a calcium zzso zzso to zzso brain tissue damage, based on the fact that zzso influx is essential in both cell death and zzso zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso detects any zzso zzso and, if so, to assess any correlation with the progression rate zzso of the disease and with zzso zzso as detected by zzso Seven zzso patients zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 healthy controls underwent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both image zzso was made by zzso zzso zzso frequency was assessed and correlated with the zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated significantly more zzso in the zzso brain than in the healthy brain, both zzso and zzso Every single zzso zzso could be retrieved as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso frequency correlated significantly with zzso Our pilot study possibly suggests zzso as a tool in zzso disease activity in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
