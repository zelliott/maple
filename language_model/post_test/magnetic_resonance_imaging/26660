Recent studies have identified brain zzso of zzso zzso but none have assessed how accurately patterns of brain activity can predict individual differences in zzso zzso We zzso data from two zzso studies of zzso analgesia (N zzso zzso using patterns of zzso activity during the anticipation and experience of pain to predict new subjects' scores on zzso analgesia and zzso changes in pain zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso which provided both unbiased estimates of zzso accuracy and zzso maps of which regions are most important for zzso Increased anticipatory activity in a zzso network and decreases in a zzso zzso network predicted zzso zzso zzso of anticipatory activity across the zzso predicted a moderate amount of zzso in the zzso response zzso overall, zzso for study 2 zzso which is substantial considering the multiple likely contributing zzso The most zzso regions were those associated with emotional appraisal, rather than cognitive control or pain zzso During pain, decreases in zzso and zzso regions most strongly predicted zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso regions explained significant zzso in zzso zzso but the pattern of effects was inconsistent with widespread decreases in zzso zzso Together, the findings suggest that engagement of emotional appraisal circuits drives individual variation in zzso zzso rather than early suppression of zzso zzso This approach provides a framework that will allow prediction accuracy to increase as new studies provide more precise information for future zzso zzso
