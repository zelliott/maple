zzso zzso Imaging zzso is a novel zzso technique that can potentially locate the margins of primary and zzso brain zzso As a result, the additional real-time anatomical and zzso information may significantly contribute to an improved extent of tumor zzso Our objectives in this article are zzso to briefly discuss the current status of zzso imaging zzso including zzso and zzso to present a case report that evaluates the usefulness of zzso in detection of brain tumor and its zzso In this case report, zzso was used in a patient with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso profile of the tumor and surrounding normal cerebral zzso were mapped with a zzso zzso zzso infrared camera by zzso zzso The data obtained by zzso zzso revealed a clear zzso of tumor with significant temperature differences, up to zzso degrees C, between the tumor core zzso degrees zzso and the surrounding normal tissue zzso degrees zzso zzso and zzso MR and CT confirmed the position and size of the zzso The volume of the tumor was preoperatively calculated using the zzso software and zzso zzso measurement of the tumor residual was calculated by the zzso zzso zzso Our result, along with previously published results of others, suggests that zzso imaging could be used to provide a zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso
