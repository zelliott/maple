zzso with zzso zzso are impaired in the timing of repetitive movements that involve the zzso of discrete events such as tapping a zzso In contrast, these individuals perform comparably to controls when producing continuous repetitive zzso Based on this, we have proposed that the zzso plays a key role in event zzso representation of the zzso relationship between salient events related to the movement zzso zzso onset or contact with a response zzso In the current study, we used zzso to examine zzso activity during discrete and continuous rhythmic zzso Participants produced rhythmic movements with the index finger either making smooth, continuous transitions between zzso and extension or with a pause inserted before each zzso phase making the movement zzso zzso regions in zzso zzso zzso to the moving hand were activated in a similar manner for both zzso However, zzso in the superior zzso was significantly greater when the movements were discrete compared to when the movements were zzso This pattern was not evident in cortical regions within the field of view, including zzso and zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso are selectively engaged during tasks involving event zzso
