zzso objects in the hand requires the continuous transformation of sensory input into appropriate motor zzso Using a novel zzso device combined with zzso the cortical network associated with tactile zzso transformations was zzso Continuous tactile stimuli were delivered in a random or predictable pattern to the second zzso on the right hand of all zzso To better distinguish sensory and motor zzso subjects were instructed to make zzso motor gripping responses with their left zzso A consistent cortical network of zzso was revealed that included the supplementary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso primary and secondary zzso and primary motor zzso Tracking the unpredictable versus predictable tactile stimulus led to greater delays in motor responses and to increased performance zzso zzso effects due to stimulus predictability were observed in several components of the network, though it was most evident as increased cortical zzso in frontal motor regions during tracking of unpredictable tactile zzso In contrast to the proposed zzso primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso to tactile input did not reveal enhanced responses during unpredictable zzso zzso during unpredictable tracking was also observed in primary zzso zzso zzso to motor responses, the receptive site for zzso zzso The present study provides a novel and controlled approach to investigate the zzso associated with zzso processing and to measure the zzso effect of stimulus predictability on network zzso
