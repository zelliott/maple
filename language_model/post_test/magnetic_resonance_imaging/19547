zzso resonance zzso imaging is a fast developing zzso that has become an indispensable diagnostic tool at numerous disease zzso The first MR zzso in Norway was installed in zzso by the end of 1999 Norway will have a total of 39 units, approximately one unit per zzso zzso MR technique uses zzso and magnetic fields, and no zzso radiation is zzso Imaging is based on the fact that all biological zzso are zzso when placed in a strong, zzso magnetic zzso Short zzso zzso set the tissue magnetic zzso into zzso and the zzso zzso electric currents in a receiver zzso The electric signals are zzso zzso by means of magnetic field zzso thus enabling image reconstruction by means of zzso zzso The signal zzso can be made dependent on several tissue zzso thus creating several unique image contrast zzso
