To investigate the in zzso and three-dimensional zzso length changes of the zzso ligaments during shoulder abduction using open magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

From 2007 to 2008 zzso attachment points of the zzso ligaments were obtained by anatomical study and zzso zzso scanning of 10 embalmed zzso shoulders, including the superior zzso ligament zzso middle zzso ligament zzso the anterior band of the inferior zzso ligament zzso zzso zzso and the zzso band of the inferior zzso ligament zzso Then an in zzso study was conducted, in which 14 right shoulder zzso of 14 healthy volunteers were evaluated in 7 zzso abduction positions zzso degrees , 30 degrees , 60 degrees , 90 degrees , 120 degrees , 150 degrees and 180 degrees ) using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the shoulders and located the attachment points of the ligaments were zzso zzso lengths were based on the shortest calculated paths between each origin and zzso in zzso space along the zzso bone surface for each abduction zzso 

During shoulder zzso the zzso distance of zzso was found to zzso and attained zzso length at 30 degrees abduction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso attained zzso length at 60 degrees zzso zzso zzso and 120 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reached the zzso length at 180 degrees abduction zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso limits inferior translation of the zzso head at 30 degrees of zzso zzso maintains maximum anterior stability at 60 degrees of zzso zzso prevents anterior dislocation of the zzso head at 120 degrees of zzso In 180 degrees zzso zzso provided anterior stability and zzso has the contribution to the inferior zzso
