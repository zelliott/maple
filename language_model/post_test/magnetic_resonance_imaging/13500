To ascertain the dynamic changes between the median nerve and zzso zzso in the zzso tunnel, MR images of 16 zzso in eight volunteers were studied in zzso extension, and neutral zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso were obtained with the zzso straight, extended at 45 degree, and zzso at 45 zzso Each scan was evaluated with regard to zzso changes of the median nerve and zzso zzso in the zzso tunnel as well as zzso in nerve zzso In the neutral position, the median nerve was found in one of two standard zzso either anterior to the superficial zzso zzso of the index finger or zzso more zzso between this zzso and the zzso zzso zzso During extension, the nerve always maintained or assumed an anterior position between the superficial index finger zzso and the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso moved zzso With zzso the zzso shifted zzso toward the zzso and the median nerve was found in one of three zzso It either remained in its anterior position between the superficial index finger zzso and zzso or became zzso between the superficial zzso zzso of the index finger and thumb or middle finger and ring zzso Nerve shape varied with its zzso zzso positioned nerves were flattened in the zzso plane between the zzso and zzso zzso this was greatest with zzso and least with zzso zzso nerves were flattened in the zzso plane or rounded in zzso In conclusion, the alignment of the median nerve in the zzso tunnel, its shape, and its relationship to the zzso zzso were variable and dependent on wrist zzso These findings may explain why certain wrist motions, zzso in particular, zzso a person to zzso tunnel zzso
