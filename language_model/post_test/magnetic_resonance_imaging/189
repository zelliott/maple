The purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude and direction of respiratory displacement of the ascending and descending zzso zzso during breathing zzso In 11 healthy nonsmokers, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging was performed in zzso orientation at the zzso zzso during maximum expiration and inspiration as well as tidal zzso The magnitude and direction of zzso displacement was determined relatively to resting respiratory position for the ascending zzso and descending zzso zzso To estimate a respiratory threshold for occurrence of distinct respiratory zzso motion, the latter was related to the underlying change in zzso zzso zzso zzso displacement between maximum expiration and inspiration was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the AA in the left anterior direction and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso in the right anterior zzso The mean respiratory zzso excursion during tidal breathing was zzso zzso zzso zzso The respiratory zzso zzso the increase in zzso diameter necessary to result in respiratory zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso The data suggest that after a threshold of respiratory zzso excursion is zzso zzso is accompanied by significant displacement of the zzso zzso Although this threshold may not be reached during tidal breathing in the majority of individuals, zzso differences during forced zzso impact on zzso zzso may result in additional zzso forces on the zzso wall, and may be of significance for zzso zzso designed for zzso zzso zzso zzso
