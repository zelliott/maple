The aim of this study is to describe the zzso of the rare zzso that is zzso of the internal auditory canal zzso and determine the course of the facial nerve in cases of normal facial nerve zzso 

Index cases were zzso selected from our electronic database in which all inner ear zzso presenting to a zzso referral center between 1995 and 2010 are zzso zzso zzso zzso data and magnetic resonance zzso images were reviewed by two zzso An zzso analyzed the patients' clinical zzso 

Nine ears of six patients (three zzso three zzso with zzso of the zzso were zzso All patients presented with sensory neural hearing zzso Two of these unilaterally affected patients had facial nerve zzso In the other seven cases of complete zzso of the zzso the facial nerve was zzso in its zzso segment close to the zzso zzso Where the nerve fibers enter the zzso zzso the facial nerve takes a sharp lateral turn and enters a minute canal by which it reaches the zzso zzso In the two ears with facial nerve zzso this zzso could not be zzso 

In zzso of the zzso the facial nerve takes a zzso and superior course, with its own canal starting at the point where the zzso nerve enters the zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso points to absence of this zzso zzso facial nerve zzso
