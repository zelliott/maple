To correlate long-term clinical outcome and the results of zzso as well as advanced zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques zzso zzso chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso zzso in patients after zzso zzso transplantation zzso in knee zzso 

Nine zzso patients zzso female and seven zzso median age, 49) had clinical zzso zzso Documentation Committee zzso modified zzso visual analog scale zzso and zzso long-term follow-up examinations at a median of zzso years zzso range, zzso Standard zzso zzso and zzso of cartilage were performed on a 3 T MR zzso zzso imaging further included zzso and chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso imaging at 7 zzso The zzso resonance Observation of zzso zzso zzso zzso score was used for quantitative assessment of zzso zzso 

Clinical outcome was good with a median modified zzso score of zzso Median zzso revealed zzso and median zzso score 75 zzso The difference between native and repair cartilage was statistically significant for all three zzso imaging zzso The strongest correlation was found between the results of the advanced zzso imaging methods zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the results from zzso and zzso imaging, a correlation was found between zzso score and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the results from clinical scores with zzso a correlation between modified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso clinical outcome in patients zzso years after zzso was good, but did not correlate with zzso and zzso imaging results except for zzso
