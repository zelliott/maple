zzso of the magnetic properties of cerebral aneurysm clips in patients undergoing magnetic resonance zzso imaging is zzso The authors zzso in electromagnetic units the magnetic properties of 13 different types of aneurysm clips by using a vibrating sample zzso Their results showed that the magnetic moment of these clips ranged from zzso zzso to as high as zzso zzso Based on these results and tests of the movement of the clips during MR imaging, they conclude that aneurysm clips with a magnetic moment less than 1 zzso may be safely used during MR zzso The zzso of magnetic properties into electromagnetic units by using a vibrating sample zzso is a reliable method zzso to any testing field zzso This method can be used as a standard to measure and label the magnetic properties of aneurysm zzso
