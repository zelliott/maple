Changes in the zzso loop have been suggested in the zzso of obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso and have been studied using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso with interesting zzso However, whether neural zzso are abnormal in the zzso prefrontal zzso in patients with zzso is zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate neural zzso in this brain region in a sample of patients with zzso 

zzso were 21 zzso zzso patients, including 10 who were zzso and 19 healthy zzso zzso zzso MRS was used to study the zzso prefrontal zzso for each zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso compounds and zzso were measured in terms of their ratios with zzso zzso 

The zzso ratio was significantly higher among zzso patients than among healthy controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, it did not correlate with patients' symptoms or with their illness zzso The zzso ratio also did not differ between zzso and previously zzso zzso No significant group differences were found between zzso patients and normal controls for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, a significant correlation between the zzso ratio and trait anxiety scores on the zzso zzso zzso was found among the controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso level relative to zzso in the zzso prefrontal zzso was increased among zzso zzso zzso This cannot be attributed to the effect of zzso The possible significance of this finding in the zzso of zzso is zzso
