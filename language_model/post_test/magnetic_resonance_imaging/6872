To characterize the zzso response in the zzso the time to resolution of disease, and the correlation between magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso zzso results, biopsy findings, and serum zzso zzso zzso level after external beam zzso 

A total of 55 patients underwent zzso before and/or at varying times after external beam zzso The percentage of the zzso healthy, and zzso zzso was zzso and the time to resolution of disease was determined and compared with the zzso zzso 

Of the 55 patients, zzso had negative zzso and zzso had positive zzso zzso A strong correlation was found between negative zzso and negative biopsy findings zzso zzso zzso and between positive zzso and positive biopsy findings zzso zzso zzso A weak correlation was observed between the zzso level and the zzso and biopsy zzso The mean time to disease resolution was zzso months and the mean time to zzso zzso was 50 zzso With time, an increase in zzso and a decline in zzso metabolism was zzso 

When used in conjunction with zzso measurement and zzso the results of this study suggest that zzso contributes to a greater level of confidence in determining the outcome and may be a useful adjunct for assessing local control before zzso failure when striving to distinguish the benign zzso from local zzso
