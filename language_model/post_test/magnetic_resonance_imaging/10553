Previous studies have revealed altered structural development of the frontal zzso and prefrontal zzso zzso in children with symptoms of zzso stress disorder zzso This study is the first to provide a detailed structural analysis of the zzso in children with and without zzso zzso We compared gray and white matter volume in four zzso of the zzso between said groups, then explored whether volume was associated with zzso symptom severity and functional zzso zzso zzso were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging zzso data from a sample of 23 children zzso zzso with a history of trauma and symptoms of zzso who had undergone assessment for zzso symptoms and functional impairment using the Child and Adolescent version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were compared to data from an zzso control group of 24 healthy zzso Children with zzso symptoms showed a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the delineated zzso and zzso regions of the zzso than did control zzso zzso volume of gray matter in the zzso zzso correlated with increased functional impairment zzso zzso indicate that increased volume of the zzso and zzso zzso may be associated with trauma and zzso symptoms in zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso zzso may influence the degree of functional impairment experienced by children with zzso zzso
