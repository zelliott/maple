To report a case of an zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from the jugular zzso zzso are tumors usually seen in the deep soft zzso of the zzso and are rarely seen within the zzso zzso The zzso differential diagnosis includes zzso conventional zzso and zzso zzso among zzso A distinguishing feature of zzso is their characteristic zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso man presented with progressive hearing loss and gait zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a zzso enhancing zzso zzso mass in the zzso zzso A right far lateral zzso skull base approach with gross total removal of the tumor was zzso zzso findings showed that the mass appeared to arise from the zzso nerve within the jugular zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso studies were zzso 

zzso and zzso studies were compatible with the diagnosis of zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso studies showed disruption of the zzso gene locus at zzso and added further support to the zzso 

We report a rare case of zzso arising from the jugular zzso and the diagnosis of zzso can be supported by confirmation of disruption of the zzso gene zzso
