The use of Cartesian electronic feedback for zzso a major improvement in the functioning of magnetic resonance zzso is zzso The zzso of both flip angle and signal strength upon probe zzso matching, and tuning are virtually zzso Thus, for a chosen probe, sample geometry and flip angle, the free induction zzso signal strength is rendered solely dependent upon the number of zzso The instrument therefore becomes capable of absolute zzso In addition, phase and zzso distortion of selective zzso introduced by crossed diodes, power amplifier heating, zzso is virtually zzso as are radiation zzso and phase zzso caused by probe zzso The use of multiple zzso at the same frequency, for example zzso zzso and phased zzso is also simplified as the effects of interactions between such zzso are typically reduced by two orders of zzso
