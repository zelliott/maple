To assess the correlation between imaging findings zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging zzso and neurological status before and after the treatment of bacterial brain zzso 

CT and zzso images of 96 patients with brain zzso were zzso evaluated in terms of the number, location and size of zzso and the presence and extent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso An imaging severity index zzso based on these different zzso parameters was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scores and zzso were assessed and the zzso value of these two zzso was zzso The zzso correlation test, zzso test, zzso test, zzso characteristic zzso analysis, together with comparison of zzso analyses and zzso exact test were zzso 

There was a negative correlation between zzso and the initial zzso zzso zzso increased as the zzso score zzso indicating an inverse relationship zzso zzso There was a significant difference between the zzso and zzso scores of patients with an adverse event compared with patients with good zzso zzso was significantly worse in patients with initial zzso over the calculated zzso values of 8 points or zzso scores under the zzso value of 13 zzso 

zzso is a useful zzso indicator for bacterial brain zzso patients and zzso strongly with the patient outcome for all parameters zzso zzso score had a better zzso value than zzso
