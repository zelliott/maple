The aims of this trial were to investigate the effect of zzso zzso factor zzso on zzso ejection fraction and zzso survival in patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We enrolled 44 patients suffering from zzso zzso with late zzso achieved by zzso coronary intervention zzso Patients were zzso to receive either zzso zzso at a dose of zzso body zzso zzso or zzso Changes of global and regional cardiac function from baseline zzso after zzso over 1 and zzso to zzso of follow-up were analyzed by magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso fraction improved in zzso treated patients from zzso to zzso zzso and decreased slightly to zzso after zzso zzso fraction also improved in the zzso group from zzso to zzso zzso and decreased slightly to zzso after zzso zzso zzso follow-up was performed in 23 out initial 44 zzso There was no significant difference between the two groups at any time zzso Other parameters such as zzso size, zzso zzso left zzso zzso and zzso volumes were not different between the two zzso zzso survival of such as death, zzso zzso zzso or acute coronary zzso coronary artery bypass zzso and target zzso zzso was not significantly different between both zzso 

zzso administration after zzso zzso is feasible and safe but does not improve zzso function or survival when used as a single zzso
