Rapid auditory processing and auditory change detection abilities are crucial aspects of speech and language development, particularly in the first year of zzso Animal models and adult studies suggest that zzso zzso and in particular zzso zzso play key roles in this zzso We zzso that infant perception of rapid pitch and timing changes is zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso source zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso we examined the neural zzso of rapid auditory processing in zzso During a standard oddball zzso infants listened to tone pairs with zzso standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tone pairs were first presented in a block with a short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso followed by a block of stimuli with a longer zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso showed greater zzso peak zzso in response to the zzso tone in both conditions and later and larger zzso during Rapid Rate zzso compared to the Control zzso Sources of neural activity, localized to right and left auditory regions, showed larger and faster zzso in the right zzso for both rate zzso zzso analysis of the source activity revealed clusters of zzso band enhancement to the zzso tone in right auditory zzso for both zzso Left auditory activity was enhanced only during Rapid Rate zzso These data suggest that local zzso zzso zzso zzso rapid processing and can robustly index auditory perception in young zzso Furthermore, left zzso recruitment during rapid frequency change discrimination suggests a difference in the spectral and zzso resolution of right and left zzso at a very young zzso
