A retrospective zzso 

To evaluate and compare clinical and zzso outcomes of the zzso and zzso 

There is no clinical report comparing zzso and zzso 

Among a total of 61 patients who underwent total disc replacement, 57 patients followed more than 3 years were zzso The zzso was used in 33 patients and zzso in zzso zzso follow-up was possible in 52 zzso Clinical and zzso data including range of motion zzso and facet zzso of the replaced segment, and zzso of the disc at the adjacent level were zzso 

Mean percentage improvement of zzso zzso Index zzso score was zzso in the zzso group and zzso in zzso zzso The mean improvement of the Visual zzso zzso zzso pain score was zzso in the zzso and zzso in zzso There was no statistical difference between 2 groups in improvement rates either of the zzso scores and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was seen in zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of disc zzso at the adjacent level above the index level was seen in zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso The degradation rates of facet zzso and disc at adjacent segment between the 2 groups were not significantly zzso zzso zzso of the replaced segments was well zzso but zzso of zzso of the zzso was significantly less than that of the zzso 

While clinical outcomes of both zzso and zzso groups were fairly good, the facet joint of the index level and the disc at the adjacent level showed an zzso of the degenerative process in a significant number of patients, regardless of the device used, raising concerns of possible late consequences of total disc replacement, especially regarding facet zzso and adjacent segment zzso
