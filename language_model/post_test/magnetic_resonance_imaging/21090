We evaluated 50 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease, age and gender paired to 47 healthy zzso We selected two homogeneous groups of 18 patients taking zzso and 7 no zzso zzso The functional magnetic resonance imaging verbal zzso task, with low and high cognitive demands, was performed at a zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso Data was analyzed with zzso software for group maps and zzso zzso 

Patients without zzso had more zzso than the ones with zzso in the zzso frontal and in the left frontal and zzso zzso The zzso zzso in patients taking zzso had similar result of the zzso detected in the healthy volunteer zzso zzso areas were less activated in the zzso group than in the no zzso zzso
