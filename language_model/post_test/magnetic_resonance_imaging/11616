zzso zzso brain zzso the use of brain zzso and zzso drainage all result in an zzso brain deformation that is known as brain zzso Thus, zzso systems relying on zzso image data have a decreasing accuracy during the surgical zzso zzso image data represent the correct zzso situation, so their use may compensate for the effects of brain zzso 

In a series of 16 brain tumor patients, we used zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging to obtain 3-D data, which were then transferred to the zzso zzso zzso With the help of bone zzso markers these images were registered zzso updating the zzso zzso 

In all patients the updating of the zzso system with the zzso MR data was zzso It led to reliable zzso with high zzso the mean registration error of the update procedure in all patients was zzso zzso The updating procedure added about 15 minutes to the operation zzso In all patients the area suggestive of remaining tumor was reached and the additional tumor could be zzso resulting in a complete tumor removal in 14 zzso In the remaining patients extension of the tumor into eloquent brain areas prevented a complete zzso 

The update of a zzso system with zzso MR images reliably compensates for the effects of brain zzso This method allows completion of tumor removal in some difficult brain zzso
