The ability to imagine the future zzso relies on many of the same brain regions that support memory for the zzso To date, scientific research has primarily focused on the neural zzso of episodic forms of zzso zzso simulation of zzso specific future zzso however, little is known about the neural zzso of semantic zzso zzso simulation of future zzso zzso Of particular interest is the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and specifically the zzso Although the zzso has been proposed to play a key role in episodic zzso recent evidence suggests that it may not play a similar role in semantic zzso To examine this possibility, zzso patients with zzso zzso were asked to imagine future issues occurring in the public zzso The results showed that patients could list general semantic facts about the future, but when zzso to elaborate, patients produced impoverished descriptions that lacked semantic zzso This impairment occurred despite intact performance on standard zzso tests of semantic processing and did not simply reflect deficits in narrative zzso The performance of a patient with damage limited to the zzso was similar to that of the remaining patients with zzso zzso and zzso patients' impaired zzso of the semantic future correlated with their impaired zzso of the semantic zzso Together, these results provide novel evidence from zzso zzso that memory and zzso are linked in the semantic domain and reveal that the zzso play a critical role in the construction of detailed, zzso semantic zzso
