zzso zzso veins can be identified on the zzso phase of the brain circulation in patients with zzso congestion related to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The term zzso pattern zzso has been used to describe this zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of zzso in patients with zzso zzso and to analyze the relationship of this sign to zzso location of the zzso presence of retrograde zzso zzso zzso and MR zzso 

We zzso reviewed the charts and imaging findings of 130 patients with zzso zzso In 122 patients the zzso phase of the brain circulation was adequately zzso The zzso was graded as mild, moderate, or zzso 

zzso was found in 51 patients zzso zzso zzso of the 44 patients who had a zzso zzso deficit, or seizure had zzso as compared with 16 zzso of the 75 who had a zzso or zzso zzso The three patients with either zzso heart failure or increasing head circumference had zzso Fourteen zzso of the 16 who had zzso of the superior zzso zzso straight zzso or superior zzso zzso had zzso zzso was seen in 46 zzso of 57 patients who had retrograde zzso zzso drainage and in five zzso of the 65 who had only zzso zzso Fourteen zzso of the 16 who had white matter zzso zzso on MR images had severe zzso 

The zzso reflects zzso congestion and is associated with an aggressive presentation with or without retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a useful zzso indicator and should be considered in treatment zzso
