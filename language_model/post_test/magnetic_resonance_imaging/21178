There is growing evidence for the idea of zzso zzso in white zzso In the current study, we compared zzso response functions zzso in white matter and gray matter using zzso zzso White matter zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso of the corpus zzso at both the group and individual levels zzso an established zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso were compared to zzso from zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of the raw zzso revealed similar overall response zzso zzso impulse response modeling confirmed that the zzso zzso characteristics were comparable to those of the zzso zzso but had significantly decreased peak response zzso 

Overall, the results matched a zzso expectations of smaller zzso responses in white matter due to the relative drop in cerebral blood flow zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso zzso the findings demonstrate that despite lower zzso and zzso white matter zzso zzso remained within zzso ranges at zzso
