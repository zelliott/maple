There is consistent evidence that brain volume changes in early and late zzso Most zzso studies usually only span a few years and include a limited number of zzso In this review, we integrate findings from 56 zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso studies on whole brain volume change in healthy zzso The individual zzso zzso studies describe only the development in a limited age zzso In total, zzso participants were zzso Age at first measurement varied between 4 and 88 years of zzso The studies included in this review were performed using a large range of methods zzso different scanner protocols and different acquisition zzso We applied a weighted zzso analysis to estimate the age dependency of the rate of relative annual brain volume change across zzso The results indicate that whole brain volume changes throughout the life zzso A wave of growth occurs during zzso where around 9 years of age a zzso annual brain growth is found which levels off until at age 13 a gradual volume decrease sets zzso During young adulthood, between zzso and 35 years of age, possibly another wave of growth occurs or at least a period of no brain tissue zzso After age 35 years, a steady volume loss is found of zzso per year, which zzso gradually to an annual brain volume loss of zzso at age zzso The brains of people over 60 years of age show a steady volume loss of more than zzso zzso the mechanisms underlying these plastic brain changes may contribute to distinguishing progressive brain changes in psychiatric and neurological diseases from healthy aging zzso zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso 2011 zzso zzso zzso
