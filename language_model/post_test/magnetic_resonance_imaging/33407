zzso resonance zzso zzso is a newly developed zzso tool for zzso evaluation of patients with zzso zzso We discuss whether MR zzso can provide useful information about the zzso zzso compared with other diagnostic zzso 

MR zzso of 20 patients with zzso zzso were reviewed to evaluate the site of zzso the cause of zzso and the degree of zzso 

The precise location of an zzso zzso and complete display of the zzso zzso tree just zzso to the obstruction were provided in all 20 patients by MR zzso the same as in direct zzso MR zzso could completely distinguish common duct stones from zzso whereas accurate differentiation among the zzso was zzso In six patients, MR zzso was not able to help in zzso between high-grade zzso and complete zzso 

Although precise zzso zzso of the zzso and extent of the zzso disease by MR zzso was inferior to direct zzso MR zzso is easily performed for a short duration and is a zzso diagnostic zzso for assessing the outline of the anatomy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we recommend promptly performing MR zzso if zzso zzso is suspected on clinical zzso
