Study aim To explore various sources of zzso in the measurement of zzso volumes and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied 100 patients zzso zzso 18 years, 51 zzso to assess the impact of: zzso manual zzso zzso zzso data set zzso zzso zzso zzso 16- or zzso zzso zzso software sensitivity for automated zzso surface zzso and zzso image quality, on the measurement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes, zzso zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data sets were analyzed and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso was used as reference in 26 zzso zzso Manual editing of zzso surface improved the agreement of zzso volumes with zzso but increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Data set zzso resolution had no significant impact on zzso zzso Adding the 17th to zzso zzso model did not significantly increase zzso zzso software sensitivity in zzso surface detection increased zzso (101 zzso 46 zzso zzso 118 zzso 50 zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and improved agreement of zzso and zzso with zzso Impact of software sensitivity in zzso zzso detection on zzso parameters was related to image zzso higher on zzso in zzso with zzso quality zzso 17 bias zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher on zzso volumes in patients with optimal quality zzso bias 14 zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso bias 5 zzso zzso 9 zzso P zzso zzso zzso Manual editing, software settings and image quality significantly impact on zzso zzso volumes and zzso zzso
