To determine the zzso use, and perceived value of magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the management of acute central nervous system zzso trauma in United States Level I (or zzso trauma centers zzso 

One hundred zzso American College of Surgeons, state or locally designated Level I (or zzso zzso were identified using compiled lists and telephone zzso zzso about MR use in zzso trauma were mailed to each zzso zzso telephone calls were made to zzso zzso Data were analyzed using frequency zzso 

Using returned questionnaires from trauma directors and follow-up telephone zzso data on the physical location, zzso zzso and patient monitoring capabilities were zzso The questionnaire addressed the perceived value and zzso of MR for acute zzso trauma in general, distinguishing between spinal zzso and traumatic brain injury, using a zzso rating zzso 

One hundred nine zzso of identified zzso responded by zzso Sixty zzso required contact by zzso One hundred zzso zzso reported MR scanners zzso zzso Five of seven zzso without on-site MR had facilities within 5 zzso No zzso reported the inability to obtain MR zzso zzso percent of zzso reported MR zzso zzso zzso percent of MR facilities were staffed 24 hours per day, zzso by zzso zzso technologists at night and on zzso zzso reported patient monitoring capabilities including cardiac monitoring zzso and pulse zzso zzso Seventy-one percent reported the ability to scan zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso use zzso 51% report zzso use, and zzso zzso use MR for acute zzso zzso percent of trauma directors agreed or strongly agreed that MR directed management and was cost-effective for spinal zzso zzso zzso percent agreed or strongly agreed that MR directed management and was cost-effective for traumatic brain zzso No correlation existed between perceptions of MR zzso in zzso trauma and the number of trauma admissions or on-site zzso 

Most trauma directors consider MR important in the acute evaluation of spinal trauma and, to a lesser extent, for traumatic brain zzso Despite these opinions, the vast majority of these centers reported only zzso to zzso use of MR in the setting of acute zzso zzso Our results show that most zzso have on-site and continuously available MR facilities capable of cardiac and pulmonary zzso Other factors such as the higher relative cost of MR may be responsible for the zzso between the perceived value and the actual zzso of MR imaging in the setting of zzso zzso
