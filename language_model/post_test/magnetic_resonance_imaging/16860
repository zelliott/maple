zzso learning is a dynamic process that allows us to incorporate new knowledge within existing semantic zzso Even after years, a seemingly stable association can be altered by a single significant zzso Here, we investigate whether the acquisition of new associations affects the neural representation of stimuli and how the brain zzso stimuli according to zzso and emerging zzso zzso zzso data were collected during a differential fear conditioning procedure and at test zzso weeks zzso Two pictures of faces and two pictures of houses served as zzso One of each pair zzso with a shock in half of the trials zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso in a zzso manner, we zzso changes in the similarity of neural representations of stimuli over the course of zzso Our findings show an increase in similarity of neural patterns throughout the zzso on consecutive trials of the reinforced zzso Furthermore, neural pattern similarity reveals a shift from original categories zzso toward new categories zzso over the course of zzso This effect was zzso represented in the cortex, with visual areas primarily reflecting similarity of low-level stimulus properties zzso zzso and frontal areas reflecting similarity of stimulus significance (new zzso zzso were not dependent on overall response zzso and were still present during zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a useful tool for examining how the human brain encodes relevant associations and forms new zzso zzso
