zzso of the carotid artery is common following carotid zzso but analysis of zzso composition has mostly been based on zzso study of zzso zzso zzso This study investigated the ability of zzso cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso to determine the components of zzso carotid artery disease and examined whether these differed from primary zzso zzso 

50 patients underwent zzso zzso of both carotid arteries using a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 patients had previously undergone carotid zzso zzso time since surgery zzso days, range zzso zzso and 25 with primary zzso zzso plaques served as zzso Two experienced zzso zzso the zzso zzso images according to the presence or absence of major plaque features and assigned an overall zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso carotid disease following zzso the mean degree of zzso was 51% zzso zzso Three distinct types of zzso were zzso 5 patients zzso showed zzso characteristics of zzso zzso 11 patients zzso had plaque features consistent with possible zzso zzso zzso and 6 patients zzso had zzso plaque suggestive of further zzso zzso Three patients zzso showed evidence of zzso dissection of the carotid zzso Compared to primary zzso zzso zzso plaques were more likely to contain zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso and less likely to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly between patients with early and late zzso 

As defined by zzso zzso zzso of the carotid artery fall into three distinct types and differ in composition from primary zzso zzso If validated by subsequent zzso studies, these findings could suggest a role for zzso in detecting high-risk zzso zzso zzso zzso
