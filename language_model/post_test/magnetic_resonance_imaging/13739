The aim of the study was to establish the normal range and to evaluate the zzso of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso zzso estimates in normal human pelvic zzso zzso patients with prostate cancer, undergoing zzso deprivation treatment, had paired zzso examinations of the pelvis using zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement parameters were calculated for each examination: transfer constant zzso leakage space zzso and maximum contrast medium zzso zzso of pelvic muscles, bone zzso and zzso zzso and zzso statistics were zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of variation zzso The zzso head and zzso fat showed large numbers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso bone zzso had the highest values of kinetic zzso estimates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Muscle parameters values were lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean difference between paired examinations was not significantly different from zero for any zzso zzso and zzso had the lowest zzso (between 19 and zzso For individuals, a zzso zzso change of approximately zzso in muscles and zzso in the zzso would be statistically zzso The corresponding absolute changes for zzso are zzso in muscle and zzso in the zzso For a group of 19 patients, small changes are statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fat and the zzso head are unreliable zzso from which to obtain kinetic zzso estimates due to poor zzso zzso and zzso have smaller zzso of variation than zzso in muscles and zzso zzso studies of normal and pathological zzso should be incorporated into clinical research protocols that measure treatment effects by zzso zzso
