zzso life expectancy of children with chronic zzso failure zzso has increased the number of patients with zzso zzso and has brought to light novel and severe forms of the zzso These factors have contributed to the need to evaluate new, zzso imaging zzso for the detection of bone zzso 

To evaluate the potential of zzso in the detection of the bone changes of zzso zzso as compared to conventional zzso 

Fourteen children with zzso were examined with a zzso MR unit using zzso and STIR sequences and conventional zzso The following features were reviewed in a zzso zzso skeletal zzso zzso of cortical bone, zzso pattern, zzso zzso masses, zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso signal zzso 

zzso adequately demonstrated skeletal zzso cortical zzso and irregular zzso zzso It showed zzso and zzso zzso masses more conspicuously than zzso In addition, it revealed diffuse zzso signal changes in the bone zzso 

zzso is a potentially useful tool for evaluating the bone changes of zzso zzso
