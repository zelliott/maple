Cell therapy has the potential to treat or cure a wide variety of zzso zzso cell tracking techniques are, however, necessary to translate this approach to the clinical zzso This protocol details methods to create zzso that are visible by zzso ultrasound zzso or magnetic resonance zzso for the zzso and zzso of cellular zzso Three steps are generally used to zzso cellular zzso in an zzso zzso zzso droplets of zzso liquid zzso are zzso using an zzso zzso through a needle tip into a solution containing a dissolved zzso zzso salt to form a solid zzso zzso the resulting zzso spheres are coated with zzso as a zzso and zzso these complexes are then incubated in a second solution of zzso to form a zzso membrane composed of an inner and an outer layer of zzso The zzso can be rendered visible during the first step by adding contrast agents to the primary zzso zzso Such contrast agents include zzso iron oxide for detection by zzso MR imaging zzso the zzso agents zzso or zzso zzso for detection by X-ray zzso or zzso zzso for zzso detection by zzso zzso X-ray and US zzso The entire synthesis can be completed within 2 zzso
