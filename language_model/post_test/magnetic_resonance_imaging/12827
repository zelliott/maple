zzso memory zzso represent a core deficit in schizophrenia that severely limits patients' functional zzso This quantitative zzso of functional imaging studies of episodic zzso and retrieval tests the prediction that these deficits are most consistently associated with dysfunction in the prefrontal zzso 

zzso likelihood zzso zzso was used to perform a quantitative zzso of functional imaging studies that contrasted patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers during episodic zzso and zzso From a pool of 36 potential studies, 18 zzso studies in standard space that included a healthy comparison sample and low-level baseline contrast were zzso 

As predicted, patients showed less prefrontal zzso than comparison subjects in the frontal pole, zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso during zzso and the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso prefrontal zzso during zzso The zzso prefrontal zzso zzso deficits were not present in studies that provided patients with zzso strategies, but zzso prefrontal zzso deficits remained and were not secondary to group performance zzso The only zzso zzso lobe finding was relatively greater patient versus comparison subject zzso in the zzso zzso during zzso and zzso 

The finding of prominent prefrontal dysfunction suggests that cognitive control deficits strongly contribute to episodic memory impairment in zzso Memory rehabilitation approaches developed for patients with frontal lobe zzso and zzso approaches designed to improve prefrontal zzso function may therefore hold special promise for zzso memory deficits in patients with zzso
