To review brain imaging studies of zzso control in subjects with normal control and urge zzso to define a simple model of zzso zzso zzso and to propose a neural correlate of urgency and possible origins of urge zzso 

Review of published reports of brain imaging relevant to urine storage, and secondary analyses of our own recent zzso 

In a simple model of normal urine storage, zzso and zzso zzso received in the zzso gray zzso are mapped in the zzso forming the basis of sensation; the anterior zzso zzso zzso provides monitoring and zzso the prefrontal zzso makes zzso zzso The net result, as the zzso zzso is zzso of the zzso zzso center zzso and of zzso together with gradual increase in insular response, corresponding to increasing desire to zzso In zzso subjects, brain responses zzso At large zzso volumes and strong sensation, but without zzso zzso zzso most cortical responses become zzso especially in zzso This may be both a learned reaction to previous zzso episodes and the neural correlate of zzso The neural signature of DO itself seems to be prefrontal zzso zzso causes of urge zzso include dysfunction of prefrontal zzso or zzso system, suggested by weak responses and/or zzso as well as abnormal zzso signals or zzso of infantile zzso 

zzso control depends on an extensive network of brain zzso zzso in various parts may contribute to urge zzso suggesting that there are different zzso requiring different zzso
