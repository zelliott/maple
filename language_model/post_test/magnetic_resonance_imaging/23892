We consider PET zzso zzso zzso measurement with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to be one of the most useful methods to identify activated areas of the brain involved in language zzso zzso is an effective zzso method that detects markedly activated areas over the whole zzso However, with the conventional presentations of these functional brain images, such as horizontal zzso three directional projection, or brain surface zzso makes understanding and interpreting the zzso relationships among various brain areas zzso zzso we developed zzso reconstructed images from these functional brain images to improve the zzso The subjects were 12 normal zzso The following three types of images were zzso 1) routine images by zzso 2) three-dimensional zzso images, and 3) three-dimensional dynamic images, after PET images were analyzed by zzso during daily zzso zzso The creation of images of both the three-dimensional zzso and dynamic types employed the volume rendering method by zzso (The zzso zzso Since the functional brain images did not include original brain images, we zzso zzso and zzso brain images by self-made zzso zzso The three-dimensional dynamic images were made by sequencing zzso images with available zzso Images of both the three-dimensional zzso and dynamic types were processed by a personal computer zzso Our newly created images showed clearer zzso relationships among activated brain areas compared to the conventional zzso To date, functional brain images have been employed in fields such as neurology or zzso however, these images may be useful even in the field of zzso to assess hearing and zzso zzso three-dimensional images based on functional brain images are important for exact and intuitive zzso and may lead to new developments in brain zzso Currently, the surface model is the most common method of three-dimensional zzso However, the volume rendering method may be more effective for imaging regions such as the zzso
