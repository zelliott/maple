zzso resonance imaging of zzso has been shown to predict surgical anatomy accurately and identify complex zzso In addition, zzso complexity has been correlated with poor outcome after surgical zzso We investigated whether zzso magnetic resonance imaging could predict clinical outcome after surgery for zzso disease better than clinical examination under zzso 

zzso patients with clinically suspected zzso underwent zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging before surgical zzso zzso was assessed at a minimum of one year after surgical exploration and correlated in a blinded fashion with the surgical and magnetic resonance grading of the severity of the zzso zzso 

Of 70 patients, 12 were not operated on and 6 were lost to zzso making 52 patients eligible for zzso Assessment by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging more accurately predicted outcome than the findings at initial surgical zzso Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging had a sensitivity of 81 percent, specificity of 73 percent, and positive zzso value of 75 percent; surgery had a sensitivity of 77 percent, specificity of 46 percent, and positive zzso value of 59 zzso zzso assessment of apparent disease severity bore no relation to final zzso Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging could accurately predict whether patients were likely to have a satisfactory or unsatisfactory outcome after zzso 

Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging better predicts clinical outcome of patients with zzso than initial surgical zzso
