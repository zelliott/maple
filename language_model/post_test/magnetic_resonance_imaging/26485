The silent period following motor evoked zzso in small hand muscles after zzso magnetic stimulation zzso of the human motor zzso is considered to be cortical zzso The authors report three patients with cervical spinal zzso zzso who showed loss of the cortical silent period zzso after zzso One patient had traumatic cervical zzso injury, and the other two patients had cervical zzso All the patients had cervical zzso zzso on magnetic resonance zzso zzso study showed loss of the zzso in both the hand and foot muscles in two patients and only in the foot muscle in one zzso zzso zzso study in one patient with zzso hands showed reduced zzso within the motor zzso The hand weakness or interrupted sensory zzso might have caused motor cortical reorganization or zzso leading to the loss of the zzso
