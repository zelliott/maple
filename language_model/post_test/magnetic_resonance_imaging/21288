Assessment of cerebral zzso zzso function with zzso spin labeling zzso pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging zzso could be a highly useful tool in clinical psychiatric zzso The goal of this study was to verify the reliability of zzso zzso after an oral challenge of a selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in repeated assessment of cerebral zzso zzso In a zzso zzso crossover study we investigated the effect of a single oral dose of zzso on brain cerebral blood flow zzso using a zzso zzso sequence zzso in twelve female healthy zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso signal was good for all regions tested zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses revealed small but significant effects of a zzso challenge on zzso values in zzso rich brain regions, among which the frontal zzso and zzso These effects could however not be zzso between sessions, most probably due to the small effect size of the oral zzso challenge on cerebral blood zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso reliability of zzso zzso with an oral zzso challenge is low, limiting the zzso sensitivity to zzso changes and consequently its use as a zzso research zzso
