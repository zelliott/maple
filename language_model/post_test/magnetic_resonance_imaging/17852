The default mode network zzso has been linked to a number of mental disorders including zzso However, the abnormal connectivity of zzso in early onset schizophrenia zzso has been rarely zzso 

Independent component analysis zzso was used to investigate functional connectivity zzso of the zzso in 32 zzso adolescents with zzso and 32 age and zzso healthy zzso 

Compared to healthy controls, patients with zzso showed increased zzso between the zzso frontal zzso and other areas of the zzso zzso correlation analyses showed that the zzso of zzso frontal zzso significantly correlated with zzso symptoms zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso corrected zzso 

Although the sample size of participants was comparable with most zzso studies to date, it was still relatively zzso zzso brains were registered to the zzso adult brain zzso However, possible zzso differences in spatial zzso that arise from registering pediatric brains to the zzso adult brain template may have little effect on zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence for functional abnormalities of zzso in zzso zzso These abnormalities could be a source of abnormal zzso mental zzso
