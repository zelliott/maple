To report early observation of transient zzso zzso on this pilot study of external beam radiation therapy and magnetic resonance imaging zzso guided high dose rate zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven patients with zzso and high-risk localized prostate cancer received zzso guided zzso zzso zzso zzso each zzso before and after a course of external beam zzso zzso zzso Two patients continued on hormones during follow-up and were censored for this zzso Four patients discontinued hormone therapy after zzso Five patients did not receive zzso zzso bounce is defined as a rise in zzso values with a subsequent fall below the zzso value or to below zzso of the maximum zzso zzso Six previously published definitions of zzso failure to distinguish true failure from were zzso definition 1, rise zzso zzso definition 2, rise zzso zzso definition 3, rise zzso of previous value; definition 4, zzso defined guidelines, definition 5 zzso + 2 zzso and definition 6, zzso + 3 zzso 

Median follow-up was 24 months zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso of transient zzso zzso was: zzso for definition 1, zzso for definition 2, zzso for definition 3, zzso for definition 4, zzso for definition 5, and zzso for definition zzso 

We observed a substantial zzso of transient zzso in zzso following combined external beam radiation and zzso zzso for prostate zzso Such zzso seem to be zzso and should not trigger initiation of salvage zzso No definition of failure was completely zzso
