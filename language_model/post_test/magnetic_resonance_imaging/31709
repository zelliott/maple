Little is known about the neural development underlying high order visual zzso For example, in detection of structures by zzso moving dots, motion information must interact with zzso information to enable object zzso zzso involving these different zzso zzso are known to activate distinct specialized brain areas in zzso Here, we investigate neural development of normally developing children using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso during perception of randomly moving zzso dots zzso zzso moving dots that formed a zzso rotating object zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced neural activity as compared with zzso dots in motion zzso visual areas, including visual area zzso zzso and middle zzso area zzso in 10 adults (age zzso zzso Children (age 5-6 zzso showed less pronounced activity in area zzso than zzso zzso of zzso induced enhanced neural activity as compared to zzso in adults in the left zzso shape area zzso whereas children increased neural activity within zzso zzso and zzso brain areas zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These findings provide evidence of neural development within the zzso zzso First, maturation was associated with enhanced activity in specialized areas within the zzso zzso during zzso perception zzso and zzso perception zzso zzso high order visual zzso neural development was associated with a shift in neural activity from low level shape and motion specialized areas in children, including partially immature area zzso to high order areas in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso
