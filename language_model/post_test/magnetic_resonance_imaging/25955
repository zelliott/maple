zzso changes in bovine zzso zzso cartilage, induced by component selective zzso treatments, were investigated by measuring tissue zzso relaxation at zzso zzso This zzso zzso was compared with Young's zzso a measure of elastic zzso and zzso ability of cartilage zzso zzso was used to digest the collagen network and zzso ABC to remove zzso zzso light zzso and digital zzso were used to assess zzso penetration after 44 zzso of zzso zzso zzso relaxation in superficial cartilage increased significantly only in samples treated with zzso A statistically significant decrease in Young's zzso was observed in both zzso treated sample zzso These results confirm that zzso of zzso cartilage is sensitive to the integrity of collagen in the zzso zzso Nonetheless, it does not appear to be an zzso indicator of cartilage zzso which is significantly impaired in zzso
