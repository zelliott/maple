To measure and assess the significance of zzso zzso volume zzso determined zzso by equilibrium contrast cardiovascular magnetic zzso as a clinical zzso in health and a number of cardiac diseases of varying zzso 

Prospective zzso 

zzso referral zzso zzso in London, zzso 

192 patients were mainly recruited from specialist zzso We studied patients with zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso severe zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with those for 81 normal zzso 

In normal subjects, zzso zzso zzso zzso measured in the zzso was slightly higher in women than men zzso zzso to zzso vs zzso zzso to zzso zzso with no change with zzso In disease, the zzso of zzso was the same as in normal subjects but higher in all other diseases zzso Mean zzso was the same in zzso zzso and AS zzso zzso zzso respectively), but higher in cardiac zzso zzso and higher again in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, each zzso Where zzso was zzso correlations were found with zzso left zzso mass, end zzso volume, ejection fraction and left zzso area in apparent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso assessed zzso in the zzso with equilibrium contrast cardiovascular magnetic zzso shows gender differences in normal individuals and zzso zzso zzso zzso shows early potential to be a useful zzso in health and zzso
