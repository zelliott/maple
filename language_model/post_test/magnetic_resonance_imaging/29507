To determine the effect of digital zzso examination findings, zzso biopsy results, and zzso zzso zzso levels on reader accuracy in the zzso of prostate cancer with zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging and MR zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective study of 37 patients zzso age, 57 zzso with zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR images and MR zzso images were zzso Two independent readers, unaware of clinical data, recorded the size and location of suspicious peripheral zone tumor zzso on a standardized zzso of the zzso Readers also recorded their degree of diagnostic confidence for each zzso on a zzso zzso Both readers repeated this interpretation with knowledge of zzso examination findings, zzso biopsy results, and zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were the reference zzso zzso zzso analysis with generalized zzso equations was used to correlate tumor detection with clinical data, and alternative zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis was used to examine the overall effect of clinical data on all positive zzso 

Fifty-one peripheral zone tumor zzso were identified at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed awareness of clinical data significantly improved tumor detection rate zzso zzso from 15 to 19 zzso for reader 1 and from 13 to 19 zzso for reader 2 zzso zzso by using both size and location zzso zzso analysis showed no significant change in overall reader performance because there was an associated increase in the number of zzso findings with awareness of clinical data, from 11 to 21 for reader 1 and from 16 to 25 for reader zzso 

Awareness of clinical data significantly improves reader detection of prostate cancer zzso with zzso MR imaging and MR zzso imaging, but there is no overall change in reader zzso because of an associated increase in zzso zzso A stricter definition of a zzso result is associated with reduced sensitivity for prostate cancer zzso zzso
