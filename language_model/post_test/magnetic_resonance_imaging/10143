In multiple sclerosis zzso zzso occurs in various cortical and zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether this is mostly due to gray zzso or white matter zzso zzso Recently, a new zzso brain region extraction zzso technique was developed to zzso zzso volume in 13 zzso zzso This study zzso SABRE and tissue zzso to examine whether regional brain zzso in zzso is mostly due to zzso or zzso loss, correlated with disease zzso and moderated by disease zzso We studied 68 zzso patients and 39 normal controls with zzso T brain zzso As expected, zzso diagnosis was associated with significantly lower zzso zzso zzso regional brain zzso zzso zzso While significant findings emerged in 11 zzso zzso only four zzso comparisons were zzso The largest mean zzso percent differences between groups zzso zzso zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso region zzso superior frontal zzso and superior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed zzso regions were more zzso of zzso diagnosis than zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso were significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with disease duration compared to only one zzso zzso zzso trends emerged for differences in zzso but not zzso between secondary progressive zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso between the two groups were largest in superior frontal zzso zzso superior frontal zzso and superior zzso zzso regions, with SP patients having lower zzso Overall, zzso in zzso is diffuse and mostly related to zzso loss particularly in deep zzso and superior zzso zzso
