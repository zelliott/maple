Current models of zzso zzso are difficult to use for zzso studies because of high mortality and important variations of zzso size and location of blood zzso We propose a modification of the zzso blood infusion technique in rats to reduce these zzso 

The modification consisted in a mechanical zzso preceding blood zzso A zzso was zzso introduced into the zzso of adult zzso zzso a zzso zzso was created by a rotating zzso zzso inserted through the zzso followed by slow infusion of 30 zzso zzso blood during 5 zzso zzso included zzso zzso only and zzso + zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the animals zzso zzso using standardized zzso 

zzso mortality was zzso zzso One animal died during zzso zzso volume was constant and significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso than control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso edges were sharply delineated and the zzso region zzso zzso zzso with zzso showed initially a reduced spontaneous zzso zzso They also showed zzso deficits of zzso placing zzso 

The advantages of this model include a systematic control of all steps of zzso production, high zzso of volume, size, and location of blood deposits, preservation of zzso brain zzso and quantifiable neurological zzso
