To establish the feasibility of the zzso approach to the zzso and to demonstrate the superiority of the zzso over the microscopic vision during zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

Nine consecutive patients with a zzso zzso were operated since November zzso The surgical procedure consisted of a zzso approach of the zzso with use of a rigid zzso zzso and zzso (3 months after zzso symptoms, zzso zzso Imaging zzso findings, zzso and zzso assessment, and zzso findings were zzso 

One patient presented a zzso leak with a successful zzso zzso Regarding symptom resolution, headache disappeared during the early zzso period in case of zzso zzso All cases of zzso zzso and zzso but one improved zzso Two patients recovered zzso deficient hormonal functions and six patients did not require substitution therapy any zzso No zzso packing was needed except in one zzso Considering the healing course, the zzso repair inside the zzso zzso was quicker with zzso removal at week zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a residual zzso zzso in 3 out of 6 cases of zzso Only one required radiation zzso These results are commented through comparison with the zzso approach and with surgery exclusively using the zzso 

The zzso zzso approach to the zzso zzso using the telescope is at least as effective as the conventional zzso approach using the operating microscope zzso It provides a wide access to the zzso zzso and an optimal vision of the critical zzso The absence of zzso zzso packing improves significantly the comfort of the patient during the first zzso zzso
