As 3 T MR scanners become more available, body imaging at high field strength is becoming the subject of intensive zzso However, little has been published on prostate imaging at 3 zzso Will zzso imaging dramatically increase our ability to depict and stage prostate zzso This paper will address this question by reviewing the advantages and drawbacks of body imaging at 3 T and the current limitations of prostate imaging at zzso zzso and by detailing the preliminary results of prostate 3 T zzso Even if slight adjustments of imaging protocols are necessary for taking into account the changes in zzso and zzso relaxation times at 3 zzso tissue contrast in zzso zzso imaging seems similar at zzso T and 3 zzso zzso significant improvement in cancer depiction in zzso imaging is not zzso However, increased spatial resolution due to increased zzso ratio zzso may improve the detection of minimal zzso zzso Higher field strength should provide increased spectral and spatial resolution for zzso imaging, but new pulse sequences will have to be designed for overcoming field zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, dynamic zzso zzso is the method of imaging that is the most likely to benefit from the increased zzso with a significantly better zzso between zzso and spatial zzso
