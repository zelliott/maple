Type A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are rare zzso fed primarily by the zzso anterior spinal zzso The artery is frequently too narrow or tortuous for zzso zzso and direct surgical zzso of the zzso requires an invasive zzso We present a less invasive indirect surgical approach through an zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso 

A 62-year-old man presented with a zzso history of progressive bilateral lower zzso zzso and weakness and associated zzso and zzso Spinal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated zzso flow zzso Selective spinal zzso revealed a zzso at zzso between the zzso anterior spinal artery and an early draining vein returning zzso along the zzso zzso diagnostic of an zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso were performed to disrupt the zzso zzso supply to the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the spinal zzso At zzso clinical follow, up the patient had regained zzso and zzso zzso was able to zzso with a cane, and reported zzso improvement of lower zzso zzso Selective spinal zzso at 1 year demonstrated no residual zzso zzso 

zzso zzso hypertension of a type A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can be treated by zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso This avoids zzso partial zzso required for direct zzso however, subsequent clinical follow-up is necessary to monitor for zzso
