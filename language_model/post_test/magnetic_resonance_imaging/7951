To determine when zzso breast zzso will not be more zzso than available breast imaging and can be omitted in patients eligible for breast zzso therapy zzso 

We performed an zzso in 685 consecutive patients with zzso invasive breast tumors and eligible for zzso based on conventional imaging and clinical zzso We explored associations between patient, zzso and conventional imaging characteristics and similarity with zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analysis was employed to zzso the area under the curve zzso 

zzso and conventional breast imaging were similar in zzso of the zzso tumors zzso At zzso analysis, age zzso negative zzso zzso zzso status zzso comparable tumor diameter at zzso and at ultrasound zzso negative zzso status zzso and absence of invasive zzso cancer zzso were significantly associated with this zzso At zzso analysis, these factors, except zzso status, retained significant zzso The zzso was zzso 

It is feasible to identify a zzso of patients prior to zzso breast zzso who will most likely show similar results on conventional imaging as on zzso These findings enable zzso of a practical consensus zzso to determine in which patients a zzso breast zzso can be zzso
