This pilot study aimed to evaluate the correlation between clinical symptoms and cartilage volume through zzso in patients with knee zzso after zzso of treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knee zzso patients aged zzso received either zzso zzso twice zzso zzso or zzso zzso during zzso zzso criteria were global pain in the target knee zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grade 2 or zzso Clinical assessments included zzso index and zzso for pain on motion, at zzso 24 and zzso and zzso at baseline and at 24 and zzso Global and compartments cartilage volume, joint cartilage zzso zzso zzso ligaments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The quantitative and qualitative zzso of zzso was tested by the zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared by an analysis of zzso with baseline value as zzso Groups were comparable at baseline for zzso disease zzso and cartilage zzso A significant zzso correlation was seen for the assessment of cartilage volumes, number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso within investigator and from zzso to zzso After zzso symptoms improved in both zzso The total cartilage volume increased in the zzso group zzso which opposed to a loss in the zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant differences between groups were observed for the other zzso zzso No correlations were evidenced between key zzso parameters changes and zzso The difference in the evolution of cartilage volume between the two groups could reflect a structure zzso effect of zzso This pilot study confirms the usefulness of quantitative and qualitative zzso as a sensitive tool to assess a structure zzso drugs in knee zzso
