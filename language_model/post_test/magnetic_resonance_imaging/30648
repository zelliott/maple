We measured zzso structures of 59 subjects with Parkinson's disease zzso and 140 zzso and zzso normal subjects without neurological disorders by using zzso MR zzso There is a significant increase in the maximum distance of the zzso zzso zzso and a significant decrease in the average distance from the zzso zzso to the red nucleus zzso in patients with zzso compared with normal subjects in the 70 years old or less zzso These findings may reflect the zzso increase of iron concentration and the zzso loss in the zzso However, it is difficult to find differences between normal subjects and patients with zzso in the greater than 70 years old group in the zzso zzso These findings based on a large-scale zzso study provide essential information to evaluate conventional MR images of zzso
