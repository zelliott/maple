When considering zzso of zzso generators near the central zzso it is essential to define the spatial relationship between the zzso generator and the primary zzso hand zzso In this study, the authors assessed the accuracy of zzso modeling of zzso spikes and median nerve zzso evoked zzso zzso in defining this relationship preoperatively and zzso 

zzso spikes and zzso in patients with focal central area zzso were represented by zzso models zzso onto global magnetic resonance zzso In patients who underwent surgery, spike zzso were also compared with findings of zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso To improve the accuracy of the zzso models, anatomical landmarks of the hand area were used to assess the error in zzso zzso location, and this error measure was used to correct the location of spike zzso Five patients with central zzso were zzso three of whom underwent zzso surgical zzso The location of zzso zzso correlated well with anatomical landmarks of the primary sensory hand zzso The relative position of the spike and zzso zzso correlated well with the patients' zzso symptoms, zzso findings, and the location of the zzso focus (as defined by the zzso cavity in patients who became seizure free zzso zzso spike zzso were located even closer to the zzso zzso 

The calculation of the relative location of spike and zzso zzso is a simple zzso method of determining the relationship between the primary hand area and an zzso focus in the central zzso The spatial resolution of this technique can be further improved using easily identifiable anatomical zzso
