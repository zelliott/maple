In 28 patients with various cardiac diseases we compared ejection zzso obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in a single zzso slice with zzso zzso in the right anterior zzso projection, the latter serving as the zzso Also, results were evaluated for clinical relevance and relation to image zzso The correlation between the two techniques was moderate zzso zzso zzso According to our standardized limits for clinical zzso insufficiently zzso ejection zzso were obtained in 14 zzso In 8 of these patients this was attributed to poor zzso edge zzso Edge detection problems were more frequently encountered by imaging with zzso 20 zzso than with zzso 32 zzso Other causes for zzso of the obtained ejection zzso are zzso It is concluded that determination of ejection fraction by single slice magnetic resonance imaging should not be used for clinical zzso Improvement can be expected by using a zzso slicing technique, a longer zzso in the zzso pulse zzso or in due course by application of newly developed zzso pulse zzso
