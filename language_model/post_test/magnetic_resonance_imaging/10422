The objective of this study was to implement a three-dimensional zzso zzso mapping sequence zzso at zzso T for zzso based on the Look Locker zzso 

Because all current reports on zzso are at zzso T and mostly using zzso zzso fast spin echo zzso data were acquired at zzso T and zzso T with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso of zzso were used and seven subjects (three zzso four zzso were scanned using the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso obtained on the phantom with zzso show very good agreement with those acquired with zzso zzso Using a zzso paired zzso test, the zzso zzso zzso in two sections obtained in all subjects with both sequences were found to be statistically indistinguishable at either field strength zzso zzso zzso at zzso T and P zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

The preliminary data presented here suggest that the zzso sequence provides accurate zzso values with sufficient zzso resolution and allows full joint coverage in less than 10 zzso
