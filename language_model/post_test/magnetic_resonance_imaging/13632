The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate whether zzso influences the clinical outcome or the zzso size after intravenous zzso of focal cerebral zzso A consecutive series of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso 17) with acute focal cerebral zzso zzso zzso in the middle cerebral artery zzso territory received zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso Clinical outcome was measured using the zzso Stroke zzso on admission and was followed up until day zzso zzso volume was measured by zzso MR imaging on admission, on days 3 and zzso There was a significantly better neurological outcome on day 28 in the zzso patients than in the zzso group zzso SS zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso The zzso volume increased significantly in the zzso patients Delta zzso zzso plus minus zzso compared to zzso patients Delta zzso zzso plus minus zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso in patients with a focal zzso zzso can cause a worse clinical outcome despite zzso of the zzso vessel by zzso zzso This zzso with a markedly larger increase of the zzso volume in the zzso zzso These results may be explained by an zzso zzso zzso and pH decrease by elevated energy levels which cannot be compensated by restoration of blood flow zzso
