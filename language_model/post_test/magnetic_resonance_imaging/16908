We wanted to zzso assess the adverse events and zzso effects associated with an intravenous zzso infusion in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease and who were undergoing cardiac zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients zzso zzso 9 zzso received zzso zzso zzso during cardiac zzso Before and during the administration, the heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and oxygen zzso were monitored using a zzso zzso We documented any signs and symptoms of potential adverse zzso 

In total, 47 out of zzso patients zzso experienced adverse effects, which were mostly mild or zzso In 13 patients zzso the zzso infusion was discontinued due to intolerable zzso or chest zzso No high grade zzso block, zzso or other life-threatening adverse events zzso The zzso zzso showed a significant increase in the heart rate during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A significant but clinically irrelevant increase in oxygen zzso occurred during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso versus 97 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The blood pressure did not significantly change during zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study confirms the safety of zzso infusion during cardiac zzso A considerable proportion of all patients will experience minor adverse effects and some patients will not tolerate zzso zzso However, all adverse events can be successfully managed by a zzso The increased heart rate during zzso infusion highlights the need to individually adjust the settings according to the patient, zzso the number of slices of zzso zzso zzso
