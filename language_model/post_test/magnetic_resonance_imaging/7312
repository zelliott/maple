The patient, a 34-year-old Caucasian female presented at the emergency department with acute abdominal pain in the right lower zzso zzso diagnostic zzso including zzso and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a large zzso mass at the base of the appendix with indirect signs of zzso A zzso appendectomy was performed the following day where the finding was zzso The patient went on to have an zzso recovery and was discharged from the hospital on the first zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging is a useful tool in identifying unknown zzso of the appendix and should be considered the primary imaging zzso in especially younger patients requiring diagnostic zzso In this case the zzso imaging findings aided in choosing the correct timing and treatment option for the zzso
