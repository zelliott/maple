zzso zzso complexes zzso not equal zzso zzso and zzso are the prototypes of a novel class of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging based on chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso Their ability to reduce the water signal intensity depends on the interplay of several zzso properties of the agent and instrumental zzso This study aims to identify possible routes for their zzso 

zzso transfer zzso has been measured in zzso at zzso T as a function of zzso temperature, and concentration of the zzso 

Large zzso transfer effects have been observed upon irradiating the coordinated water zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The comparison of the results obtained by irradiating water versus zzso zzso allows the zzso of zzso methods through which the ST response can be made independent on the concentration of the zzso 

The zzso of the magnetic properties along the zzso series allows an in-depth understanding of the zzso of ST effect and provides useful insights for the design of more efficient zzso
