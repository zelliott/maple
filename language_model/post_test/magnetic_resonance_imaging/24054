To evaluate a new zzso zzso technique, we applied a new magnetic resonance technique to 10 healthy volunteers and 21 patients with zzso of the zzso zzso In addition to the usually performed zzso and zzso zzso zzso a heavily zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso TE zzso 800 zzso was performed that allowed depiction of the zzso zzso duct zzso zzso patients with benign as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso duct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duct was reliably depicted in all volunteers and zzso The primary branching ducts were reliably depicted in all normal zzso zzso and zzso duct zzso and duct strictures were well depicted in patients with chronic zzso zzso with a calculus zzso the duct was demonstrated in 2 zzso In conclusion, zzso experience indicates that magnetic resonance zzso can be applied successfully to investigate the duct system of the zzso zzso The usually performed zzso zzso zzso and zzso images, zzso depicts the internal architecture of the zzso zzso with high zzso zzso resonance zzso with heavily zzso images adds important information about the zzso zzso Because it is completely zzso the only zzso are the ones generally accepted for zzso
