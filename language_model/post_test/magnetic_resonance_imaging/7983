Avoiding zzso injury in zzso concussion zzso requires understanding the neural mechanisms involved during the time of recovery after zzso The decision for zzso is one of the most difficult responsibilities facing the physician, and so far this decision has been based primarily on neurological examination, symptom zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso may be an zzso more objective tool to assess the severity and recovery of function after zzso The purpose of this study was to define neural zzso of zzso during the 2 months after injury in varsity contact sport athletes who suffered a zzso All athletes were scanned as they performed an zzso task, for zzso 2, zzso zzso were scanned within 72 hours zzso one), at 2 weeks zzso zzso and 2 months zzso three) zzso Compared with age and sex matched normal controls, zzso subjects demonstrated persistent, significantly increased zzso for the 2 minus 1 zzso contrast in bilateral zzso prefrontal zzso zzso in all three sessions and in the inferior zzso lobe in session one and two zzso zzso zzso of task performance revealed no significant differences between zzso versus control groups at any of the three time points with respect to any of the three zzso zzso These findings suggest that functional brain zzso differences persist at 2 months after injury in zzso athletes, despite the fact that their performance on a standard working memory task is comparable to normal controls and zzso of clinical and zzso test zzso These results might indicate a delay between neural and zzso assessed recovery after zzso
