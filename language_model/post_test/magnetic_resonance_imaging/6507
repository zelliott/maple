The research goals were to zzso a zzso zzso zzso membrane and study its efficacy in preventing zzso zzso Different weight ratios of zzso zzso zzso with zzso were tested for zzso and zzso zzso Forty-eight adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent an zzso zzso Sixteen rabbits each received a weight ratio of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso or a zzso membrane zzso zzso on the exposed zzso The last 16 rabbits received no treatment and served as zzso No adverse reaction of the zzso was zzso zzso resonance images revealed a zzso space between the zzso and the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso site 3 months after zzso zzso examination showed that the amount of zzso decreased with time in all zzso zzso of zzso decreased significantly at zzso sites treated with either zzso Compared with the control group, the extent of zzso zzso decreased significantly in the zzso zzso group at 3 months after zzso while it decreased zzso but not significantly, in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso membrane is a safe and effective zzso material in zzso When placed onto the zzso site, the membrane with a weight ratio of zzso zzso zzso appears to reduce zzso zzso zzso
