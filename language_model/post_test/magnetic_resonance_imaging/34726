The purpose of this study was to present our initial experience with zzso MR zzso with a zzso three-dimensional imaging zzso We performed MR zzso studies in two pigs (four zzso and five human subjects using zzso zzso The zzso sequence we used was the same as the one used for zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso MR three-dimensional zzso were obtained zzso minutes after the contrast injection with a dose as low as zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were very well zzso zzso MR zzso can be acquired within a single zzso after administration of zzso zzso This technique could become part of a protocol that could potentially lead to a single comprehensive diagnostic zzso for suspected zzso obstruction and gross zzso
