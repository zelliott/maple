To evaluate and improve on the procedures used by a tissue bank in selecting donor zzso for zzso this study was designed to fulfill four zzso zzso define and zzso a set of independent parameters for describing the geometry of the zzso and lateral zzso zzso determine how well the zzso protocol of the tissue bank zzso two zzso zzso zzso obtained from the injured knee or six zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso obtained from the zzso zzso predicts the four standard zzso parameters of the zzso zzso determine if including one additional zzso zzso measurement for each compartment improves the ability of zzso to predict zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine if five magnetic resonance imaging zzso at three different zzso cross sections of the zzso knee predict the 15 standard zzso parameters of the zzso in the injured zzso A zzso zzso three-dimensional coordinate zzso system was used to determine surface coordinates from which zzso were reconstructed in a zzso For each reconstructed zzso four parameters in the zzso plane and five zzso parameters in each of three regions zzso zzso middle, and zzso were zzso yielding a set of 19 standard parameters to describe the zzso Through a correlation analysis, these standard parameters were shown to be largely unrelated to one another, thus confirming that the parameters form an independent set describing the three-dimensional geometry of the zzso The two zzso zzso were poor zzso of zzso standard zzso zzso predicting only one of four standard parameters for the zzso zzso and none of four standard parameters for the lateral zzso with zzso of determination greater than or equal to zzso Including one additional zzso measurement to the tissue bank protocol increased the number of standard zzso parameters predicted to three of four for the zzso zzso and two of four for the lateral zzso zzso resonance imaging was better than zzso for predicting the three-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso zzso from magnetic resonance imaging predicted three of four standard zzso parameters for the zzso zzso and all four for the lateral zzso With the addition of the zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging, seven of 15 standard zzso parameters were predicted for both the zzso and lateral zzso Assuming that a successful clinical outcome depends on how well an zzso matches the size and shape of the original zzso magnetic resonance imaging rather than zzso should be used for zzso zzso by tissue zzso
