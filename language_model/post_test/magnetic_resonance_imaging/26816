persistent ST zzso after zzso ST zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to be related to poor zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso can evaluate zzso obstruction zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which represent severe zzso damage, have independent zzso value and are dynamic and evolving over the first zzso after zzso The aim of this study was to assess whether the development of zzso or zzso has an impact upon ST segment zzso 

patients undergoing primary zzso coronary intervention zzso for zzso had serial 12 lead zzso zzso from one hour after zzso until zzso zzso single lead zzso residual ST zzso zzso at each time point was zzso ST segment deterioration zzso was calculated on each zzso until discharge compared with one hour post zzso zzso zzso was performed within seven days post zzso zzso zzso weighted imaging to evaluate culprit artery area at risk zzso and zzso zzso delayed enhancement zzso zzso zzso size and zzso 

in the 41 patients studied zzso had zzso and zzso had zzso ST segment deterioration was more common in those with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was higher at each time point after zzso in those with zzso but only became statistically significant after zzso The measurement of zzso at 48 or zzso after zzso provided the best correlation with the combination of zzso size, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso injury as defined on zzso is associated with dynamic changes and persistence of ST segment zzso in the first zzso after zzso
