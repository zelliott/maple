zzso CT is considered the best alternative for zzso in the evaluation of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare zzso evaluation of spiral CT with zzso in patients suspected of zzso zzso 57 patients with zzso zzso syndrome underwent spiral CT and zzso T zzso Two zzso independently evaluated zzso zzso discs for zzso or zzso and 456 nerve roots for root zzso once after CT and once after zzso We compared zzso agreement using the zzso statistic and we performed a paired comparison between CT and zzso For detection of zzso or bulging discs, we observed no significant difference in zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso For root zzso we observed significantly better zzso agreement at zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In 30 of zzso zzso discs zzso and in 54 of 456 nerve roots zzso the observers disagreed on whether CT results were similar to zzso In the cases without zzso CT differed from zzso in 6 discs zzso and in 3 nerve roots zzso For zzso evaluation of zzso zzso discs, we found no evidence that spiral CT is inferior to zzso For evaluating zzso nerve root zzso spiral CT is less reliable than zzso
