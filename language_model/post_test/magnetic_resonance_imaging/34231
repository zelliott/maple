The signal zzso with increasing zzso at fixed echo time from brain tissue in zzso has been measured using a line scan zzso spin echo diffusion approach in eight healthy adult zzso The use of a 175 zzso echo time and maximum zzso strengths of 10 zzso allowed 64 zzso to be zzso ranging from 5 to zzso zzso zzso a maximum some three times larger than that typically used for diffusion zzso The signal zzso with zzso over this extended range showed a decidedly zzso behavior zzso to zzso zzso zzso analyses of the fitted zzso parameters from over 125 brain zzso (15 zzso 15 zzso 1 zzso zzso per volunteer yielded a mean volume fraction of zzso which decayed with a typical apparent diffusion zzso around zzso zzso The remaining fraction had an apparent diffusion zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso models which might explain the zzso behavior, such as zzso and zzso water zzso with slow exchange, appear inadequate for a complete zzso For typical diffusion imaging with zzso below 2000 zzso the standard model of zzso signal zzso with zzso apparent diffusion zzso values around zzso zzso and a sensitivity to diffusion zzso direction may appear zzso Over a more extended but readily accessible zzso range, however, the complexity of brain signal zzso with zzso increases, offering a greater zzso of the water diffusion process for tissue zzso
