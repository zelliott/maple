Although dietary folate zzso lowers plasma homocysteine and may reduce cardiovascular risk, high-dose zzso acid therapy appears to not alter clinical zzso zzso acid and its principal circulating zzso zzso improve vascular function, but mechanisms relating folate dose to vascular function remain zzso We compared the effects of zzso acid on human vessels using pharmacological high-dose versus zzso treatment, equivalent to dietary folate zzso 

zzso zzso patients with coronary artery disease were zzso to receive zzso zzso zzso or high-dose (5 zzso zzso acid or zzso for 7 weeks before coronary artery bypass zzso zzso function was zzso by magnetic resonance imaging before and after zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso were determined in segments of zzso vein and internal zzso zzso zzso zzso acid increased zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, reduced vascular zzso production, and improved zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso through availability of the zzso zzso No further improvement in these parameters occurred with high-dose compared with zzso zzso Whereas plasma zzso increased zzso with treatment dose of zzso acid, vascular tissue zzso showed no further zzso with high-dose compared with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso acid treatment, comparable to daily intake and dietary zzso improves vascular function through effects on zzso zzso oxide zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso acid treatment provides no additional zzso These direct vascular effects are related to vascular tissue levels of zzso rather than plasma zzso zzso zzso acid treatment likely zzso no further benefit in subjects already receiving folate zzso
