We aimed to investigate whether early zzso formation can be zzso with in zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso by the use of a novel zzso zzso contrast agent zzso 

zzso formation plays a central role in several vascular zzso During the early zzso of zzso formation, activated factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso indicating the potential of zzso zzso in the detection of early zzso zzso 

A zzso CA was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso to an zzso zzso For the control CA, a zzso zzso essential for zzso was replaced by zzso In zzso zzso were exposed to both zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on human pulmonary zzso sections to determine the presence of zzso and zzso in different zzso zzso zzso In zzso feasibility of the CA in detecting early zzso formation specifically was investigated with zzso 

In zzso zzso exposed to the zzso CA showed zzso magnetic resonance signal zzso at the zzso zzso No zzso signal was observed when we used the zzso CA in the presence of zzso inhibitor zzso nor when we used the control zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso CA bound to zzso zzso demonstrated substantial zzso zzso in fresh compared with zzso and organized zzso The administration of CA in zzso within seconds after inducing zzso formation increased zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the site of zzso formation compared with the control CA zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and zzso CA administration 24 to 48 h after zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso CA was developed, zzso and zzso Our results showed that this zzso CA enabled zzso in zzso magnetic resonance zzso of early zzso zzso
