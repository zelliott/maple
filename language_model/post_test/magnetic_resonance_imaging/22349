The zzso of the zzso visual system has mainly been investigated by invasive and zzso techniques providing fragmented zzso This area of research has been deprived of functional zzso studies based on blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast, which allows a whole brain approach with a high spatial and zzso zzso In the present study, we looked at the zzso response properties of the visual system of the pigmented zzso focusing on the visual zzso zzso the superior zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso under zzso zzso Visual stimulation was performed zzso or zzso while flashing light from a zzso unit was zzso For each structure, we assessed the flashing frequency that evoked the optimal zzso response: Neither the VC nor the zzso displayed frequency dependence during zzso visual zzso but were most sensitive to low zzso zzso zzso when flashing light was provided zzso The SC responded zzso to high flashing rates zzso zzso during both zzso and zzso zzso The signal intensity changes in the VC and zzso were locked to the stimulation period, whereas the zzso response in the SC showed a similar onset but a very slow recovery at zzso The VC and zzso but not the zzso showed signs of zzso zzso The observed correlation between zzso responses of different visual areas during zzso visual presentation suggests a functional relationship between the VC and zzso rather than between the SC and zzso
