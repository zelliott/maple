The specificity in discriminating zzso is limited in the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso Furthermore, PET is not widely available compared to the single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso acids play a minor role in metabolism of inflammatory cells, the potential of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting pancreatic cancer was examined in zzso models of human pancreatic zzso in zzso 

zzso was injected to eight mice zzso with subcutaneous or zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were zzso The gene expression level of L zzso acid zzso 1 zzso was analyzed and correlated with tumor zzso of zzso 

A high zzso of zzso was detected in all zzso zzso The median zzso ratio zzso was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression in transplanted zzso cells was increased compared to zzso zzso 

Our mouse model could show a high zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso scans facilitate precise evaluation of zzso in the specific regions of zzso Further studies are required to confirm these findings in tumors derived from other human pancreatic cancer zzso Since zzso acids play a minor role in the metabolism of inflammatory cells, the potential for application of zzso to distinguish pancreatic tumor from inflammatory zzso warrants further zzso
