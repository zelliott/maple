zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated for its pharmaceutical properties and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics as a potential zzso contrast zzso 

zzso partition zzso plasma zzso zzso relaxation enhancement, zzso zzso zzso liver extraction ratio, and liver enhancement were measured in various zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was soluble and stable at moderate alkaline pH in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the compound was highly protein zzso zzso for water and plasma were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in rats and mice confirmed zzso properties and zzso zzso was zzso over 24 zzso First pass liver zzso was zzso zzso resonance imaging studies showed persistent liver enhancement at zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso compound that shows potential as a zzso magnetic resonance contrast zzso
