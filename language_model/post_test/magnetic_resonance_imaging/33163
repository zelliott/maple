Conventional MR images are zzso and their signal intensity is dependent on several complementary contrast mechanisms that are manipulated by the MR hardware and zzso In the absence of a quantitative metric for absolute interpretation of zzso signal zzso one that is independent of scanner hardware and zzso it is difficult to perform comparisons of MR images across subjects or zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso the contributions of individual MR contrast mechanisms zzso zzso zzso and provides zzso which are independent of the MR protocol and have a physical interpretation often expressed in absolute zzso In addition to providing an unbiased metric for comparing MR scans, quantitative zzso uses the relationship between MR maps and physiology to provide a zzso surrogate for biopsy and zzso This study provides an overview of some promising clinical applications of quantitative zzso followed by a description of the methods and challenges of acquiring accurate and precise quantitative MR zzso It concludes with three case studies of quantitative zzso applied to studying multiple zzso liver iron, and acute zzso zzso
