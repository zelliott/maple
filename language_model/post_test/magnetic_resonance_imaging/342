The existence of large pores in the zzso barrier zzso of zzso solid tumor zzso makes the zzso barrier more permeable to zzso than the zzso barrier of most normal tissue zzso The zzso of zzso solid tumors growing outside the brain, in peripheral zzso is more permeable than that of similar tumors growing inside the zzso This has been previously attributed to the larger zzso sizes of the pores within the zzso of peripheral zzso Since in the zzso state in zzso a zzso zzso layer coats the pores of the zzso it is possible that the effective zzso pore size in the zzso of brain tumors and peripheral tumors is zzso If this were the case, then the higher zzso of the zzso of peripheral tumor would be attributable to the presence of a greater number of pores in the zzso of peripheral zzso In this study, we zzso in zzso the upper limit of pore size in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso grown inside the brain, the zzso site, as well as outside the brain in zzso skeletal muscle, the zzso zzso 

Generation 5 zzso through generation 8 zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso acid, an zzso zzso contrast zzso The respective zzso generations were zzso in zzso by scanning transmission electron zzso Following intravenous infusion of the respective zzso generations zzso N zzso 6; zzso N zzso 6; zzso N zzso zzso zzso N zzso 5) the blood and tumor tissue zzso of the zzso generations were zzso in zzso over 600 to 700 minutes by dynamic zzso zzso One additional animal was zzso in each zzso generation group for 175 minutes under continuous zzso for the creation of zzso zzso concentration zzso 

The estimated diameters of zzso zzso were 11 zzso 1 zzso and those of zzso zzso were 13 zzso 1 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was more permeable than the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to all zzso generations except for zzso The zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not permeable to zzso zzso 

The zzso upper limit of pore size in the zzso of zzso solid tumor zzso is approximately 12 zzso In the zzso state in zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso brain tumor and peripheral tumors is the primary impediment to the effective zzso transport of particles across the zzso of zzso solid tumor zzso independent of tumor host zzso The higher zzso of zzso peripheral tumor zzso to zzso smaller than approximately 12 zzso in diameter is attributable to the presence of a greater number of pores underlying the zzso of the zzso of zzso peripheral tumor zzso
