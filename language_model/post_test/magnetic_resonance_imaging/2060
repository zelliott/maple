We aimed to investigate the importance of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnostic process of the upper motor zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients zzso 1) who were diagnosed with zzso lateral sclerosis in the neurology department of the zzso zzso Hospital and 20 controls zzso 2) entered the zzso zzso resonance imaging examinations were performed in the zzso clinic of the same zzso zzso and zzso density weighted zzso images were zzso These images were evaluated by two blind zzso The zzso looked for two zzso the presence of a low signal intensity at the zzso zzso and the presence of symmetrical rounded zzso of high signal intensity within the internal capsule on both zzso and zzso density weighted zzso 

For the first sign there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups but for the latter one there was a statistically significant zzso 

We think that the presence of the latter sign may make it possible for the zzso to help the clinicians further in this difficult and confusing zzso
