We hypothesized that magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans taken prior to zzso may be zzso of response to the procedure in persons with zzso Specifically, response would be zzso related to the severity of zzso zzso zzso was administered to 21 zzso with zzso zzso (target zzso A detailed self-report of zzso history, joint evaluation with scoring according to the World Federation of zzso zzso joint and pain zzso plain zzso and zzso studies of the zzso were performed zzso and zzso To augment comparison of the zzso findings to those assessed using the zzso and zzso zzso a provisional zzso scale for evaluation of zzso zzso was zzso We found the zzso findings prior to the procedure were not zzso of clinical zzso independent of the severity of zzso zzso most zzso bled less and showed improvement by the zzso zzso zzso There was generally no change in the severity of zzso zzso after the zzso We conclude that zzso evaluation is not routinely indicated prior to zzso
