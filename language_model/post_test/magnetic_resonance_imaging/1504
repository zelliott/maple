The zzso of blood zzso dependent zzso functional zzso zzso signals is closely related to cerebral blood flow zzso change; therefore, understanding the exact relationship between zzso and zzso changes on a zzso basis is zzso In this study, quantitative zzso changes induced by neural activity were used to zzso zzso signal changes during zzso stimulation in zzso zzso To examine the influence of fast-moving vascular spins in zzso zzso bipolar zzso were zzso Our data show no significant difference in relative zzso changes obtained with and without bipolar zzso To compare zzso and zzso signal changes induced by neural zzso a zzso zzso sequence with long zzso time of 40 zzso at zzso T was used in conjunction with an zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso correlated to zzso changes on a zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso at high magnetic fields allows a quantitative comparison of functional brain activities across brain regions and zzso
