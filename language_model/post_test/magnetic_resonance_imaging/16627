To explore visual scenes in the everyday world, we constantly move our eyes, yet most neural studies of scene processing are conducted with the eyes held zzso Such prior work in humans suggests that the zzso place area zzso represents scenes in a highly specific manner that can differentiate between different but overlapping views of a panoramic zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso adaptation to measure sensitivity to change, we asked how this specificity is affected when active eye movements across a stable scene generate zzso different zzso The zzso adapted to successive views when subjects made a series of zzso across a stationary zzso scene but not when the eyes remained fixed and a scene translated in the background, suggesting that active vision may provide important cues for the zzso to integrate different views over time as the zzso zzso was also robust when zzso information was preserved across views when the scene moved in tandem with the zzso These data suggest that zzso physical similarity is zzso but the visual system may also zzso zzso cues and/or global zzso information to generate more ecologically relevant representations of scenes across different zzso
