zzso adversity zzso increases stress sensitivity and risk of adverse health zzso However, neural mechanisms underlying these associations in humans remain zzso To understand neural responses underlying the link between CA and adverse health symptoms, the current study assessed brain activity during stress and zzso states in 75 demographically zzso healthy individuals with high, zzso and low CA zzso in each group), and their health symptoms using the Cornell Medical zzso CA was significantly associated with greater adverse health symptoms zzso in all zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging results indicated significant associations between CA scores and increased zzso activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, zzso zzso right amygdala, zzso and zzso regions in all 75 participants zzso zzso zzso In addition to these regions, the high vs low CA group comparison revealed decreased zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high CA group zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso and zzso right zzso responses to stress were each significantly associated with greater adverse health symptoms zzso Furthermore, an inverse correlation was found between activity in the zzso zzso and right zzso zzso These results indicate that high CA zzso zzso responses to acute stress and also identifies an important role for stress-related zzso zzso and zzso responses in the effects of CA on increasing vulnerability to adverse health zzso
