A recently published zzso zzso method for zzso liver fat content using zzso zzso zzso echo imaging was validated by phantom experiments and compared with results of biopsy in two patients zzso zzso We applied this method in ten healthy volunteers and compared the outcomes with the results of MR zzso zzso the gold standard in zzso liver fat zzso Novel was the use of zzso imaging yielding the variations in fat content across the liver rather than a single value obtained by single zzso zzso Compared with the results of zzso liver fat content according to zzso was too high in nine subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso and correct in one zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in one of the ten subjects the zzso fat content according to the zzso zzso method was incorrect due to a zzso versus zzso percent zzso content zzso The second problem was fixed by a minor adjustment of the zzso zzso Despite systematic zzso of liver fat contents by zzso zzso correlation between the adjusted zzso liver fat contents with MRS was high zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Even after correction of the algorithm, the problem remaining with the zzso zzso method for the assessment of liver fat zzso that, at the lower end range, liver fat content is systematically overestimated by zzso
