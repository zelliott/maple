The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the prediction of whether a given cortical area would be deemed essential for language processing by zzso stimulation mapping zzso 

The authors studied patients with vascular zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso and cavernous zzso in whom zzso patterns are not normal and in whom a zzso mapping signal may be zzso Ten patients were studied zzso harboring zzso and three with cavernous zzso The authors used a battery of linguistic tasks, including visual object naming, word generation, auditory responsive naming, visual responsive naming, and sentence zzso to identify brain regions that were consistently activated across expression and comprehension linguistic zzso In a comparison of zzso and zzso imaging zzso the authors varied the matching criteria zzso zzso adjacent zzso and deep zzso and the zzso of influence of zzso zzso 5, and 10 zzso to determine the effects of these factors on the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso imaging were dependent on the task, zzso and matching zzso For the population zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso imaging zzso during expressive linguistic tasks were found to be up to 100 and zzso respectively, in the frontal zzso and during comprehension linguistic tasks up to zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of each disease population zzso with zzso and those with cavernous zzso and of individuals were consistent with those values reported for the entire population zzso 

The authors conclude that zzso zzso imaging is a highly sensitive zzso planning tool for the identification of which cortical areas are essential for language and that this imaging zzso may play a future role in zzso planning for patients with vascular zzso
