The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso through the central compartment of the hip in patients with internal snapping zzso 

zzso patients with a snapping hip, aged 18 to 54 years zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso through the central compartment of the zzso all patients had symptomatic zzso zzso as zzso The degree of zzso was evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso perimeter with a magnetic resonance imaging protocol in patients with more than 6 months' zzso In addition, function was assessed preoperatively and zzso with the Western Ontario and zzso Universities zzso Index zzso zzso active zzso force was graded clinically between 1 and 5 with the Medical Research Council zzso 

Eight patients had less than 6 months' zzso and they were zzso The remaining 19 patients were evaluated after a mean follow-up period of zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in all zzso Compared with zzso zzso the zzso zzso circumference had recovered by zzso on average zzso zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso improved in all patients, and the mean Western Ontario and zzso Universities zzso Index score fell from 49 zzso zzso points to zzso zzso zzso points zzso zzso zzso Muscle force recovered completely in all zzso 

There is a process of zzso repair after zzso zzso and the findings on magnetic resonance imaging suggest that zzso tissue regrowth zzso
