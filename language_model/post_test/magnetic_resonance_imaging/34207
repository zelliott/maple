The purpose of this study was to evaluate a zzso zzso reserve index zzso derived from a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique in normal human volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease and to relate zzso to coronary artery zzso severity measured with quantitative zzso 

zzso resonance imaging could be a useful zzso tool in the investigation of zzso heart zzso However, there have been few studies in humans to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reserve using zzso and none in patients with coronary zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso proven coronary artery disease and five normal volunteers underwent both resting and stress zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso examinations zzso zzso zzso 1 of zzso zzso Using a zzso kinetic model, the zzso transfer constant zzso a zzso marker for the zzso zzso of contrast, was zzso in each coronary zzso zzso The ratio of zzso for the rest and stress scans was used to calculate the zzso zzso reduction in zzso diameter of coronary zzso was measured using an automated zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reserve index was significantly reduced in patients compared with normal subjects zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso For regions supplied by individual vessels, there was a significant negative correlation of zzso with percent diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso regions supplied by vessels with zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso had a significantly higher zzso than regions supplied by zzso of zzso severity, that is, zzso to 59% diameter zzso zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso However, even regions supplied by vessels with zzso diameter zzso had a significantly lower zzso than volunteers zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso reserve index derived from zzso zzso studies can distinguish between normal subjects and patients with coronary artery zzso Furthermore, it provides useful functional information on coronary zzso particularly where the zzso significance cannot be predicted accurately from the zzso
