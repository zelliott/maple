Much work has investigated the neural representation of specific categories of knowledge, but relatively scant attention has been paid in the cognitive zzso literature to the semantic processes that contribute to semantic zzso In this study, we monitored regional cortical activity with zzso while healthy young adults evaluated visually displayed NATURAL zzso zzso and zzso nouns with two standard tasks: zzso judgments and zzso zzso We observed a significant interaction effect between the category of knowledge and the type of judgment used to evaluate members of these semantic zzso zzso judgments recruited greater zzso zzso relative to zzso judgments of the same category, and this was seen for comparisons of all three semantic zzso However, when contrasted with zzso judgments, zzso judgments activated a different zzso distribution for each semantic zzso These findings are consistent with a dynamic approach to semantic memory that includes at least two zzso semantic knowledge and semantic processes that interpret this knowledge in several ways depending on the particular semantic zzso
