Several animal studies suggest that the zzso might be involved in the maintenance and propagation of zzso zzso However, zzso evidence for this implication in human partial zzso zzso is still zzso Considering the rich and zzso connectivity of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso we evaluated a potential participation of this zzso nucleus in zzso lobe zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso was recorded during zzso exploration of spontaneous zzso lobe zzso in 14 patients referred for zzso assessment of zzso zzso 

We recorded zzso zzso activity in zzso of the 74 zzso that we zzso This activity was characterized by rhythmic zzso or rhythmic spikes zzso or both or by zzso fast activity zzso in zzso and zzso of seizures, zzso zzso occurred mostly in zzso arising from zzso structures, whereas zzso was more frequently observed in zzso of zzso zzso In the 15 zzso without zzso zzso activity, spreading of the seizure outside the onset zone never occurred, whereas it did in zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso Discharge propagation was systematic when zzso involvement corresponded to zzso whatever the seizure onset zone was, whereas it represented only zzso of the zzso when zzso exhibited zzso 

This study shows that zzso changes in zzso activity are frequently observed during zzso lobe zzso and suggests that this zzso nucleus might participate in their zzso
