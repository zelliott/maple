zzso zzso is an effective zzso tool for identifying and zzso the zzso in patients with focal zzso In this study, we evaluated different zzso strategies in zzso for the assessment of zzso responses to zzso in the zzso of drug-resistant zzso 

Sixteen patients with focal zzso were examined by using simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fluctuation of zzso signals on the zzso was extracted by independent component analysis to predict the zzso responses to the zzso We applied 3 different threshold criteria to detect zzso responses within the zzso 1) zzso 2) a fixed threshold at P zzso zzso corrected for multiple comparison zzso and 3) zzso zzso zzso 200 activated zzso within the zzso 

PA identified the zzso in 9 of 16 zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso signal zzso in 11 of 16, and zzso in 13 of 16 zzso zzso responses were detected within the zzso areas in 5 zzso 6 zzso and 8 zzso of 10 patients who remained zzso after zzso 

zzso is a zzso tool for the zzso zzso of patients with zzso which can be performed during zzso periods and is complementary to the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of zzso in zzso the zzso may be further improved by the additional use of alternative analysis strategies such as zzso
