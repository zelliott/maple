zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso reduces production of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso to focal cerebral zzso Our objective was to investigate whether the zzso action of zzso extends to averting the immune zzso zzso gene changes were analyzed by zzso analysis from rat brains subjected to 90 zzso of middle cerebral artery zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for 48 zzso The zzso expression profile was compared between groups using ingenuity zzso analysis at the zzso and network zzso zzso selectively zzso 23 genes and zzso 75 genes more than twofold compared with both zzso and zzso It significantly suppressed zzso zzso oxide zzso signaling and increased the expression of zzso zzso 2A and zzso zzso 1 zzso which are involved in increasing the production of the zzso zzso The most significantly affected gene network comprised genes implicated in the inflammatory response with an expression change indicating an overall zzso Both zzso and zzso pathways were also significantly associated and zzso In conclusion, the zzso effects of zzso are zzso not only by suppressing zzso zzso stress but also by limiting zzso migration and zzso
