Working zzso brain zzso has been widely zzso and impaired zzso patterns have been reported for several psychiatric zzso We investigated whether variation in zzso working memory brain zzso is genetically influenced in 60 pairs of zzso (29 zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso brain response zzso percent signal difference of 2 minus zzso was measured in three regions of zzso Although statistical power was low due to the small sample size, for middle frontal zzso angular zzso and zzso zzso the zzso correlations were, in general, approximately twice those of the zzso pairs, with zzso zzso estimates zzso in the zzso zzso Task performance was strongly influenced by genes zzso and highly correlated with cognitive ability zzso This study, which will be expanded over the next 3 years, provides the first support that individual variation in working zzso brain zzso is to some extent influenced by zzso
