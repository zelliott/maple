There is paucity of studies regarding the utility of various conventional zzso sequences in the diagnosis of viral zzso The present study evaluates the usefulness of various zzso sequences in acute viral zzso 88 consecutive viral encephalitis patients, aged zzso years were subjected to clinical zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso fluid zzso was analyzed for zzso Japanese encephalitis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and polio viruses using zzso or zzso zzso zzso was done and zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were zzso The zzso changes were correlated with type of encephalitis and duration of zzso All the patients had altered zzso and 37 had zzso 22 patients had zzso 9 had zzso 8 had zzso zzso encephalitis zzso 2 had zzso virus encephalitis zzso and 47 had zzso zzso The median duration of zzso study from onset was 10 zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were more common compared to dengue zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso abnormalities were more common in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso value in zzso patients was lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso were seen in zzso cases on zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were more sensitive in revealing abnormalities in viral zzso
