The zzso is connected to the cerebral zzso through multiple anatomical zzso that process zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies in the monkey reveal that these zzso connections form stereotyped patterns in the zzso Here the organization of the zzso was explored in the human with zzso functional connectivity zzso zzso Data from 1,000 subjects were registered with zzso deformation of the zzso in combination with zzso alignment of the cerebral zzso zzso maps derived from seed regions placed in the foot and tongue representations of the motor zzso yielded the expected zzso zzso in the zzso zzso maps derived from the supplementary motor area were located zzso to the primary motor zzso also consistent with anatomical zzso The topography of the complete zzso was estimated and zzso by assigning each zzso in the zzso to its most strongly correlated cortical network in two independent groups of 500 zzso The results revealed at least five cortical zones in the zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso and two association networks with a topography globally consistent with monkey anatomical zzso The majority of the human zzso was coupled to cortical association zzso zzso these association networks further revealed details that zzso the five major zzso The resulting estimates of zzso organization provide a reference for exploring how the zzso contributes to processing zzso zzso and zzso information through multiple large-scale zzso zzso
