The diminishing threshold for the application of zzso leads to an increasingly frequent diagnosis of previously zzso zzso zzso zzso In such a context, it is warranted to define the criteria that make a zzso potentially hazardous so that zzso and patients reach a decision concerning how to manage the zzso In addition to the proposed grading system for zzso which zzso the risk of an actual treatment zzso several studies have been concerned with the evaluation of zzso zzso The goal of the present study is to demonstrate the significance of feeding vessel zzso zzso especially those found in zzso zzso 

To determine the zzso of associated zzso the authors reviewed an zzso cohort of 242 consecutive patients with zzso managed between 1989 and zzso Within this group were 240 patients who were treated by surgery, zzso techniques, or a combination of zzso Of these patients, 216 zzso a zzso and 24 an zzso zzso Two additional patients with zzso zzso underwent treatment of zzso zzso without treatment of the zzso In six of the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found on major feeding zzso only one of which had caused zzso In only one patient were there additional zzso feeding vessel zzso zzso near the zzso one of which had caused a major zzso In contrast, four of 24 patients with zzso zzso had zzso feeding artery zzso zzso Three of these zzso had caused zzso 

zzso zzso on feeding vessels are frequently associated with zzso (four of five cases in this zzso In our cohort of 242 treated patients zzso treated for zzso and two for an zzso feeding vessel zzso zzso appear to occur more frequently in conjunction with zzso zzso which justifies aggressive management to prevent zzso of morbidity associated with zzso of the zzso
