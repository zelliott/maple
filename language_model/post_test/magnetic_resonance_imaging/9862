The zzso of traumatic zzso artery dissection varies in published trauma zzso 

To determine the frequency of traumatic zzso artery injury in zzso patients by using standardized zzso trauma zzso zzso with adapted zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive patients requiring zzso trauma zzso zzso zzso zzso because of the mechanism of their injury patterns and an zzso zzso zzso score greater than 16 were analyzed zzso After a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso vessels with 40 zzso of zzso contrast agent was performed using zzso zzso 

The overall zzso of blunt carotid and zzso injuries zzso in the screened population was zzso zzso were observed in zzso of patients with detected isolated cervical spine injuries and in zzso of patients with isolated zzso fractures with or without zzso zzso whereas zzso of patients with combined cervical and zzso zzso were associated with zzso In addition, zzso of zzso occurred in patients without evidence of head or neck zzso 

zzso trauma zzso zzso with an adapted scanning protocol for the zzso vessels is a fast, safe, and feasible method for detecting vascular zzso It allows prompt further treatment if zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a part of a broad screening protocol for zzso vessels in documented injuries of the head and neck and in trauma mechanisms influencing the zzso region as zzso
