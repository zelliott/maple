We sought to determine the relations between zzso zzso and white matter zzso zzso on zzso 

We studied 395 zzso stroke patients with zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso and cortical zzso was zzso zzso were analyzed in 6 zzso zzso and zzso statistical analyses were used to find the risk factors for different zzso zzso and to study the connections between zzso and brain zzso 

zzso zzso were associated with hypertension zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso alcohol consumption zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso were associated with carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and carotid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were independent positive zzso and history of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and migraine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were negative zzso for cortical zzso Patients with zzso zzso had more severe zzso than patients with zzso zzso in all zzso areas zzso Patients with zzso zzso showed severe zzso zzso zzso especially around zzso horns zzso The extent of zzso in patients with cortical zzso did not differ from that in those without cortical zzso 

Various zzso zzso have different risk zzso The association between zzso zzso and zzso supports the concept of zzso disease underlying these 2 zzso The connection between zzso zzso and zzso zzso again raises the question of the disputed zzso vascular border zzso
