zzso anorexia is usually considered as a zzso disorder with benign zzso However, unusually severe characteristics of infantile zzso seen in the south of the island, seem to us in favor of a new zzso zzso 

Among 38 known cases, we zzso studied the best documented observations of 24 children admitted over the last 25 years to our zzso 

The sex ratio was ten females and 14 zzso zzso of the 24 infants lived in formerly isolated localities of the island where other zzso diseases have been observed with an unusually high zzso The family zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso Severe zzso accompanied by zzso vomiting zzso appeared at the age of zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso feeding was necessary but did not always avoid death, which occurred in zzso of the cases at the age of 24 months zzso zzso All of the children which survived had neurological disorders zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso mental zzso zzso which occurred sometimes at an early zzso The investigations did not allow the identification of any known zzso 

The elevated level of zzso acid in the cerebral spinal fluid seemed to indicate a possible zzso disorder, eventually a zzso of an zzso gene of the zzso zzso complex because of the normal zzso ratio, but zzso activities were zzso The cerebral zzso showed features of zzso On the other hand, the elevated level of plasma zzso seemed to indicate a disorder of the zzso zzso for which an animal model zzso 

We propose to name this new syndrome by the zzso zzso which associates zzso zzso zzso which is zzso and Neurological zzso zzso study might allow the zzso and isolation of a gene and allow one to start understanding the biological mechanism which we suspect to be an zzso zzso eating zzso
