Studies have long reported that aging is associated with declines in several functions modulated by the prefrontal cortex, including executive functions like working memory, set shifting, and zzso zzso The zzso basis to this is poorly zzso but may include the zzso zzso We investigated the zzso effect of zzso using acute zzso depletion zzso during a cognitive switching task involving zzso set shifting modified for a functional zzso zzso Ten healthy women over 55 years were tested on two separate occasions in this zzso zzso zzso crossover study to compare behavioral and zzso brain functioning following zzso and following a zzso sham depletion zzso zzso did not significantly affect task zzso It did zzso brain functional zzso During sham depletion women significantly activated the expected zzso brain regions associated with the zzso task including prefrontal and anterior zzso zzso In contrast, following zzso participants activated zzso regions of brain more during switch than repeat zzso In addition to the main effects of depletion condition, a comparison of the zzso relative to the sham condition confirmed this zzso shift in zzso The zzso zzso zzso clusters significantly and zzso correlated with the reduced prefrontal zzso clusters suggesting a compensation mechanism for reduced prefrontal zzso during zzso Thus, zzso zzso an zzso shift of zzso during cognitive switching in older zzso zzso adaptation to zzso challenge during cognitive control may prove useful in determining cognitive vulnerability in older adults with a predisposition for zzso zzso zzso in vascular or late life zzso
