We studied 12 children who had minimally displaced lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso gaps at the fracture site were zzso zzso on the zzso view of plain zzso To determine the stability of the fractures, we used a magnetic resonance imaging zzso study of the zzso zzso and elbow zzso In the results, two types of fractures were classified by the extent of the fracture line in zzso Type I showed that the line zzso from the lateral zzso to the growth plate but not through zzso In type II, the line crossed the growth plate to enter the joint zzso We concluded that the zzso study distinguished the potentially unstable fracture zzso zzso from the minimally displaced fracture and recommend the use of a zzso pin fixation for the expected unstable zzso
