Our goal was assessment of the zzso staging of zzso zzso with MR with double surface zzso MR with zzso zzso and zzso ultrasound zzso as correlated with zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso zzso had zzso evaluation using zzso ultrasound (all 15 zzso MR with double surface zzso alone (6 zzso and MR with double surface zzso combined with zzso surface zzso (9 zzso The results of the zzso staging were correlated with the zzso zzso 

zzso correctly staged the depth of zzso wall invasion in 10 of 15 patients, zzso 4, and zzso zzso zzso correctly staged 10 of 15 zzso Without the zzso surface zzso three of six were correct, and with zzso surface zzso seven of zzso MR with the zzso surface zzso is able to show the zzso wall in more detail than the double surface zzso 

zzso surface zzso zzso provides increased detail of the zzso wall, leading to better zzso of its different zzso This may lead to better staging results than with other MR zzso The results with zzso zzso probably equal those of zzso for staging small tumors in the zzso zzso MR with the double surface zzso gives additional information about tumor spread in more advanced zzso
