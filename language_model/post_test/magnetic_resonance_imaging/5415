The purpose of the current study was to zzso whenever the patients complained of probable symptoms of zzso low back pain and had obvious disc pathological changes on magnetic resonance imaging zzso but showed negative in zzso whether we could absolutely exclude the diagnosis of zzso pain or zzso 

The patients we selected in our study had only one zzso disc pathology on zzso for the purpose of minimizing the interference and all patients complained of probable zzso pain zzso Some special zzso diseases were excluded by physical examination and CT or zzso zzso Finally, 45 isolated patients with negative zzso were enrolled in our study from January 2006 to June zzso zzso patients were randomly distributed in experimental group, who underwent provocative zzso plus zzso injection of zzso (5 zzso in each zzso while the other 22 patients in the control group received zzso injection of saline as a zzso Visual analog scale zzso and zzso zzso Index zzso were used to evaluate the changes of pain and function after zzso 

The mean age of the 16 male and 29 female patients was zzso years, whose main clinical manifestations included zzso back pain zzso pain in the region of zzso zzso pain in the anterior or zzso region of thigh zzso zzso pain zzso and lower zzso pain zzso and among them zzso pathological disc was found in three patient, zzso pathological disc in 28 patients and zzso pathological disc in 14 zzso zzso and CT scans of the 45 patients revealed that there were grade 5 in 38 discs and grade 4 in seven discs by means of zzso Dallas zzso After about zzso zzso the results showed that zzso scores and zzso scores were greatly improved during the first zzso follow-up in the experimental group compared with zzso and between groups zzso zzso zzso but no statistically significant difference after zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso The probable symptoms of zzso low back pain were significantly improved in the experimental group in the short zzso 

The study indicated that negative zzso in patients with probable symptoms of zzso low back pain cannot absolutely exclude the diagnosis of zzso zzso Patients of this kind may suffer from other diseases, but we cannot ignore the existence of zzso zzso
