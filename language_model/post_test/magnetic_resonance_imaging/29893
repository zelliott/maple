The aim of the study is to zzso the location and amount of spinal zzso fluid zzso and to differentiate and zzso the cardiac and the respiratory zzso 

An echo zzso imaging sequence was applied to 5 different levels of the spinal canal of 7 healthy zzso The amount of zzso flow and respiratory signal variation were determined by a time and frequency domain analysis, zzso 

zzso zzso was high in the anterior cervical and in the zzso zzso Respiratory influence rose by zzso at C1 and by zzso at zzso The zzso flow was elevated during late expiration and the zzso upward movement was pronounced by early zzso 

The zzso in the lower spine seems to be related to a second motor of zzso movement because there is a rising respiratory influence and a reappearance of zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso contains a relevant respiratory zzso
