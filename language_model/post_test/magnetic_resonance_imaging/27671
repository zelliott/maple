zzso zzso zzso are frequent findings in zzso scans of elderly zzso Depending on the zzso protocols applied zzso to zzso of community-based subjects show incidental zzso The rates reported for various types of zzso strokes and zzso zzso vary between zzso and zzso Most studies also demonstrated zzso in approximately one third of zzso zzso A zzso distribution of zzso is considered to relate to cerebral zzso zzso while zzso located in the zzso zzso or in zzso brain regions are thought to relate to zzso zzso Besides age, hypertension, diabetes zzso and low serum cholesterol have so far been identified as risk factors for zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso is the only genetic factor that was consistently shown to increase the risk for zzso zzso There are only few zzso studies on the zzso value of zzso For incident zzso strokes and zzso zzso hazard ratios of zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso also doubled the risk for conversion to zzso in zzso patients, and there are indications for zzso being possible zzso of increased zzso Given the small number of zzso investigations with often small sample sizes the role of zzso as zzso of disease needs to be further zzso zzso were significantly more common in zzso stroke patients who developed zzso zzso zzso These data are zzso They do not provide enough evidence to consider zzso as a zzso for zzso agents in primary and secondary stroke zzso zzso are likely to zzso affect cognitive zzso It remains to be determined if direct zzso effects are responsible for this finding or if zzso are sole markers of more extensive tissue damage in the wake of cerebral small vessel disease leading to widespread visible but also zzso tissue destruction with a high likelihood for cognitive zzso
