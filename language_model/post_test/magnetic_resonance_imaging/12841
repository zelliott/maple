zzso resonance imaging zzso may emerge as an ideal zzso imaging zzso to monitor stem cell therapy in the failing zzso This imaging zzso generates any arbitrary zzso view at high spatial and zzso resolution with exquisite intrinsic tissue zzso This capability enables robust evaluation of both the cardiac anatomy and zzso Traditionally, zzso iron oxide zzso zzso has been widely used for cellular zzso due to zzso ability to enhance sensitivity of zzso by inducing remarkable zzso negative zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso has been reported by our laboratory for its ability as a contrast agent to track biological activity of viable zzso zzso positive signals can be achieved from the zzso stem cells on zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential drawback of zzso labeling of the zzso However, in our laboratory the labeling method has been zzso to minimize zzso zzso This article describes two different magnetic labeling methods of human embryonic stem cells zzso using zzso and zzso
