Although the zzso barrier zzso is beneficial zzso it acts as an obstacle to zzso We wished to determine whether a zzso emulsion could alter the zzso of the zzso in zzso 

An emulsion of zzso zzso in 20 zzso of saline was infused into the abdominal zzso just zzso to the branching of the zzso arteries of each of 15 cats zzso zzso As controls, 12 cats were each similarly infused with 20 zzso of normal saline zzso zzso Pre and zzso MR images were obtained 30 minutes and 2 hours after zzso The images were analyzed for the presence and degree of contrast enhancement zzso zzso and the contrast enhancement ratios zzso derived from one zzso of each animal were compared and statistically analyzed by the mixed linear model zzso zzso 

zzso enhancement of the zzso was observed in both groups at both time points, but it was more prominent in the zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso group zzso at 30 minutes, zzso at 2 zzso were significantly higher than in the control group zzso at 30 minutes, zzso at 2 hours; P zzso zzso In each group, the zzso at 2 hours were significantly lower than those at 30 minutes zzso zzso zzso 

zzso infusion of zzso emulsion increased the zzso of the zzso This result may be useful in future studies of zzso disruptions caused by fat zzso
