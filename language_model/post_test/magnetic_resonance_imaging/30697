We hypothesized that in patients with negative zzso inversion recovery zzso images zzso weighted fast zzso zzso images and zzso weighted zzso zzso images before and after intravenous administration of zzso contrast medium display no pathology zzso Thus, we assessed the negative zzso value of zzso images to rule out zzso brain zzso zzso consecutive zzso MR examinations were zzso zzso zzso of the brain included zzso weighted zzso imaging before and after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso weighted zzso and zzso zzso The zzso images were rated by two zzso into categories of 0 (without zzso zzso and 1 (with zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso the complete zzso In zzso MR examinations of the brain no abnormalities were found zzso zzso were zzso in four cases and zzso in 30 zzso zzso and specificity of the zzso sequence for zzso brain zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso application of zzso avoided one zzso zzso and improved the sensitivity of the zzso from zzso to zzso Positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reliability was zzso for the zzso and zzso for the readers who rated the complete zzso In conclusion, negative zzso images provide a high negative zzso value for zzso brain zzso Thus, in patients with negative zzso images the zzso application of zzso seems to be zzso
