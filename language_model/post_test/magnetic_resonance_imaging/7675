Studies systematically evaluating the detection of zzso spinal zzso zzso with PET are zzso Our purpose was to evaluate the visibility of zzso spinal zzso zzso on PET in a single institutional series and to correlate PET and MR imaging zzso 

Patients were included if zzso MR imaging identifying an zzso spinal zzso zzso and an zzso zzso examination near the time of MR imaging were zzso PET examinations were zzso zzso with zzso blinded and then zzso to the PET report and MR imaging zzso PET zzso spinal zzso zzso features were compared with and correlated with previously analyzed MR imaging zzso zzso Original clinical PET reports were zzso 

The final study sample was 10 PET examinations in 10 patients with 13 zzso spinal zzso zzso In 7 zzso patients, retrospective blinded review demonstrated convincing evidence of 10 zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso Three MR imaging features correlated with zzso spinal zzso zzso being visible on PET compared with those zzso zzso larger zzso enhancement size: mean size: zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larger zzso extent of zzso signal zzso mean zzso versus zzso segments zzso zzso zzso and larger ratio of extent of zzso signal zzso to contrast zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso was confidently reported clinically in 2 zzso patients, accounting for 5 zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso 

Most zzso spinal zzso zzso can be detected on PET when performed near the time of zzso MR zzso However, zzso spinal zzso zzso may not be clinically reported on zzso zzso zzso with more zzso are more likely to be zzso The spinal zzso should be specifically and carefully assessed on PET for evidence of zzso spinal zzso zzso to provide timely zzso
