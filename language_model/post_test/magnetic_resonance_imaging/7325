Suicide gene therapy zzso by zzso stem cells with their ability to zzso into tumors makes these therapeutic stem cells an attractive tool to activate zzso directly within the tumor zzso In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of human zzso stem cells derived from bone zzso and from zzso zzso engineered to express the suicide gene zzso zzso zzso to treat zzso rat zzso zzso in a simulated clinical therapeutic zzso zzso grown zzso was treated by zzso and subsequently with single or repeated zzso zzso of therapeutic stem cells followed by a continuous zzso delivery of zzso using an zzso zzso zzso survival zzso revealed that surgical zzso of the tumor increased the survival time of the zzso animals depending on the extent of surgical zzso However, direct injections of therapeutic stem cells into the brain tissue surrounding the zzso zzso cavity led to a zzso outcome in a significant number of treated zzso Moreover, the continuous supply of therapeutic stem cells into the brain with growing zzso by zzso pumps together with continuous zzso delivery also proved to be zzso zzso We assume that observed zzso therapy of zzso by stem zzso zzso gene therapy might be caused by the destruction of both tumor cells and the niche where zzso initiating cells zzso
