The role of degenerative changes in rotator cuff zzso with respect to the functional outcomes of rotator cuff repair have only recently been recognized and are still not well zzso In addition, the zzso of these changes with repair of the zzso is zzso 

Poorer zzso muscle quality zzso affects outcome, and a successful outcome (in terms of a healed zzso might demonstrate improvements in fatty zzso and muscle zzso 

zzso study; Level of evidence, zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 62 zzso were zzso evaluated with zzso and zzso zzso clinical examination and appropriate magnetic resonance image sequencing to determine grades of muscle zzso and fatty zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso American zzso and zzso Society zzso zzso and pain scores were determined as well as strength zzso The zzso rate and progression of muscle zzso were also zzso Independent zzso of outcome zzso and cuff integrity were zzso 

The overall clinical outcome, including zzso zzso and pain scores, improved significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso in forward zzso improved significantly zzso zzso zzso while external rotation strength did zzso There was a strongly negative correlation between muscle quality and outcome results in most zzso When the results were adjusted for zzso effect, muscle zzso and fatty zzso of the zzso muscle were the only independent zzso of zzso and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso zzso size and rotator cuff healing did not play an independent zzso zzso size, however, was the only independent predictor of ultimate cuff integrity zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and fatty zzso progressed significantly over the course of the zzso In cases in which the zzso had zzso the progression was found to be more significant than when the repair proved successful zzso zzso zzso 

Muscle zzso and fatty zzso of the rotator cuff muscles, particularly of the zzso play a significant role in determining functional outcome after cuff zzso zzso size appears to have the most influential effect on repair zzso A successful repair did not lead to improvement or reversal of muscle zzso and a failed repair resulted in significantly more zzso In general, healed repairs demonstrated minimal zzso These findings suggest that repairs should be performed, if possible, before more significant deterioration in the cuff zzso in order to zzso zzso and that understanding the degree of muscle zzso and fatty zzso before surgery can help guide patient zzso
