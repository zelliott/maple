This study assessed whether high-resolution 7 T zzso allowed direct in zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing the greatest and earliest zzso cell loss in Parkinson disease zzso and whether any zzso changes could be detected in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 2 from healthy controls zzso and 1 from a patient with zzso were scanned with high-resolution zzso zzso scans, zzso and stained for iron and zzso zzso zzso and zzso To confirm the identification of zzso in zzso on 7 T zzso scans, we assessed zzso with zzso zzso zzso We then assessed the ability to depict zzso pathology on in zzso zzso scans by comparing data from 10 patients with zzso and 8 zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso area within the zzso border of the otherwise zzso zzso was identified in the HC brains on in zzso and PM zzso zzso zzso size, shape, and zzso characteristics conform to zzso zzso zzso assessment by 2 zzso showed consistent bilateral absence of this zzso feature in all 10 patients with zzso and bilateral presence in zzso zzso 

In zzso and PM zzso with zzso correlation demonstrates that high-resolution 7 T zzso can directly zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso 1 in the zzso on zzso scans might prove useful in developing a zzso diagnostic test for zzso
