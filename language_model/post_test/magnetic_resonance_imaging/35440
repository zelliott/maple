The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso binds to zzso zzso which accumulates zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso Although zzso zzso is greater in patients with zzso than in healthy controls at a group level, the optimal method for discriminating between these 2 groups has, to our knowledge, not been zzso We assessed the use of zzso standardized zzso of interest zzso to improve the zzso capability of zzso scans on patients with zzso 

A total of 16 controls and 14 zzso zzso patients were zzso All subjects underwent a zzso scan and structural zzso zzso potential (a measure of zzso zzso was calculated for each zzso using the Logan zzso method with zzso gray matter as the reference zzso zzso maps were then zzso corrected and zzso zzso by zzso onto a standardized zzso The subjects were divided into 2 zzso The first cohort zzso 12; zzso 9) was used for statistical zzso mapping analysis and zzso of zzso zzso These zzso were tested in the second cohort zzso 4; zzso 5) of zzso 

zzso zzso mapping analysis revealed significant differences between control and zzso zzso The zzso map determined from the first cohort resulted in complete separation between the control and the zzso subjects in the second cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso potential values based on this zzso were in the same range as other reported individual and mean cortical zzso zzso 

A standardized zzso template that is zzso for control or zzso group discrimination provides excellent separation of control and zzso subjects on the basis of zzso zzso This zzso template can serve as a potential replacement for manual zzso zzso and can eventually be fully zzso zzso potential use in a clinical zzso To facilitate independent analysis and validation with more and a broader variety of subjects, this zzso template and the software for processing will be made available through the zzso
