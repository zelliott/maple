Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso imaging and zzso of the parameters zzso and zzso have been carried out in zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had been treated 24 h previously by zzso therapy zzso using zzso zzso and 630 zzso laser zzso zzso images clearly demarcated a high zzso region on the side of the zzso closest to the incident light zzso while the parts of the zzso more remote from the beam resembled the images from zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso values were raised in the high-intensity zzso This high-intensity region was shown to zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso region to zzso intact zzso Linear zzso analysis of the relationship of depth of necrosis measured zzso and zzso of zzso measured from the zzso images, yielded a slope of zzso zzso zzso zzso
