Numerous reports have described a variety of clinical syndromes resulting from zzso cerebral artery zzso zzso whereas only a few zzso and retrospective clinical studies have investigated the underlying zzso Therefore we attempted to determine the causes of zzso in the superficial zzso cerebral artery zzso territory by means of a more comprehensive, modern vascular and cardiac zzso During a zzso period 74 consecutive patients zzso men, 25 zzso with acute zzso zzso documented on CT zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso Patients had a neurological examination, vascular studies zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 31) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac evaluation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A cardiac source of embolism was established in zzso significant zzso artery disease in zzso and zzso zzso or zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso causes, such as zzso or paradoxical embolism via a patent zzso zzso were present in zzso However, in spite of the comprehensive diagnostic zzso the cause of the stroke remained zzso in zzso of the zzso Apart from complete zzso of the zzso branches of the zzso which occurred more frequently in zzso strokes zzso P zzso zzso the topographical patterns of zzso extension and the coincidence of zzso in the deep territories of the zzso the zzso and zzso were not significantly different among the zzso zzso The frequency of zzso transformation zzso was highest among zzso strokes zzso P zzso zzso This prospective study of zzso zzso demonstrated embolism from cardiac and vascular sources as the zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence of migraine as a cause of zzso zzso whereas paradoxical embolism was the presumed cause in a considerable number of zzso Whereas the cause of stroke could not reliably be derived from zzso topography, zzso transformation indicated there had been zzso in most zzso
