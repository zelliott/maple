zzso zzso often generates large amounts of data on regions of zzso Such data can be addressed effectively with a zzso statistical technique based on measurement theory that has not yet been applied to zzso zzso factor analysis is a convenient zzso modeling environment that can be used to conduct formal statistical tests comparing alternative hypotheses regarding the elements of putative zzso zzso In such models, measures of each activated region of interest are treated as indicators of an underlying zzso construct that represents the zzso zzso of the elements in the zzso As such, zzso factor analysis focuses analyses on the zzso of hypothesized networks as a whole, improves statistical power by modeling measurement error, and provides a zzso approach to data reduction with a robust statistical zzso This approach is illustrated using data on seven regions of interest in a hypothesized zzso reward system in a sample of 262 adult volunteers assessed during a zzso reward zzso A zzso construct reflecting zzso zzso of the reward system was found to be significantly associated with a zzso construct measuring zzso particularly in zzso
