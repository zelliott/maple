To compare six MR sequences zzso and zzso fat suppressed zzso spin zzso zzso standard spin zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast spin zzso and zzso zzso fast spin zzso in their ability to zzso zzso and characterize zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on 47 examinations were zzso evaluated by three blinded zzso Several zzso variables were compared by the above six zzso imaging time, image quality, zzso sharpness of zzso space, zzso zzso zzso detected zzso volume, number of individual zzso or discrete zzso zzso of invasion into adjacent boundaries and structures, and overall diagnostic zzso 

zzso in the above outcome variables between sequences did not correlate with MR scanner software upgrade level, zzso type, or zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso sequences resulted in significantly higher scores for zzso zzso detected zzso volume, and overall diagnostic zzso zzso images resulted in the next highest scores, whereas zzso zzso and standard zzso zzso sequences performed poorly for most zzso zzso 

MR imaging of the zzso zzso should include zzso zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso images need not be obtained zzso
