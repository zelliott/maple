To explore the zzso of zzso small zzso in deep brain by zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso and its clinical zzso 

A total of 42 cases with small zzso in deep brain underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso The drifting of zzso was corrected by images acquired from zzso MR zzso 

All zzso were successfully identified and 40 cases totally removed without zzso Only 3 cases developed new neurological deficits zzso while 2 of them returned to normal neurological functions after a follow-up duration of 3 months to 2 zzso 

The application of zzso zzso can effectively correct the drifting of zzso and enhance the accuracy of zzso zzso for small zzso in deep zzso
