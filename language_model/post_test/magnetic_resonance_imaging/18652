The aims of this study were to evaluate normal spinal anatomy in zzso and infants as seen by zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the value of zzso US in the evaluation of zzso spinal zzso in zzso and to correlate the findings of zzso US with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso when zzso 

We used zzso US and zzso US to examine the zzso spine in infants with zzso zzso syndromes associated with spinal zzso and abnormal zzso We also zzso as controls, healthy infants who had no markers of spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scans, when available, were compared to assess differences in the display of the infant zzso 

In total, we examined 29 zzso 18 subjects and 11 control zzso The correlation between zzso US and zzso US was zzso in the detection of zzso defects of the spinal cord, although zzso US allowed superior zzso of the zzso bodies and zzso spinal zzso When a gross zzso of the zzso spinal elements occurred with zzso zzso soft zzso interpretation was simpler with zzso than with zzso 

zzso US is a useful adjunct to zzso US when screening the infant spine for zzso zzso particularly in showing alignment of zzso spinal elements and integrity of zzso zzso This ability is important because zzso spinal defects may be associated with underlying spinal zzso zzso
