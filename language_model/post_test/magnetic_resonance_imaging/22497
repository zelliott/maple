To assess the tissue iron concentration of the left zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso MR technique and a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was performed in 53 zzso major zzso Three zzso views of the zzso were obtained and analyzed with zzso zzso The zzso was automatically segmented into 12 zzso The zzso value on each segment as well as the global zzso value were zzso zzso dynamic images were also obtained to evaluate zzso function parameters by quantitative zzso 

For the zzso global value, the zzso of variation zzso for zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three groups were identified based on analysis of zzso zzso homogeneous zzso zzso zzso and no zzso iron overload zzso The mean serum zzso liver iron zzso and urinary iron zzso were significantly different among the zzso We did not find significant differences among groups in zzso zzso There was a correlation between the global zzso value and the zzso value in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a zzso fast, zzso means of assessing zzso iron zzso The single measurement of zzso zzso correlated well with the global zzso zzso
