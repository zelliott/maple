This is the first in zzso demonstration of an association between zzso neurotransmitter release and conscious zzso Using zzso PET we demonstrated increased zzso zzso release in the zzso zzso during Yoga zzso zzso Yoga zzso is characterized by a depressed level of desire for action, associated with decreased blood flow in zzso zzso and zzso regions, structures thought to be organized in open zzso zzso executive zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the projections from the frontal zzso to zzso zzso which in turn project back to the frontal zzso via the zzso and zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether zzso zzso release increases during loss of executive control in zzso Participants underwent two zzso PET zzso one while attending to speech with eyes closed, and one during active zzso The zzso competes with zzso zzso for access to zzso zzso receptors predominantly found in the zzso zzso During zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso decreased by zzso This zzso to a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso The reduced zzso binding correlated significantly with a zzso increase in zzso zzso activity, a characteristic feature of zzso All participants reported a decreased desire for action during zzso along with heightened sensory zzso The level of gratification and the depth of relaxation did not differ between the attention and meditation zzso Here we show increased zzso zzso release during meditation associated with the experience of reduced readiness for zzso It is suggested that being in the conscious state of meditation causes a suppression of zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first time in zzso evidence has been provided for regulation of conscious states at a synaptic zzso
