A phantom set was devised to evaluate capability of independent component analysis zzso as an image filter for magnetic resonance zzso images to segregate zzso 

Four components zzso water zzso olive oil zzso zzso and zzso zzso gels zzso and zzso zzso were arranged in a phantom zzso Seven MR images were obtained with different echo time and repetition zzso zzso was performed on 23 combinations of four zzso A segregation rate higher than zzso was defined as zzso 

zzso segregation was obtained in 5 of 23 zzso The best result showed a mean of zzso across the four zzso For each zzso there were 20 of 23 for zzso 22 for zzso 9 for zzso and 16 for zzso 

The results demonstrated zzso works as an image filter and provides new contrast images that zzso segregate components in MR zzso For practical application, the best performance should be obtained when zzso zzso and zzso density images are included in the zzso for zzso
