zzso zzso zzso has been used for several years to study differences in brain structure between zzso Recently, a zzso version of zzso has been used to show changes in gray matter associated with relatively short periods of zzso In the present study we use zzso and three different standard zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to assess functional and structural changes associated with a simple learning zzso zzso and zzso data clearly showed a significant learning zzso However, initially positive zzso results were found to be inconsistent across minor zzso of the analysis technique and ultimately proved to be zzso When alignment biases were controlled for and recommended statistical procedures were used, no significant changes in zzso matter density were zzso This work, initially intended to show structural and functional changes with learning, rather demonstrates some of the potential pitfalls of existing zzso zzso methods and zzso that these tools be applied and interpreted with extreme zzso
