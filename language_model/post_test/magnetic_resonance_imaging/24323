To investigate cerebral cortical changes by using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso after zzso renewal and to test how these relate to zzso treatment zzso as measured by chewing efficiency and maximum bite zzso 

Ten complete zzso zzso (five women and five men, mean age zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in the zzso Each had their complete zzso renewed and underwent an zzso examination with three functional tasks zzso zzso jaw zzso jaw zzso as well as a zzso test for chewing efficiency and unilateral maximum bite force zzso zzso were performed with the old zzso zzso and with the new zzso on zzso zzso and at 1 week zzso and 3 months zzso zzso At zzso zzso stability and retention zzso were assessed by two independent zzso zzso signed rank tests and zzso zzso correlation were carried out for data zzso 

The right and the left zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified with significant zzso across all three functional zzso A statistically significant increase in the level of activity between zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was found during jaw zzso zzso Both regions of interest zzso zzso appeared to correlate with zzso of the new zzso while the subject performed a zzso task zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso The chewing efficiency and maximum bite force increased significantly during the adaptation to replacement zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso maximum bite force right side: zzso P zzso zzso 

Changes in brain activity occurred in the adaptation to replacement zzso and appeared to regain zzso activity levels during motor tasks involving the dental zzso after 3 months zzso
