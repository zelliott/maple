The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution in zzso expression during the first 5 years after a primary, successfully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using cardiac magnetic resonance zzso for zzso location, and to depict changes in zzso size and left zzso zzso over zzso 

In the absence of zzso zzso abnormal Q waves are usually diagnostic of zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso zzso after zzso could be related to smaller zzso zzso Late zzso enhancement accurately depicts zzso of any zzso 

zzso zzso patients underwent zzso and zzso at 1 week zzso 4 months, 1 year, and 5 years zzso Conventional zzso parameters were zzso and zzso presence, location, and size were assessed using late zzso enhancement zzso zzso locations were anterior or zzso zzso and/or zzso using late zzso enhancement zzso as a zzso For each time point, patients were classified as having a zzso zzso zzso using the European Society of zzso College of zzso zzso Heart zzso Heart Federation consensus criteria for previous zzso zzso 

At zzso 11 patients zzso did not meet the criteria for zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly smaller than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) were correctly zzso whereas in 7 of 19 zzso zzso zzso the location or extent of the zzso was zzso by zzso At zzso zzso in 10 patients (3 zzso zzso the zzso became zzso The zzso remained zzso at zzso zzso A zzso zzso size of zzso at 1 year yielded a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso to predict the presence or absence of Q zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso for previous zzso using the current European Society of zzso College of zzso zzso Heart zzso Heart Federation criteria is substantial and increases with time zzso from zzso immediately zzso to zzso at zzso zzso
