We describe a novel technique to perform zzso zzso fixation in mice with specific relevance to zzso With the guidance of zzso ultrasound imaging, we were able to zzso zzso and contrast agents via a zzso inserted into the left zzso and therefore preserved the integrity of the chest and abdominal zzso In this preliminary study, our success rate over 15 animals was zzso We demonstrate applications of this technique for magnetic resonance imaging and zzso but we expect that this method can be generally applied to zzso zzso of other small animals in which the intact body is zzso
