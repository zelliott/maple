zzso zzso studies have highlighted the pronounced loss of white matter in zzso and early zzso Disease zzso The current study zzso on the corpus zzso zzso since it provides zzso connections to vulnerable cortical zzso 

To investigate zzso and zzso group differences in zzso volume and zzso associations with three cognitive zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso from 106 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 47 zzso zzso years from predicted zzso 84 early HD zzso Stage 1 zzso and 31 Stage 2 zzso and 101 control subjects from the zzso study, using a zzso technique for zzso zzso zzso differences in volume and zzso zzso rates, and correlations with cognitive performance were investigated using zzso models, adjusting for potential zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso had statistically significantly smaller baseline zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso and all groups had elevated zzso zzso rates compared with controls zzso zzso zzso Smaller baseline zzso volume was associated with impaired performance in the Circle zzso zzso task in early HD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significant relationships with zzso Word Reading were shown in both zzso zzso There was no evidence of an association with the Trail Making B zzso 

We found reduced zzso volume and elevated zzso zzso rates, even in individuals far from disease zzso zzso zzso of zzso connections may contribute to cognitive deficits, such as performance in the Circle zzso zzso task in zzso zzso of different image acquisitions may provide more specific information about underlying zzso zzso
