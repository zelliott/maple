In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid imaging zzso correction zzso of the patient tissue and patient table is performed by converting the zzso zzso units zzso to linear zzso zzso zzso of zzso When applied to the new field of hardware component zzso in zzso resonance zzso hybrid imaging, this conversion method may result in local zzso of PET activity zzso The aim of this study thus was to zzso the conversion parameters for zzso zzso of hardware components in zzso zzso evaluation and zzso of the zzso to zzso conversion parameters has been performed for the hardware component zzso map zzso of a flexible zzso zzso zzso used in zzso zzso Furthermore, spatial zzso of this zzso zzso to its zzso was simulated by shifting the zzso in different directions and the effect on PET zzso was zzso zzso of a PET zzso standard zzso phantom were performed on an integrated hybrid zzso zzso Various CT parameters were used to calculate different zzso for the flexible zzso zzso and to evaluate the impact on the PET activity zzso A zzso transmission scan of the local zzso zzso was used as standard of reference to adapt the slope of the conversion from zzso to zzso at zzso The average zzso of the PET activity concentration due to the zzso corrected zzso zzso in place was calculated to be zzso in the overall zzso When considering zzso only in the upper volume of the zzso the average difference to the reference scan without zzso zzso is zzso When the zzso conversion is applied, an average zzso of zzso (without extended CT zzso and zzso (with extended CT zzso is observed in the top volume of the zzso zzso Using the adapted conversion resulting from this study, the zzso in the top volume of the phantom is reduced zzso and shows the lowest standard zzso inside the phantom in comparison to all other zzso zzso of a zzso zzso shows acceptable results for shifts below zzso for the flexible surface zzso zzso The adapted conversion from zzso to zzso at zzso within this study can improve hardware component zzso in zzso hybrid imaging as shown for a flexible zzso surface zzso Furthermore, these results have a direct impact on the improvement of the hardware component zzso of the examined flexible zzso zzso in conjunction with position zzso
