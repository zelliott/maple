The appropriate choice of resolution in zzso remains an open zzso To address this issue, we simulate the signal change between activated and resting states as a function of blood volume fraction zzso From these results, the relative zzso ratio zzso from the resting to the activated state can be calculated as a function of zzso We consider different vessel zzso and note that, in most cases, the most efficient scanning procedure is for low resolution zzso To overcome this zzso a zzso enhancing contrast agent is proposed to increase the signal from the blood and, zzso the zzso contribution to the zzso zzso We show that this effect dramatically increases both the signal changes and the efficiency of high-resolution imaging and should lead to much better zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
