Shared zzso characteristics of patients with schizophrenia and their siblings might represent intermediate zzso that could be used to investigate genetic zzso to the zzso We sought to discover previously unidentified gray matter volume differences in patients with schizophrenia and their siblings with zzso zzso zzso 

We studied 169 patients with zzso zzso of their unaffected siblings, and 212 healthy volunteers from the Clinical Brain Disorders zzso Institute of Mental Health zzso Study of zzso with magnetic resonance zzso 

Patients with schizophrenia had significant regional gray matter decreases in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with healthy zzso Their unaffected siblings tended to share gray matter decreases in the zzso zzso superior zzso and insular zzso but these decreases were not significant after correction for multiple zzso even when we looked at a zzso of siblings with a past history of mood zzso As an exploratory analysis, we estimated zzso with regions of interest from the zzso analysis as well as from the zzso zzso volume was significantly correlated within zzso 

Our findings confirm and extend previous zzso zzso analyses in ill subjects with zzso Furthermore, these data argue that although siblings might share some regional gray matter decreases with their affected siblings, the pattern of regional differences might be a weak intermediate zzso for zzso
