The effects of two zzso agents, zzso A4 zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso on the zzso of two human colon zzso implanted in zzso mice, were assessed for up to 3 h using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso of zzso inflow showed that treatment with zzso had little effect on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso also showed that the drug had no significant effect on zzso cell energy status, as assessed from the ratio of the zzso of the signals from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, after treatment with zzso zzso was reduced and the zzso ratio increased, indicating that the zzso zzso is susceptible to the action of this zzso The zzso zzso model was susceptible to both zzso and zzso using the criteria of changes in zzso inflow and zzso zzso
