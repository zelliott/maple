zzso spectrum analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso breast MR images was used to establish a new quantitative analysis method for solid tumor blood zzso and to explore its zzso in evaluating efficacy of breast cancer zzso Five randomly selected patients suffering from newly diagnosed zzso breast zzso zzso were enrolled in this study, and four of them were treated with zzso zzso Their zzso breast MR images were collected before and after zzso zzso efficacy was analyzed using international response evaluation criteria for solid tumors zzso zzso method for statistical number density was employed to measure and calculate zzso zzso of zzso breast MR images with zzso zzso zzso spectral data of zzso zzso before and after chemotherapy were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso show an zzso zzso zzso efficacy was assessed to be partial zzso zzso for three patients and their zzso spectral zzso significantly increased after chemotherapy while to be stable disease zzso for other patient and of her changed zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso with zzso condition of tumor zzso before and after chemotherapy, providing a potential suitable characteristic zzso for evaluating zzso efficacy zzso
