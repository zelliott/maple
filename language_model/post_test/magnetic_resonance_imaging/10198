This study examined the relationship between the integrity of cerebrovascular zzso zzso testing and zzso potential zzso of cognitive functioning in a nonclinical group of participants being at risk for vascular zzso zzso measures, magnetic resonance zzso scans and zzso were recorded in 30 participants treated for zzso hypertension, with no report of neurological or psychiatric zzso As a zzso measure of cerebral zzso the zzso cerebral transit time zzso was zzso While zzso measures of memory functions and general mental ability functions did not show systematic correlations with the zzso and other measures of vascular pathology, a pronounced correlation was obtained between zzso zzso and zzso Participants with long zzso showed a delayed zzso These findings suggest that the zzso is a sensitive measure for reduced cognitive functions even at early stages of cerebrovascular pathology and by this may be a valuable tool for the early identification of cognitive deficits in individuals being at risk for vascular zzso
