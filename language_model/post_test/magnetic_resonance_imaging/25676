The complex organization and high density of nerve cells in the human brain presents a challenge to the zzso of total cell zzso The first unbiased counting method, the zzso was described in 1984 and has since made it possible to accurately count total zzso numbers in any region that can be zzso while excluding artifacts of earlier counting zzso The zzso method has been applied to normal zzso and to four zzso brain regions from zzso and zzso The total zzso number in zzso in 26 normal individuals was estimated to be zzso A 40 and 50% reduction of total nerve cell number was found in the zzso zzso nucleus and nucleus zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso principle has been used to estimate the volume of human cortex, white matter, central zzso regions and the volume of the zzso system in both controls and zzso As shown by these studies, the introduction of unbiased zzso methods and subsequent modifications in recent years have made it possible to estimate a number of parameters in the human brain without the biases included in most classical zzso By comparison, earlier conventional counting methods have been relatively time zzso mostly biased to a smaller or larger degree, and generally less zzso The application of these new zzso methods will undoubtedly provide greater confidence for future brain zzso
