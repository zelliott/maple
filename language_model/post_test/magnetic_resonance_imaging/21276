zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role following acute zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso present in the zzso however, the role of zzso in zzso remains zzso The present study aimed to investigate whether plasma zzso of zzso are altered in patients following an zzso and whether they are correlated with zzso zzso zzso levels and other laboratory and clinical zzso Plasma zzso of zzso were assessed in 102 patients with zzso (less than 7 zzso and 120 control subjects using zzso zzso The correlation between zzso zzso and zzso levels, Trial of zzso zzso in Acute Stroke Treatment zzso zzso stroke severity and risk factors were zzso The expression of zzso was significantly decreased in patients with zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso were positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso thus zzso is an independent predictor of zzso concentration zzso zzso levels below zzso zzso had sensitivity and specificity values of zzso of zzso and zzso respectively and zzso below zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following adjustment for potential zzso In conclusion, for the first time, a reduction in zzso was detected in patients following zzso and these altered plasma zzso were correlated with zzso zzso studies are required to further investigate whether zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
