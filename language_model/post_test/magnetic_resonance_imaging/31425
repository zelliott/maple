To zzso compare the diagnostic accuracy of three cardiac magnetic resonance zzso imaging approaches for the detection of zzso and zzso criteria zzso zzso proved zzso inflammation in patients clinically suspected of having chronic zzso zzso 

zzso MR imaging was performed in 83 consecutive patients (55 male, 28 zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso clinically suspected of having zzso after written informed consent was obtained according to guidelines of the local ethics committee, which approved the zzso zzso zzso imaging to calculate the zzso ratio zzso zzso imaging before and after contrast agent administration to calculate the zzso global relative enhancement zzso and zzso zzso imaging to evaluate areas of late zzso enhancement zzso were zzso The MR results were correlated with the zzso biopsy zzso findings to detect zzso inflammation and zzso viral zzso analyzed at zzso chain reaction zzso For statistical zzso receiver operating characteristic analysis and the zzso test for zzso data were used because the zzso test revealed a distribution of data that was different from zzso 

zzso inflammation and zzso viral persistence were confirmed at zzso analysis in 48 and 49 of the 83 patients, zzso The sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy of the MR zzso as compared with the zzso detection of zzso were, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not associated with zzso chain reaction proof of viral zzso 

In patients clinically suspected of having zzso increased zzso and zzso indicating inflammation were common findings that could be confirmed at zzso analysis, whereas zzso had low sensitivity and zzso zzso MR imaging may be helpful in detecting zzso inflammation zzso but it fails to depict viral zzso
