This paper reports on an experimental study of in zzso tissue damage in the rabbit brain with focused ultrasound zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso zzso zzso were created in five rabbits using a focused ultrasound beam of zzso zzso electrical power input to the zzso of zzso W, and an exposure duration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fast zzso zzso and zzso attenuated inversion recovery zzso sequences were used to detect the zzso zzso after zzso Imaging was performed for zzso hours after treatment, after which the animals were immediately zzso zzso zzso diameter was measured on zzso and zzso sections after correction for tissue shrinkage during the zzso zzso The zzso images showed zzso poorly, whereas both zzso and zzso images showed zzso zzso The zzso diameters on both zzso and zzso imaging correlated well with zzso from zzso The time delay before zzso appeared on zzso imaging was 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the exposure location in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
