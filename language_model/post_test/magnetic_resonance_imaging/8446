Recent zzso and zzso magnetic stimulation studies indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso blind humans is functionally relevant for zzso zzso There are suggestions that the underlying cortical reorganization is restricted by a critical zzso These results were based on comparison between early and late blind groups, thereby facing the problem of great zzso among individuals within each zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied zzso zzso blind individuals during use of 2 zzso one acquired early zzso the other later in life zzso at approximately 10 zzso The subjects listened to zzso words consisting of superimposed Hebrew and English zzso They were instructed to either covertly generate a verb to the heard noun or repeat the zzso in either Hebrew or zzso zzso zzso during verb generation zzso zzso was found in classical language areas, in zzso with previous studies in sighted zzso zzso in our study, the blind participants typically also had robust left zzso zzso differential zzso during verb generation zzso zzso in both zzso This suggests that the critical period for plasticity persists beyond 10 years or that the visual zzso of the blind might be engaged in abstract levels of language processing, common to the 2 zzso
