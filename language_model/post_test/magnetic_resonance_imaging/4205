The authors evaluate bone zzso signal changes on magnetic resonance zzso imaging during high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation zzso 

Fourteen patients with breast cancer without bone zzso underwent four zzso MR imaging studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso and inversion recovery sequences with short inversion time zzso of the zzso zzso zzso during initial staging, zzso prior to high-dose chemotherapy after two cycles of induction chemotherapy, zzso early after zzso with a zzso exceeding zzso and zzso 6 to 8 weeks after zzso Signal intensity ratios of averaged zzso bone zzso to nucleus zzso were measured and zzso was evaluated visually using a zzso zzso 

Compared with the initial finding zzso Signal intensity ratios were altered significantly at zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31, P zzso zzso Signal intensity ratios were altered significantly at zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, P zzso zzso and Signal intensity ratios were altered significantly at zzso only zzso zzso zzso 19, P zzso zzso zzso scores decreased at zzso for zzso and STIR sequences zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and at zzso for the latter sequence zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso At zzso zzso images were less zzso than initially in 3 of 14 zzso zzso 

zzso resonance imaging demonstrates significant zzso of bone zzso composition during zzso but allows differentiation of benign zzso changes from those known in zzso disease after completion of zzso
