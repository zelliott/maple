Treatment schedule was zzso with zzso zzso chemotherapy plus zzso High zzso Rate zzso zzso Patients were treated in the zzso zzso zzso with the prospective application of the High zzso zzso concept zzso and dose volume constraints for zzso at risk including biological zzso zzso volume adaptation was performed with the aim of dose escalation in large zzso zzso zzso often with inserting additional zzso zzso zzso volume constraints zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso Late morbidity was zzso zzso using zzso zzso Disease outcome and treatment related late morbidity were evaluated and compared using zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso consecutive patients zzso age zzso with zzso cancer zzso stages zzso were treated with definitive zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso cell cancer in zzso patients zzso zzso size was zzso in 103 patients zzso zzso zzso involvement in 75 patients zzso Median follow-up was zzso for all zzso zzso techniques were used in addition to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Total prescribed mean dose zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Complete zzso was achieved in zzso patients zzso zzso local control at zzso was zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso Cancer specific survival at zzso was overall zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso survival at zzso was in total zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso In regard to late morbidity in total 188 grade zzso and 11 grade zzso late events were observed in 143 zzso zzso events for zzso were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso (including zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso plus image zzso guided zzso zzso zzso including needle zzso in advanced disease results in local control rates of zzso at zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso response zzso zzso cancer patients associated with a moderate rate of treatment related zzso Compared to the historical Vienna series there is relative reduction in pelvic recurrence by zzso and reduction in major zzso The local control improvement seems to have impact on zzso and zzso Prospective clinical zzso studies are mandatory to evaluate these challenging zzso zzso
