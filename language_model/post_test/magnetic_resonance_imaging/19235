We compare a previously developed phase zzso magnetic resonance imaging technique zzso to a zzso ultrasound zzso method for measuring small zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso acoustic zzso waves in zzso zzso Our preliminary experiments with gelatin zzso show that acoustic zzso propagation can be measured with zzso and we speculate that this technique could find applications in medical zzso
