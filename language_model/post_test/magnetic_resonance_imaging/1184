Although emotional dysfunction is considered a fundamental symptom of zzso studies investigating the neural basis of emotional dysfunction in schizophrenia are zzso Using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and a task viewing affective pictures, we aimed to examine automatic emotional response and to zzso the neural basis of impaired emotional processing in zzso Fifteen healthy volunteers and 15 zzso were zzso During the scans, the subjects were instructed to indicate how each of the presented pictures made them zzso Whole brain activities in response to the affective pictures were measured by zzso zzso recruited the neural circuit including zzso region, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, zzso zzso zzso zzso and visual zzso while viewing unpleasant zzso Despite an equal behavioral result to controls, the patients showed less zzso in the components of the circuit zzso amygdala, bilateral zzso region, zzso prefrontal zzso zzso zzso zzso thalamus, zzso zzso and visual zzso This study demonstrated functional abnormalities in the neural circuit of emotional processing in zzso In particular, decreased zzso in the right zzso and zzso appears to be an important finding related to dysfunctional emotional behavior in zzso
