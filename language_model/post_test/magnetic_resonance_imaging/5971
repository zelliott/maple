zzso To assess MR features in patients with zzso syndrome zzso and to zzso correlate MR findings with criteria derived from previously reported zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso episodes of painful zzso zzso selected according to International zzso Society zzso standards underwent MR examinations focused on the cavernous zzso zzso examinations in 20 and follow-up MR images in 17 episodes were zzso reviewed by 3 independent zzso 

The primary criteria: an enhancing soft tissue zzso within the cavernous zzso increase in size and lateral bulging of the anterior cavernous zzso zzso were consistently present in 15 initial episodes and in 5 zzso zzso zzso among observers was zzso The secondary criteria: internal carotid artery narrowing in 7 patients, extension towards the superior zzso zzso in 13 and zzso zzso involvement in 8 patients were unanimously agreed upon in zzso zzso and zzso Complete resolution of findings was observed on follow-up zzso 

In patients with zzso the MR features conform to previously reported zzso zzso MR features are evocative of zzso when an increase in size and bulging of the zzso zzso of the anterior zzso supplemented by carotid artery involvement and extension towards the orbit are zzso Resolution of findings within 6 months is required to support the zzso
