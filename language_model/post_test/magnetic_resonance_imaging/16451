zzso syndrome zzso is a disorder of chronic motor and vocal tics that begins in zzso 

A systematic zzso search was conducted to identify existing anatomical imaging studies in persons with zzso 

Thirty studies were identified, and their methods and findings were zzso zzso of reduced zzso volumes across the life span and thinning of zzso zzso that is zzso with zzso severity in children with zzso zzso these regions in the genesis of zzso zzso of zzso and prefrontal zzso and a smaller corpus zzso accompany fewer symptoms in children with zzso likely representing an zzso plasticity within these regions that help to zzso zzso zzso 

Although existing studies differ with respect to sample size, gender zzso quality of clinical zzso pulse zzso and methods of image analysis, the preponderance of evidence suggests that disturbances in the development of the motor portions of zzso circuits likely zzso to the development zzso and that zzso changes in control systems of the brain help to zzso the severity of symptom zzso These findings from zzso studies require confirmation in more representative populations within zzso zzso
