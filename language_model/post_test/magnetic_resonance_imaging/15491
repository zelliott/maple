The cerebral zzso must have access to an eye position zzso as humans can report passive changes in eye position in total darkness, and visual responses in many cortical areas are modulated by eye zzso The source of this signal is zzso Here we demonstrate a representation of eye position in monkey primary zzso cortex, in the representation of the zzso zzso near cells with a tactile representation of the zzso zzso The zzso have eye position signals that increase zzso with increasing zzso zzso from near the center of zzso with zzso selectivity tuned in a zzso zzso All directions of eye position are represented in a single zzso The signal is zzso because it can be obliterated by zzso the zzso zzso It is not related to zzso or peripheral visual zzso and it represents the position of the eye in the head and not the angle of gaze in zzso
