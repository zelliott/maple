To assess the risks and implications of assuming that white matter zzso in cancer patients that do not enhance with zzso zzso zzso can be considered to be zzso 

zzso was administered zzso to 131 consecutive patients with zzso zzso zzso referred for zzso MR imaging to exclude cerebral zzso over a zzso zzso From this initial group, 50 patients were identified who had focal zzso zzso of the white matter on zzso images, but no other findings to suggest zzso zzso This cohort of 50 patients was then followed for at least 1 year to determine the risk and clinical implications of assuming these zzso white matter zzso were zzso 

Thirty patients zzso were alive and clinically free of zzso zzso disease at least 1 year following their initial MR study zzso follow-up time, 17 zzso Twenty of the 50 patients zzso died within 1 year of their study zzso survival, zzso zzso Review of clinic notes and hospital charts revealed no evidence for deterioration of zzso status in any of these patients before death, and the cause of death in each case was ascribed to zzso complications of their systemic zzso Eight of these 20 patients who expired had at least one follow-up zzso CT or MR scan before death showing no new cerebral zzso or change in the zzso white matter zzso previously zzso In a single patient, however, follow-up MR scan revealed conversion of one of her several white matter zzso from zzso to enhancing without appreciable change in its size on zzso zzso Unfortunately, this patient died 4 months later from surgical complications without zzso change in her zzso status nor zzso proof of the nature of this zzso 

White matter zzso in cancer patients that do not enhance with zzso at the time of the initial MR study have a low probability of representing zzso zzso Clinical management or final outcome will not likely be altered by assuming such zzso are zzso
