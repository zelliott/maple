To detect zzso zzso changes in sleeping patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome by dynamic zzso and concurrent zzso monitoring during true zzso zzso 

Five volunteers and eight patients with clinically diagnosed zzso sleep zzso were zzso monitored inside the scanner before, zzso and after sleep zzso After sleep zzso the Mueller maneuver was performed to compare induced zzso collapse with real collapse during zzso 

In all patients, zzso zzso registration was achieved in the zzso magnetic zzso Sleep was proved in four of the eight patients who showed typical zzso zzso A complete zzso collapse was shown in two of the four sleeping zzso The other patients predominately showed local zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Compared with the zzso episodes, the Mueller maneuver did not reveal the same extent of zzso zzso nor a complete zzso 

zzso monitored zzso can directly assess findings induced by the zzso of sleep zzso and shows promise for use in sleep investigation and therapy planning and zzso
