zzso zzso for zzso disease prevents cerebral zzso attacks by improving cerebral blood flow zzso But little is known about the changes of zzso and its effect on neurological status during the acute stage after direct bypass for zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso by the zzso method was performed 4 and 10 days after superficial zzso zzso cerebral artery zzso zzso on 11 sides of 9 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso years old) with zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 7 days after zzso The zzso zzso by zzso showed focal decrease at the site of the zzso 4 days after zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso and was further decreased in larger territory 10 days after surgery in all zzso zzso cerebral blood volume zzso by zzso showed significant increase compared to zzso zzso in four patients who suffered symptomatic cerebral zzso after zzso zzso zzso revealed apparent increase of zzso in all patients and the zzso of the zzso bypass was confirmed by zzso All patients were discharged without neurological deterioration compared to zzso neurological status, and none of them suffered zzso attack after zzso 

zzso decrease in zzso by zzso could be a sensitive zzso for the zzso of zzso after zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso may suggest cerebral zzso and could be the optimal predictor for zzso syndrome after zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso
