zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso in the zzso zzso and to the zzso of zzso family protein zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso plays a key role in cancer cell growth, survival and tumor zzso As such, zzso of zzso offer the promise of a new therapeutic zzso for cancer zzso zzso based drug screening has recently become a viable entry point for hit zzso In this work, zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso afforded novel zzso as zzso starting points from zzso screening zzso zzso identified as hits by zzso zzso were tested in a zzso zzso and fragments with activity in both zzso were zzso The Pfizer compound file was zzso via zzso and zzso similarity search, and the zzso were zzso by zzso efficiency zzso zzso mining, chemical zzso and chemical zzso of promising zzso From this effort, an zzso zzso hit, 5 zzso zzso zzso was identified as a novel, zzso efficient inhibitor of zzso and a suitable scaffold for further zzso zzso in the absence of zzso data, a zzso growing approach efficiently explored four zzso of the zzso scaffold via parallel synthesis to afford a compound with zzso data, 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso lead zzso efforts provided 24 zzso zzso zzso with greater than fivefold selectivity against other key zzso zzso
