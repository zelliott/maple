Despite the generally accepted view that zzso exercise can have positive effects on brain health, few studies have measured brain responses to exercise over a short time zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the impact within one hour of a single bout of exercise on brain zzso and zzso zzso 

Healthy adults zzso age zzso zzso zzso were scanned using zzso zzso Imaging zzso before and after 20 minutes of exercise at zzso of their zzso zzso heart zzso zzso zzso spin labeling zzso was used to measure absolute cerebral blood flow zzso prior to exercise zzso and at 10 zzso zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso Blood zzso level dependent zzso functional zzso zzso was performed zzso and zzso to characterize zzso differences related to a zzso reaction time zzso 

Compared to zzso levels, zzso matter zzso was zzso zzso lower at zzso zzso and not different at zzso zzso while global zzso zzso was increased at both time points zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso showed a decrease in zzso in zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso analysis identified elevated zzso in the left zzso zzso zzso at zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso were consistent between sessions, however, the left zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso after zzso 

This study provides preliminary evidence of zzso brain effects associated with a single bout of zzso zzso The observed acute cerebrovascular responses may provide some insight into the zzso ability to change in relation to chronic zzso
