zzso zzso tumor zzso is chronic inflammatory zzso of unknown zzso The zzso diagnosis for tumors in the zzso cavity is difficult to distinguish between zzso and aggressive zzso in most zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the imaging features of zzso distinguishing the 2 types of zzso 

zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging were identified zzso with zzso in 14 cases and with aggressive zzso in 38 cases in the zzso cavity proven by zzso Imaging findings were zzso including the zzso extent, margin, zzso bone involvement, zzso and zzso signal intensity, and degree of zzso 

There was a significant difference between zzso and aggressive zzso regarding the zzso extension, zzso bone change, signal intensity and homogeneous on zzso imaging, and degree of enhancement zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tumor and aggressive zzso have some different imaging features that could be helpful in the differentiation between the zzso Bone erosion with zzso zzso when present, typically zzso and never zzso of zzso appearance, and mild enhancement played an important role in zzso zzso zzso from zzso
