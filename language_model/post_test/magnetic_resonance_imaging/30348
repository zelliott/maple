The zzso regions implicated in zzso selective attention differ between patient zzso studies and functional imaging of the intact zzso We aimed to resolve this zzso In a zzso zzso mapping study in 20 zzso stroke patients, we applied the same cognitive zzso approach as in 23 healthy volunteers who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso using identical tasks and zzso An zzso central cue directed attention to one visual zzso After a brief zzso a grating appeared in that zzso together with an irrelevant grating in an zzso zzso zzso had to discriminate the orientation of the grating in the cued zzso Patients with a right inferior zzso zzso were significantly more impaired during zzso versus zzso zzso when stimuli were bilateral and symmetrical than when stimuli occupied diagonally opposite zzso or two zzso within the same zzso In one area, the zzso map overlapped with the activity map obtained in healthy zzso the lower bank of the middle third of the right zzso zzso zzso In an additional 37 healthy zzso subjects, we zzso the effects of zzso zzso and spatial zzso between stimuli on activity in the volume of zzso Only the axis of zzso between stimuli had a significant effect, with highest activity when the zzso axis was zzso This constitutes zzso evidence from patients and cognitively intact subjects that the lower bank of the middle third of the right zzso critically contributes to attentive selection between competing stimuli in a zzso zzso zzso
