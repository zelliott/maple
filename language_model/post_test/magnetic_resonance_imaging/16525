Since the advent of screening zzso approximately one-quarter of newly diagnosed breast zzso are at the earliest zzso stage of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with this improvement in early detection has been a growing clinical concern that distinguishing aggressive from zzso zzso is necessary to zzso patient zzso zzso engineered mouse models offer an appealing experimental framework in which to investigate factors that influence and predict progression of zzso zzso Because of the small size of early stage zzso in mice, high-resolution imaging techniques are required to effectively observe zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of zzso for assessment of in zzso zzso zzso and early invasive zzso zzso that zzso arise in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso Additionally, images of normal zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice were acquired and compared with those from transgenic zzso Sixteen mice underwent MR examinations employing zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso recalled echo scans zzso zzso zzso with fat suppression in a zzso process targeting both the upper and lower zzso zzso zzso successfully detected in zzso and early invasive zzso in transgenic mice with high sensitivity and zzso The average zzso ratio zzso of in zzso zzso on zzso high-resolution zzso zzso images was zzso which was lower than that of invasive tumors, zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso of zzso p zzso zzso but significantly higher than that of normal zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed no zzso or benign zzso and comparable image contrast characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with normal tissue areas of transgenic zzso This present study demonstrates that zzso is an excellent candidate for performing zzso assessment of early stage zzso cancer disease progression and response to therapy in the transgenic model zzso
