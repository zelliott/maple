The human brain zzso complex organizational changes during development in and ex zzso zzso events affecting the developing brain cause abnormalities or zzso the patterns of which depend on the stage of brain zzso During the first and second zzso cortical zzso predominantly takes place, characterized by zzso migration, and organization of zzso zzso Brain pathology is characterized by zzso During the third zzso growth and differentiation events are zzso which persist into zzso zzso zzso of brain development during this period mainly cause zzso During the early third zzso zzso white matter is especially affected, whereas toward the end of the third zzso gray matter, either cortical or deep gray matter, appears to be more zzso These patterns of brain zzso or zzso offer excellent models to study mechanisms of organization and reorganization in the developing zzso Evidence for superior brain plasticity is well established for language function after early zzso zzso Some evidence exists for higher zzso potential within in the motor system; maintenance of zzso tracts seems to play a certain, but only incomplete functional role after unilateral zzso in early and mid zzso The visual system seems to have limited zzso zzso
