To evaluate the significance of dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso and whole body zzso zzso in the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of therapy for patients with zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso and multiple myeloma zzso 

The retrospective study includes 219 patients providing 463 zzso and zzso investigations for the zzso zzso zzso zzso active disease zzso this includes 70 patients with new diagnosis of zzso according to the International zzso System zzso zzso zzso stage I, zzso zzso stage II, zzso zzso stage III, zzso insufficient for zzso and 56 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso progressive disease and zzso stable disease) and zzso zzso zzso zzso complete zzso zzso very good partial zzso and zzso partial zzso zzso of patients with zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy persons zzso were added as control subjects zzso zzso evaluation was done by evaluating thirteen skeletal regions, providing a zzso zzso zzso images of the spine, were analyzed with zzso and zzso zzso 

All zzso parameters can significantly differentiate between the zzso zzso zzso One hundred days after zzso stem cell transplantation a zzso decrease of the slope zzso value zzso can be zzso A cubic zzso trend between zzso zzso and slope zzso zzso could demonstrate a significant increase bone zzso zzso if zzso affects more than 10 skeletal regions zzso associated with a poorer prognosis zzso 

zzso evaluation of the spine is useful for diagnosis of zzso follow-up after stem cell transplantation and evaluation of disease zzso A combined evaluation with zzso and zzso provides additional zzso information on the zzso zzso and could help categorize patients with zzso in two different groups to offer useful therapeutic and zzso zzso
