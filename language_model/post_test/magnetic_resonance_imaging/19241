The potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in the zzso of zzso brain damage has intensely been zzso We have recently demonstrated that stroke patients display an zzso production of zzso zzso early after onset of zzso zzso one of these zzso stimulates the production of zzso oxide zzso a potent inflammatory zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso levels of zzso one of the main zzso of NO in acute stroke and to relate its levels to brain zzso Stroke patients were zzso studied with clinical zzso zzso assessment and analysis of zzso levels of nitrate by gas zzso zzso In addition, simultaneous analyses of zzso and of soluble zzso and zzso two proteins regulating zzso were zzso The zzso levels of nitrate were not significantly different in stroke patients compared to controls throughout the observation zzso However, the zzso levels of nitrate increased significantly 3 months after stroke onset compared with the first 3 zzso Interestingly, the levels of nitrate measured at stroke onset were zzso correlated to the final size of zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso measured by zzso In addition, patients with large zzso displayed significantly zzso zzso zzso lower levels of nitrate in zzso fluid compared to patients with small zzso during the first 3 days after stroke zzso In contrast, the zzso levels of nitrate were significantly positively correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso to the neurological deficit and zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso 76, p zzso zzso to zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso in the late stage of the zzso Early NO production is associated with a smaller zzso volume, suggesting a protective effect, whereas late NO production is associated with zzso neurological deficits, suggesting a zzso zzso Treatment trials pertaining to zzso NO production in stroke should take into consideration the dual effect of NO on zzso brain zzso
