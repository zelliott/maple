zzso of a new fast software technique to segment the cartilage on knee magnetic resonance zzso zzso Large studies of knee zzso zzso will require fast and zzso methods to zzso cartilage changes for knee MR zzso In this report we document and measure the zzso and reader time of a software-based technique to zzso the volume and thickness of zzso cartilage on knee MR zzso 

The software was tested on a set of duplicate zzso three-dimensional zzso dual echo steady state zzso acquisitions from 15 (8 zzso 7 zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cartilage volume zzso and thickness zzso were measured independently as well as the reader time for each cartilage zzso The zzso square zzso of variation zzso was used as metric to zzso the zzso of VC and mean zzso 

The repositioning zzso was as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso values were higher for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The method required an average of zzso per zzso 

We have documented a fast zzso zzso software method to segment zzso cartilage on knee MR zzso
