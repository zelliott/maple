To study the effects of zzso zzso on zzso of the human zzso cortical network, we measured zzso evoked fields to electric median nerve zzso using a zzso zzso zzso from six patients with cortical zzso stroke and from seven healthy control zzso In the control subjects, unilateral stimuli zzso responses which were zzso accounted for by zzso sources in the zzso primary zzso and bilateral secondary zzso zzso zzso In all patients, stimulation of the right median nerve also activated the zzso and zzso zzso of the healthy left zzso However, the zzso pattern was altered, suggesting diminished zzso zzso via zzso connections after zzso zzso zzso to left median nerve stimuli showed large zzso zzso due to the different zzso of the zzso The strength of the zzso response, originating in the zzso cortex, roughly reflected the severity of the tactile zzso Right zzso responses were absent in patients with abnormal right zzso responses, whereas the left zzso was active in all patients, regardless of the responsiveness of the right zzso and/or zzso Our results suggest that the human zzso and zzso zzso may be zzso activated within one hemisphere, whereas zzso zzso to the stimulation may receive direct input from the zzso at least when normal input from zzso is zzso
