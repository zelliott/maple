zzso imaging studies have shown that elderly individuals activate widespread additional brain networks, compared to young subjects, when performing motor zzso However, the parameters that effect this unique neural zzso including the spatial distribution of this zzso across zzso are still largely zzso Here, we examined the effect of task complexity and body side on zzso differences between older and younger adults while performing cyclical zzso movements of the zzso hand and zzso In particular, easy zzso and more difficult zzso coordination patterns were performed with either the left or right body side at a zzso comfortable zzso Even in the absence of imposed pacing the older group activated a larger brain network, suggestive of increased zzso deployment for monitoring the spatial relationships between the simultaneously moving segments and enhanced sensory processing and zzso Evidence of zzso zzso was also found in zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso possibly reflecting a functional decline of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the older zzso An zzso model revealed significant main effects of task complexity and body zzso However the interaction of these factors with age did not reach zzso zzso we conclude that under zzso conditions, task complexity and body side did not have a zzso effect on age-related brain zzso
