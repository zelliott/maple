In this contribution, a rapid and robust technique for quantitative zzso mapping of the human lung is zzso Based on a series of zzso zzso zzso acquired after a single inversion pulse, high quality and quantitative zzso zzso maps acquired in under five seconds were obtained from six healthy zzso The measured zzso values are in good agreement with previously reported literature zzso zzso maps were also acquired with the volunteers breathing room air or zzso zzso The zzso difference between breathing room air and zzso zzso is statistically significant at P zzso zzso
