In zzso zzso zzso of wing vein cells and sensory organ precursor zzso cells, which later give rise to a zzso requires zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso signaling in wing vein and bristle zzso We observed that loss of zzso function yielded extra wing veins and additional zzso zzso zzso of zzso eliminated wing veins and zzso zzso for zzso produced no zzso on their own, but greatly enhanced zzso caused by the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso are zzso by zzso that have zzso Response zzso zzso sequences in their zzso zzso are known to bind zzso to zzso regulation in other zzso We show that these zzso sequences bind zzso and zzso repression on a zzso reporter in zzso zzso Taken together, our evidence suggests that zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso signaling by directly targeting components of the zzso in zzso
