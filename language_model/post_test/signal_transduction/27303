In zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso molecules are demonstrated on the surface of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are present on the surface of zzso in zzso patients as well as normal individuals, are responsible for this zzso In this study, we have investigated zzso and functional characteristics of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cell suspensions were prepared zzso with zzso followed by either zzso or zzso treatment, zzso zzso blood zzso were zzso selected by excluding other zzso with surface marker zzso zzso with previous reports, both peripheral blood zzso and zzso zzso were positively stained with anti zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso positive population was demonstrated among zzso zzso positive zzso These cells express significant amounts of zzso molecules zzso and zzso CD 1 a zzso which identifies them as zzso zzso zzso of the zzso No other zzso zzso zzso positive population was found in the other zzso zzso or zzso zzso except for a minor zzso population, presumably mast zzso To analyze whether these zzso zzso zzso molecules are signal zzso for zzso zzso calcium zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso was measured with flow zzso Following zzso peripheral blood zzso clearly increased zzso zzso On the other hand, neither normal zzso zzso nor zzso zzso + cells changed their zzso calcium level after zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that normal zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso are resistant to calcium flux following zzso zzso zzso zzso
