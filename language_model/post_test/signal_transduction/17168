zzso cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death in males in the United zzso Using human prostate cancer zzso the authors have previously shown that elevated expression levels of zzso zzso occurred more frequently in advanced stage, high-grade prostate cancer, suggesting that zzso expression is associated with zzso progression and zzso Previous reports from their group and others have shown that zzso is a positive zzso of invasion and zzso however, the mechanism remains zzso In this work, a new link between zzso and the zzso zzso 9 zzso in prostate cancer zzso is zzso This study demonstrated that zzso of zzso in prostate cancer zzso cells resulted in elevated expression of zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso acid, the sole and stable end product of zzso acid metabolism by zzso is able to increase zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, using pharmacological and genetic zzso approaches, it was found that zzso activates zzso 3 zzso zzso which results in nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso ensuing in enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso inhibited zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and resulted in the blockade of the migratory ability of zzso zzso In zzso the authors have identified a new zzso by which zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells leads to zzso production of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell migration may account for the zzso function of zzso in prostate zzso
