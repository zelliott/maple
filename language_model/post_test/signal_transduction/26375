zzso shock zzso is a common condition and leading cause of death in trauma patients zzso Severe inflammatory responses during HS finally lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is increasingly recognized as an important signaling zzso with various protective zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso and zzso effects of an zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso in an HS rat zzso Male zzso rats were randomly divided into the zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and HS treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The HS groups were subjected to zzso HS for zzso and then treated with zzso or left zzso The rats were then zzso with zzso zzso solution for zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso were zzso zzso changes in cardiac tissue and zzso injury were also zzso HS resulted in significant zzso deterioration and increased zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly prevented zzso deterioration and decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the nuclear factor zzso inhibitor zzso zzso factor zzso inhibitor zzso factor zzso zzso signaling zzso The results suggest that zzso exerts zzso effects against zzso The protective effects of zzso may occur via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
