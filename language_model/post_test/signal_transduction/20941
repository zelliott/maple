We investigated zzso in the zzso zzso zzso system in rabbits with zzso heart failure induced by zzso zzso A dose of 24 zzso zzso was administered over 16 weeks in 16 zzso Five of them died and 4 of them could not tolerate the full dose of zzso Complete data were obtained in the remaining 7 zzso Another 7 rabbits received zzso saline for the same period and served as zzso Plasma zzso concentration increased in zzso zzso but not in the control zzso zzso output was lower in the zzso group than in the control zzso Both the left and right zzso zzso pressure were higher in the zzso zzso The density of zzso zzso receptors and the zzso content were reduced in both zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were lower in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso in zzso signaling occurred in both zzso in animals with chronic zzso failure induced by zzso These may be the result of zzso zzso including abnormalities of zzso zzso proteins or of the zzso unit of zzso zzso
