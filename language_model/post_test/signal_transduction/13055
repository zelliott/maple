In the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso signaling can be initiated by zzso acting through its nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso to stimulate the local synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso activity can be induced by IGF-1 zzso providing evidence for a zzso mechanism between IGF-1 and zzso To investigate whether zzso alpha is required for zzso responses to IGF-1 in zzso both zzso zzso and zzso alpha knockout zzso zzso mice were administered IGF-1, and various zzso responses to IGF-1 were zzso In both zzso and alpha zzso mice, IGF-1 treatment resulted in zzso of zzso IGF-1 zzso zzso and formation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In addition, IGF-1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and alpha zzso zzso However, IGF-1 treatment zzso zzso incorporation and zzso cell nuclear zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso alpha can be activated in zzso by IGF-1 zzso transgenic mice carrying a zzso gene driven by two zzso response elements zzso zzso were zzso Treatment of zzso zzso mice with IGF-1 resulted in an increase in zzso zzso activity that was attenuated in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Together these data demonstrate that 1) functional signaling zzso to zzso is maintained in the alpha zzso mouse zzso 2) zzso alpha is necessary for IGF-1 induction of zzso nuclear zzso responses, and 3) zzso between zzso and zzso signaling pathways exists in zzso
