zzso protein zzso is a multiply membrane spanning member of the zzso zzso that regulates some zzso cell functions through formation of a complex with zzso zzso and zzso G zzso zzso is critical for the association of the three protein components of the zzso complex and for its zzso The multiply membrane spanning domain of zzso is required for complex formation because it binds zzso The zzso complex forms zzso in zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso domain, previously shown to be required for association with zzso is affected by both the multiply membrane spanning domain and zzso These data demonstrate that cholesterol is an essential component of the zzso protein signaling complex, presumably acting through an effect on zzso zzso
