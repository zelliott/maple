The zzso of zzso signaling and zzso zzso of zzso signaling has previously been implicated in zzso neural zzso as evidenced by the zzso induction of zzso and zzso in zzso However, screens have not previously been conducted to identify additional potential target zzso Using a zzso screening method we determined that zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso are induced in response to zzso and a zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso 30 and zzso acid zzso gamma were induced by zzso zzso To determine whether any of the induced genes are direct targets of zzso zzso we zzso on zzso In the present study we show that the zzso zzso promoter contains three consensus binding sites for zzso which are zzso box zzso factors which bind to zzso in response to zzso of the zzso 1 signaling zzso An zzso promoter zzso reporter construct containing these zzso sites is induced in zzso zzso zzso by the combination of zzso or zzso and zzso These zzso sites are required for expression of zzso as a dominant negative zzso blocks expression of zzso zzso as well as expression of the reporter zzso Moreover, zzso of these three zzso sites abrogates expression of the reporter construct in response to zzso and zzso or zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is a direct target of the zzso signaling pathway, and that zzso signaling works with zzso zzso to regulate gene expression during patterning of the developing nervous system of zzso
