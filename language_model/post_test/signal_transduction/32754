We have previously reported that zzso toxin zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso cascade zzso by insulin acting through zzso growth zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso A high level of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was sustained for up to 4 h after insulin treatment, and mobility shifted and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso activity measured by the incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by insulin zzso We previously discovered that insulin activates Ras and that this is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also occurred in response to zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso of these proteins by zzso Interestingly, treating zzso cells with zzso zzso the zzso by insulin of both the zzso cascade and zzso zzso In contrast, neither zzso of zzso and zzso nor the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso However, zzso of the zzso cascade and zzso of zzso by zzso growth factor are insensitive to zzso These results indicate that there is another zzso which regulates zzso zzso and zzso independent of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso via zzso zzso by insulin acting via zzso zzso
