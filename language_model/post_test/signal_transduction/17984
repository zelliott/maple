zzso was originally described as a zzso which induced zzso production by established zzso cells in an zzso zzso However, subsequent studies demonstrated that zzso zzso in the absence of zzso failed to drive zzso differentiation of zzso cells and induced zzso from established zzso cells only in combination with zzso We have examined the role of zzso zzso in controlling zzso lineage zzso When zzso zzso T cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in partial zzso of zzso production, but did not inhibit zzso zzso To distinguish whether the zzso effect of zzso zzso was zzso directly by blocking zzso production or indirectly by blocking zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso - zzso - mice were zzso with zzso and zzso These cells failed to produce zzso but markedly zzso zzso zzso We propose that the major effect of zzso on zzso development is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso thereby enhancing zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso expression by zzso may be particularly important for the differentiation of foreign zzso or zzso zzso cells when the zzso concentration of zzso in the zzso is just below the threshold required for zzso zzso
