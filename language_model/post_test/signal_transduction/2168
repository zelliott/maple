Previously, we have reported that zzso zzso zzso is one of the major downstream targets by which zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso serum response element zzso in response to zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 407 (1997) zzso Thus, the potential activity of zzso acid zzso a principal product of zzso zzso on zzso zzso stimulation has been zzso Here, we provide evidence about the biological activity of AA on zzso zzso zzso Further, we observed that zzso with expression zzso of either zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso via zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity is critical for the signaling cascade of zzso to zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling to the nucleus appears to be, at least partly, zzso by a zzso zzso and this zzso signaling connection is zzso by zzso In accordance with the role of zzso as a potential zzso of AA signaling to the nucleus, AA zzso a rapid zzso of zzso
