Red zzso zzso zzso zzso detect a zzso chemical cue released by zzso eggs, and change their swimming behavior to increase the likelihood of zzso zzso Previously, we isolated the natural zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso and chemically identified it as the zzso acid zzso zzso In the present study, levels of this ecologically meaningful compound were zzso in various zzso zzso and in freshly spawned zzso zzso was the least abundant of 19 dissolved free zzso acids zzso in zzso zzso foot muscle, zzso stomach and zzso As a proportion of the zzso pool, however, zzso zzso were significantly elevated in eggs zzso to zzso zzso relative to all other sampled zzso Natural rates of zzso release from eggs also were measured and correlated with zzso zzso success peaked during an initial 30 zzso period zzso but decreased to zzso over the next 50 zzso zzso zzso these events, zzso accumulated in seawater around freshly spawned eggs for the first 45 zzso zzso before zzso rapidly from zzso Older eggs stopped releasing zzso approximately when they became zzso revealing a critical link between zzso physiology and chemical zzso This apparent negative feedback loop did not arise from zzso zzso zzso by bacteria in seawater, or a degrading zzso released by zzso As a zzso precursor critical to development of the zzso nervous system, zzso could be an honest indicator of egg fitness for prospective zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling pathways have been zzso for external communication between zzso as an adaptation to increase zzso success by promoting zzso navigation towards fertile zzso
