zzso of zzso into mature zzso T cells is an ordered process involving sequential interactions between T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and their appropriate major zzso zzso zzso zzso how these zzso engagements determine lineage commitment is still controversial, but recently it has been suggested that quantitative differences in the signal transmitted by zzso of zzso versus zzso with zzso might provide the discriminating zzso We examine this hypothesis, using zzso zzso zzso to mimic zzso zzso engagement during zzso zzso These zzso zzso lack zzso and can engage surface molecules without extensive zzso or targeting to zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso with zzso zzso efficient differentiation of mature zzso lineage cells, irrespective of their zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso with zzso also zzso maturation of zzso T cells, although less zzso but not of zzso T zzso Thus, although the signals delivered by zzso of zzso and zzso appear weaker than from zzso of zzso and zzso the outcome from either engagement is the zzso These data suggest that differences in signal intensity alone do not determine lineage commitment in the zzso but that distinct signals are required for zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso
