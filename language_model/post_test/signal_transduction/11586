The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is primarily expressed in muscle and zzso tissue and accounts for the majority of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso or zzso state, zzso is localized to zzso membrane compartments zzso away from circulating zzso However, in response to zzso zzso there is a marked zzso of the zzso protein to the cell surface membrane providing a transport route for the zzso of zzso This zzso zzso can be divided into four general steps: zzso zzso zzso trafficking out of the storage pool, zzso zzso just below the cell surface, zzso zzso via the interactions of the zzso proteins present on the zzso and plasma zzso and zzso fusion of the zzso zzso with the plasma zzso This review focuses on recent advances made in identification and characterization of the molecular events and protein interactions involved in these steps of zzso zzso zzso
