zzso gene expression is induced by DNA damage in cells with zzso zzso and contributes to the arrest of cell zzso It was demonstrated that under many experimental conditions, including zzso stress, zzso expression can be induced through zzso zzso Since most of these experimental conditions induce the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and thus its zzso we evaluated zzso zzso levels in cells exposed to an zzso stress, induced by zzso zzso and in which the zzso zzso was zzso The expression of a zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso that zzso and activates zzso and of a zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Similarly, the expression of zzso and of zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso the cells with the zzso compound zzso suggesting that zzso stress is involved in these zzso zzso zzso levels reached a maximum within 2 h of adding zzso or zzso however, the rate of zzso from a zzso construct did not increase during this zzso In contrast, cells treated with zzso D show an increase of zzso zzso stability after zzso zzso This result suggests that the increase in zzso zzso at early times results from zzso regulatory zzso zzso exposure to zzso may activate zzso gene zzso through an zzso zzso while zzso treatment gradually zzso zzso gene zzso through zzso changes that affect zzso binding to zzso
