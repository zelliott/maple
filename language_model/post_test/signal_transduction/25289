Low molecular weight G proteins of the zzso zzso are regulators of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso G zzso the small zzso are not directly activated through zzso binding to G zzso receptors zzso However, a subset of zzso including those for zzso acid and zzso induce stress zzso focal zzso and cell zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso has been a useful tool for demonstrating zzso involvement in these and other responses, including zzso zzso of smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, zzso and serum response zzso gene zzso Most of the zzso that induce zzso responses can activate zzso but this is not a sufficient zzso Recent data demonstrate that G alpha zzso can induce zzso zzso Furthermore, G alpha zzso can bind and activate zzso zzso zzso exchange factors, providing a mechanism by which zzso that couple to G alpha zzso could activate zzso and its downstream zzso
