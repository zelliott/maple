The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is known to mediate the cellular response to numerous zzso including zzso zzso zzso knockout mice provide evidence for the involvement of the zzso zzso cascade in zzso regulated zzso functions of the female zzso zzso Several studies already aimed to investigate the impact of the zzso zzso zzso response zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas on contrary availability of data describing the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso cascade is rather zzso In this study we observed an zzso effect of zzso treatment on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso zzso rats, whereas zzso zzso and zzso displayed an increased zzso The usage of the zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enabled us to distinguish between zzso zzso specific zzso On zzso level the observed changes in gene expression were mainly zzso by zzso except for the expression of zzso In most cases the zzso of zzso caused effects opposite to the ones observed following zzso of zzso Despite the significant changes in zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso tissue section did not reveal changes of the zzso protein zzso Taken together our results zzso support and extend the hypothesis of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso they give an insight into how the zzso and its related genes may participate in zzso dependent zzso zzso processes and provide another potential mechanism of action for zzso
