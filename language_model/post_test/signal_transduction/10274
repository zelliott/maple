zzso evidence reveals a significant correlation between zzso 2 zzso expression and tumor invasion and zzso in various human zzso but the major focus of recent studies has been on the zzso effects of zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso cell invasion results from the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso in tumor zzso In this study, we identify a novel mechanism by which zzso stimulates zzso expression leading to zzso cell zzso We show that zzso interacts with zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells, zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and substantially enhancing zzso expression and zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso was attenuated by functional zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, expression of a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso expression and zzso cell zzso in the zzso zzso These data establish a functional link between zzso interaction with zzso zzso and zzso cell invasion through the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
