The zzso zzso bacterial zzso array of zzso coli and zzso zzso is representative of the large, zzso family of sensory zzso that control the cellular zzso of zzso bacteria and zzso The core framework of the zzso array is a lattice assembled from three zzso a zzso zzso a zzso His zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso studies in the field have revealed the global architecture of the array and complexes between specific zzso but much remains to be learned about the essential zzso zzso that define array structure and transmit signals between zzso This study has focused on the structure, function, and zzso switching of a key contact between the zzso and zzso proteins in the working, zzso zzso Specifically, the study addressed interface 1 in the putative zzso ring where zzso 1 of the zzso regulatory domain contacts zzso 2 of the zzso zzso Two independent approaches, zzso mapping and zzso zzso and Ala zzso were employed zzso to test the structural model of interface 1 and zzso to investigate its functional roles in both stable zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies were conducted in functional, zzso zzso or in live zzso The findings reveal that crystal structures of zzso and zzso complexes accurately depict the native interface in its zzso on zzso Furthermore, the findings indicate that at least part of the interface becomes less closely packed in its zzso off zzso Together, the evidence shows the interface has a dual structural and signaling function that is crucial for incorporation of the stable zzso into the zzso for zzso zzso in the array on state, and likely for zzso zzso zzso zzso A model is presented that describes the concerted transmission of a zzso signal among the zzso the zzso regulatory domain, and the zzso zzso In principle, this signal could spread out into the surrounding array via the zzso ring, employing a series of alternating zzso transitions that transmit low-energy zzso signals long zzso
