The establishment and maintenance of cell and tissue polarity is crucial for a range of biological zzso such as oriented division, migration, zzso and barrier zzso The molecular pathways that regulate cell and tissue polarity have been extensively studied in lower organisms as well as in zzso cell zzso By contrast, relatively little is still known about how polarization regulates the in zzso formation and zzso of zzso zzso Several recent papers have identified crucial roles for zzso polarity proteins in a range of in zzso zzso including stem cell behavior, cell fate determination, junction formation and maintenance and organ zzso Using the zzso of the skin as a model system, this zzso aims to discuss the in zzso significance of cell and tissue polarity in the regulation of zzso tissue zzso zzso and zzso Specifically, we discuss the mechanisms by which the molecular players previously identified to determine polarity in zzso and/or in lower organisms regulate zzso zzso orient cell division to drive cell fate determination within the zzso zzso and orient hair zzso We also describe how altered polarity signaling contributes to skin zzso
