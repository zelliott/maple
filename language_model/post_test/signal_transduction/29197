zzso zzso or global zzso zzso delayed zzso death in vulnerable zzso zzso cells with many features of zzso A brief period of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso robust protection of zzso zzso against a subsequent more prolonged zzso zzso Here we show that zzso acts via zzso signaling to block the zzso cascade involving zzso zzso of zzso assembly of Bad with zzso zzso of zzso to form its zzso fragment, zzso zzso of zzso channels in the zzso outer zzso zzso release of zzso c and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein with low zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings show how zzso acts to prevent the release of zzso c and zzso from zzso and to preserve the integrity of the zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso administered in zzso 1 h before or immediately after zzso or up to 120 h later significantly reverses zzso protection, indicating a requirement for sustained zzso signaling in zzso zzso These findings zzso zzso signaling in maintenance of the integrity of the zzso outer zzso
