zzso is a key cellular process, both during zzso and upon infection or tissue zzso zzso on the surface of professional zzso cells bind to target particles either directly or through zzso zzso and trigger zzso zzso of the zzso The process must be carefully controlled to ensure that zzso is triggered efficiently and specifically, and that the zzso zzso responses that often accompany it are initiated only when zzso In this review, we will describe and compare the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso triggered by zzso zzso which mediate the zzso of zzso zzso targets, and zzso which is responsible for zzso of zzso with exposed cell wall zzso We will examine how these receptors detect their zzso how signal zzso is initiated and zzso and how zzso is instructed to achieve rapid and yet controlled zzso of their zzso
