In zzso cells, growth factors, zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may regulate cell zzso To validate the role of zzso in zzso we determined the effects of insulin, zzso growth factor I zzso and other growth factors on DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso highly expressing human zzso zzso zzso without increasing zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, insulin and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to greater zzso than in the corresponding zzso control zzso Furthermore, the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso DNA synthesis in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso control zzso The results indicate that high cellular levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA synthesis by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
