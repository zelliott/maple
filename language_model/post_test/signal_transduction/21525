zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso factor for many zzso zzso exerting its function through zzso of specific membrane zzso that is, zzso residing in zzso zzso Several recent reports indicate that zzso receptors are also expressed in cancer cells, suggesting that specific zzso cancer cell reactions may parallel the zzso zzso Using a novel zzso zzso recognizing the activated zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso we assessed the expression of zzso in normal and zzso zzso A strong and consistent zzso and nuclear zzso expression was noted in the normally cycling zzso including zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggesting a role in the normal zzso zzso zzso one-third of the 70 stage I zzso zzso zzso exhibited an intense zzso and nuclear zzso expression in both cancer cells and zzso zzso It was noted that such zzso zzso in cancer cells was related directly to zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was significantly associated with poor zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso is activated in both normally cycling and zzso zzso suggestive of an important role in the biology of this zzso The zzso prognosis that zzso zzso to zzso zzso could be attributed to its zzso activity, but also to a direct effect on cancer cells through an zzso zzso zzso
