Cellular responses to protein zzso are thought to play key roles in triggering zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso model of zzso lateral sclerosis zzso zzso of zzso are selectively vulnerable to zzso Fast zzso zzso selectively activate an zzso zzso zzso stress response that drives their early zzso while a subset of zzso zzso show exacerbated sensitivity to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the links between the two mechanisms and the molecular basis of their cellular specificity remained zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso to reductions in levels of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is both necessary and sufficient to trigger zzso zzso death through the zzso zzso In zzso mice in zzso reductions in zzso zzso muscle zzso and are restricted to vulnerable motor zzso In zzso both reduced zzso and zzso zzso trigger an zzso stress response that is restricted to, and required for death of, vulnerable zzso zzso Our data reveal zzso as a critical link between a zzso death zzso and the zzso stress response and point to a role of zzso levels in modulating zzso vulnerability to zzso
