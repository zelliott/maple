Experimental pulmonary zzso zzso infection in zzso mice is associated with polarized zzso zzso production, alternative zzso zzso and severe zzso In contrast, pulmonary infection with a zzso zzso strain that zzso zzso zzso elicits zzso zzso production and classical zzso zzso Additionally, mice infected with zzso resolve the acute infection and are subsequently protected against challenge with zzso zzso zzso The present study characterizes zzso zzso during the protective response to zzso zzso zzso in mice previously zzso with zzso We observed increased pulmonary zzso zzso production in lung zzso and classical zzso zzso as evidenced by enhanced expression of zzso NO zzso in the lungs of zzso mice compared with mice given a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso isolated from zzso mice on day 7 zzso and cultured in zzso were zzso against zzso zzso whereas zzso growth was uncontrolled within zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso production and induction of alternatively activated zzso were also observed in lungs of zzso mice during zzso Gene expression zzso showed that classical zzso zzso during challenge infection in zzso mice was associated with induction of the zzso factor zzso and its downstream targets zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These studies demonstrate that protective responses to zzso zzso challenge in zzso mice include classical zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Finally, the classical zzso zzso of protective zzso zzso is likely zzso via zzso signal zzso zzso
