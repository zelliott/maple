zzso act as zzso agents that regulate and/or mediate zzso zzso serving as hormones, zzso and signal zzso zzso The low molecular weight peptides affect zzso events, which influence zzso gastrointestinal and zzso zzso While some peptides have been marketed as drugs, many have served as leads or templates for the development of zzso drugs that mimic zzso zzso This review presents the advantages and disadvantages of using peptides as drugs that bind as zzso to zzso receptors and considers their applications in such zzso The value of both the peptides and their mimics is based on their participation in the zzso of zzso zzso which frequently employ scaffolding proteins acting in a zzso sequence of zzso zzso The peptides bind to zzso surface receptors to initiate a signal that is zzso to the interior of the cell through multiple layers of zzso zzso and binding zzso zzso have been further employed to identify the molecular targets of signal zzso the zzso of which might provide a means for various disease zzso The exploitation of such zzso signal zzso which are of primary importance to zzso cells, may provide an attractive strategy for zzso therapy in the zzso
