This study examined the molecular mechanism of action of zzso zzso The hypothesis was tested that death in zzso occurs through sustained zzso arrest with robust zzso signaling causing complete zzso of zzso and zzso and conversely, that zzso zzso is associated with incomplete zzso of zzso The results, obtained from studying six different cancer cell lines, strongly support the hypothesis and identify for the first time a unique molecular signature for zzso zzso The findings represent an important advance in understanding zzso drug action and provide insight into cancer cell zzso to such drugs which has important clinical zzso
