During development, differentiation is often initiated by the zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in the tightly regulated zzso of zzso signaling zzso In the differentiation of zzso and zzso in the developing zzso eye, we found that the proper intensity of zzso signaling downstream of zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso required two mutually zzso feedback zzso We identified a positive feedback loop zzso by the Ras association zzso zzso protein zzso that sustained Ras activity and zzso the negative feedback loop zzso by zzso zzso has two zzso zzso that together showed a binding preference for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was found in zzso weight zzso zzso of rau in flies decreased the differentiation of retinal wrapping zzso and induced a rough eye zzso similar to that seen in zzso of Ras zzso Further, the expression of zzso was zzso and that of rau was increased by the zzso zzso factor zzso in the presence of weak, but not zzso zzso of zzso Together, our findings reveal another regulatory mechanism that controls the intensity of zzso signaling in the developing neural network in the zzso zzso
