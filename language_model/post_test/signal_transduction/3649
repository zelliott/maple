zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso zzso receptors that mediate regulatory signals for cell proliferation and differentiation in response to zzso We have previously determined that the zzso zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso domain of zzso which is responsible for the lethal skeletal zzso zzso zzso type II zzso greatly enhances the zzso zzso activity of the zzso Here, we demonstrate that expression of this construct zzso a zzso promoter construct approximately zzso but does not lead to proliferation or zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the isolated zzso domain of activated zzso targeted to the plasma membrane by a zzso zzso is able to stimulate zzso expression by zzso induce proliferation of zzso cells, and zzso transform zzso This result suggests that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso exert a negative regulatory influence on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso of the activated zzso domain to either the zzso or the nucleus does not significantly affect biological zzso suggesting that signals from zzso resulting in zzso originate exclusively from the plasma zzso Furthermore, our novel observation that expression of a highly activated zzso zzso domain is able to zzso transform zzso suggests that zzso of zzso has the potential to play a role in human zzso
