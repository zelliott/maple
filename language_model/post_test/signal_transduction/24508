We describe the isolation of a zzso zzso adapter of T cells zzso which is expressed at high levels in zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression exerted positive or negative effects on zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling induced zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso zzso reduced the association of zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with these results, pharmacological zzso of zzso also induced zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a protein which plays a role in zzso development and/or zzso perhaps by interfering with zzso zzso
