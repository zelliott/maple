The zzso spine exhibits two striking zzso The first one is the periodic arrangement of its zzso zzso the zzso zzso This segmented organization is the result of zzso which takes place during zzso The zzso machinery involves a molecular zzso zzso zzso delivers a periodic signal controlling zzso zzso During embryonic axis zzso this signal is displaced zzso by a system of traveling signaling zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso The other characteristic feature of the spine is the subdivision of groups of zzso into anatomical zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is controlled by a set of zzso factors called zzso zzso zzso genes exhibit zzso expression zzso in the zzso which reflect their linear arrangement along the zzso property termed zzso The zzso disposition of zzso genes expression zzso provides a blueprint for the zzso of the future zzso territories of the zzso In zzso zzso genes are activated in the zzso precursors of the zzso in a zzso zzso sequence and they were proposed to control their progressive zzso into the nascent zzso zzso zzso the positioning of the expression zzso of zzso genes along the zzso axis is largely controlled by the timing of zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is subsequently refined through a zzso with the zzso machinery in the zzso zzso In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the embryonic mechanisms that establish zzso identities during zzso zzso
