Networks of zzso express persistent spontaneous network activity when maintained in zzso zzso zzso blockade of the spontaneous activity with zzso zzso causes the eventual death of the zzso In this study, we investigated some molecular mechanisms that may zzso the zzso slow zzso of cortical zzso in zzso Already after zzso days of exposure to zzso well before the zzso die, they began to express markers that lead to their eventual death, zzso days zzso There was a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso a persistent increase in zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso and an increase in zzso breakdown zzso At this point, blockade of zzso zzso or zzso zzso with a selective zzso or through the natural regulator of zzso zzso protected cells from the toxic action of zzso zzso zzso lost their normal zzso shape as well as their membrane zzso Eventually, zzso activated zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso hallmarks of zzso zzso and zzso These experiments will lead to a better understanding of slow zzso death, typical of neurodegenerative zzso
