Over the past decade, investigators have attempted to establish the zzso mechanisms by which zzso injuries damage the zzso Several studies have implicated either membrane zzso or zzso channel dysfunction pursuant to zzso cell death as the primary mechanism of zzso We hypothesized that traumatic stimulation of zzso may be an important zzso contributor to mild zzso Brain zzso In order to study the effects of forces at the cellular level, we zzso two zzso in zzso systems to mimic traumatic injury to rat cortical zzso a high zzso stretcher and a magnetic zzso zzso In one system, we controlled focal zzso formation in zzso cultured on a zzso zzso loaded with an abrupt, one zzso zzso With the second system, we used magnetic tweezers to directly simulate the abrupt injury forces endured by a focal zzso on the zzso Both systems revealed variations in the rate and nature of zzso injury as a function of focal zzso density and direct zzso stimulation without membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not mitigate the injury yet the zzso of zzso immediately after injury reduced zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso may be a contributor to the diffuse zzso injury reported in mild zzso Brain zzso
