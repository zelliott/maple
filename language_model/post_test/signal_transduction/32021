Iron zzso zzso a complex set of responses in plants, including zzso and zzso changes, to increase iron zzso from zzso In zzso many zzso involved in the zzso and distribution of iron have been identified over the past zzso However, little is known about the signaling pathways and networks driving the various responses to low zzso Only the basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has been shown to control the expression of the root iron zzso machinery genes zzso and zzso Here, we characterize the biological role of two other zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso in iron zzso First direct zzso targets of zzso were determined in zzso We show that zzso and zzso do not regulate zzso target zzso suggesting that they play a zzso role with the two closely related zzso factors zzso and zzso that have been suggested to act in concert with zzso zzso and zzso play a crucial role in zzso responses, as zzso by their severe growth defects and iron zzso related zzso on zzso zzso To gain further insight into the biological role of zzso and zzso we performed zzso analysis using the corresponding double zzso and showed that zzso and zzso likely regulate genes involved in the distribution of iron within the zzso Altogether, this work establishes zzso and zzso as key regulators of zzso responses independent of the master regulator zzso and sheds light on new regulatory networks important for proper growth and development under low iron zzso
