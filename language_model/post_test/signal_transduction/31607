Although the role of the zzso beta zzso members in the regulation of zzso zzso has been extensively zzso their involvement in zzso zzso is not well zzso In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that zzso a member of the zzso beta zzso is involved in promoting zzso zzso as evidenced by the zzso 1) zzso of zzso and its type I zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso proteins in the zzso cells was only observed in zzso zzso zzso whereas they were present in zzso cells and zzso cells of healthy zzso zzso 2) addition of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by zzso infection induced zzso of otherwise healthy zzso zzso 3) zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso the function of zzso in the induction of zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or zzso increased zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso decreased zzso inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso expression at both zzso and protein level and zzso content, as well as triggered zzso release of death proteins zzso zzso and zzso c in the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso of zzso and thus rescued zzso cells from undergoing zzso In addition, whereas zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was significantly attenuated by forced expression of activated zzso and zzso rescued zzso cells from undergoing zzso via zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso plays an zzso role in the zzso where it zzso zzso cell zzso through zzso of zzso zzso of the key survival molecules zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of zzso death zzso
