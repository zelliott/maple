zzso of type I collagen zzso with zzso zzso causes differentiation and transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso enables cells to escape from the zzso of differentiation by zzso To clarify how the zzso interaction regulates these zzso changes, signaling pathways were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso A, destruction of focal zzso by zzso D, or zzso of zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso of zzso and the increase in alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, introduction of a zzso active zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity in the absence of collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by treatments that zzso zzso whereas the expression of zzso had no zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso interaction zzso differentiation and zzso zzso receptors via the zzso of zzso and its diverse downstream zzso These signaling pathways may play an important role in the sequential differentiation of zzso during bone zzso
