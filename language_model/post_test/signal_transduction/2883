In order to better understand the significance of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso signal zzso we investigated zzso signaling under conditions in which zzso zzso is zzso We demonstrate that human zzso zzso and zzso beta both induced zzso and zzso zzso at either 4, 14, or 37 degrees C in human skin zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation also occurred when zzso was inhibited by zzso the cells in zzso zzso While zzso was not required for the production of zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso B was strongly reduced when cells were zzso with zzso at low temperature or in zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso of zzso B by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso was also zzso These results suggest that low temperature and zzso two zzso of zzso zzso zzso do not affect the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso do inhibit a step zzso to zzso of the zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso B zzso
