The diverse biological effects of zzso zzso are zzso through a family of G protein coupled receptors of which 5 members have been recently identified by molecular zzso This review focuses on the molecular biology, zzso zzso and function of these receptors with particular emphasis on the human zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a family of 5 genes which map to separate zzso and which, with one exception, are zzso zzso gives rise to spliced zzso zzso and zzso zzso display weak selectivity for zzso binding whereas zzso is zzso zzso Based on structural similarity and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5 belong to a similar zzso zzso zzso and 4 react poorly with these zzso and belong to a separate zzso All 5 zzso are functionally coupled to zzso of zzso zzso via zzso toxin sensitive zzso binding zzso Some of the zzso are also coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso is widely expressed in brain and peripheral zzso and displays an overlapping but characteristic pattern that is zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso tumors express several zzso genes suggesting that multiple zzso zzso are zzso in the same zzso zzso studies indicate that the core zzso in zzso zzso zzso dock within a zzso binding pocket located in zzso zzso which is lined by zzso and charged zzso acid zzso
