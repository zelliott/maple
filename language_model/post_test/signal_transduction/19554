The crystal structures of zzso and zzso were determined using the zzso zzso pipeline of the Joint Center for zzso zzso zzso as part of the zzso zzso zzso Initiative zzso The structures revealed a zzso core with domain zzso and a superficial similarity of the zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso The conservation of the domain interface indicates a potential binding site that is likely to involve a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso analyses additionally supporting a role for this family in signal zzso possibly during zzso zzso
