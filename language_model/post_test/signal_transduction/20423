zzso A zzso zzso is responsible for a variety of changes in cell zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of UVA zzso on the zzso properties of human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso Furthermore, we examined the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso its action zzso The results of this study showed that UVA reduced the zzso potential and zzso of zzso as evidenced by reduced zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso factor zzso but not zzso was reduced by zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso for zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso suggesting that UVA reduces the zzso through zzso of zzso In addition, we examined the mechanisms underlying the zzso effects and found that UVA induced production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this effect was zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso The UVA effects were antagonized by zzso and the effects were found to be zzso by reduced production of zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings show for the first time that UVA regulates the zzso of zzso and its effects are zzso by zzso of zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso may be used as an zzso agent to mitigate the effects of zzso
