To investigate the zzso effect of zzso and its relationship with zzso signal zzso 

Changes of tension of rat zzso zzso rings were measured by zzso zzso signal collection system, and the activity of total zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso after being treated with zzso was determined with zzso acid zzso zzso 

zzso relaxed the zzso and zzso zzso induced contraction of zzso rings, either with or without intact zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso could zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso rings without intact zzso but it could not inhibit zzso of zzso on zzso rings with intact zzso This zzso action of zzso (40 zzso could be partial blocked by zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with the zzso range dropped to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso (40 zzso increased zzso activity zzso 

The zzso zzso effect of zzso might act by zzso the zzso zzso in vascular zzso
