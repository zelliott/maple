The zzso zzso zzso zzso family consists of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and three related receptors zzso zzso zzso Their intrinsic zzso zzso can be activated by zzso induced by numerous zzso or zzso zzso receptors are frequently zzso in breast cancer, and their zzso is associated with protection from zzso To directly assess their role in zzso sensitivity of breast cancer cells, we established zzso breast zzso cell lines zzso each zzso zzso alone or in all possible zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors was enough to activate them as judged by their zzso whereas zzso of other zzso receptors was necessary for the zzso of the zzso Surprisingly, zzso of the zzso receptors even when combined with treatment with their zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso failed to protect the zzso cells from cell death induced by either tumor necrosis factor zzso or serum zzso During zzso zzso however, increased the cell size of the zzso zzso cell line, and zzso increased that of all cell zzso In conclusion, our data does not support the role of zzso receptors in the regulation of cell death induced by zzso or serum zzso and the observed association in breast cancer may be due to other zzso zzso
