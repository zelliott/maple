zzso is the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is involved in many human zzso including multiple myeloma zzso Recently, multiple agents have been developed directed to interfere at different levels in zzso signaling zzso zzso are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of zzso zzso In this study, we wanted to determine the zzso effect of a novel zzso zzso in zzso 

We examined the effects of an zzso zzso on zzso zzso migration, zzso of zzso cells, and zzso in zzso Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the zzso on zzso zzso signaling by Western zzso 

We show that the zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso incorporation of zzso zzso cells via zzso of an zzso zzso growth loop and zzso incorporation in zzso zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso of zzso were completely and specifically blocked by the zzso Furthermore, the zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on bone zzso zzso alkaline zzso activity and the zzso of human zzso stem zzso Finally, we show that the zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso We also compared the zzso with zzso zzso zzso and revealed the similar or better zzso 

The zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell migration, zzso zzso and zzso and blocked the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso might represent a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of zzso and other zzso driven by zzso zzso
