zzso through the B cell zzso zzso zzso is required for peripheral B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In mature B cells, the zzso zzso normally consists of two zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the signals initiated from both zzso differ in zzso and intensity, in zzso the zzso of either zzso seems to be able to compensate for the loss of the other, reflected by the mild zzso of mice deficient for zzso or zzso Thus, it is still unclear why mature B cells need expression of zzso in addition to zzso In the present paper, we used the B cell line zzso and investigated the zzso zzso zzso in dependence of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso whether the signal initiated from zzso is modulated through zzso from zzso and vice zzso We clearly showed that zzso of zzso decreases the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and interpret this influence as a unilateral zzso zzso control on signals initiated at zzso
