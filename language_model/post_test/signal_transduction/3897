zzso proteins have been identified as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is involved in a range of biological activities including cell growth, zzso development and immune zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals from bone zzso zzso and zzso and zzso mediate zzso by zzso and zzso whereas zzso acts as a common zzso zzso For example, zzso is zzso by the zzso type I zzso upon zzso zzso forms a zzso with zzso and then zzso into the nucleus where it activates zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso in the zzso zzso is quite different in structure from the other zzso zzso and forms stable associations with type I zzso zzso interferes with the zzso of zzso and the subsequent zzso with zzso but does not inhibit the activity of zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso that is induced by the bone zzso protein type zzso zzso These data indicate that signals of the zzso zzso are regulated both positively and zzso by members of the zzso zzso
