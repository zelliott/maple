The zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso through its zzso domain zzso zzso zzso affecting cell migration, zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso can promote zzso zzso and directional cell migration in a zzso manner, through a new and specific interaction between an internal zzso domain coined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha v beta zzso zzso a zzso corresponding to this region zzso zzso zzso retains the ability to bind to alpha v beta 5, zzso zzso zzso and directing cell migration at a concentration as low as zzso zzso These effects are lost in cells not expressing zzso indicating that the zzso is required for zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso v beta zzso interaction enhances zzso zzso and cell migration induced by the well-established interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These results provide new insight into the function of zzso zzso individual zzso engage two different surface receptors zzso and alpha v beta 5 zzso thus initiating and zzso zzso signaling and zzso
