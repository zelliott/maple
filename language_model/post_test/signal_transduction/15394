A 3-year-old boy with right zzso zzso showed massive zzso in the zzso white matter and progressive zzso of the affected zzso zzso was successful in zzso of the patient's intractable zzso and a surgical zzso from the zzso focus was examined zzso zzso of cortical layers along with zzso appearance of zzso balloon cells in the zzso and white matter, zzso zzso in the superficial cortical layer and zzso white matter, zzso zzso in the white matter, and diffuse zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso positive balloon cells was occasionally observed in the area of zzso A diffuse increase was observed in the number of zzso zzso particularly in zzso and zzso zzso These cells were often located within the zzso zzso which implicates their participation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and numerous balloon cells, as well as in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso target of zzso zzso was expressed in a small percentage of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was rarely identified in zzso zzso These findings suggest that inflammatory processes have contributed to the zzso of progressive zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of expression of zzso cascade components is common to other reported cases of zzso but zzso expression in zzso has not been zzso The cellular mechanism and significance of zzso zzso of the zzso cascade in zzso particularly in the inflammatory cell zzso should be explored zzso
