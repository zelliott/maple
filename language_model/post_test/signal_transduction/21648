The novel ING zzso family proteins zzso have been discovered during the past decade and are recognized as the regulators of transcription, cell cycle zzso DNA repair, zzso cellular zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso ING proteins contain a few zzso zzso including plant zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and potential zzso regulatory domain, suggesting that the ING family proteins may share common biological zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso transcription, cell cycle control, and zzso possibly by modulating the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso have been shown to be involved in cellular stress responses such as zzso zzso repair and zzso after zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso also zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso expression was rapidly induced by zzso zzso at both zzso and protein zzso Using the stable clones of melanoma cells zzso zzso we showed that zzso of zzso significantly promoted zzso zzso Unlike its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was independent of functional zzso Furthermore, zzso did not affect the expression of zzso proteins but increased the zzso of Bid and zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso zzso down of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso plays an important role in cellular response to zzso zzso by enhancing zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso
