The signal zzso zzso linking zzso zzso of zzso zzso to an increase in frequency of zzso zzso was examined in zzso cultures of zzso vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a robust increase in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso 100 pm zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso and this effect was inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, the stimulation of zzso zzso by 100 pm zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely blocked by zzso (10 zzso a zzso family zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso recently identified as a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not its inactive zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by both zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not appear to be involved because 1) 100 pm zzso did not appreciably increase zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso and 2) zzso growth factor (10 zzso robustly zzso zzso zzso but did not induce zzso zzso Delayed zzso zzso channels may mediate the zzso activity because zzso channel protein zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso Our findings are consistent with a role for zzso and zzso of zzso channels in the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso
