zzso zzso is a potent zzso known to be involved mainly in zzso immune responses, and host defense against infection, although the exact signaling mechanisms by which it exerts its effects are not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation via a zzso pathway, and that stable expression of zzso a dominant negative zzso zzso completely blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso generation is selectively blocked by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso which is indicative of its dependence on zzso zzso and synthesis of zzso zzso zzso with those findings, zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, and transient zzso with zzso expressing zzso a zzso activated zzso zzso also zzso stimulates zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso are situated downstream of zzso and we conclude that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all play pivotal roles in zzso the zzso generation that appears to be a prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso
