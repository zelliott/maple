The zzso zzso zzso gene of tomato zzso resistance to the fungus zzso zzso expressing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso which codes for an zzso zzso Little is known about how such mechanisms work, but previous studies have shown that zzso recognition activates zzso zzso and protein zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that a new zzso zzso the zzso second zzso zzso acid zzso is produced within a few minutes of zzso zzso Using transgenic tobacco cells expressing the tomato zzso gene as a model system, zzso zzso pathways were studied by zzso the cells with zzso and zzso for the formation of zzso signals after challenge with the zzso zzso zzso A dramatic rapid response was an increase in zzso together with its zzso product zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the levels of PA and zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso manner, while the zzso zzso zzso did not trigger any zzso In general, PA zzso can be triggered by two different zzso via zzso D zzso which generates PA directly by zzso structural zzso like zzso zzso or via zzso which generates zzso zzso that is subsequently zzso to PA by zzso zzso zzso To determine the origin of the zzso PA formation, a zzso zzso zzso and a differential zzso protocol were zzso The results clearly demonstrated that most PA was produced via the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity, inhibited zzso PA zzso suggesting that the increase in zzso activity was because of increased zzso activity producing zzso Lastly, evidence is provided that zzso zzso and, in particular, PA production could play a role in triggering responses, such as the zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso burst, and when PA was added to cells, an zzso burst was zzso
