zzso hair graying is caused by irreversible defects in the zzso and/or development of zzso zzso stem cells in the hair zzso Kit signaling is an essential growth and differentiation signaling zzso for various cell lineages including zzso and its zzso effects have been shown in zzso zzso However, it is uncertain whether Kit signaling exerts a zzso effect for zzso In this study, we found that various zzso zzso of Kit facilitate zzso hair zzso In contrast, transgenic mice expressing the zzso for Kit zzso in the zzso have significantly reduced levels of zzso hair zzso The X-ray doses used did not show a systemic lethal effect, indicating that the in zzso zzso of Kit zzso is mainly caused by the damaged zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso stem cells seemed to take the fate of zzso pigmented zzso in the zzso regions of hair zzso in zzso zzso 3, another growth and differentiation factor for zzso showed a lesser zzso effect compared with zzso These results indicate the prevention of zzso hair graying by Kit zzso
