zzso have high zzso ability, which is dependent on zzso adult zzso stem cells called zzso Recently, zzso zzso signaling was shown to be required for zzso zzso and zzso signaling was shown to control zzso polarity via zzso of the zzso gene at the zzso end of zzso Thus, various signaling molecules play an important role in zzso stem cell zzso However, the molecular mechanisms directly involved in stem cell differentiation have remained zzso Here, we demonstrate that one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the differentiation of zzso cells from stem cells at the zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso zzso show a zzso zzso Thus, we speculated that zzso might be involved in zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso When we carefully examined the expression pattern of zzso by quantitative real-time zzso during zzso zzso we found two zzso of zzso expression: the first phase was detected in the differentiated cells in the old tissue in the early stage of zzso and then a second phase was observed in the cells derived from stem cells in the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is expressed in stem zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso only zzso the second zzso Thus, we propose that zzso might act to trigger the differentiation of cells expressing zzso from stem zzso
