Signal proteins are able to adapt their response to a change in the environment, governing in this way a broad variety of important cellular processes in living zzso While conventional zzso zzso techniques can be used to explore the early signaling zzso of these protein systems at zzso resolution, the high zzso costs limit their usefulness for the zzso of the zzso zzso dynamics of most signaling zzso occurring on experimental zzso To cope with the problem, we present in this paper a novel zzso method, based on a combination of the kinetic zzso and zzso and demonstrate its suitability for investigating the signaling behavior of the zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso recently employed to control the zzso of cancer cells through light zzso More specifically, we show that their signaling pathways begin with a residual zzso and subsequent zzso formation of zzso acids near to the zzso zzso causing a zzso between zzso and subsequent detachment of a peripheral zzso from the zzso In the case of the zzso system we find that this latter process zzso the release of the zzso from the zzso site of the zzso enabling signal zzso through zzso zzso These applications demonstrate that our approach reliably reproduces the signaling pathways of complex signal zzso ranging from zzso up to seconds at affordable zzso zzso
