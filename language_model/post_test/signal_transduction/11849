zzso and zzso in the brain play an important role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso A zzso is a major zzso protein produced locally in the brain and zzso with senile plaques in zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso plays a role in the development of zzso The viability of cultured primary zzso and zzso was measured by zzso cell cycle and zzso analysis was also zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with 1 zzso zzso for different periods of time zzso 4, 6, 12 zzso or treated with 1 zzso zzso with or without 15 zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted for zzso zzso zzso induced zzso changes of primary zzso but not zzso Interestingly, zzso increased the viability of zzso by zzso their zzso and reduced the viability of zzso by inducing zzso cell cycle zzso zzso treatment increased the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with higher potency in zzso than in zzso However, zzso induced more zzso zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso induced these zzso and zzso expression by zzso the zzso zzso in both zzso cells, but selectively activated the zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso can stimulate a different zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso regulates cell viability differently in these two zzso cells in part through the zzso zzso
