The zzso is the major degradation machinery of the cell that regulates multiple cellular processes as diverse as cell cycle, signal zzso and gene zzso zzso and unfolding of target proteins involves the regulatory cap whose base contains six zzso that display reverse zzso zzso One of them, zzso (also known as zzso has an essential role in gating the zzso central zzso We have isolated the zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso as a molecular interaction partner of zzso zzso plays a major role as zzso of zzso zzso in zzso prompting our interest in the zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso regulates zzso at the genetic and molecular zzso zzso of zzso by using zzso zzso interference zzso resulted in a specific stabilization of the zzso zzso but not in stabilization of the zzso domain of zzso or the zzso protein zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso interaction provides a novel mechanism of positive regulation of zzso zzso
