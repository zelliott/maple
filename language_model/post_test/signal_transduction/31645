In recent years, major advances in zzso measurement systems have included the introduction of zzso versions of traditional flow zzso that are now capable of measuring zzso network activity, the emergence of isotope labels that can enable the tracking of a greater variety of cell markers and the development of zzso zzso techniques that allow measurement of zzso expression in single living zzso These technologies will facilitate our capacity to catalog and bring order to the inherent diversity present in cancer cell zzso zzso these developments, new zzso approaches that mine deep data sets are zzso the zzso of the shape of the data and enabling the extraction of meaningful zzso These applications have the potential to reveal new insights into cancer biology at the zzso of stem cell function, zzso cells and zzso tumor zzso In the clinic, they may also prove important not only in the development of new diagnostic zzso but also in understanding how the emergence of tumor cell clones harboring different sets of zzso zzso patients to zzso or disease zzso
