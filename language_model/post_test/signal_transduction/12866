zzso causes a state of zzso resistance responsible for low circulating zzso zzso To investigate whether this resistance may result from zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, we determined the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso or fed male rats were injected with zzso rat zzso via the portal zzso Liver was removed 0 and 15 zzso after zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in all animals, this was severely blunted in zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso of the zzso zzso although observed in both zzso and fed rats after zzso injection, was markedly reduced in zzso zzso A rapid signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso was also induced in the liver of fed animals in response to zzso In contrast, in zzso rats only a slight zzso zzso signal was zzso The zzso effect of zzso on these zzso signaling molecules occurred without changes in their protein zzso Furthermore, the impairment of the zzso zzso in zzso animals was associated with increased liver zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso zzso Although zzso which are increased by zzso may cause zzso resistance, zzso failed to prevent zzso in the zzso zzso caused by zzso In conclusion, the zzso resistance induced by zzso is associated with impairment of the zzso signaling zzso This might contribute to the decrease in liver zzso production observed in zzso
