zzso of zzso signaling requires data on the zzso distribution of hydrogen zzso zzso within the zzso The fluorescent reporter zzso is a powerful instrument for zzso zzso However, rapid diffusion of zzso throughout the zzso compartment does not allow zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Here we dramatically improved the spatial resolution of zzso imaging by applying zzso targeting of zzso The zzso reporters identified zzso of elevated zzso levels within the zzso of the cells exposed to growth zzso We demonstrate that diffusion of zzso across the zzso was strongly zzso providing evidence that zzso acts locally inside zzso
