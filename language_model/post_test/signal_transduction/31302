zzso complex data sets that are generated from zzso experiments, create a need for systematic analysis techniques to unravel the underlying connectivity of gene regulatory zzso A modular approach, previously proposed by zzso and co-workers, helps to scale down the network complexity into more zzso manageable entities called zzso A functional module includes a zzso zzso promoter and resulting products, thus encompassing a large set of interacting zzso The essential elements of this approach are described in detail for a zzso model network and later extended to a zzso model network, demonstrating zzso The network architecture is identified by zzso in zzso zzso changes in the activities of only the module zzso zzso zzso that result from specific zzso applied to the network zzso one at a zzso These zzso changes form the system response zzso which is used to zzso the network connectivity or network interaction zzso By employing a known zzso network, the accuracy of the modular approach and its sensitivity to key assumptions are zzso
