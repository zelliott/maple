The receptors for zzso acid zzso and for 1 zzso D3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso members of the nuclear zzso zzso These receptors mediate their regulatory effects by binding as zzso complexes to response elements located in regulatory regions of hormone target zzso zzso scanning of the tumor necrosis zzso type 1 zzso zzso alpha zzso gene identified a 3' zzso region composed of two directly repeated zzso core motifs spaced by 2 zzso zzso On this novel zzso zzso but not on a zzso zzso response element, zzso was shown to act through its zzso the vitamin D zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso The repression appears to be zzso by competitive zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and possibly their zzso This zzso zzso of zzso signaling suggests a novel mechanism for the complex regulatory interaction between zzso and zzso
