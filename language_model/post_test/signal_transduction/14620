Bone zzso protein zzso signaling is critical for the development and patterning of the mouse zzso from the initial induction of zzso zzso to cell zzso in the anterior zzso We examined the regulation of zzso signaling during zzso development by analyzing zzso zzso for zzso a zzso 2 and 4 zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso in the underlying cartilage plate during cell zzso and in the adult anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have a variable zzso zzso which ranges from a zzso displaced zzso zzso to induction of secondary zzso zzso While cell zzso in the anterior zzso appears normal, patterning in the zzso zzso is zzso zzso activity is expanded resulting in zzso growth factor 10 repression and in a zzso shift in the boundary between the zzso and Sonic zzso expression zzso The expanded domain of zzso activity also results in additional zzso of oral zzso and can shift the position of zzso zzso or create secondary zzso zzso This work demonstrates the importance of attenuating the activity of zzso signaling during zzso induction in order to maintain the proper balance of signaling factors necessary for zzso zzso
