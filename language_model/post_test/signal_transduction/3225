Considering that zzso deposition is observed in zzso as well as in diabetic zzso we performed studies to clarify the roles of the zzso zzso and the active type of zzso factor X zzso zzso in the development of chronic kidney disease zzso using animal zzso Factor zzso activates various cell types through zzso zzso 2 zzso Several in zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso can mediate factor zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso processes proceed together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso through factor V expression in rat zzso zzso zzso a factor zzso zzso suppresses this type of zzso The factor zzso inhibitor zzso ameliorated zzso cellular zzso and zzso deposition in zzso zzso zzso of High zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso Another factor zzso zzso zzso suppressed urinary zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue growth factor zzso and zzso protein deposition together with zzso in diabetic zzso zzso Finally, in the model of zzso fibrosis, zzso treatment decreased the thickness of zzso zzso tissue and zzso In consideration of the results to potential human therapy, factor zzso regulation may be promising for the treatment of the zzso in zzso and of the early phase of diabetic zzso In the near future, novel factor zzso zzso with the characteristics of oral administration and zzso elimination may appear in the clinical use for treatment of cardiovascular zzso
