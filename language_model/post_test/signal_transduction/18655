The effects of different kinds of mechanical wounding on nicotine production in tobacco plants were zzso with sand or zzso culture under controlled zzso Both removal of the shoot zzso and damage of the youngest unfolded leaves zzso 1 and 2 by a zzso zzso with zzso zzso caused an increase in nicotine concentration in whole plants at day 3, and reached its highest level at day zzso The nicotine concentration induced by zzso of the shoot zzso was much higher than that induced by leaf zzso Both treatments also caused an increase in zzso acid zzso concentration within 90 zzso in the shoot, followed by an increase in the roots (210 zzso in which the zzso concentration induced by leaf wounding was significantly higher than that induced by zzso of the shoot zzso The increase in nicotine concentration occurred throughout the whole plant, especially in the shoot, while the increase in zzso concentration in the shoot was restricted to the damaged zzso and was not observed in the adjacent zzso zzso of the lateral buds that emerged after zzso of the shoot zzso caused a further increase in nicotine zzso in the plant zzso zzso of mature leaves, however, did not cause any changes in nicotine concentration in the plant, even though the degree of wounding in this case was comparable with that occurring with zzso zzso The results suggest that the nicotine production in tobacco plants was not correlated with the degree of wounding zzso or zzso but was highly dependent on the removal of zzso zzso and hence on the major sources of zzso in the zzso Furthermore, immediate application of zzso acid zzso on the cut surface after removing the shoot zzso completely inhibited the increase both in nicotine in whole plants and in zzso in the damaged stem segment and zzso Application of an zzso transport inhibitor around the stem directly under the shoot zzso of intact plants also caused an increase in nicotine concentration in the whole zzso The results strongly suggest that zzso serves as a negative signal to regulate nicotine synthesis in roots of tobacco zzso
