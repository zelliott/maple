Increased vascular zzso is a key feature of inflammatory zzso In severe infections, leakage of plasma from the zzso zzso a life-threatening zzso zzso zzso a major human bacterial zzso causes a toxic shock syndrome zzso characterized by excessive plasma leakage and zzso zzso Here we find that M zzso released from the zzso surface, forms complexes with zzso which by binding to zzso zzso of zzso activate these zzso As a result, zzso release zzso binding zzso an inflammatory zzso inducing vascular zzso In mice, injection of M protein or subcutaneous infection with zzso zzso causes severe pulmonary damage characterized by leakage of plasma and blood zzso These zzso were prevented by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso In addition, M zzso complexes were identified in tissue zzso from a patient with zzso zzso and zzso further underlining the zzso significance of such complexes in severe zzso zzso
