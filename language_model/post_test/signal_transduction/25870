A wide range of host cellular signal zzso pathways can be zzso by influenza virus zzso Some of these signal zzso pathways induce the host cell's innate immune response against influenza virus, while others are essential for efficient influenza virus zzso This review examines the cellular signaling induced by influenza virus infection in host cells, including host pattern recognition zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding effects on the host cell and/or virus, such as recognition of virus by the host cell, viral zzso and entry, viral zzso zzso export, translation control of cellular and viral zzso and zzso cell zzso Research into influenza zzso cell signaling promotes a clearer understanding of influenza zzso interactions and assists in the identification of novel zzso targets and zzso zzso
