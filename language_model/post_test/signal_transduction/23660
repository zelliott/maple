The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a hypersensitive cell death in pepper zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso cell death are not fully zzso Here, we identified pepper zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso which is early and strongly induced in incompatible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso complex was localized to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso zzso leaves specifically enhanced zzso cell death, accompanied by an zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso application strongly induced NO and zzso zzso ultimately leading to cell zzso zzso zzso in pepper leaves significantly compromised NO and zzso zzso and cell death zzso leading to the enhanced zzso zzso growth during zzso The levels of salicylic acid, zzso and zzso acid zzso and the expression of defense response genes during zzso zzso infection, were distinctly lower in zzso plants than those in the empty zzso control zzso zzso application significantly inhibited zzso zzso growth in zzso leaves and the empty zzso control zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso may act as a key defense and cell death regulator via mediation of zzso and zzso zzso
