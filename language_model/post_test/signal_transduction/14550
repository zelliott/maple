In the central nervous system, zzso can exert either protective or zzso zzso For example, testosterone protects zzso against zzso zzso whereas in other studies, testosterone exacerbated zzso zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this duality of zzso is still zzso Recently, our laboratory reported that zzso elicit opposite effects on the zzso and zzso signaling zzso depending on whether a membrane zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso By extension, we hypothesized that zzso may affect cell viability differently depending on which zzso is zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso protected primary cortical zzso from the zzso and zzso insult associated with zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso a cell zzso analog of zzso that zzso targets the membrane zzso suppressed zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity, and enhanced zzso zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso also blocked the protective effects of zzso and zzso zzso these data support the existence of two, potentially zzso pathways for zzso in a given cell or tissue that may provide insight into the controversy of whether zzso therapy is beneficial or zzso
