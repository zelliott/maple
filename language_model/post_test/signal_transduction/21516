Signaling through zzso zzso receptors has the potential to initiate several distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso or functional zzso Expansion and differentiation of zzso T cells is required for defense against foreign zzso whereas functional zzso termed zzso is a zzso mechanism that contributes to peripheral zzso Other mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include the zzso tolerance imposed by regulatory T cells and zzso zzso by zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso calcium levels as well as zzso additional signaling pathways that are further zzso by zzso zzso In this review, we argue that zzso programs of peripheral zzso and tolerance are imposed by sustained calcium signaling in zzso We address in particular the role of the zzso zzso factor nuclear factor for zzso of T cells, which is activated by zzso zzso stimulation and, depending on the presence or absence of input from its zzso partner, zzso zzso dictates two distinct zzso zzso zzso or zzso
