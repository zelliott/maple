Several physical phenomena accompany the firing of electrical impulses by zzso Some of these, such as the microscopic swelling of zzso alter the transmission of light through zzso This produces what are called zzso optical zzso because optical methods can be used to see zzso fire without adding zzso zzso or using electronic zzso These physical changes allow zzso zzso through zzso signals to adjacent cells, such as other zzso or zzso Two of the three videos in this zzso Resource show the optical manifestations of the microscopic swelling of zzso that accompanies the firing of action zzso in cultured zzso and one shows the zzso release of zzso that occurs through membrane channels that are zzso by zzso zzso
