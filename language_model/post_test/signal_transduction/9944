Signaling by zzso zzso zzso molecules is crucial for the correct allocation of cell fates and patterns of cell proliferation in humans and other organisms zzso zzso to zzso are universally zzso by regulating the activity and the zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso such that they induce target genes only in the presence of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the sole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partial zzso to zzso which zzso key zzso target genes zzso This processing requires zzso of full-length zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso as well as the activity of zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso which binds as part of an zzso zzso complex to a defined zzso motif to target proteins for zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso at the specific zzso zzso and zzso sites required in zzso for partial zzso stimulates binding to zzso in zzso Furthermore, a consensus zzso binding site from another protein can substitute for zzso zzso of zzso to direct conversion to zzso in zzso From this, we conclude that zzso binds directly to zzso zzso to initiate processing to zzso We also explore the zzso motifs in zzso that are recognized by zzso and provide some evidence that zzso of zzso by zzso may involve more than binding to zzso
