In the third zzso segment of zzso wing development is suppressed by the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in order to mediate zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling to specify zzso zzso Here we examine the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso regulated in wing and zzso zzso In wing discs, although zzso expression in zzso cells is dependent on zzso boundary function of zzso it maintains its expression by zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in zzso cells can bypass the requirement for zzso signaling from the zzso zzso zzso functions, at least, at two levels to repress zzso expression in zzso cells of zzso zzso At the zzso boundary, it functions downstream of zzso beta to enhance the degradation of zzso zzso which causes zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso but upstream of zzso zzso zzso of zzso at multiple levels appears to be crucial for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso discs is enough to override zzso function and cause zzso zzso zzso
