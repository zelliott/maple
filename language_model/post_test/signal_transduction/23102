Resistance against environmental stress is a crucial factor in determining the lifespan of zzso A central role zzso has been recently attributed to the transport and storage of lipids with the zzso family emerging as a potential key zzso Here we show that the zzso of one out of five functional zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso results in a reduced survival of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso subsequent to infection with the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso An active zzso pathway, including supply of cholesterol by zzso steroid zzso formation by the zzso zzso dependent zzso and zzso of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso in the presence of zzso bacteria was associated with reduced nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso and increased zzso zzso Taken together, the study provides functional evidence for a crucial role of zzso and the zzso zzso in determination of resistance against zzso
