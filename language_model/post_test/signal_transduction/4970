The central roles of zzso in cellular processes and diseases make them highly attractive as indicators of biological responses and as therapeutic zzso zzso zzso are emerging as an important means of characterizing zzso zzso Currently, the zzso tools used to perform zzso zzso analyses are not specifically tailored to the nature of the data, which zzso extraction of biological information and overall progress in the zzso We have developed a method for zzso analysis, which is implemented as a software pipeline in the R zzso zzso and parameters were chosen to address the technical and biological characteristics of zzso zzso We performed comparative analysis of zzso data sets that corresponded to stimulation of immune cells with zzso of zzso signaling zzso bovine zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The data sets for each of the treatments were analyzed with our methodology as well as with three other commonly used zzso The methods were evaluated on the basis of statistical confidence of calculated values with respect to technical and biological zzso and the statistical confidence zzso zzso by which the known signaling pathways could be independently identified by the zzso analysis of zzso (a Web-based resource for innate immunity interactions and zzso By considering the particular attributes of zzso data, we found that our approach identified more of the peptides involved in the pathways than did the other compared methods and that it did so at a much higher degree of statistical zzso
