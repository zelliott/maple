zzso zzso is an inhibitor of the zzso activity of DNA zzso II zzso zzso that does not stabilize zzso II zzso zzso Here, we examined zzso signaling by zzso in human zzso zzso cells and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso induced zzso cell death characterized by zzso DNA zzso nuclear zzso and induction of at least zzso and zzso zzso activities (but not zzso zzso Treatment of these cells with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was associated with transient induction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso However, zzso cells, which were zzso more sensitive than zzso cells to zzso due to a decrease in zzso II activity, exhibited zzso zzso in the absence of zzso induction and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso II by zzso leads to zzso through at least a zzso and zzso zzso mechanism and suggest that zzso and zzso are not required in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
