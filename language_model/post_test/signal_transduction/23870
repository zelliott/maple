A functional immune system requires the selection of T zzso expressing receptors that are major zzso complex restricted but tolerant to zzso This selection occurs predominantly in the zzso where zzso precursors first assemble a surface zzso In this review we zzso the current state of the field regarding the natural zzso and molecular factors required for positive and negative selection and discuss a model for how these disparate outcomes can be signaled via the same zzso We also discuss emerging data on the selection of regulatory T zzso Such cells require a zzso interaction with zzso yet differentiate into regulatory cells instead of being zzso
