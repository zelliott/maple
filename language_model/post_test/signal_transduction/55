To investigate the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso signaling in rat zzso zzso cells zzso induced by zzso 

The proliferation of primary rat zzso treated with different concentration of zzso was checked by zzso zzso zzso The expression and zzso of zzso and zzso was detected by western zzso zzso and zzso of collagen I were detected by the quantitative zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso in a zzso zzso At the concentration of zzso to zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the proliferation of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Type I collagen was significantly decreased 24 hours after zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso induced by zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso however, the expression of zzso was not regulated by zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso and proliferation of zzso and zzso the synthesis and zzso of Type I zzso possibly via the repression of the zzso signal zzso
