zzso growth factor zzso a member of the vascular zzso growth factor family of zzso factors, is prominently expressed by zzso In addition to its role as a zzso zzso factor within the zzso and zzso presence of its zzso zzso on zzso suggests that zzso also may have an zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso To zzso its role in zzso we examined the signal zzso and functional responses of primary human zzso to zzso zzso zzso induced specific zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso and zzso zzso in primary term zzso with little to no induction of the zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso induced significant zzso and zzso activity in human zzso vein zzso cells but did not induce zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathways protected zzso from growth factor zzso zzso but it did not protect zzso from zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso gamma and tumor necrosis factor zzso These results provide the first direct evidence of a zzso and functional role for zzso in normal zzso and suggest that zzso zzso expression during pregnancy may impact upon zzso function as well as zzso within the zzso zzso
