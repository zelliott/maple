We tested the hypothesis that the negative zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso would be diminished in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rabbit hearts and that this attenuated effect would be due either to decreased zzso zzso production or to reduced zzso 

Using isolated control and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso data zzso edge zzso were zzso zzso at baseline and after zzso zzso M, followed by zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso at zzso following zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso at baseline and zzso zzso zzso 

In control zzso zzso decreased percent zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate of relaxation zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These effects were attenuated by subsequent zzso zzso zzso failed to produce these negative functional effects in zzso zzso When zzso with zzso zzso had no negative functional effect in either normal and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were similar in control versus zzso zzso however, zzso produced a significant rise in zzso zzso level in control zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thus, zzso acted through the zzso zzso protein zzso in control zzso We conclude that in zzso cardiac zzso the decreased effect of zzso was because of decreased production of zzso zzso
