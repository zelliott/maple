zzso zzso signaling via its zzso zzso stimulates T cell zzso and gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso critically mediates zzso migration and prolonged zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in T zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which zzso or other G zzso receptors activate zzso has not been zzso Here we show that zzso stimulates the physical association of zzso and the T cell zzso zzso and zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso for signal zzso This zzso is responsible for several of the effects of zzso on T cells, including prolonged zzso zzso zzso activity, increased zzso calcium zzso zzso robust zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest new zzso for understanding the effects of zzso and other zzso on zzso
