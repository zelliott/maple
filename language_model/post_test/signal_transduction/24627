The effect of zzso action on nuclear zzso synthesis was investigated in isolated rat liver zzso An increased zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso was observed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a maximum response at zzso M concentration of zzso zzso experiments in isolated zzso following zzso treatment indicate that the observed increase in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is mainly due to a decrease in their rate of turnover possibly induced by a change in activity of zzso zzso In zzso zzso also reduces the activity of nuclear zzso C specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, this feature is strongly supported by the zzso decrease in nuclear zzso zzso Thus these data suggest that once zzso reaches the nucleus an zzso zzso is evoked through zzso zzso zzso
