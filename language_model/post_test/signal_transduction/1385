In the zzso portion of rat zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso of zzso evoked zzso release (up to 43 zzso zzso when zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso zzso zzso of zzso release was prevented by the zzso zzso MRS zzso enhanced by preventing zzso degradation with zzso abolished by the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and attenuated by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also zzso a zzso of zzso zzso an effect that was abolished by zzso zzso and attenuated by MRS zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso metabolism and by blockade of zzso and zzso receptors with zzso and zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso receptors are involved in a zzso of zzso release in the zzso portion of rat zzso zzso that can be activated by zzso formed by zzso zzso of zzso The receptors seem to be coupled to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso but zzso of the protein zzso C by protein zzso A, may also contribute to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
