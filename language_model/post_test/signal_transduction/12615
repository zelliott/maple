A combination of systemic zzso and tissue response to immune injury zzso zzso involvement in lupus zzso In this review, we discuss recent literature investigating zzso mechanisms of lupus zzso 

In lupus zzso zzso immune complexes were believed to be the primary zzso of zzso zzso Recent studies make it apparent that zzso of multiple zzso participate in the formation of immune complexes, deposited in the zzso Renal zzso by T cells, zzso and zzso cells have a dominant role in the progression of lupus zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso production and systemic zzso zzso However, zzso cell responses to immune injury influence disease zzso In addition, new insights on the zzso of zzso to zzso damage in lupus zzso have been zzso zzso zzso responses reflected in gene expression profiles during disease progression provide potential markers for diagnosis of lupus zzso progression and zzso In addition, studies of zzso responses provide new targets for therapeutic zzso 

Lupus zzso is a zzso of immune complex disease zzso by zzso of multiple zzso one of which is zzso zzso models of spontaneous systemic lupus zzso have been critical for understanding the underlying zzso Recent studies demonstrate that in addition to systemic zzso zzso responses, and zzso resistance to damage are also critical in determining disease zzso This understanding should influence design of novel therapeutic approaches in systemic lupus zzso
