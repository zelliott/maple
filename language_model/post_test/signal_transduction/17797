The mechanism controlling the development of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso is not well zzso Here we characterized a zzso zzso few zzso develops zzso zzso and zzso zzso but does not develop zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zinc finger zzso zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso embryonic zinc zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that zzso was not expressed in zzso or zzso zzso and instead controlled development of these zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso motif and the second zinc finger domain were necessary for zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a key component in regulating the development of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
