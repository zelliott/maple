Gap junctions consist of zzso channels dedicated to providing a direct zzso for zzso and zzso communication between zzso zzso After an initial burst of publications describing electrical zzso in the brain, gap junctions progressively became less fashionable among zzso as the consensus was that this form of synaptic transmission would play a minimal role in shaping zzso activity in higher zzso Several new findings over the last decade zzso the implication of zzso in genetic diseases of the nervous system, in processing sensory information and in zzso the activity of zzso zzso have brought gap junctions back into the zzso The appearance of gap zzso zzso in the nervous system is zzso zzso restricted to distinct cell types and persists after the establishment of chemical zzso thus suggesting that this form of zzso signaling may be functionally interrelated with, rather than alternative to chemical zzso This review focuses on gap junctions between zzso and summarizes the available data, derived from zzso zzso zzso and genetic approaches, that are contributing to a new appreciation of their role in brain zzso
