This review focuses on zzso bacterial interactions with zzso emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or zzso by zzso 

Since the discovery of type III and IV zzso progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host zzso has been extensive but largely focused on the zzso The remarkable growth of information about bacterial zzso of zzso metabolism has been summarized in several excellent zzso The scope of progress on zzso interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the agent of zzso zzso 

For many zzso contact with or zzso by zzso elicits a vigorous but varied microbial zzso The response repertoire includes zzso of type III and type IV zzso systems that inject zzso molecules into the host zzso zzso modify host cell signaling and zzso pathways to favor survival of the zzso Whereas microbial zzso structures are few in kind and relatively zzso zzso molecules are numerous and zzso zzso may promote zzso by zzso cells or suppress zzso by zzso and zzso They may suppress assembly or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for generating toxic zzso and they may suppress zzso zzso zzso bacteria may also zzso the expression of defensive proteins that zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso These zzso stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among zzso organisms, zzso versus zzso that arose early in zzso
