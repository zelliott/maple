zzso are the primary cell type responsible for synthesis and zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso A number of factors including growth factors, hormones and mechanical forces have been identified that zzso the production of zzso zzso by cardiac zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso also impact zzso of the zzso Recent studies have illustrated that zzso promotes a zzso response in cardiac zzso however the effects of this zzso on other aspects of zzso function have not been zzso While zzso have long been known for their role in production and zzso of the zzso zzso other functions of these cells are only now beginning to be zzso We zzso that exposure to zzso will stimulate other aspects of zzso behavior important in zzso zzso including zzso migration and collagen zzso zzso were isolated from adult male rat hearts and zzso performed to determine the effects of zzso on zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in increased production of zzso zzso components and zzso or contraction of three-dimensional collagen scaffolds by these zzso Furthermore, exposure to zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso Treatment of heart zzso with zzso resulted in the rapid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies with pharmacological zzso illustrated that zzso of these pathways is critical to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These studies illustrate that zzso plays a role in zzso of cardiac zzso function and may be an important component of the zzso cascade during pathological zzso zzso
