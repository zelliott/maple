zzso coli is a versatile zzso for the production of zzso zzso Often, however, the zzso protein does not reach its native, biologically active zzso within the bacterial cell but deposits as inclusion zzso The zzso zzso a group of zzso omnipresent in all zzso of life, form a network to assist proper folding of cellular zzso prevent their deposition and can even zzso deposits of zzso proteins formed during environmental stress conditions such as excessive zzso zzso of individual zzso with the target protein can also reduce deposition of the zzso protein into inclusion zzso The selection of the suitable zzso however, is still a zzso zzso The wrong zzso will not lead to success, or may even zzso effect product stability or host zzso Recent progress in understanding the mechanisms and zzso zzso of the major zzso and their roles in the zzso network now gives some hints for a more rational choice of zzso for zzso Also, more specialized zzso systems may become an alternative for application in the production of zzso zzso
