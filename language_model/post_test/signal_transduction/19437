zzso exerts multiple biological effects on zzso cells by regulating many downstream zzso including smooth zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of smooth zzso gene expression remain zzso In this study, we have shown that serum response factor zzso a common zzso factor important in cell zzso migration, and zzso is targeted by zzso in a zzso zzso We show that the molecular mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso is via zzso of the zzso L system, which triggers zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso As a result, decreased zzso expression reduces expression of zzso target genes such as smooth muscle zzso and smooth muscle zzso heavy zzso Additionally, zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso binding in both smooth muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreasing smooth muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal that zzso is a novel zzso gene and further zzso the molecular zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its target zzso
