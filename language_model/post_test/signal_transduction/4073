zzso has long been implicated in nocturnal phase adjustment of zzso zzso yet the subject remains zzso Although the zzso nucleus zzso site of the zzso clock, contains no intrinsic zzso zzso it receives zzso zzso projections from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that contribute to sleep and zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso of zzso rats in a zzso brain slice is sensitive to zzso phase adjustment via zzso receptors zzso only at zzso We used this paradigm to probe the zzso signal zzso mechanism and the zzso gating nocturnal zzso The zzso zzso zzso altered the zzso rhythm of zzso zzso activity in a pattern closely resembling that for zzso of zzso nocturnal gating of clock sensitivity of each is preserved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso key elements in the zzso signal zzso zzso blocked phase shifts induced by zzso Further, zzso administration to the zzso at night increased zzso production and zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso was blocked both by zzso an zzso zzso and by zzso a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso regulation of the zzso is zzso via zzso zzso nocturnal gating of this zzso is controlled by the zzso clock, and zzso a gating site is positioned downstream from zzso This study is among the first to identify a functional context for zzso zzso in the zzso
