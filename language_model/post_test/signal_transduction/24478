Many zzso zzso including zzso are zzso to the zzso effects of transforming growth factor zzso zzso In some zzso zzso resistance has been linked to zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso however, in zzso cancer, the mechanism of resistance remains zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cultures were used as a model system to determine the mechanisms of zzso zzso To simulate in zzso responses to zzso primary cultures derived from normal human zzso surface zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso were grown on collagen I zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso When treated with 5 zzso zzso for 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation was inhibited by 20 zzso zzso on zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso 10) proliferation was zzso 5 zzso zzso in response to zzso (a statistically significant difference in response when compared with zzso P zzso zzso To dissect the zzso signaling zzso we used a quantitative zzso protection zzso zzso for measuring zzso levels of zzso zzso components in 20 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso receptors I and II, downstream signaling components zzso 3, 4, 6, 7, and the zzso zzso Ski and zzso did not show a statistically significant difference between zzso and zzso and cannot explain their differential zzso to zzso cell cycle zzso To assess functional differences of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso we measured zzso and 3/4 complex induction after zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed equivalent zzso and 3/4 complex induction after zzso exposure for 0, zzso 2, and 4 zzso It has been proposed that zzso and Ski are zzso of the zzso zzso and undergo zzso degradation followed by zzso of zzso zzso However, our data show equivalent zzso degradation in zzso and zzso and equivalent zzso zzso induction after zzso zzso zzso zzso Ski degradation was not observed in zzso or zzso suggesting that Ski may not function as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These data implied that the zzso zzso remains functional in zzso although zzso cells are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso coincided with the loss of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling is blocked downstream of zzso complex formation or that an alternate signaling zzso other than zzso may transmit zzso cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso
