With the recent progress in surgical treatment zzso human brain tissue from patients with intractable focal zzso will increasingly become available for studies on the molecular pathology, zzso changes and zzso of human focal zzso An inherent problem for studies on human zzso lobe zzso zzso is the lack of suitable zzso Strategies to alleviate this obstacle include the use of human post zzso samples, zzso from experimental animals and, in particular, the comparative analysis of surgical specimens from patients with zzso horn sclerosis zzso and with focal zzso zzso but zzso preserved zzso zzso In this review we focus on selected aspects of the molecular zzso of zzso zzso the potential impact of zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso as potential regulator of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The diverse and complex changes described so far in human zzso specimens require a systematic interdisciplinary approach to distinguish primary, zzso zzso and secondary, zzso mechanisms in the zzso of human zzso lobe zzso
