zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso behavior, proliferation and zzso occurs through gap zzso zzso expression of zzso may play a role in the development of zzso zzso 

We estimated zzso 26 zzso zzso in zzso patients and investigated whether the standard therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso exert their zzso activity partially through altering zzso zzso zzso We also detected zzso in skin zzso by zzso zzso measured zzso zzso levels in 24 chronic plaque psoriasis zzso Group A received intramuscular zzso and group B was treated by zzso for ten weeks, each followed by measurement of zzso zzso levels and zzso Twelve healthy volunteers served as zzso 

zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in the patients before treatment than in controls zzso Post treatment levels were significantly lower than zzso levels zzso however, significantly higher than in controls zzso zzso and zzso caused significant reductions in zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Post treatment levels were slightly significantly lower in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso The reduction in zzso zzso expression was significantly positively correlated with the clinical improvement of the zzso plaque zzso zzso of zzso decreased after zzso 

zzso expression of the gap junction protein zzso may have a role in the development of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly lowered the expression of zzso zzso and zzso
