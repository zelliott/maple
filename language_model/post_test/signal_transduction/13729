DNA double strand breaks zzso constitute one of the most dangerous forms of DNA zzso In actively replicating cells, these breaks are first recognized by specialized proteins that initiate a signal zzso cascade that zzso the cell cycle and results in the repair of the breaks by zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in response to double strand breaks involves zzso and zzso of zzso and a variety of associated zzso Here we review the emerging structural principles that zzso how zzso protein modifications control protein signaling that emanates from these DNA zzso
