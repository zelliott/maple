The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a critical role in the generation of signals in response to stress zzso but its role in zzso zzso signaling and its potential regulatory role in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are not zzso In the present study, we provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso and activated during treatment of cells with Type I zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the Type I zzso zzso of zzso regulates induction of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly suggesting the existence of an zzso signaling cascade activated downstream of the zzso zzso The engagement of this zzso in zzso signaling plays a critical role in zzso zzso regulation, as evidenced by the fact that zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso gene zzso via zzso response zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso blocks zzso gene zzso without zzso DNA binding or zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso acts in cooperation with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso signaling cascade is activated by the Type I zzso zzso and plays a critical role in zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso
