zzso recognition triggers the recruitment of the critical zzso protein zzso to small zzso clusters zzso by the zzso zzso zzso These structures develop zzso in parallel with zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and are likely to contribute to zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that these zzso clusters segregate from the zzso and move towards the center of the contact zzso Neither the function of these clusters nor the structural requirements governing their persistence have been examined zzso Here we demonstrate that defects in cluster assembly and persistence are associated with defects in zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso persist normally in the absence of zzso zzso indicating that in the absence of a critical zzso these structures are insufficient to drive zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the critical zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in persistent zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that multiple zzso within each of these proteins contribute to cluster zzso These data indicate that zzso cooperative interactions stabilize these persistent signaling zzso which may zzso to the functional complexes predicted by kinetic zzso models of zzso zzso
