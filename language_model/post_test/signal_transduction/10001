The regulator of zzso signaling zzso zzso recently identified in zzso zzso zzso named as zzso has a predicted zzso structure as well as an zzso box with zzso activity and thus zzso the zzso zzso The roles of zzso proteins in zzso seed zzso and their possible interactions with zzso and zzso acid zzso were investigated in this zzso Using seeds that carry a zzso zzso in the genes zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso of the G protein in zzso (named zzso and zzso respectively), our genetic evidence proved the involvement of the zzso protein in the zzso of seed zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found not to be required and the zzso process had no effect on the zzso seed zzso In addition, zzso seed zzso was insensitive to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso were not due to a possible zzso stress because the zzso of zzso zzso seeds showed the same response as those of zzso zzso and wild type when treated with the same zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso seed zzso was hypersensitive while zzso was less sensitive to zzso zzso The different responses to zzso largely diminished and the zzso effects on seed zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were markedly alleviated when zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso responses of seed zzso to both zzso and zzso were also observed in the zzso of zzso Analysis of the active zzso zzso levels and the expression of zzso and zzso genes showed that zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso and increased the expression of zzso and zzso genes in zzso Columbia seeds, but not in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso proteins are involved in the regulation of seed zzso The zzso of zzso zzso seed zzso to zzso might be the result of the impairment of zzso zzso during seed zzso
