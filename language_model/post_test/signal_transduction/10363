Liver zzso represents a significant health problem worldwide of which no acceptable therapy zzso The most characteristic feature of liver zzso is excess deposition of type I zzso A great deal of research has been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of liver zzso The activated zzso zzso cell zzso is the primary cell type responsible for the excess production of zzso Following a zzso zzso zzso change from a zzso to an zzso zzso zzso Numerous changes in gene expression are associated with zzso zzso including the induction of several zzso signaling zzso which help maintain the activated zzso and control the zzso and zzso state of the zzso zzso analyses in understanding the molecular basis of collagen gene regulation have revealed a complex process offering the opportunity for multiple potential therapeutic zzso However, further research is still needed to gain a better understanding of zzso zzso and how this cell maintains its zzso zzso In this review we describe many of the molecular events that occur following zzso zzso and collagen gene regulation that contribute to the zzso nature of these cells and provide a review of therapeutic strategies to treat this zzso
