Each zzso of the zzso zzso is required to selectively allow transit of newly zzso zzso and plasma membrane proteins and also to maintain a unique set of resident proteins that define its structural and functional zzso In the case of the zzso zzso zzso residency is achieved in two ways: zzso prevention of residents from entering newly forming transport zzso and zzso retrieval of those residents that zzso The latter mechanism is directed by discrete retrieval zzso zzso proteins have a zzso sequence at their zzso membrane proteins have a zzso zzso either zzso or zzso located close to the zzso of their zzso zzso Recently it was found that zzso motifs bind the complex of zzso coat zzso zzso I, and that this interaction functions in the retrieval of proteins from the zzso to the zzso Also discussed are the potential roles this interaction may have in zzso zzso
