zzso is a member of the class II zzso zzso family, and it associates with zzso to form a functional zzso complex, zzso This zzso complex zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoting zzso and zzso activities similar to those of type I zzso In an effort to further understand signal zzso through zzso we used zzso analysis and identified a tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso motif in the zzso domain of zzso In subsequent zzso and zzso pull-down zzso zzso was shown to zzso with zzso and was pulled down by zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction implies that these proteins really interact in the zzso This interaction was zzso upon zzso of the zzso motif in zzso Furthermore, the interaction between zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso likely due to a reduction in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso with zzso significantly increased the stability of zzso thereby zzso its zzso and enhancing its zzso level in cultured zzso
