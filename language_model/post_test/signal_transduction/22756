A complex zzso from bovine zzso body with a strong zzso activity has been recently isolated to zzso by our zzso In this work, a sequential analysis of its zzso signaling zzso has been undertaken to characterize the zzso mechanisms responsible for the zzso zzso The results show that this zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso of around zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso stores, with no participation of zzso zzso Upon repeated administration, it shows no signs of zzso zzso does not induce zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso but is zzso by the previous administration of zzso The zzso activity requires a membrane zzso is blocked after zzso of the cells with zzso toxin and zzso zzso as well as by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and zzso (which zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon administration of this zzso the zzso levels of zzso acid zzso rise with a time course that parallels that of the zzso zzso suggesting that PA could be responsible for this zzso zzso Exposure to zzso (a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso does not modify the zzso rise, ruling out the possibility that the PA generated could be further converted to zzso by the action of zzso zzso Based on the experimental data zzso a signaling zzso involving a zzso zzso C coupled to zzso zzso is zzso This compound may represent a new class of zzso lipids with a putative role in the physiology of the zzso zzso
