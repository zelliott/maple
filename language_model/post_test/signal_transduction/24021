Although zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso zzso it has remained unclear whether other members of the zzso family are involved in zzso We examined zzso function in both zzso and zzso zzso by using zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso or zzso did not effectively induce zzso differentiation from zzso zzso cells derived from these mice into mature zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was apparently observed in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso hormone zzso zzso model, calcium concentration peaked at day 3 after zzso However, in zzso mice, this peak was delayed and found at day 5, showing less effective zzso zzso Thus, we have provided the first evidence showing that zzso is involved in zzso
