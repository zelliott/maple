This overview focuses on the zzso mimic of zzso zzso and its application to the study of zzso signal zzso of great interest to drug zzso The most versatile modes of access to these chemical biological tools are discussed, organized by method of zzso bond zzso The zzso mimic may be zzso incorporated into peptides zzso and proteins zzso protein zzso This zzso zzso zzso mimic results in a zzso zzso zzso and is seen to support native zzso interactions that depend on zzso zzso Signal zzso pathways studied with this chemical biological approach include the regulation of zzso tumor zzso protein activity and of zzso zzso Given these successes, the future is bright for the use of such zzso zzso acid zzso to map zzso signaling zzso
