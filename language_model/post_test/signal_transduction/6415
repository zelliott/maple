Various physical, social, and biological systems generate complex fluctuations with correlations across multiple time zzso In zzso systems, these long-range correlations are altered with disease and zzso Such correlated fluctuations in living systems have been attributed to the interaction of multiple control zzso however, the mechanisms underlying this behavior remain zzso Here, we show that a number of distinct classes of zzso behaviors, including correlated fluctuations characterized by zzso zzso of their power zzso can emerge in networks of simple signaling zzso We found that, under general conditions, complex dynamics can be generated by systems fulfilling the following two requirements, zzso a zzso zzso and zzso the presence of zzso Our findings support two notable zzso First, complex zzso signals can be modeled with a minimal set of zzso and second, systems fulfilling conditions i and zzso are robust to some degree of degradation zzso they will still be able to generate zzso zzso
