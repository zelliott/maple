Small zzso of the Ras family are major players of signal zzso in zzso zzso They receive signals from a number of receptors and transmit them to a variety of zzso The distribution of signals to different zzso molecules allows for the generation of opposing effects like proliferation and zzso To understand the specificity of Ras zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso one of the Ras zzso proteins with zzso exchange factor activity for zzso We determined the zzso level on zzso and showed that the highly zzso Ras binding domain zzso of zzso which mediates association with zzso is important but not sufficient to explain the stimulation of the exchange zzso Although a point zzso in the zzso of zzso which abrogates binding to zzso renders zzso independent to activated zzso an artificially zzso version of zzso lacking its zzso could still be activated by zzso The switch II region of Ras is involved in the zzso because the zzso zzso in this region is impaired in the zzso zzso Furthermore, it is shown that zzso which was originally identified as a Ras zzso can block zzso zzso signaling only when zzso contains an intact zzso In addition, kinetic studies of the complex formation between zzso and Ras suggest that the fast association between zzso and zzso which is analogous to the zzso case, achieves signaling zzso zzso the Ras zzso zzso complex has a short lifetime of zzso s and zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso possibly explaining its zzso effect on zzso
