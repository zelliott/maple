Solar zzso zzso is the zzso factor for the increasing zzso of human skin zzso The zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be responsible for the tumor promoter action of zzso light in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso inhibitor I zzso I) and II zzso zzso from potato zzso when applied to mouse zzso zzso cells, block zzso zzso zzso The zzso appears to be specific for zzso signal zzso for zzso zzso because these zzso did not block zzso zzso zzso nor did they exhibit any significant influence on zzso growth zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso activity occurs through a zzso that is independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Considering the important role of zzso in tumor promotion, it is possible that blocking zzso zzso activity by zzso I or zzso II may be functionally linked to zzso cell zzso
