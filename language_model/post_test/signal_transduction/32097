We sought to determine whether zzso of the zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso was associated with improved response to zzso chemotherapy in breast zzso 

An zzso signature was used to analyze the association between zzso status and zzso complete response in gene expression zzso encompassing three different zzso zzso Parallel zzso analysis of the RB zzso was conducted on zzso zzso to determine the association with zzso response to zzso zzso 

An zzso gene expression signature was associated with increased zzso complete response in zzso from breast cancer patients treated with zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy encompassing approximately 1,000 zzso The association with improved response to zzso chemotherapy was true in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso expression of zzso is associated with the zzso signature (R zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were strongly associated with zzso complete response in the same zzso zzso In an independent zzso zzso analyses of RB and zzso revealed an association of RB loss zzso zzso zzso or elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso complete zzso In addition, by zzso and zzso scoring zzso zzso tumors experienced an overall improved response to zzso zzso 

zzso of the RB zzso as measured by several independent methods was associated with improved response to zzso zzso The zzso status was relevant for zzso response in both zzso and zzso breast cancer with similar results observed with multiple chemotherapy zzso zzso these data indicate that RB status is associated with the response to zzso chemotherapy in breast cancer and could be used to inform zzso
