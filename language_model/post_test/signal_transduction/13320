In this work, the role of zzso acid zzso in leaf zzso is zzso zzso application of zzso caused premature zzso in attached and detached leaves in zzso zzso but failed to induce precocious zzso of zzso zzso zzso plants, suggesting that the zzso zzso is required for zzso to promote leaf zzso zzso levels in zzso leaves are zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso with the increase in zzso level in zzso leaves, genes zzso the zzso that catalyze most of the reactions of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso activated during leaf zzso in zzso except for zzso oxide zzso which is zzso and highly expressed throughout leaf zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso expression is greatly increased but zzso 2 zzso expression is sharply reduced during leaf zzso Similarly, zzso zzso oxide zzso 1), zzso and zzso are all zzso whereas zzso is zzso with the progression of leaf zzso The transcript levels of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 3 also increase in zzso leaves, as does zzso zzso a zzso for zzso This represents the first report, to our knowledge, of an increase in zzso levels and expression of zzso genes during leaf zzso and indicates that zzso may play a role in the zzso zzso
