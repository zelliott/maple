zzso the molecular zzso of prostate cancer zzso progression is paramount for broadening current diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Current interest in the role of zzso zzso signaling in prostate zzso was generated with the finding of zzso zzso and corresponding nuclear zzso in primary zzso The recent finding of zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso function potentially ties zzso to key regulatory steps of prostate cell growth, zzso and zzso By zzso analysis of zzso tumors, we detected nuclear zzso in zzso of lethal zzso cases, suggesting a more common role for zzso in advanced disease than would be predicted by its zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso nuclear zzso was found to occur zzso with zzso regrowth of normal rat zzso These in zzso observations likely zzso zzso involvement in both normal and zzso prostate zzso thus prompting our interest in further characterizing modes of zzso signaling in prostate zzso zzso our previous findings, we demonstrate that transient zzso zzso stimulates T cell factor zzso signaling in most zzso cell zzso Further, this activity is not subject to zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso often zzso in zzso upon zzso zzso zzso with a previous report, we observed that transient zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso off two natural target gene zzso However, we were unable to zzso zzso stimulation of zzso expressed zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that other zzso factors are required for this zzso Although zzso cells are capable of this mode of zzso zzso stable expression of zzso zzso did not alter their zzso response to zzso In total, our characterization of zzso signaling in zzso reveals the complex nature of its activity in prostate zzso indicating that zzso potentially contributes to multiple zzso zzso required for disease zzso
