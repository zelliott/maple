This study describes a novel path to the zzso of smooth muscle cells zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human vascular zzso zzso express only scant amounts of zzso and so do not respond to stimulation with this zzso We show that zzso also do not zzso express appreciable levels of zzso which would render them sensitive to zzso by the zzso zzso Because zzso is generally believed not to be subject to regulation, zzso would thus appear not to qualify as targets for the zzso zzso However, we report that treatment of zzso with zzso provokes marked zzso of zzso zzso and surface protein zzso This is accompanied by zzso of zzso by the cells, so that an zzso stimulation loop is zzso In the wake of this self-sustaining system, there is a selective induction and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and marked cell zzso The study identifies zzso as the first example of cells in which zzso expression is subject to substantive zzso and discovers a novel amplification loop involving zzso and its soluble zzso that drives zzso into a zzso zzso
