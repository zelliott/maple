Signaling pathways depend on regulatory zzso zzso controlling these interactions in cells has important applications for zzso biological zzso As many regulatory proteins are zzso considerable progress in engineering signaling circuits has been made by zzso commonly occurring zzso Our ability to predictably engineer cellular functions, however, is constrained by complex zzso observed in naturally occurring zzso Here we demonstrate a strategy for improving and simplifying protein network zzso using zzso design to create zzso zzso zzso zzso We validated the design of the interface between a key signaling zzso the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and by solving the crystal structure of the engineered zzso The designed zzso zzso is activated exclusively by its engineered zzso partner zzso but maintains the ability to interface with other zzso signaling circuit components in zzso In zzso cells, zzso activity can be regulated by zzso but not zzso zzso showing that the designed interaction can trigger complex zzso zzso design of protein zzso thus promises to provide specific components that facilitate the predictable engineering of cellular zzso
