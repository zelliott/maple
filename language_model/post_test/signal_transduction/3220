Growth and differentiation factor 5 zzso a member of the bone zzso protein zzso family, is essential for cartilage, bone, and joint zzso zzso such as zzso counteract zzso signaling by covering the zzso zzso type I zzso and type II zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso The zzso zzso is located within the zzso interaction site, the so-called zzso zzso and was identified in patients suffering from multiple zzso syndrome zzso zzso is characterized by progressive zzso zzso zzso deafness and mild facial zzso Here we present a novel molecular mechanism of a zzso zzso affecting zzso and zzso zzso exhibits impaired binding to zzso causing alleviated zzso and zzso signaling and reduced zzso differentiation of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso in mouse zzso cultures was strongly enhanced by zzso By using quantitative techniques zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso zzso we uncovered that this gain of function is caused by strongly reduced affinity of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and the consequential lack of zzso zzso Thus, since zzso is zzso during zzso zzso zzso exceeds the zzso action, which results in the zzso outcome of zzso The detailed molecular characterization of zzso as a zzso growth factor illustrates the potential of zzso zzso in applications with defined zzso zzso
