zzso presence in the male zzso system has been known for over 60 years, but its potential function in the zzso remains an important area of zzso zzso is zzso by germ cells, producing a relatively high concentration in zzso zzso zzso There are two zzso receptors zzso the presence of which in the head of the zzso is well documented and consistent between zzso however, in other regions of the zzso their expression appears to be zzso species, and cell zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the zzso however, its presence is zzso by high doses of estrogen, making the design of experiments complicated, as the zzso of the zzso mouse does not resemble that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso models further demonstrate the complexity and importance of both signaling pathways in maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso Data now reveal the presence of not only classical nuclear zzso but also zzso zzso and rapid responding membrane zzso however, their importance in the zzso remains zzso zzso regulates zzso transport and water zzso in the zzso ducts and zzso and its regulation of other associated genes is continually being zzso In the male, some zzso such as zzso and zzso contain both zzso and zzso response elements and are zzso regulated by these zzso While zzso pathways are a necessity for fertility in the male, future studies are needed to understand the interplay between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso particularly in cell types that contain both receptors and their zzso
