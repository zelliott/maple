As a first step towards developing a genetic system for investigating signaling processes in plants, we have developed a screen for signaling zzso deficient in a wound zzso We have isolated two zzso of tomato that lack zzso production of zzso zzso induced zzso in leaves by zzso The zzso are deficient in the induction of both zzso zzso I and zzso zzso II but can be induced to respond at near zzso levels by zzso zzso a known zzso of inhibitor production in zzso While completely deficient in systemic production of zzso zzso both zzso produce some zzso inhibitor in wounded zzso This evidence suggests the existence of two signaling zzso one local and one zzso that regulate the induction of zzso inhibitor synthesis in response to zzso
