The derivation of stable zzso zzso stem zzso cell lines from zzso and early zzso mouse zzso has been reported zzso zzso and its zzso zzso have been identified as embryonic signaling factors responsible for the maintenance of the zzso state of zzso zzso zzso Here we report the derivation of stable zzso cell lines from the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are similar to zzso zzso cells with respect to their zzso zzso factor gene expression and differentiation in zzso into derivatives of the zzso zzso and with respect to their ability to invade and zzso host zzso forming zzso zzso after subcutaneous injection into nude zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells carry an inactive paternal X zzso indicating that they have undergone imprinted X zzso which is characteristic of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that an alternative signaling zzso may be responsible for the establishment and stable proliferation of zzso zzso zzso
