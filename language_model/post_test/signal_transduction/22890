The yellow mouse obesity syndrome is due to dominant zzso at the zzso zzso which is characterized by zzso zzso insulin resistance, zzso zzso increased linear growth, and yellow coat zzso This syndrome is caused by zzso expression of zzso in multiple zzso zzso of zzso action in obesity seem to zzso at least in part, competitive zzso zzso Both central and peripheral effects have been implicated in zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been described zzso It has been shown to be expressed in mice zzso and to act similarly to zzso as a potent zzso to central zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso become zzso and develop zzso zzso that zzso may lead to obesity by interfering with zzso signaling in the brain and consequently regulating food zzso Furthermore, food intake is inhibited by zzso injection of a potent zzso zzso and was reversed by administration of an zzso zzso The direct cellular actions of zzso include stimulation of fatty acid and zzso synthesis via a zzso zzso zzso and insulin act in an additive manner to increase zzso This additive effect of zzso and insulin is demonstrated by the necessity of insulin in zzso weight gain in transgenic mice expressing zzso specifically in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso expression in zzso tissue combined with zzso may lead to increased zzso The roles of zzso receptors or zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso metabolism and other peripheral effects remain to be zzso In conclusion, both central and peripheral actions of zzso contribute to the yellow mouse obesity syndrome and this action is zzso at least in part by antagonism with zzso receptors and/or regulation of zzso zzso
