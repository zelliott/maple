The effect of ethanol on zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor cells was investigated using single-channel recordings and focusing on zzso signal zzso In zzso patches, ethanol caused a transient zzso increase of zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso per zzso ethanol significantly increased mean channel open time and channel open probability by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso single-channel current zzso was not affected by zzso The zzso effect of ethanol was blocked in the presence of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor as well as by zzso zzso a zzso zzso but not by the zzso C blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid promoted the ethanol zzso The blocking effect was released at higher zzso of ethanol zzso zzso suggesting a second site of action or a competition between zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the effect of ethanol on zzso is zzso by zzso stimulation and zzso of the channels which increases channel activity and hence may influence action zzso duration and hormone zzso
