zzso growth restriction zzso is a risk factor for impairment of lung function in adolescence and zzso zzso and zzso processes linking zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as an underlying mechanism have not been addressed so zzso zzso in this study, we aimed to investigate the zzso regulation of inflammatory and zzso processes in the lung subsequent to zzso zzso was induced in rats by zzso protein restriction during zzso Lung function was assessed with direct zzso at zzso day zzso 28 and zzso zzso were obtained at zzso zzso and zzso for assessment of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both respiratory system resistance and compliance were impaired subsequent to zzso at zzso and this impairment was even more pronounced at zzso In line with these results, the expression of zzso components and zzso zzso was zzso The deposition of collagen was increased at zzso In addition, the expression of inflammatory zzso and both the activity and the expression of target genes of zzso signaling were zzso zzso with zzso or decreased expression at zzso and significantly increased expression art zzso Taken together, these data give evidence for an zzso impairment of lung function as a result of a zzso regulated increase in inflammatory and zzso processes subsequent to zzso
