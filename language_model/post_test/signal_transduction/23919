zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso short-range signals regulating zzso zzso development of the cardiovascular system, as well as migration and spreading of zzso and zzso zzso Some of these effects are believed to be zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The members of the small zzso zzso family elicit various effects on zzso structures and are probably involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to contribute to zzso as it is strongly expressed at sites of zzso Moreover, zzso factors induce the expression of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, using rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso we investigated the contribution of the small zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect early zzso of zzso on zzso zzso or zzso but strongly impaired cell zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partly reversed the zzso effect, suggesting involvement of zzso in this zzso However, zzso of zzso synthesis with short interfering zzso had a modest effect, suggesting that zzso plays a limited role in zzso zzso of spreading in zzso The zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso activity, and were antagonized by the expression of a zzso active zzso zzso Moreover, repression of zzso synthesis with zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Finally, zzso zzso a zzso zzso known to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso In conclusion, our results emphasize the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso In this way, zzso alone or in zzso with zzso can participate in blood vessel zzso a prerequisite for zzso
