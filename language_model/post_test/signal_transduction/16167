zzso zzso is maintained by a population of stem cells zzso that have not been identified by specific molecular zzso The objective of this study was to find new putative markers for these zzso and to identify associated molecular zzso 

Real time zzso zzso was performed in 24 human zzso and central zzso zzso samples to evaluate the gene expression profile of known zzso zzso zzso zzso A pool of those samples was further analyzed by a zzso array zzso for 84 genes related to the zzso growth, zzso and differentiation of zzso 

zzso from the zzso zzso SC niche showed significant expression of zzso cassette zzso G member 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results indicated an increased or decreased expression in 21 and 24 zzso respectively, in cells from the zzso SC niche compared to cells from the central zzso zzso zzso analysis by proprietary software found 4 different associated pathways and a novel network with the highest zzso genes in the zzso SC zzso This led to the identification of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso II alpha 1 zzso neural cell zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso box zzso zzso Gap junction protein beta zzso 32 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso that could be used to recognize putative zzso zzso zzso grown in culture and intended for zzso Other zzso zzso and zzso potentially could be used to positively purify them, and zzso zzso defective 6 zzso alpha zzso to zzso purify zzso 

zzso of these gene and molecular pathways has provided a better understanding of the signaling molecular pathways associated with zzso zzso zzso This knowledge potentially could give support to the design and development of innovative therapies with the potential to reverse zzso zzso arising from zzso surface zzso
