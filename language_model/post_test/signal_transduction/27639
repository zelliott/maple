zzso a transforming counterpart of the zzso zzso detected in experimental and human cancer, results from fusion of the zzso zzso domain with a zzso motif zzso by zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso the Met zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso domain has been suggested to be a regulatory region endowed with negative feedback zzso To understand whether its absence is critical for the generation of the zzso transforming potential, we produced a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The presence of the domain zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso dependent cell zzso Cell zzso zzso growth, zzso and invasion were also zzso The zzso behavior of zzso and zzso was the same, while zzso ability to associate zzso signal zzso and to elicit downstream signaling was severely zzso These data indicate that the presence of the zzso domain counterbalances the zzso transforming potential and therefore the loss of the zzso zzso the zzso domain is crucial in the generation of the active zzso zzso
