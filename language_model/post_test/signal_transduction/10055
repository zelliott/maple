Previous studies of the specificity of zzso interactions with G protein zzso in living cells have relied on zzso of second zzso or other downstream zzso We have examined the selectivity of interactions between zzso receptors zzso and various combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by measuring changes in zzso between zzso fluorescent protein and zzso fluorescent zzso zzso in zzso zzso All combinations of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso or zzso were activated to some degree by zzso zzso as judged by zzso decreases in zzso The degree of G protein zzso is determined by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso rather than by the identity of an individual zzso zzso analysis and small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso number by zzso of the zzso zzso minimized the differences among zzso preferences for zzso and zzso zzso The molecular properties of each zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso influence signaling efficiency for the zzso zzso signaling zzso
