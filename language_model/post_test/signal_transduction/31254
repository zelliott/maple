zzso muscle cell zzso deletion of transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling would help zzso the mechanisms through which zzso signaling contributes to vascular development and zzso We attempted to generate mice with zzso deletion of zzso signaling by mating mice with a conditional zzso zzso for the type II zzso zzso zzso to mice with zzso expression of zzso zzso We bred male mice transgenic for smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso with females carrying zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice zzso zzso at low levels in zzso and at high levels in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso correlated with high-level expression of zzso in zzso and zzso transmission of zzso In contrast, mice expressing zzso from a zzso promoter zzso efficiently zzso zzso in vascular and visceral zzso and the heart, but not in zzso Use of the zzso reporter zzso confirmed that zzso zzso in vascular zzso was inefficient for zzso mice and highly efficient for zzso zzso zzso that introduced the zzso zzso into zzso zzso in order to generate adult mice that are zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso and would have conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso no live zzso : zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso lines vary significantly in specificity and efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in the subset of cells that express zzso is required for normal zzso zzso generation of adult mice with absent zzso signaling in zzso remains a zzso
