In an effort to understand the zzso of G zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we sought to identify which regulators of G protein zzso proteins zzso are present in human zzso Using zzso zzso we performed zzso with human zzso and zzso cell line zzso In addition to confirming the presence of several known zzso zzso we found a novel zzso zzso transcript in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of multiple human zzso indicates that this transcript is most abundantly expressed in zzso compared to other zzso zzso zzso cloning of this novel zzso which we now term zzso demonstrates that this transcript is predicted to zzso a zzso acid protein that is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso and that has approximately zzso identity to other zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso in zzso
