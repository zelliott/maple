Life in the soil is an intellectual and practical challenge that the zzso zzso zzso masters by utilizing zzso zzso The nervous system assembled by these zzso zzso is capable of executing a variety of behaviors, some of respectable zzso The simplicity of the nervous system, its thoroughly characterized structure, several sets of zzso behaviors, and its genetic zzso combined with its zzso background make zzso zzso an attractive model zzso to study the zzso of zzso This review describes several behavioral plasticity zzso in zzso zzso and their underlying zzso circuits and then goes on to review the forward genetic analysis that has been undertaken to identify genes involved in the execution of these zzso Lastly, the review outlines how reverse zzso and zzso approaches can guide the analysis of the role of genes in behavior and why and how they will complement the forward genetic analysis of zzso
