The function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the angular zzso zzso zzso is to stabilize images on the zzso during zzso and zzso motion, zzso It has generally been assumed that these two zzso differ in their central processing because they differ significantly in their primary zzso behavior and characteristics at the motor zzso So far, models of the zzso have focused on the type of processing that the primary zzso signal must undergo before reaching the neural zzso Here, we propose a model that does not require any zzso It is known that the eye plant requires signals in phase with zzso and zzso We propose that the zzso signal is obtained directly from the neural zzso whereas the position signal is obtained directly from the primary zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso This design proved sufficient to simulate eye movements in response to zzso zzso
