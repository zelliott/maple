In the zzso zzso zzso proliferation is induced by zzso zzso zzso of germ cells into zzso is triggered by activity of the zzso and zzso zzso which function zzso to promote zzso and/or inhibit zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso ultimately zzso the activities of the zzso and zzso zzso We previously identified several ego zzso of zzso genes that promote zzso proliferation and interact genetically with the zzso signaling zzso Here, we show that zzso is an ego zzso Our data suggest that zzso is not a positive regulator of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso signaling is not the sole positive regulator of zzso zzso Moreover, our data indicate that zzso must have an additional function, which may be to repress activity of a third zzso entry zzso that would work in parallel with the zzso and zzso zzso In addition to its role in zzso zzso acts downstream of zzso to promote the female zzso zzso
