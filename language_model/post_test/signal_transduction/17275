The process of cellular transformation involves zzso of molecular changes that are modulated through altered zzso transcription, zzso and protein regulatory zzso Thus, identification of zzso protein zzso can provide an insight into major regulatory pathways activated during disease zzso In the present protein expression profiling approach, we identified differential sets of proteins in a two-dimensional gel zzso screen of a zzso zzso zzso progression zzso zzso categorization of the proteins exclusively associated with zzso cells identified four cellular processes of which zzso is known to zzso cellular differentiation and zzso We thus zzso the functional relevance of zzso expression and signaling in these two pathways during tumor zzso zzso expression was observed to zzso cellular differentiation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment was found to enhance zzso expression in transformed cells and sensitize them towards zzso in zzso and also reduce growth of zzso derived from transformed zzso Our findings emphasize that loss of zzso levels appears to provide zzso benefits to transformed cells towards the acquisition of resistance to zzso hallmark of cancer, while effective zzso treatment may present a viable approach towards zzso of tumor cells to zzso through induction of zzso zzso
