zzso delivered through the zzso a zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso are crucial for the maturation and proliferation of immature zzso lineage zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the structural and functional properties of the zzso zzso zzso alpha chains were generated by replacing zzso of the alpha chain zzso zzso and constant regions with zzso zzso from the zzso alpha zzso All zzso zzso could be expressed zzso at the cell surface and induce zzso zzso as well as zzso of several protein zzso on zzso zzso However, zzso wherein the connecting zzso of zzso alpha chain was zzso by the one from zzso zzso were zzso associated with the zzso zzso chain, showing that functional but not physical interactions were preserved in such zzso In contrast, introduction of the connecting zzso of zzso alpha in the zzso alpha chain was insufficient to zzso stable association with the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the inability of the zzso to interact strongly with zzso zzso is attributable to zzso acid zzso present throughout the region comprised between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso It remains to be determined whether the weak physical interaction between the zzso zzso the zzso zzso prevents the zzso of specific zzso zzso signaling zzso and thus zzso unique signaling properties upon the zzso In addition, this structural difference between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso might constitute a means to regulate the expression of these receptors at the surface of zzso at different stages of their zzso
