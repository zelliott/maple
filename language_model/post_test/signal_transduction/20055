We used zzso profiling to investigate the direct effects of zzso on gene expression in isolated zzso zzso from 6 patients with zzso Our data demonstrate that changes in genes involved the tumor necrosis factor zzso signaling zzso and the bone zzso zzso suggesting that treatment with zzso may help restore the damaged niche and suppress the zzso signaling zzso 

zzso is an effective treatment for patients with zzso and zzso syndrome zzso The exact mechanism of zzso function and its impact on the prognosis of patients is not known zzso 

We used gene expression profiling to study the effect of zzso therapy in peripheral blood zzso zzso of 6 patients with zzso and zzso 

After zzso treatment, genes involved in the tumor necrosis factor zzso signaling zzso that were zzso in the patients before treatment decreased to the healthy control baseline expression zzso This change in gene zzso in conjunction with increased expression of zzso genes that affect the stem cell niche zzso zzso and zzso may exert a positive effect on treated zzso In contrast, we found that increased expression of the zzso gene may have a negative impact on the stability of patient zzso 

The observed changes in gene expression described here may contribute to the identification of pathways that are affected by zzso which may help to explain the effects of this zzso
