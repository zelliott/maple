The present study zzso a novel transgenic mouse model that expresses an zzso dominant negative zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso type II zzso zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso signaling plays an important role in the zzso of chronic zzso increases in pulmonary zzso pressure and vascular and zzso zzso zzso to zzso male zzso and control zzso zzso mice were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso or air for 6 zzso zzso of zzso was induced by drinking 25 zzso zzso water beginning 1 zzso before hypoxic zzso zzso increases in right zzso pressure, right zzso mass, pulmonary zzso zzso and zzso were greatly attenuated in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effects of hypoxic exposure on pulmonary zzso and zzso collagen content, appearance of zzso muscle zzso cells in zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso (including collagen I and III, zzso and zzso zzso in whole lung were zzso in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso exposure had no effect on systemic zzso pressure or heart rate in either zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso zzso plays an important role in pulmonary vascular adaptation to chronic zzso and that disruption of zzso signaling zzso zzso pulmonary hypertension, right zzso zzso pulmonary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso in whole zzso
