zzso depleted mice are protected from zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso are critical for cellular liver zzso zzso has zzso and zzso properties and mediates zzso recruitment in diseases such as zzso zzso In classic zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso and zzso signaling via zzso In zzso zzso the zzso soluble zzso can form a soluble zzso complex and stimulate cells which only express zzso but no zzso zzso zzso was shown to be important for liver zzso and development of liver zzso Here, we show that blocking classic zzso signaling but not zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso liver damage in mice, with reduced liver zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso zzso is only reduced by zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of circulating zzso after zzso A challenge revealed that classic zzso signaling is required for the zzso of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced level of zzso zzso zzso classic zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso effects indicating that zzso classic but not zzso zzso is responsible for liver zzso Classic zzso signaling is required to mount an efficient zzso during zzso zzso immune response, which might have clinical implications in the regard that blocking global zzso signaling pathways is a treatment option in different chronic inflammatory zzso
