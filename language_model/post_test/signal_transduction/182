zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso bundle of the lateral zzso zzso zzso consolidation of implicit and explicit memories for a variety of learning zzso in zzso However, the neural and molecular mechanisms involved in memory zzso by zzso are not zzso Here, we investigated the influence of zzso treatment on zzso gene expression in order to identify potential signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in zzso cognitive zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso caused a rapid induction of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, using zzso or quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, we showed that zzso zzso the expression of 62 zzso genes shortly after zzso Most of the proteins zzso by these zzso such as zzso 1 A zzso are part of signal zzso zzso or are related to zzso as heat shock 70 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 10 of the regulated genes have been previously related with learning and memory or neural zzso including the cocaine and zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The fact that the zzso gene was zzso expressed in our zzso experiments validated our findings from our zzso studies mentioned zzso In addition, using quantitative real-time zzso we confirmed the observed expression changes for several of the genes identified by our zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may facilitate learning and memory by regulation of multiple signaling pathways in the zzso that may promote zzso
