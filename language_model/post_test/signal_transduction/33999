zzso of specific gene expression patterns in response to activity zzso functional plasticity to zzso A principal role in the regulation of these processes has been ascribed to the zzso responsive element binding protein zzso Using zzso expression profiling in mice lacking zzso in the zzso accompanied by deletion of the zzso responsive element zzso gene zzso we here show that the role of these proteins in zzso gene expression is surprisingly selective and highly context zzso Thus, only a very restricted subset of zzso genes zzso zzso or zzso requires these proteins for their induction in the zzso after zzso acid administration, while they are required for most of the zzso expression changes in the zzso Interestingly, in the absence of zzso zzso is able to rescue zzso transcription, which strengthens the notion of overlapping functions of the two zzso In addition, we show that cholesterol metabolism is zzso in the brains of zzso mice, as reflected coordinated expression changes in genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and zzso zzso of zzso These findings provide novel insights into the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
