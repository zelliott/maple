During the development of periphery auditory zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso extend their zzso to zzso cochlear hair cells zzso with their zzso zzso into a cluster zzso zzso from the cochlear sensory zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this spatial patterning remain zzso In this study, in zzso zzso in the mouse zzso suggests that zzso and its zzso zzso exhibit apparently complementary expression patterns in the spiral zzso and its nearby region, the spiral zzso In zzso and zzso zzso the spatial restriction of zzso was zzso zzso zzso were found to scatter in the space between the cochlear zzso and the main body of spiral zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and failed to zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso were displaced toward the cochlear zzso as an zzso zzso of different embryonic stages in the zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso was due to a progressive displacement to zzso locations after their initial normal settlement at an earlier zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling zzso a restriction force on zzso to ensure their precise positioning for correct zzso zzso
