To observe the zzso effect on the expression of zzso zzso in liver from brain dead zzso rats through zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso by zzso 

A total of 30 male zzso rats weighing from 180 to 200 g were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: zzso BD group zzso zzso 10): brain death was induced in zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso 10): brain death was successfully induced and zzso (10 zzso was given through zzso vein of zzso After brain death artificial ventilation was maintained for 6 hours and only those with mean zzso blood pressure more than 80 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were accepted as BD zzso zzso Control group zzso zzso 10): living healthy zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso zzso in liver zzso were analyzed by zzso and the protein expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by Western zzso 

The zzso zzso detected in the liver in BD group was significantly increased compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins in liver were also significantly increased in BD group compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso The zzso zzso was decreased in zzso group and significantly decreased compared with the BD group zzso zzso zzso P is less than zzso but higher than that in control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins in liver were significantly decreased in zzso group compared with the BD group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso but higher than that in control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso can suppress the expression of zzso zzso in the liver of brain dead rats through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso which may reduce the zzso of donor zzso
