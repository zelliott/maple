zzso depletion of bone zzso zzso compromises zzso suggesting a zzso mechanism provided by the T cells that has been shown to associate with zzso but not zzso T zzso zzso for this phenomenon have focused on immune targeting of residual host cells or zzso zzso We provide evidence for an alternative mechanism based on cooperative effects on cell zzso We observed that zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso mouse model paralleled clinical observations in humans, with an enhancing effect noted from the addition of zzso cells but not zzso zzso This correlated with zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso to the bone zzso in zzso and zzso zzso increases of zzso cell zzso through a bone zzso zzso cell line in zzso The cooperative interaction was not sensitive to zzso A zzso of protein zzso However, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and impaired zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso cells did not migrate in tandem with zzso cells or alter zzso barrier zzso rather, they affected zzso signaling in zzso cells in response to the zzso zzso derived zzso zzso These data demonstrate zzso zzso between different cell types in zzso zzso events and provide one potential explanation for the clinically observed effect of zzso cells on bone zzso zzso This modification of cell migration by neighboring cells provides broad possibilities for zzso effects between cells of different types to influence cell zzso
