To study the effects of zzso zzso zzso on the biological function and signal zzso of zzso in a human myeloma cell zzso 

The effect of zzso on the growth of zzso cells was shown by zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso of two zzso zzso and the zzso by zzso which were involved in the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso Then, the cells were treated with zzso and zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso The changes in the cell growth and zzso of the two zzso were exhibited by zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso could promote the proliferation of zzso cells, zzso both zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways were activated by zzso in the zzso cells and zzso Cell proliferation and zzso of the two zzso signal zzso pathways were inhibited by zzso zzso the zzso of these two signal zzso pathways at the same zzso 

The zzso of cell growth, zzso by the zzso of the zzso pathway, is related to the zzso zzso of the two zzso signal zzso zzso
