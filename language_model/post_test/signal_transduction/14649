To address the functional role of zzso transforming growth zzso zzso signaling in a normal zzso background, we selected a spontaneously immortalized lung zzso cell line derived from the normal lung tissue of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transgenic mouse that zzso expressed zzso under the control of the zzso promoter zzso and assessed this cell zzso response to zzso 

A spontaneously immortalized lung zzso cell culture zzso was established and all analyses were performed within 50 zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso were used to assess zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to assess the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso promoter activity was measured using zzso reporter zzso 

Exposure to zzso inhibited zzso signaling induced either by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso treated with either zzso or zzso zzso against zzso showed a significant increase in zzso compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso 

Our findings imply that zzso of zzso zzso signaling via zzso of the zzso function enhances the zzso of normal lung zzso cells, and this can be directly attributed to the loss of zzso signaling zzso
