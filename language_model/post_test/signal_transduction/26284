zzso zzso act as molecular switches central in cellular processes such as zzso zzso migration, cell zzso growth or zzso Their zzso is tightly regulated downstream of cell surface receptors by zzso zzso Exchange zzso zzso that are responsible for the zzso the zzso and the spatial restriction of zzso zzso response to zzso zzso Because there is about four time more zzso that zzso zzso and zzso do not always show a strict specificity for zzso it is clear that their regulation depends on specific interactions with the zzso zzso zzso bear a peculiar structure, highly zzso though evolution, consisting of a zzso tandem, the zzso zzso zzso domain being responsible for the exchange zzso The function of the zzso zzso zzso domain known to bind zzso however, remains zzso and reports are in many cases rather zzso This review summarizes data on the regulation of zzso activity through interaction of the zzso zzso domain with zzso which are considered as critical players in the spatial organization of major signaling zzso
