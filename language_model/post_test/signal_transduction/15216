zzso zzso causes extensive lung zzso zzso signaling involves zzso zzso and zzso However, the relative contribution of zzso and zzso signaling in host defense against pulmonary zzso zzso infection has not been zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice infected with zzso zzso showed impaired survival and reduced bacterial zzso zzso influx, zzso evidence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso expression in the zzso In addition, zzso zzso late zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was attenuated in the lungs of zzso zzso However, zzso mice infected with zzso zzso showed a much more remarkable zzso including impaired survival and reduced bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression with almost no zzso influx in the zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso early zzso and zzso zzso in the lungs was also zzso Furthermore, the role of zzso is dominant over zzso because zzso double knockout mice displayed a more pronounced zzso than zzso zzso Moreover, human zzso zzso zzso with zzso blocking zzso showed attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, zzso mice zzso with zzso blocking zzso exhibited zzso in zzso zzso zzso influx and enhanced bacterial burden in the lungs and zzso Overall, this investigation provides new insights into the zzso and zzso signaling triggered by pulmonary zzso zzso infection in the lungs and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of zzso in reducing excessive zzso influx in human disease during zzso bacterial zzso
