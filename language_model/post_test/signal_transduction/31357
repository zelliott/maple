The zzso protein zzso zzso has been identified as an important zzso of cell survival able to counteract zzso zzso However, zzso a model of natural tolerance to cerebral zzso is associated with zzso of zzso We previously established a model of zzso tolerance in a zzso cell line and using this model we now addressed the question whether zzso tolerance also zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies showed decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso levels of three major targets of zzso and well-known zzso factors, the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso a zzso family member, zzso and the protein zzso double minute 2 zzso all zzso upon zzso by zzso were decreased in zzso zzso In addition, pharmacological blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced cell death induced by oxygen and zzso deprivation zzso and increased the protective effect of zzso zzso Furthermore, decreasing availability of zzso by zzso zzso cells with zzso of inactive zzso also resulted in protection against zzso and zzso of the protective effect of zzso Depending on the environment, zzso zzso and zzso can trigger zzso responses or cell cycle arrest, and thus, in a situation of reduced energy, driving the cells into a state of zzso might be zzso This work suggests that in the context of tolerance zzso of zzso is zzso
