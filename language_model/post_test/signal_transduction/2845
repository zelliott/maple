zzso of some cultured human tumor cell lines bearing high numbers of zzso growth factor zzso receptors is paradoxically inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the zzso mechanism of growth zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso In zzso we studied a selected zzso zzso which is resistant to zzso growth zzso We observed a marked reduction in zzso zzso zzso activity when zzso and zzso cells were cultured with 20 zzso zzso for 4 zzso After further continuous exposure of zzso cells to zzso the zzso activity remained at a low level and was accompanied by persistent zzso zzso In contrast, the early reduced zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso cells was only zzso We found that, at early time points zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso But only in zzso cells, was zzso expression sustained at a significantly increased level for up to 5 d after addition of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso could be inhibited by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso induction was a consequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso We also demonstrated that the increased zzso was associated with both zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso arrest and growth zzso in zzso zzso
