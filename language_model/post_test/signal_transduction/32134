This study was conducted to investigate the zzso effect of vegetable soy peptides on adult stem cells zzso in the absence of serum and their possible mechanisms of zzso The proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso treated with soy peptides was found to increase significantly upon zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso zzso In addition, soy peptides led to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the zzso revealed that the production of transforming growth zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor and zzso increased significantly in response to treatment with soy peptides in both zzso and zzso Similarly, soy zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was blocked in response to zzso with zzso a specific zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and a consecutive decrease in zzso proliferation revealed that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the results of this study indicate that zzso production of zzso plays a crucial role in the soy zzso proliferation of zzso under zzso zzso
