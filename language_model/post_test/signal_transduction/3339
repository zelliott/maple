Starting from the information on zzso cancer provided by the mainstream publications, we construct a review focusing on the following issues: zzso the genetic profile, zzso the role of the zzso transition in the zzso of zzso features, zzso the controversial hypothesis regarding the origin, and zzso the involvement of the immune system in the zzso zzso Advances in the zzso at the genetic level in the zzso mechanisms progressively lead to the idea of a genetic signature for the zzso zzso Moreover, the complementary approaches oriented towards the decryption of the intrinsic structure of the expressed molecules and, zzso the development of zzso open new perspectives for an early diagnosis and an appropriate zzso The research on the zzso transition zzso those exploring the signaling pathways responsible for the switch between the loss of the zzso characteristics and the gain of a zzso cell zzso with results in the amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso allow a deeper understanding of the complex zzso mechanism which zzso zzso zzso The classic conception of zzso cancer zzso based on the role of the zzso surface zzso is currently zzso and a novel hypothesis is formulated, which supports direct involvement of the zzso tubes for the zzso zzso Although recent research suggests the implication of zzso cells by specific mechanisms in zzso cancer zzso there is yet reliable evidence concerning their zzso of direct action and/or zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso remains a research challenge, due to still numerous unknown factors involved in the zzso transformation zzso originating from the zzso zzso and reflected by cellular and tissue expression zzso
