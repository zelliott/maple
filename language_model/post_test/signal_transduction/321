Various zzso functions such as zzso zzso production, and survival are regulated by zzso zzso Despite the essential role of focal zzso zzso zzso in zzso this signaling pathway, its exact function in zzso is ill zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso using a zzso conditional zzso knockout zzso As reported in many other cell types, zzso is required for regulation of focal zzso dynamics when zzso adhere to zzso or zzso zzso on zzso surfaces and zzso after zzso were not altered in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we observed significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso As a result, these zzso displayed decreased pathogen killing capability both in zzso and in zzso in a mouse zzso zzso In adherent cells, the defects associated with zzso zzso are likely due to suppression of zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso also reduced zzso zzso production in suspended zzso in the absence of cell zzso This may be solely caused by suppression of zzso signaling in these cells, because the zzso calcium signal was not zzso zzso with decreased zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso we also observed accelerated spontaneous death in these zzso Taken together, our results revealed previously zzso roles of zzso in zzso function and provided a potential therapeutic target for treatment of a variety of infectious and inflammatory zzso
