zzso zzso cancer is a significant cause of zzso cancer zzso 

We examined whether this mortality was associated with inherited variation in approximately 170 candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso analysis based initially on 312 Mayo Clinic cases zzso zzso Additional analyses used The Cancer Genome zzso zzso zzso cases, 62 zzso For the most compelling zzso we zzso Mayo Clinic tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and conducted zzso zzso replication analysis zzso cases, zzso zzso 

The strongest initial mortality association was in zzso zzso growth zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and with overall variation in zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso data revealed consistent associations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso Mayo Clinic + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggested zzso correlation with reduced zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso In Mayo Clinic zzso protein levels of zzso its zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not associated with zzso and did not serve as an intermediate zzso however, zzso was associated with reduced mortality zzso zzso zzso likely due to higher expression in zzso zzso In eight additional zzso cancer case series, zzso zzso was not associated with mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We conclude that although zzso signaling is critical to migration, invasion, and zzso it is unlikely that zzso genetic variation plays a major role in zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, any minor role is not related to zzso zzso 

Our study shows the utility of multiple data types and multiple data sets in zzso zzso
