The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanism by which zzso coli zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso in primary cultures of rat type II zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso was additive to those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A and C zzso zzso and this effect was not suppressed by zzso of both protein zzso On the other hand, zzso did not modify the increase on zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and enhanced slightly the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso was suppressed by zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso These results, together with the zzso increase in the zzso zzso suggest that stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso in type II zzso occurs by a zzso zzso mechanism via zzso protein zzso zzso
