zzso rotation is a cell zzso zzso of zzso cell polarity zzso signaling in the zzso zzso Although the signaling aspects of zzso establishment are beginning to be zzso the zzso aspects of the associated zzso rotation process remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso have opposing effects on zzso zzso promotes zzso as zzso zzso zzso rotate less than wild type or not at zzso By contrast, the two zzso act to restrict this movement, with zzso rotating too fast in the zzso The opposing effects of zzso and zzso result in a coordinated cellular movement, enabling zzso of the same stage to rotate zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies indicate that zzso and zzso signaling feed into the regulation of zzso activity and zzso in this zzso Thus, zzso and zzso integrate zzso from at least two signaling zzso resulting in a coordinated cell zzso A similar input into zzso zzso and zzso might function in the progression of diseases such as zzso zzso zzso
