zzso a disease involving excessive collagen deposition, can be studied using zzso cultured from affected zzso We find that zzso the active component of the spice zzso causes zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso but not in normal lung zzso zzso This effect is likely to be linked to the fact that although zzso zzso the expression of the phase 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso are deficient in these zzso particularly after zzso zzso The sensitivity of cells to zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso 1) are regulated by the zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso which contain less zzso and less zzso zzso than zzso become less sensitive to zzso zzso and express higher levels of zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso become sensitive to zzso zzso and express lower levels of zzso zzso when zzso expression or function is zzso The zzso distribution of zzso also differs in zzso and zzso zzso is predominantly nuclear or zzso in zzso but is associated with stress fibers in zzso Just as zzso levels are lower in zzso than in zzso in zzso zzso expression is decreased in zzso lung tissue in zzso In zzso our results suggest that a signaling zzso involving zzso and phase 2 zzso zzso provides protection against zzso zzso in zzso and is defective in zzso These observations suggest that zzso may have therapeutic value in treating zzso just as it has already been shown to protect rats from lung zzso induced by a variety of zzso
