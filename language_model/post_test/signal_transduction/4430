The zzso transition is controlled by zzso checkpoint pathways which inhibit zzso if previous events are incomplete or if the DNA is zzso zzso analyses in zzso have defined two zzso but zzso pathways which prevent zzso which acts when S phase is zzso and one which acts when the DNA is zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso many of the gene products involved have been zzso Six zzso zzso zzso gene products are required for both the zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso a putative protein zzso is required only for the zzso checkpoint and not for the zzso checkpoint following the zzso of DNA zzso 

We have genetically defined a third zzso control checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso which prevents zzso when passage through zzso (the commitment point in zzso is zzso In cycling cells arrested at start, zzso is prevented by a zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso cells attempt an zzso zzso with a zzso DNA content without entering S zzso Similar results are seen in the absence of zzso a typical example of a zzso gene zzso 

zzso dissection of checkpoints in zzso growing zzso zzso has identified a zzso that couples zzso to correct passage through zzso This zzso is related to the zzso zzso which ensure that zzso is dependent on the completion of replication and the integrity of the zzso We propose that all three zzso control checkpoints monitor distinct DNA or protein structures at different stages in the cell zzso
