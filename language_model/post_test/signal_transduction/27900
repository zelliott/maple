The nervous system encodes information relating chemical stimuli to taste perception, beginning with zzso mechanisms at the zzso and ending in the representation of stimulus attributes by the activity of zzso in the zzso Recent studies have rekindled the long-standing debate about whether taste information is coded by the pattern of activity across zzso zzso or by specifically tuned zzso zzso Taste zzso are broadly tuned to stimuli representing different qualities and are also responsive to stimulus intensity and often to touch and zzso Their responsiveness is also modulated by a number of zzso zzso In addition to representing stimulus quality and intensity, activity in taste zzso must code information about the hedonic value of zzso zzso These considerations suggest that individual zzso zzso contribute to the coding of more than one stimulus zzso making the response of any one cell meaningful only in the context of the activity of its zzso
