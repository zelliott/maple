At the shoot zzso of plants is a small region known as the shoot zzso zzso zzso that maintains a population of zzso zzso cells whilst providing cells for developing lateral zzso and the zzso All aerial structures of the plant develop from the SAM zzso enabling plants to grow in a characteristic modular fashion with great zzso and zzso plasticity throughout their zzso The maintenance of the stem cell population is intimately balanced with cell recruitment into zzso zzso through zzso communication involving a complex zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that diverse regulators function in SAM zzso many of which zzso on the zzso zzso zzso In this review the diverse regulatory zzso that function in SAM maintenance are zzso zzso and zzso control, hormonal regulation, and the balance with zzso The central role of zzso as an zzso of multiple signals is zzso in addition, accessory feedback zzso emerge as a feature enabling dynamic regulation of the stem cell zzso
