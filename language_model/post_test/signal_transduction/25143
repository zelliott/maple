zzso known as DNA zzso agents, have been shown to block zzso zzso channels zzso as well as to alleviate functional deficits in certain multiple sclerosis zzso patients in a manner similar to zzso Since zzso channel zzso are known to inhibit T zzso immune responses both in zzso and in zzso we investigated the effects of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso currents of zzso zzso basic zzso memory T cell line cells zzso derived from Lewis rats as measured by zzso technique, zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso from Lewis rats challenged for experimental zzso zzso zzso by zzso with spinal zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as measured by zzso and zzso zzso gene expression of zzso as measured by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso The examined zzso exhibited zzso effects on the measured parameters with the same sequence of zzso zzso zzso therefore, conclude that zzso zzso zzso interfere with zzso signal zzso in zzso and might thereby suppress immune responses in zzso diseases of the central nervous system and most likely also in other zzso zzso Thus, zzso especially the zzso substance zzso are new candidates for further studies on zzso channel blocking zzso zzso The agents may exert a dual beneficial effect on zzso diseases like zzso because they could zzso the inflammatory process and improve zzso zzso
