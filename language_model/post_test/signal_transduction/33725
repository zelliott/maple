zzso from occupational exposure and components of cigarette smoke can cause DNA damage in zzso zzso Failure to repair DNA damage by DNA repair proteins may result in zzso leading to genetic instability and the development of zzso zzso zzso studies have shown DNA damage signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso which is lost on zzso suggesting that the damage zzso mechanism acts as a brake to further zzso Single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso genes may alter protein zzso We hypothesized that zzso in zzso zzso genes may zzso predisposition to zzso cancer and influence the effects of environmental zzso 

We recruited 771 cases and 800 controls zzso zzso and 227 zzso from a previous zzso zzso and interviewed them regarding their smoking habits and occupational zzso DNA was extracted from a peripheral blood sample and zzso of 24 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was undertaken using an zzso discrimination method zzso 

Smoking and occupational dye exposure were strongly associated with zzso cancer zzso Using zzso zzso adjusting for age, sex, smoking and occupational dye exposure, there was a marginal increase in risk of zzso cancer for an zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for individuals zzso for the rare zzso compared to those carrying the common zzso or zzso zzso However, in the zzso controls, the zzso distribution for this zzso deviated from zzso zzso None of the other zzso showed an association with zzso cancer and we did not find any significant interaction between any of these zzso and exposure to smoking or dye zzso 

Apart from a possible effect for one zzso zzso zzso our study does not support the hypothesis that zzso in zzso signaling genes zzso predisposition to zzso zzso
