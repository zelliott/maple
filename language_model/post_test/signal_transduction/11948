To reveal the involvement of zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso in zzso prevention from zzso zzso and necrosis induced by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso rats were exposed to zzso for 8 days and then zzso with zzso for 30 zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to antagonize zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to neutralize zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and necrosis were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso measured zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso prevented the zzso of zzso cells and zzso expression and activity, and also suppressed the increase in zzso zzso cells and zzso and zzso zzso in cultured zzso evoked by zzso These zzso and zzso effects of zzso were larger on zzso cells than on zzso zzso since zzso treatment alone significantly inhibited the zzso zzso and necrosis but DAN exposure alone did not alter the zzso and necrosis induced by zzso In support of these results, zzso zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso All these zzso effects were blocked by zzso zzso 

zzso prevention from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and necrosis in zzso depends on the zzso of zzso channel opening and expression rather than on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling mediates this zzso of zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso
