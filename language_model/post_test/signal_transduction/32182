zzso comprise an essential component of the zzso zzso necessary for normal zzso zzso However, there is no viable in zzso model to study their role in normal human breast zzso We hypothesized that adding primary human zzso to the zzso zzso zzso would enhance and provide a novel approach to examine zzso cell interactions during the zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso of enhanced zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso western analysis, invasion and proliferation zzso results were confirmed with zzso zzso 

The combined treatment of zzso and zzso stimulation significantly enhanced the percentage of the total zzso humanized and the zzso success zzso zzso analysis revealed the disappearance of the human zzso by two weeks zzso suggesting that the improved overall growth and zzso of the zzso provided a larger zzso bed for zzso cell proliferation and structure zzso zzso their promotion of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso proliferation and invasion in zzso as well as significantly increased zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso positive cells in humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso and western analyses identified zzso and zzso as potential mechanisms by which zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso validated the effects of these molecules on zzso behavior in zzso as well as by zzso analysis of humanized zzso for zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso humanized with zzso had enhanced zzso and tumor growth compared to zzso humanized with zzso zzso 

zzso we demonstrate intricate immune and zzso cell zzso interactions in a humanized in zzso model zzso We confirmed our in zzso results with in zzso zzso highlighting the value of this model to zzso substantiate in zzso and in zzso zzso It is critical to understand the signaling networks that drive zzso cell zzso for tumor cells exploit these signaling mechanisms to support their growth and invasive zzso This report presents a dynamic in zzso model to study primary human zzso interactions and to advance our knowledge of the zzso signals that promote zzso
