It is well known that zzso zzso factor zzso and the early zzso zzso input are implicated in the regulation of zzso processes in the zzso There is growing evidence that interactions between these zzso signals rather than singular actions are critical for cellular differentiation and zzso of the zzso In the present report, our goal is to identify zzso target cells for zzso and zzso Using primary zzso and zzso cell cultures, we have demonstrated that zzso selectively regulates zzso but not zzso zzso expression in zzso This effect was not observed in zzso zzso approaches indicated that zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso expression were zzso at the zzso level by an zzso of the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso laser zzso revealed that the newly zzso zzso receptors were integrated into the plasma membrane of zzso Our findings clearly show that developing zzso zzso are targets for zzso Furthermore, zzso appears to regulate the zzso responsiveness of zzso This implicates that functional interactions between zzso zzso and zzso are necessary to warrant proper differentiation of the zzso zzso
