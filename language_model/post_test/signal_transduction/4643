The early inflammatory response to influenza virus infection contributes to severe lung disease and continues to pose a serious threat to human zzso The mechanisms by which zzso gain entry to the respiratory tract and their role during zzso remain zzso Here, we report that zzso significantly contributed to morbidity in a pathological mouse model of influenza virus zzso Using extensive zzso bone zzso zzso and depletion studies, we identified zzso as the zzso pulmonary cellular source of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, which is capable of digesting the zzso zzso Furthermore, infection of zzso mice showed that zzso was functionally required for zzso migration and control of viral replication in the respiratory zzso Although zzso release was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso cells, rather than zzso zzso themselves, were important for zzso zzso These results were extended using multiplex analyses of inflammatory zzso to show that zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso were reduced in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso and blocking zzso in zzso reduced zzso recruitment after zzso zzso recognition of influenza virus therefore provides the mechanisms to induce recruitment of zzso through zzso and to enable their zzso within the tissue via zzso zzso of the basement zzso Our results demonstrate a previously unknown contribution of zzso to influenza virus zzso by zzso excessive zzso migration into the respiratory tract in response to viral replication that could be exploited for therapeutic zzso
