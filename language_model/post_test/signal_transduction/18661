zzso migration and differentiation of neural zzso cells are controlled by a variety of zzso signal zzso Members of the zzso family of zzso molecules play a crucial role for zzso and repair mechanisms in the embryonic and adult nervous zzso A strategy of disclosure of the role of different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso signal pathways for zzso cell expansion and zzso is illustrated at the example of the rat zzso zzso cell line zzso that is immortalized by stable zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of the zzso large T zzso A shift from zzso 33 degrees C to zzso 39 degrees C leads to proliferation stop and start of differentiation into zzso and zzso zzso Investigation of expression of zzso zzso receptors and zzso signal zzso zzso point to a zzso involvement of zzso and zzso signaling in proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells, zzso a mutual suppression of zzso activities is zzso zzso zzso molecules are not detected in zzso and zzso zzso cells except zzso The zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso cells and increase during zzso whereas cellular zzso decreases in the early phase and is restored in the late phase of zzso zzso of zzso at the membrane in zzso zzso cells and its nuclear zzso in zzso zzso cells under differentiation conditions argues for a distinct zzso regulated role of the zzso in the proliferation and early differentiation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling is not detected during differentiation of zzso zzso Complete exploration of the role of zzso zzso for differentiation of the neural zzso cells zzso will require zzso zzso and exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso either with zzso zzso or by zzso with zzso zzso
