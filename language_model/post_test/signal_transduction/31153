zzso of T cells after stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso via signaling processes that have collectively been termed zzso zzso The molecular basis for zzso signaling is not yet completely zzso Here, we show that a signaling module zzso the zzso adapter proteins zzso and zzso is involved in zzso zzso signaling and, moreover, that the interaction between zzso and zzso is mandatory for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso module leads to displacement of the small zzso zzso from the plasma membrane without influencing its zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso complex serves to recruit activated zzso to the plasma zzso In line with this hypothesis is the finding that membrane targeting of the zzso module zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso However, it appears as if the zzso module can exert its signaling function outside of the classical raft fraction of the cell zzso
