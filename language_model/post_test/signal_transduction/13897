zzso has a protective effect on diabetic zzso To zzso the protective zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on high zzso cell zzso and zzso signaling in cultured zzso which is a suitable model for studying zzso cell zzso High zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso inflammatory response is one of the molecular mechanisms of diabetic zzso and zzso signaling has close relationship with inflammatory zzso But there is no report about the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in controlling high zzso zzso zzso by zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso was activated by high zzso stimulation in zzso and significantly alleviated by the zzso of zzso From these findings, we made the conclusion that zzso could zzso the symptoms of diabetic zzso which zzso inflammatory reaction of diabetic zzso by regulating zzso zzso
