zzso zzso is well known to induce zzso damage in various brain regions including the zzso but the precise zzso of action underlying these effects has yet to be fully zzso zzso growth zzso zzso is a zzso factor promoting cell survival by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that IGF-1 prevents zzso cell death induced by zzso likely via the stimulation of the zzso zzso in primary zzso cultured zzso zzso induced zzso cell death at a minimal concentration of 50 zzso IGF-1 (10 zzso prevented cell death induced by zzso under zzso zzso The zzso effect of IGF-1 was accompanied by reversal of the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso effect of IGF-1 whereas the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso an upstream blocker of zzso protein zzso zzso had no zzso These results suggest that IGF-1 can prevent zzso cell death induced by zzso in zzso zzso by modulating the activity of the zzso zzso
