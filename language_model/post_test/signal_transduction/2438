Previous studies suggest that the core protein of zzso C virus zzso has a zzso function in the replication cycle of the zzso To understand the role of this protein in zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso protein interaction cloning system to search for cellular proteins physically interacting with the zzso core zzso One such cellular gene was isolated and characterized as the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso In zzso binding analysis demonstrated that the zzso core protein binds to the zzso 98 zzso acids within the zzso domain of the zzso that is involved in signal zzso although the binding affinity of the full-length zzso core protein was weaker than that of its zzso truncated zzso Our results also indicated that the zzso zzso segment of the zzso core protein was sufficient for interaction with zzso and that the core protein could form complexes with the zzso form of the zzso domain of zzso which is a prerequisite for downstream signaling of this zzso Similar to other members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso effect of the signaling pathway, and thus we have zzso the biological consequence of interaction between the zzso core protein and zzso Our results indicated that in the presence of the zzso agent gamma zzso the zzso core protein enhances the zzso effects of zzso forms of zzso zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Furthermore, this enhancement of the zzso activity was zzso specific, since in the presence of zzso the expression of the zzso core protein did not elicit an increase in the zzso activity of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso core protein can associate with zzso and this zzso interaction has a zzso effect on the signaling zzso of zzso in certain cell zzso Given the known roles of zzso zzso interactions in the normal development of peripheral zzso zzso and in triggering zzso activity and zzso zzso in certain cell types, our finding implies that the zzso core protein may aggravate these biological functions of zzso resulting in zzso in zzso zzso
