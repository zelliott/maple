zzso inflammation induced by zzso oxygen zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors is the hallmark of zzso a prevalent chronic respiratory zzso In various cellular and animal models, we have recently demonstrated that, in response to multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the inflammatory signals zzso by zzso Because zzso inflammation is a major characteristic of asthma zzso we have investigated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso and various inflammatory markers in cellular and animal models of asthma using primary human small airway zzso cells and zzso zzso mice, zzso We observed that pharmacological zzso or genetic zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso prevented zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso synthesis of inflammatory markers zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in small airway zzso zzso In zzso mice, we observed that administration of an zzso inhibitor markedly reduced airway zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso and release of zzso type zzso in the zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso may offer a novel therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory airway diseases such as zzso
