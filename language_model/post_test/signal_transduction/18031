zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in human breast cancer are clearly important events that lead to the transformation of zzso zzso cells in approximately one-third of breast cancer zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso are activated by zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso activated in breast cancer cells with zzso gene zzso This indicates that zzso of zzso zzso function may be an especially effective and unique strategy for blocking the zzso transformation of breast cancer zzso zzso we constructed a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso containing a dominant negative form of zzso in which most of the zzso domain was removed for introduction into zzso By using a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso resistance gene and the gene of interest are driven by a single promoter, we attained zzso coordinate zzso of zzso resistance with the gene of interest in target cell zzso Breast zzso cells with zzso gene amplification (21 zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso cells without zzso gene amplification from the same patient zzso zzso were infected with zzso and assessed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso and transformed growth in zzso zzso negative zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso and signaling in zzso and 21 zzso cells as well as the zzso zzso of zzso and signaling in 21 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were strongly inhibited by dominant negative zzso In contrast, the proliferation of cells zzso by zzso growth factor was not apparently affected by dominant negative zzso The growth zzso proliferation and transformed growth of 21 zzso cells were also strongly inhibited by dominant negative zzso in zzso and independent growth zzso in zzso Furthermore, the zzso or growth zzso proliferation of 21 zzso cells was inhibited by dominant negative zzso whereas the zzso growth zzso proliferation of these cells was not: this indicates that dominant negative zzso zzso zzso proliferation induced by zzso
