Since zzso levels are independently correlated with risk of coronary heart disease, we have identified signaling pathways important in zzso zzso production and zzso in human zzso We used zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human zzso were induced to differentiate in insulin, zzso zzso and zzso in the presence or absence of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by measuring zzso zzso zzso content, and zzso zzso zzso increased cell protein by zzso the zzso content of the cell layer was doubled, and the zzso activity increased zzso but did not stimulate zzso zzso None of the zzso significantly inhibited protein content over 20 days, but zzso content and zzso activity were inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso All of the zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and these zzso effects were increased by zzso with zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso zzso pathways are not critical to the differentiation program leading to zzso zzso but stimulation of zzso zzso is dependent on these as well as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso
