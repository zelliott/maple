zzso are zzso zzso proteins that convey critical zzso information and exert crucial zzso zzso In skin and hair zzso biology, zzso zzso and their zzso are of particular zzso It is not yet known whether zzso zzso play any role in the regulation of human hair growth and the expression pattern of zzso zzso in the human zzso unit remains zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso for zzso zzso is most prominent in the zzso layer of the outer root sheath and the surrounding zzso tissue sheath of human scalp hair zzso in zzso and in zzso Sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to previous reports, zzso zzso zzso in zzso was not significantly zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides promoted the growth of zzso zzso human scalp hair zzso in zzso and inhibited spontaneous hair zzso zzso This supports the concept that zzso zzso zzso is also important in human hair growth zzso The zzso relevant organ culture zzso employed here is a potential research tool for exploring whether targeted stimulation of zzso zzso zzso is a suitable candidate for human hair loss zzso
