The acute phase response is an orchestrated response to tissue injury, infection or zzso A prominent feature of this response is the induction of acute phase zzso which are involved in the restoration of zzso zzso are important zzso of the acute phase zzso zzso and prolonged action of zzso is potentially harmful, therefore mechanisms exist which limit the activity of zzso these include soluble zzso receptors and zzso zzso The zzso signal is transmitted into the cell via zzso zzso Different zzso zzso pathways are activated by different zzso zzso Eventually, zzso zzso factors interact with their response elements in the zzso region of acute phase genes and zzso is zzso zzso inflammation results in a systemic acute phase zzso However, local inflammatory or zzso processes in the liver may also induce an acute phase response, for example after partial zzso and during zzso zzso The acute phase proteins induced in these conditions probably act to limit zzso and/or zzso activity and tissue zzso The possible function of the acute phase protein alpha zzso in zzso zzso is discussed in some zzso
