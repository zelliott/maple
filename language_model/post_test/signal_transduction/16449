Much of our knowledge about zzso evolution comes from examination of dental zzso because the highly zzso zzso that covers teeth causes them to be among the zzso zzso As zzso entered new ecological zzso many changes in tooth number occurred, presumably as adaptations to new zzso For example, in contrast to humans, who have two zzso in each dental zzso zzso only have one zzso per zzso The zzso zzso because of its unusual zzso and remarkable stem zzso continuous growth, presents a zzso for evolutionary zzso as its origin in the fossil record is difficult to zzso and the genetic regulation of zzso number remains a largely open zzso Here, we studied a series of mice carrying zzso in zzso zzso the protein products of which are zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso splitting of gene expression zzso and reduced zzso was associated with subdivision of the zzso zzso and a zzso of its stem zzso zzso Interestingly, changes in zzso gene dosage led to a graded change in zzso number, with progressive decreases in zzso dosage leading to increasing numbers of zzso Moreover, the independent development of two zzso in zzso with large decreases in zzso dosage zzso the likely condition of zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that altering genetic dosage of an zzso can zzso ancestral dental characters, and that tooth number can be progressively regulated by changing levels of activity of a single signal zzso zzso
