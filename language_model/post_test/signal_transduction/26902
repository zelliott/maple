To guide clinicians in selecting treatment options for patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso it is desirable to have reliable markers predicting clinical zzso This study analyzed the correlation between signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and zzso D1 in zzso and their association with zzso features and zzso 

We investigated 65 specimens of zzso zzso by zzso using zzso and zzso D1 zzso First we determined the correlation between zzso and zzso D1 expression and the zzso features of the zzso Then we assessed the zzso relevance of zzso and zzso zzso 

A significant correlation was found between high levels of zzso expression and the degree of tumor zzso Additionally, a significant positive correlation was found between the expression of zzso and zzso D1 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and the presence of zzso were significantly associated with shorter overall survival in zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso expression was an independent zzso factor zzso 

zzso might be correlated with tumor zzso and its elevated expression may be an adverse zzso indicator for patients with zzso zzso of the zzso D1 signaling zzso may be attributed to the zzso transformation of zzso and may represent a possible target for zzso
