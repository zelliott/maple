zzso of the innate immune response involves recognition of the infectious agent and the subsequent zzso of cellular and zzso zzso In insects, a number of immunity genes are activated at the level of zzso leading to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso analyses in zzso have identified several signal zzso pathways that promote zzso of these immunity zzso Recent data suggest that the insect immune system is able to discriminate between a bacterial and a zzso infection, and responds by higher levels of zzso of the appropriate peptides to repel the zzso These and other recent data on zzso factors and regulation of zzso genes are integrated into a model to suggest how differential zzso of zzso and zzso peptides can occur in response to zzso and bacterial zzso
