zzso acid zzso has been identified as a key signal involved in the zzso of zzso neural zzso The main zzso zzso responsible for zzso signaling in the zzso and spinal zzso is zzso However, zzso zzso zzso exhibit only mild degrees of zzso in the neural zzso compared to full vitamin A zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso during zzso development in the zzso zzso and anterior spinal zzso using zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso and spinal zzso are not fully devoid of zzso since blocking zzso zzso signaling leads to a more severe zzso zzso than in zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso in the facial and more zzso zzso depends on full zzso signaling throughout early and late zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso synthesis after zzso reduces the number of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus, but has no effect on zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso of zzso signaling not only interferes with the differentiation of zzso zzso and their zzso in the zzso but also affects the development of the zzso lateral line zzso
