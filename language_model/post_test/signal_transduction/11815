zzso changes in gene expression zzso B cell development and zzso yet our knowledge of which zzso factors are essential is zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes was zzso for zzso B cell development but played an important, albeit selective, role during zzso Although zzso was zzso for zzso induction and differentiation into plasma cells based on the ability of zzso B cells to undergo zzso and zzso zzso zzso it was required for robust cell proliferation in response to zzso zzso zzso was required for only zzso genes to be expressed at normal levels in zzso B cells but zzso genes during their zzso zzso zzso fivefold more genes than it zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways were particularly dependent on zzso The importance of zzso in B cell zzso was underscored by the occurrence of opportunistic zzso infections in zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso has long served as a model of zzso gene zzso and the results presented here identify zzso as a zzso factor that zzso the zzso of B cells during their zzso to promote rapid cell proliferation and to mount an effective immune zzso
