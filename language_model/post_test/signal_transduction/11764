The zzso acid sequence has been determined for the zzso 41 zzso acids of chicken zzso cone zzso zzso This sequence is distinct from but structurally zzso to that of other visual zzso It contains a region rich in the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso In the related rod cell visual zzso zzso such zzso and zzso have previously been identified as sites for zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso serves to terminate its ability to function in visual zzso as an zzso of zzso We have zzso and zzso both chicken zzso and chicken zzso and shown them to be zzso by bovine zzso zzso Chicken zzso has a zzso and zzso similar to but zzso different from that for bovine zzso These results, in conjunction with other data, suggest that visual zzso in cone cells, upon zzso of light, undergo functional processes similar to those of the visual zzso in rod zzso
