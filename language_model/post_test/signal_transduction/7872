Although several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of the zzso zzso in the development of gastric zzso the functional significance of the zzso in gastric zzso is still poorly zzso To examine the role of the zzso signaling zzso in the development of gastric zzso we investigated the gastric zzso of the zzso zzso which is a zzso model for familial zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso We found that aged zzso mice spontaneously develop multiple tumors in the stomach, which are accompanied by loss of zzso of zzso Such tumors consisted of zzso zzso with strong nuclear zzso of zzso Even a single zzso zzso already showed nuclear zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is an initiating event in gastric zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 expressions, which are zzso targets of zzso increased in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reporter transgenic mice with zzso zzso showed higher levels of the zzso activity of zzso in the gastric zzso We also treated zzso and zzso mice with zzso zzso an zzso agent that zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso mice significantly enhanced the tumor development in comparison with zzso mice or zzso zzso zzso Several gastric tumors in zzso zzso mice showed invasion into the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso may play an important role in at least subset of gastric zzso In addition, zzso mice combined with zzso could be a useful short-term model to investigate zzso zzso in the zzso
