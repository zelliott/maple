zzso transmission is based on the regulated zzso fusion of synaptic zzso filled with zzso In order to sustain neurotransmitter release, these zzso need to be recycled zzso Recent data suggest that two tracks for the cycling of synaptic zzso zzso a slow track in which zzso fuse completely with the zzso plasma zzso followed by zzso recycling of the zzso zzso and a fast track that may zzso to the transient opening and closing of a fusion zzso In this review, we attempt to provide an overview of the components involved in both tracks of zzso zzso as well as to identify possible zzso links between these two zzso
