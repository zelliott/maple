zzso scaffolds bring together multiple components of a zzso pathway, thereby promoting signal propagation along a common physical zzso zzso play a prominent role in natural zzso pathways and provide a promising platform for synthetic zzso To better understand how scaffolding zzso affects signal transmission, we conducted an in zzso sensitivity analysis of the zzso mating zzso to a broad range of zzso in the abundance of the scaffold zzso Our zzso show that signal zzso exhibits a zzso dependence on scaffold concentration and that altering the amount of scaffold binding partners zzso this zzso zzso zzso the zzso level of zzso is approximately zzso below the optimum needed to maximize signal zzso This zzso zzso may be a zzso as increasing zzso expression promotes baseline zzso of the mating zzso Furthermore, operating at a zzso level of zzso may provide regulatory flexibility as tuning zzso expression up or down directly zzso the downstream zzso zzso Our quantitative analysis reveals performance tradeoffs in zzso zzso and defines engineering challenges for implementing molecular scaffolds in synthetic zzso
