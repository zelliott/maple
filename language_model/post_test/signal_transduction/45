Recent research links zzso obesity zzso with impaired zzso although the underlying mechanisms remain zzso We find that the induction of zzso NO zzso zzso and zzso is suppressed in mice with zzso and in bone zzso zzso zzso from mice with zzso exposed to an oral zzso zzso zzso zzso from lean mice zzso with free fatty acids zzso and exposed to zzso zzso also exhibit a diminished induction of zzso and zzso zzso from lean and obese mice exposed to zzso zzso and analyzed by a zzso protein array show a reduction of zzso only in zzso from mice with zzso This reduction is responsible for diminished zzso zzso and diminished induction of zzso and zzso We next observed that zzso zzso 2 zzso is suppressed in zzso from zzso mice whereas zzso zzso protein zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso is zzso This zzso stems from defective zzso zzso In zzso from lean mice, both zzso and zzso separate zzso an increase in zzso However, in zzso from zzso mice, zzso can no longer inhibit the zzso increase in zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso This zzso can then be restored by zzso zzso zzso into zzso from zzso zzso Thus, feeding mice a high-fat diet over time zzso the zzso zzso pool, initially via zzso zzso zzso and later when the defective zzso is unable to inhibit zzso zzso These findings unveil a link between obesity and innate zzso
