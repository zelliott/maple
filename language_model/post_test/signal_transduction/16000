The key visual G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the outer segment zzso and inner compartments of rod zzso in a zzso manner thereby contributing to adaptation and zzso of zzso A zzso zzso 119 protein zzso also known as zzso Gene 4 protein zzso has been recently implicated in zzso transport to the zzso in the dark through its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the interaction of human zzso zzso with zzso is dependent on the zzso but does not require the zzso form of zzso The zzso specificity of zzso is zzso zzso bound the zzso N zzso of zzso with much higher affinity than a zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso protein zzso did not interact with the zzso zzso zzso was capable of interacting with zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso This interaction of zzso with zzso led to displacement of zzso from the zzso Furthermore, zzso facilitated zzso of zzso from zzso rod zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso but had no effect on the zzso by zzso A model for the role of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso is proposed based on the zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso from each other and the zzso We also found that zzso inhibited zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso Thus, zzso may play zzso zzso role in regulation of zzso protein signaling in zzso zzso
