zzso is a zzso zzso generated by zzso of sequences from the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso 9 into the zzso gene on zzso zzso Alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso are produced that are characteristic of chronic zzso leukemia and acute zzso zzso zzso Their role in the zzso of human leukemia remains to be zzso We have previously shown that the zzso effect of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso In addition to zzso is a protein essential for transformation by zzso However, it is not known how zzso and Ras fit together in cell transformation by zzso The data presented here establish that zzso is a downstream target gene of the Ras zzso zzso in cells transformed by zzso and that zzso Ras zzso results in zzso expression of the zzso zzso a truncated form of the zzso which lacks a critical zzso region required for zzso of the Ras zzso pathway, failed to induce zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso prevents zzso by inducing zzso through a zzso zzso involving Ras and links zzso Ras zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso these results further imply that Ras is involved in both zzso signals and survival zzso
