zzso in zzso are associated with diseases and zzso zzso Proper zzso function is required for sonic zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and for zzso growth factor zzso signaling in zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in these pathways remains zzso To begin addressing this issue, we are characterizing putative zzso proteins in zzso zzso that are predicted to have regulatory rather than structural zzso In this report, we characterized the novel zzso protein zzso zzso zzso transport associated protein zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso 5 zzso We found that, unlike the zzso transport zzso zzso disruption of zzso does not result in overt zzso assembly zzso nor did it cause zzso or zzso avoidance defects typical of zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso zzso have an extended lifespan zzso and are defective in zzso zzso Our analysis indicates that these zzso result from defects in the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso sensory zzso We conclude that zzso is not a zzso protein but rather is a regulator of specific zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso zzso is also found in zzso raising the possibility that its function has been zzso during zzso
