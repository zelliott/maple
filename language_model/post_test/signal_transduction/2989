To explore the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in improving insulin resistance through observing its effect on the insulin resistance of zzso zzso induced by free fatty acid zzso 

zzso zzso was induced by a culture solution containing insulin, zzso and zzso to mature zzso and it was divided into six groups: the control group zzso zzso the model group zzso model zzso and the four drug treatment group exposed to zzso zzso zzso group), zzso zzso zzso group), zzso zzso zzso group), and zzso zzso zzso group), zzso zzso zzso in various groups, except those in the normal group, were established into insulin resistance model by zzso induction and treated respectively with corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions at the fourth, zzso and eighth day were observed using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso transportation in various groups were observed by zzso intake zzso zzso expression of zzso binding protein zzso was determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso 

zzso expression increased zzso and it showed lower levels at the fourth, zzso and eighth day in all treatment groups than that in the model zzso zzso transportation determination showed that the transportation in the model group was zzso significantly lower than that in the normal group zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the model group, they were significantly higher in the zzso and the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso expression and zzso distribution of zzso were higher in the two zzso treated groups than those in the model group, zzso 

zzso could markedly improve the insulin resistance of zzso zzso which is realized possibly by way of zzso zzso path, promoting zzso zzso to cell membrane to increase the transportation of zzso
