zzso II zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in vascular fibrosis, which leads to serious complications in hypertension and zzso However, the underlying signaling mechanisms are largely zzso In zzso patients, we found that zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso This observation was further investigated in zzso by stimulating mouse primary zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso with zzso zzso There were several novel zzso First, zzso II was able to activate an early zzso signaling zzso directly at 15 to 30 zzso This was zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso dependent but transforming growth zzso zzso independent because zzso zzso zzso signaling was blocked by addition of zzso inhibitor and by zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso II zzso or conditional deletion of zzso Second, zzso II was also able to activate the late zzso signaling zzso at 24 hours, which was zzso dependent because it was blocked by the zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso of zzso but not zzso was a key and necessary mechanism of zzso zzso vascular zzso because zzso II induced zzso promoter activities and collagen zzso expression was abolished in zzso zzso for zzso but not zzso Thus, we concluded that zzso II zzso vascular zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso is a key mechanism by which zzso II mediates zzso
