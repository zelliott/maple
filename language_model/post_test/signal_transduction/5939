The studies described here, including ours and those of others, were aimed at understanding the zzso by which the T cell zzso zzso zzso signals that result in expression of zzso zzso They have focused both on the zzso molecules and zzso events that account for zzso zzso as well as on the more zzso nuclear regulatory zzso It is now clear that the zzso is coupled to the zzso pathway, apparently via zzso changes in zzso possibly amplification by zzso and likely a G zzso zzso second zzso appear to contribute to subsequent gene expression events, but may not be required for zzso zzso How these zzso events are coupled to gene expression still remains a zzso However, studies of the regulation of the zzso gene indicate that the zzso zzso events must occur continuously for 2-4 hours to support zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and that protein synthesis during this time is zzso Other zzso such as the zzso zzso become zzso active within 15 minutes of zzso triggering even in the presence of protein synthesis zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso zzso events to expression of the zzso gene may be dependent on the induction of a regulatory zzso This zzso may act to activate the zzso gene via a 275 zzso segment that lies upstream of the zzso coding zzso Studies are now in progress to understand better the molecular requirements for competence in signal zzso and conversion of these signals into gene expression zzso
