zzso is a potent regulator of the inflammatory response and binds to and zzso zzso A zzso zzso A is a member of the zzso protein zzso which has regulatory roles in the inflammatory response and in the zzso zzso Fibrosis can occur following cell injury and cell death induced by agents such as zzso radiation zzso zzso is used to treat cancer and marked zzso response is a normal tissue zzso consequence in a fraction of patients under the current dose zzso The discovery and development of a therapeutic to abate zzso in these zzso patients would be a major advance for cancer zzso Likewise, prediction of which patients are susceptible to zzso would enable zzso of treatment and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive zzso control and better zzso treatment zzso The levels of zzso A and zzso were measured in zzso derived from patients who developed severe zzso zzso following zzso and compared to zzso from patients who did zzso Both zzso and zzso A gene expression levels were increased following zzso and the zzso gene expression level was lower in the zzso from zzso patients compared to controls at both zzso levels and after zzso The major zzso transcript zzso were found to have a similar response to zzso and both were reduced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso A zzso in the zzso culture medium also increased in response to zzso and the relative zzso protein levels were significantly lower in the samples derived from zzso zzso The decrease in the zzso levels can lead to an increased zzso of zzso A and hence may provide a useful measurement to identify patients at risk of a severe zzso response to zzso Additionally, zzso by its ability to zzso the actions of zzso A may be of value as an zzso for radiation induced zzso
