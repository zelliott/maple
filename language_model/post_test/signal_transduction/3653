Two important functions of zzso zzso zzso suppression of immune system function and feedback repression of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso through repression of gene zzso Previous studies have indicated that this repression is exerted in part through antagonism between the zzso receptors zzso and the zzso family of zzso zzso However, this mechanism could not account for repression of the zzso zzso zzso an important regulator of the zzso zzso Our recent identification of the orphan nuclear zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso induction of zzso zzso led us, in the present work, to show that zzso antagonize this positive signal at two zzso First, zzso partly blunt the zzso induction of zzso zzso and second, they antagonize zzso zzso zzso repression is exerted by antagonism of zzso action on the zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso antagonism of zzso activity was observed in response to zzso stimuli in both zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso each other on their zzso DNA zzso In zzso binding experiments as well as zzso analysis of zzso suggest that the mechanism of zzso antagonism of zzso is very similar to that of the antagonism between zzso and zzso The convergence of positive signals zzso by zzso (and also probably by related family zzso and negative signals exerted by zzso appears to be a general mechanism for control of transcription, since it is active in both zzso and zzso zzso
