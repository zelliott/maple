zzso cancer is the sixth most common cause of zzso death zzso Because of very poor zzso survival new therapeutic approaches are zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the growth of various tumors but its effect on zzso zzso known to express zzso remains zzso We therefore studied the zzso potency of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso induced growth zzso of the human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso cell line zzso as well as of primary cell cultures of human zzso zzso Combining zzso with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the zzso zzso A zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in additive or even synergistic zzso zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso The zzso signaling involved the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of the cell cycle promoter zzso zzso However, zzso did not induce immediate zzso or zzso in zzso cancer zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso appears to be a promising novel approach for innovative treatment strategies of zzso cancer, as it powerfully induced growth zzso and cell cycle arrest in human zzso cancer cells and enhanced the zzso effects of other targeted zzso
