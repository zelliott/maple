The innate immune system employs a number of pattern recognition zzso families in response to zzso and zzso either from invading microbes or within the zzso These include the zzso receptors zzso the zzso acid zzso gene I zzso like receptors zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso among other potential sensors in the zzso These receptors are composed of modular domain architecture, with zzso zzso zzso and signaling zzso regulated either through zzso or zzso changes directed by zzso zzso Signaling pathways from different families of receptors zzso on their respective common adapter proteins and lead to zzso of zzso factors or zzso Many of these receptors induce orchestrated responses to similar zzso from different cell types, resulting in redundant and complementary immunity to zzso This highly efficient defense system is a double-edged zzso inappropriate reaction to host zzso leads to compromised innate tolerance and zzso zzso zzso studies of innate immune receptors and their signaling pathways are essential in our understanding of pattern recognition mechanisms and design of more efficient vaccine zzso
