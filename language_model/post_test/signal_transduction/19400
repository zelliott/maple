zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso has been confirmed to be closely associated with gastric inflammation and zzso but the mechanism behind it is little zzso In this study, we try to determine roles of zzso strain in zzso zzso signaling pathway, and affecting expression of zzso and zzso and also in releasing zzso in host zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso and zzso strain infected zzso cells were detected by zzso Two quantitative zzso were established to measure zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso and zzso strain infected zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso pathway, was used to define effect of the zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso strain could induce an obvious zzso of zzso zzso in the infected zzso cells while zzso strain failed to do zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain infected zzso cells showed significant drops both in zzso and zzso zzso levels, whereas the zzso zzso zzso strain caused a remarkable increase in zzso zzso without affecting zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains enabled zzso cells to produce close elevated levels of zzso and the zzso block resulted in unexpected zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso can activate zzso zzso that plays an zzso role in zzso release in zzso zzso infected zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent negative regulation of zzso and zzso expression might be involved in zzso zzso
