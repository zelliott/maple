Several recent studies suggest that systemic aging in zzso is zzso affected by functional decline in specific zzso such as skeletal zzso In zzso longevity appears to be tightly linked to zzso and the formation of zzso protein zzso is a hallmark of zzso in aging zzso Similarly, defective zzso is described as an important contributor to the pathology of several age-related degenerative muscle diseases in humans, zzso inclusion body zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a central role in a zzso signaling zzso activated by a variety of stressful zzso Aging zzso zzso zzso flies display accelerated motor function decline, zzso with an enhanced zzso of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso Chemical genetic experiments suggest that zzso regulation of zzso is not limited to the control of zzso oxygen species production or the protein degradation pathways but also involves upstream turnover zzso zzso zzso Using affinity zzso and mass zzso we identified zzso as a novel zzso of zzso zzso in aging muscle and showed that the genetic interaction between zzso and zzso controls muscle zzso formation, locomotor function, and zzso zzso analyses of zzso in aging and stressed muscle suggest a model zzso zzso zzso signaling causes a zzso of zzso between a zzso pool and a putative zzso zzso zzso
