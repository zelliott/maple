At zzso zzso and zzso cells get in direct contact with each other via cell zzso molecules zzso Several zzso have been identified at the zzso junction and at central zzso where they regulate synaptic strength, by recruiting scaffolding zzso neurotransmitter receptors and synaptic zzso in response to the binding of zzso across the synaptic zzso Many zzso are also surrounded by zzso processes and embedded in conspicuous zzso zzso zzso It is now widely recognized that zzso play a central role in regulating the synaptic machinery by exchanging information with the zzso elements via zzso molecules and direct physical zzso this has lead to the concept of the zzso zzso More recently, the term zzso zzso has been introduced to zzso the importance of zzso in shaping synaptic function by zzso interaction and signaling between zzso and zzso Here, we will review how this integrated view of the zzso can help us understand zzso synaptic plasticity at the zzso junction and in the central nervous zzso We will explore how synaptic zzso regulate two forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of synaptic currents to counteract changes in zzso network activity and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso neurotransmitter release in response to changes in zzso zzso We will discuss recent findings on zzso zzso signaling events and the role of cell zzso in the feedback control of network zzso This article is part of the Special zzso entitled zzso zzso zzso
