zzso growth zzso zzso is an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso which is distinguished from zzso by its zzso structure and potent transforming zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso less efficient zzso zzso and zzso than does zzso zzso et zzso 1997, zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso and zzso zzso to show that the duration of zzso zzso induced by a single zzso exposure is less than that induced by zzso zzso The protein trafficking inhibitor zzso A zzso reduces the duration of zzso zzso to an extent similar to that seen with zzso alone; the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso degradation are opposite, however, with zzso sparing zzso from zzso but zzso accelerating zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso blocks zzso recycling and thus shortens zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso shortens zzso zzso and thus blocks zzso zzso zzso with this, repeated application of zzso is accompanied by prolonged zzso expression and zzso whereas similar application of zzso causes zzso zzso and signal zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso may perpetuate zzso zzso by permitting early zzso zzso and zzso within zzso zzso thereby zzso a zzso zzso signal and creating an irreversible zzso growth zzso
