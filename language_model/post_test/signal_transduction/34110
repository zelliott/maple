zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strong migratory stimulant for zzso stem and zzso cells zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cell factor zzso and zzso 11 zzso are able to stimulate amplification of primitive zzso zzso stem cells zzso in zzso The effects of these zzso on zzso migratory activity of zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso of these cells in the presence of 12 combinations of FL, zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was measured in a three-dimensional collagen zzso using zzso video zzso Each zzso combination had a distinct effect on zzso migratory zzso For instance, zzso and zzso cells showed a high migratory zzso response, while cells cultivated with zzso zzso and zzso did not react to zzso stimulation with an elevated migration zzso Our data indicate that the differences in the migratory zzso response are not related to different zzso expression levels, but rather to the differential engagement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso can have a significant impact on zzso migratory activity and the underlying zzso signaling processes in cultivated zzso
