zzso are major zzso constituents of the zzso plasma zzso Without certain zzso cells and/or zzso cannot survive, indicating that zzso possess important zzso functions that are not zzso for by other zzso One such role may be zzso Recent studies have revealed that some zzso zzso such as zzso bases zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso act as signaling zzso The addition of zzso groups to zzso and zzso generates zzso and zzso zzso These zzso exhibit completely different functions than those of their zzso In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the functions of zzso and zzso in zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso and zzso are mutually convertible, regulation of not only the total amount of the each zzso but also of the overall balance in cellular levels is zzso zzso we describe in detail their zzso zzso as well as the genes involved in each zzso
