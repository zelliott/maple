Earlier, we showed that in cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso in a signal zzso zzso involving zzso which is activated by zzso radiation zzso to mediate zzso arrest and enhanced zzso We also observed that zzso zzso zzso expression and activity and the zzso response of the zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso and zzso pathways are key targets of novel zzso zzso we examined the chronic zzso of expression and activity of those pathways by zzso alone in zzso models of lung zzso 

zzso mice were grafted with human lung zzso and zzso cells, were treated with a single fraction of 0 or zzso and left to grow for zzso zzso tumors were subjected to zzso and zzso or fixation and zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited significantly zzso growth and was associated with increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso of two zzso targets, zzso and checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased total zzso levels and zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to enhanced expression and zzso of zzso and zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso had reduced zzso of zzso zzso and it's target translation initiation inhibitor zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso density, reduced expression of zzso but increased expression of zzso factor zzso zzso compared to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso growth and results in sustained expression and zzso of zzso and zzso but partial zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Future studies should examine causality between those events and explore whether further zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways by novel zzso can sensitize lung zzso to zzso
