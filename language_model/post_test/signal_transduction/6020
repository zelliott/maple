The expression of zzso zzso is known to be involved in gastric zzso and tumor zzso but little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the zzso of zzso We examined the involvement of two growth zzso systems, zzso and transforming growth factor zzso in the induction of zzso in human gastric cancer zzso 

zzso expression was detected by zzso in surgical specimens obtained from 166 patients with advanced gastric zzso possible correlations between the expression of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso were then zzso 

zzso protein was zzso in 91 zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with a differentiated zzso type, deep invasion, and positive zzso zzso zzso zzso was frequently zzso in zzso tumors (19 of 22, zzso and in zzso tumors zzso of 104, zzso but irrelevant to the zzso expression zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso and the reduction in zzso were all associated with a poor patient zzso A zzso analysis demonstrated a significantly poor outcome for the zzso zzso of zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

These results support the possibility that signal zzso via zzso and the zzso system may be implicated in zzso expression and that the reduction of zzso may be, in part, of zzso significance in the zzso zzso of zzso which is associated with a poor prognosis for patients with gastric zzso
