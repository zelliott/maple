Following zzso zzso in zzso centers, B cells develop into memory B cells or plasma zzso zzso via zzso zzso receptors by zzso zzso and direct zzso contact by B and T cells plays an important role in the B cell differentiation into memory or plasma zzso Adult human peripheral blood B cells are separated into three zzso by the expression of zzso and zzso which belong to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family: zzso zzso zzso B cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso zzso B cells are larger cells with abundant zzso carrying zzso zzso and have an ability to produce zzso indicating that zzso is a memory marker of B zzso The zzso of zzso yields crucial signals that positively control the entry of B cells into the zzso to plasma zzso We review observations on zzso and differentiation of mature zzso by zzso cell interaction via zzso as compared with zzso interaction, and discuss about memory B zzso
