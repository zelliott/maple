We used a zzso zzso technique to record in zzso cavities of barley leaves the zzso pH response to different stress zzso When zzso (or zzso activity at the roots of intact plants was increased from 1 to 50 zzso the leaf zzso pH increased by zzso to zzso units within 8 to 12 zzso when zzso were open, and within 15 to 20 zzso when zzso were zzso This reaction was accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of 1 zzso zzso acid caused an zzso zzso of zzso to zzso units, and low temperatures (4 degrees zzso increased pH by zzso to zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso zzso or pH changes in the range zzso to zzso had no effect, ruling out that zzso potential and/or pH is the carried zzso On detached leaves, the same treatments yielded zzso similar results, suggesting that the zzso is the most likely signal zzso Following the attack of powdery zzso the zzso pH of barley leaves substantially zzso We demonstrate that in susceptible zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso chemical zzso zzso acid zzso zzso markedly enhances this pH zzso This is consistent with previous finding that zzso zzso is related to the degree of resistance towards this zzso
