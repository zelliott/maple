The zzso zzso zzso zzso was initially identified as a specific vascular growth factor that governed several properties of zzso cells under both zzso and pathological zzso It was subsequently found that zzso the natural zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which in turn regulates the survival and zzso of zzso cells, controls vascular zzso and regulates the zzso zzso that occurs during normal zzso such as through development and zzso zzso zzso also seems to play a crucial role in several vascular zzso such as familial zzso zzso Beyond its critical role in zzso zzso also appears to maintain the long-term population and zzso status of zzso stem cells in the bone zzso stem cell zzso In cancer, zzso was originally found to be zzso in zzso zzso More recently, our laboratory and others have found that zzso is also expressed outside the vascular compartment in several types of cancer, including leukemia and solid zzso such as gastric tumors, breast tumors, and zzso The role of zzso in these zzso cells is currently being zzso In this regard, our group reported the importance of zzso zzso cells in their zzso to the zzso zzso Because cancer may be considered as a complex organ with several cellular lineages zzso in the same zzso the expression of zzso by different zzso compartments makes this cellular zzso an attractive target for cancer zzso
