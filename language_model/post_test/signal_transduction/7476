zzso respond differently to DNA damaging agents, which may related to cell context and differentiation zzso The aim of present study was to observe the cellular and molecular responses of cells in different differentiation status to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso unit of zzso small zzso was adopted as a cell differentiation zzso DNA damage responses zzso of zzso and zzso were observed zzso h after 12 zzso zzso using gene expression zzso analysis, zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso Shift zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that most zzso expressed genes were related to zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso after zzso and in both zzso and zzso zzso after zzso In zzso stem zzso cells, zzso was zzso and zzso quickly, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso increased and zzso into nuclear with the ability to bind zzso zzso In upper zzso zzso amplifying zzso and zzso zzso cells kept survive and zzso as indicated by retained zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and rare zzso 

zzso varied with cell differentiation status and cell function in small zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso could be an important regulatory mechanism of zzso
