In zzso zzso development, zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso by establishing the zzso center, which in turn leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are essential for embryonic zzso since they mediate zzso zzso zzso and can zzso zzso zzso zzso links zzso to the zzso zzso To study the role of zzso zzso in early development, we have made deletion zzso of zzso The binding domain of zzso has been mapped to the zzso 210 zzso acids of zzso zzso of zzso lacking the zzso 230 zzso acids causes severe zzso defects that reflect impaired zzso zzso zzso Lack of normal adhesive interactions results in a loss of the zzso in early zzso and ripping of the zzso layer during zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso full-length zzso or a zzso of zzso that lacks the internal zzso zzso We next show that zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso This can be seen zzso or by studying the effects of expression on the downstream zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso is essential for proper zzso of the zzso and may act as a regulator of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso
