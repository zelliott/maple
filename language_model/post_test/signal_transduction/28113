In the present study zzso zzso was immortalized in transgenic mice by expressing zzso virus 40 T zzso under a zzso mouse zzso zzso 5 promoter zzso zzso zzso was associated with an increase in zzso zzso and a marked decrease in zzso zzso with a zzso lower level in the zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso in the immortalized corpus and zzso zzso zzso it is possible that the normally high zzso expression in the zzso is one of the factors contributing to the highly resistant nature of zzso toward zzso zzso different zzso cell lines were generated from the immortalized zzso and the cells expressed several genes typical for zzso zzso such as mouse zzso 1, mouse zzso protein 9, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and 4, zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso This indicated the differentiated status of the cells and their usefulness for analyzing zzso gene expression in zzso As zzso is considered to be one of the zzso factors responsible for zzso gene zzso we further studied its regulation in zzso cells in zzso The data showed that zzso zzso expression is regulated in the zzso via protein zzso A and zzso signaling zzso zzso protein zzso A resulted in zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso whereas no significant effect on zzso expression was found by modulating the protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
