Cellular zzso development for the zzso differentiation gene zzso family of zzso receptors zzso and related zzso zzso receptors is complicated by zzso zzso expression and divergent zzso zzso zzso expressed LP receptors exist in most tissue culture cell zzso These LP zzso along with other zzso expressed zzso contribute to zzso signaling that can complicate interpretation of zzso cellular zzso zzso These receptors also activate a diverse and divergent set of cellular signaling zzso zzso the use of a variety of zzso formats with mismatched procedures and functional zzso This zzso examination and comparison of these receptors across the entire zzso The Tango technology uses the zzso zzso zzso zzso process to allow interrogation of the zzso and related receptors with a single functional zzso This method also zzso the target zzso zzso allowing the use of tissue culture cell lines regardless of their zzso zzso zzso The authors describe the use of this technique to build zzso zzso zzso for all 8 members of the zzso zzso family as well as the related zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso In addition, they demonstrate the value of this technology for identification and investigation of functionally selective zzso compounds as demonstrated by the zzso compound zzso and its action at the zzso and zzso zzso
