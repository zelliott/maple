zzso growth factor zzso stimulates growth in various types of cells, but little is known about its effect on cardiac zzso zzso we examined whether zzso had a direct effect on cardiac zzso and investigated their zzso signaling zzso 

A primary culture of chick embryonic zzso and Hamilton stage zzso zzso zzso was zzso Cellular growth was estimated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso incorporation zzso The number of zzso binding sites was measured by binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso zzso The binding activity of zzso protein zzso was examined by zzso mobility shift zzso The zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed by Western zzso analysis, zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso concentration zzso was measured with zzso and zzso zzso channel current zzso was recorded with the patch clamp zzso 

zzso and zzso but not zzso increased viable cell number (5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 101 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso and DNA synthesis (104 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso number of zzso zzso zzso binding sites was 5 zzso 1, 63 zzso 12, 126 zzso 24 zzso cells, zzso zzso provoked induction of zzso zzso and increases in binding activity to the zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso zzso the increased zzso binding activity and the acceleration of DNA synthesis were all attenuated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor (10 or 50 zzso zzso Interestingly, protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the increases of zzso binding activity to some extent, but did not inhibit the zzso induction at zzso The zzso states of zzso were not significantly affected by zzso zzso did not alter zzso or zzso 

We conclude that zzso can exert direct effects on embryonic cardiac zzso and induce their zzso zzso cascade may play an important role in the zzso embryonic zzso zzso
