zzso 3A zzso is an important zzso repulsive guidance factor for many developing zzso zzso continues to be expressed in adulthood, and expression of its zzso zzso zzso can be altered by nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso the pelvic zzso are particularly susceptible to damage during pelvic surgical procedures, and failure to zzso or zzso growth of sympathetic and zzso nerves lead to organ zzso However, it is not known if adult pelvic zzso are potential targets for zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso were assessed in adult rat pelvic zzso zzso in culture using a growth cone collapse zzso 

zzso caused growth cone collapse in both zzso and sympathetic zzso expressing zzso However, the effect of zzso was zzso by distinct zzso zzso zzso pathways in each zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso of protein zzso A were required for growth cone zzso In sympathetic zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso can also cause collapse but was not zzso zzso zzso collapse in sympathetic zzso may require zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels zzso 

We propose that zzso is an important guidance factor for adult pelvic zzso zzso and that manipulation of their distinct zzso mechanisms could potentially promote functional selective zzso or zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is also the first study to zzso zzso in regulating growth cone dynamics of adult zzso
