zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is critical for the loss of growth control in a variety of human zzso including zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso signaling pathways including Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been primarily demonstrated in zzso zzso Gene disruption studies suggest potentially distinct functions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso by two genes closely linked on human zzso zzso To determine the function of zzso in zzso growth control, we studied the expression and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in normal and transformed human zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso of zzso was detected in transformed compared with normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells zzso zzso with dominant negative zzso zzso failed to zzso in zzso In contrast, targeting of zzso using either zzso or dominant negative strategies had no effect on cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso growth of transformed zzso cells is dependent on zzso of zzso but not zzso
