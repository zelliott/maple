To evaluate the effects of zzso zzso gene transfer of zzso and zzso zzso on proliferation and invasion of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were designed as the control zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso and zzso were respectively detected with zzso and western zzso In order to find out the changes of proliferation and invasion power of zzso cell lines, we analyzed the data by zzso zzso chamber and evaluated zzso of cell with flow zzso We treated zzso nude mice with zzso and zzso and tumor control rate zzso in nude mice was zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the corresponding zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso The experiment of permeated artificial zzso membrane showed that the invasion power of zzso cell lines were on the decline after treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The values of zzso wavelength light zzso were different in the five zzso The number of alive cells in the group of zzso was lower than others in the 6th d zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso zzso and zzso group with zzso were zzso and there were significant differences between treated and control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor transplantation experiment in zzso nude mice showed that zzso injection of zzso and zzso zzso could inhibit tumor zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso gene therapy zzso by zzso may be useful for zzso growth and invasion of zzso through a zzso zzso These results provided a novel therapeutic target in preventing gastric cancer cell invasion and zzso
