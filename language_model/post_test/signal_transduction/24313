zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was previously shown to have zzso activity on zzso zzso Since zzso Ras mediates zzso in part, through the zzso of the zzso factor nuclear zzso B zzso B), we tested here the effects of zzso on zzso B zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells led to decreased zzso B binding and activity, as well as the expression of the zzso B target gene zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso led to a dramatic decrease in colony formation by zzso zzso zzso cells, a finding comparable to the expression of the I zzso B alpha zzso zzso which could be rescued by zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso was unable to directly inhibit the activity of zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso B zzso suggesting that zzso affected an upstream signaling zzso induced by zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso expression decreased both the rate of I zzso B alpha turnover and the activities of zzso alpha and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso expression of a zzso active version of either zzso reversed the negative effects of zzso Ras can induce zzso B via both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso while partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was able to counteract the effect of zzso on zzso B, whereas zzso activated zzso was only partially zzso zzso zzso blocked membrane zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these results strongly argue that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso transformation are due to its ability to inhibit signaling pathways that lead to zzso of zzso zzso
