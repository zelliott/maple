zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso small zzso zzso has been shown to be associated with zzso zzso and implicated in the insulin action on zzso transport in rat zzso In the present study, we investigated the insulin effects on the zzso zzso exchange on zzso In zzso zzso rat zzso the amount of zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso increased in a zzso manner during 45 zzso of the incubation zzso zzso of insulin resulted in about a zzso stimulation of the binding of zzso to zzso indicating that insulin zzso the zzso zzso exchange on the zzso zzso of the cells with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso completely abolished the zzso effect of insulin on zzso binding to zzso zzso also attenuated the zzso binding to zzso in the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso activity may be essential for regulation of zzso zzso exchange on the zzso and insulin may zzso the exchange activity by stimulating the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso fraction to the soluble fraction was also inhibited by zzso These results suggest that insulin stimulates the zzso zzso exchange on zzso via a zzso zzso signaling zzso and that zzso is one of possible targets of insulin action on zzso zzso traffic in rat zzso
