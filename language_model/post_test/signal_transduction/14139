Bone zzso proteins zzso are members of the zzso Growth zzso zzso family implicated in many zzso processes in zzso such as zzso axes zzso Their wide variety of actions is in part controlled by zzso that impede the interaction of zzso with their specific zzso Here, we focused our attention on the zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso family of zzso Although they are zzso in zzso few data are available for this family in other zzso zzso In order to understand the evolution of potential zzso roles of these zzso in zzso we identified the members of this family in the zzso zzso and characterized their expression patterns during embryonic zzso Our data suggest that the function of zzso zzso genes is zzso among zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso genes seem to have acquired divergent expression patterns in each zzso zzso On the other hand, the expression of zzso in the zzso neural plate border during early zzso strengthens the hypothesis of a zzso neural plate border gene network in zzso
