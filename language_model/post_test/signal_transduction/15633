Parkinson's disease zzso is a complex zzso zzso frequently occurring in elderly zzso To investigate zzso tiny zzso zzso gene regulation, zzso zzso zzso was used to predict human zzso target sites on selected 29 genes related to zzso To verify output generated from zzso a similar analysis was performed only for zzso target sites in zzso using zzso zzso zzso Data extracted by zzso zzso the mode of zzso action based on the location of target sites in the Parkinson zzso Sites prone to action of multiple zzso were identified as zzso zzso Important properties of each zzso including zzso and zzso appear to contribute towards a complex interplay between zzso and their zzso Two sets of predicted results were explored for the occurrence of target sites of 112 zzso expressed in zzso Overall, convergence of results predicted by two zzso revealed that 48 target sites for zzso zzso occur in close proximity in 9 zzso This study will pave a way for selection of potential zzso candidates for Parkinson's zzso genes for quick therapeutic applications and zzso
