The zzso zzso plays an important role in animal organ size control, which it exerts by regulating tissue proliferation and zzso rates as a response to zzso cues, cell zzso and zzso With the ever increasing advance in zzso sequencing and analysis tools, our understanding of the animal world and its evolution has greatly increased in the recent zzso We used zzso tools to study the evolution of the zzso zzso focusing on the zzso zzso zzso which is a pivotal zzso of the zzso The aim was to establish the origin and mode of development of zzso and its zzso in the animal zzso Some zzso members can be already identified in zzso zzso like the zzso that have preceded zzso zzso Interestingly, we can find most of the components that are present in human in the zzso zzso which belongs to a very zzso group of zzso the zzso All the major zzso of zzso have been zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso can be identified even in the more zzso zzso zzso We show a very high degree of conservation in regions such as the WW and the zzso zzso zzso being the major zzso partner of zzso zzso we found that the location of an zzso in the zzso zzso region has been zzso along an evolutionary span of over 700 zzso We have followed the evolutionary changes in zzso and in other main components of the zzso from the first zzso such as zzso described the zzso relationships between the zzso genes and indicated where zzso and other components have been zzso zzso Evidence is provided that zzso and its binding partner zzso demonstrate strong zzso This gives further support for the importance of the zzso zzso Beyond contributing to an understanding of the evolutionary history of this pathway, we have provided insights into the zzso of this pathway, its functions and its mode of operation in animals with different body plans, development, and life zzso
