zzso cells predominantly use zzso zzso and zzso zzso in various zzso signal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso organisms employ numerous zzso systems, in which signaling is achieved by transferring a zzso group from zzso in the zzso zzso component to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In the last several years, genetic screens and zzso projects have identified sensor zzso and response regulators in lower zzso and plants, revealing that zzso organisms also make use of zzso zzso in a limited number of signaling zzso zzso studies in zzso have demonstrated that a variation of the zzso system, a zzso zzso is the prevailing mechanism among zzso related zzso zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso stress signals to a zzso protein zzso zzso cascade to induce zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analogous to the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso cells do not have any zzso or zzso systems, although protein zzso zzso unrelated to the sensor zzso may be involved in cellular zzso Because some zzso proteins are essential for zzso of microbial zzso including the zzso fungus zzso zzso novel antibiotics targeted to zzso may be effective against zzso pathogens without causing host cell zzso
