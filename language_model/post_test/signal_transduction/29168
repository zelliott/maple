We have developed a new concept of zzso zzso termed zzso the very strong zzso adopted by zzso This uniquely zzso property accounts for their ability to provide the zzso links in the zzso filament zzso These links are targeted by diseases, resulting in disruption of the complex with severe zzso zzso is characteristic of zzso in zzso and is believed to result from a highly ordered arrangement of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that locks their binding interaction so that it is highly resistant to zzso This ordered arrangement may be reflected by and dependent upon a similarly ordered molecular structure of the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso to a more zzso adhesive state by cell zzso involving protein zzso C, which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso takes place in wound edge zzso and appears to be accompanied by loss of the ordered arrangement causing zzso to adopt the type of weaker zzso characteristic of zzso zzso We review the evidence for zzso and speculate on the molecular basis of its zzso
