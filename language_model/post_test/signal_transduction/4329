The large molecular diversity of receptors and their zzso means that the zzso is faced with many puzzling characterization zzso First, the molecular diversity of the receptors is zzso only in part by a pharmacological approach, which zzso a satisfactory zzso zzso based solely on pharmacological zzso Second, the zzso counterpart of the numerous zzso of receptors specifically activated by single zzso zzso remains zzso Here, Philippe zzso and colleagues use the example of the zzso G zzso receptors to show that many of the apparent inconsistencies that emerge from pharmacological and molecular zzso of receptors can be better understood if the evolutionary history of the receptors is taken into zzso
