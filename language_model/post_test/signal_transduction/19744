Our previous study demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso zzso protective effects against transient cerebral zzso through zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether or not the zzso signal zzso 1/2 zzso zzso was involved in the zzso tolerance induced by zzso zzso through zzso At zzso after the end of the last zzso zzso focal cerebral zzso was induced by middle cerebral artery zzso for zzso in zzso The neurological scores and zzso volumes were evaluated at zzso after zzso The expression of zzso in the brains was also investigated in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso volumes and improved neurological outcome at zzso after zzso and the beneficial effects were abolished by zzso The blockade of zzso by zzso reversed the zzso of zzso expression induced by zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso cerebral zzso tolerance via zzso zzso zzso in zzso
