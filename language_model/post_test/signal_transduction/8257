zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso The former are partial to full zzso whereas the latter are partial to weak zzso However, most data come from studies analyzing zzso C zzso responses, although additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with these zzso We compared two zzso series of zzso and zzso measuring both zzso and zzso responses in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso or zzso zzso In addition, we zzso both groups of compounds as head shake zzso in zzso At the zzso zzso most compounds were partial zzso for both zzso Relative efficacy of some zzso was higher for both responses compared with their zzso counterparts, whereas for others, no differences were zzso At the zzso zzso most compounds behaved as partial zzso but unlike findings at zzso zzso all zzso were more zzso than their zzso zzso zzso activated only the zzso zzso at both zzso zzso zzso was selective for zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso For both zzso the rank order of efficacy of compounds differed depending upon which response was zzso The zzso were strong head shake zzso whereas their zzso zzso were not, in agreement with in zzso results and the involvement of zzso receptors in the head shake zzso Our results support the concept of functional selectivity and indicate that subtle changes in zzso structure can result in significant differences in the cellular signaling zzso
