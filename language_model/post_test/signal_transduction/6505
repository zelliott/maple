zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso represent a small family of nuclear proteins that zzso the activity of many zzso factors and act as zzso zzso for zzso modification of proteins with the small zzso modifier zzso In particular, zzso has been shown to inhibit the zzso of gene expression by the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso To assess the function of zzso in zzso we generated and analyzed mice carrying a targeted zzso of the zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso mice have no obvious zzso defects and have a normal distribution of zzso zzso zzso analysis of signaling in response to zzso and zzso zzso revealed a modest reduction in the zzso of zzso and zzso target zzso zzso analysis of total proteins and zzso proteins in transformed zzso cells showed no significant differences between zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso has a modest effect on zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a zzso with other members of the family of zzso zzso
