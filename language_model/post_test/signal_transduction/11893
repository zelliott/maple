zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an important member of the zzso zzso family and has been reported in an array of human cancer cell lines and primary human zzso zzso expression is associated with developing a new therapeutic approach for zzso In this study, we initially showed that zzso is expressed in a variety of human zzso cell zzso Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic response of targeting zzso using zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed tumor growth in zzso and in zzso including in an zzso model of zzso zzso zzso greatly enhanced the sensitivity of human zzso cells to the zzso drugs zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso activity of zzso including wound healing, invasion and zzso Further zzso studies revealed that the zzso effects of targeting zzso might be related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was an independent positive zzso marker in zzso zzso In conclusion, our data, for the first time, demonstrate that zzso zzso has zzso potential which is associated with the zzso pathway, and high zzso expression zzso poor overall survival in patients with zzso
