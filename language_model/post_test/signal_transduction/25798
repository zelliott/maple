zzso a zzso protein that determines the zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso has recently been demonstrated to be zzso by zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso results in the stabilization of zzso that is necessary to facilitate zzso zzso zzso Previous observation from zzso indicates that zzso principally zzso in the nucleus while zzso mainly zzso in the zzso which leaves us a puzzle on how zzso is recognized and then zzso by zzso in response to zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso is rapidly zzso from the zzso to the nucleus upon the cellular stimulation with zzso Using a zzso approach of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as protein degradation zzso we have demonstrated that the zzso zzso nucleus zzso is critical for zzso zzso effect that allows physical interaction between zzso and zzso and in turn zzso the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of nuclear zzso motifs on zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso Our finding reveals a cellular mechanism that zzso zzso zzso by zzso in response to zzso
