zzso is a zzso zzso zzso predominantly expressed in tissue derived from the zzso and is involved in multiple zzso zzso type 2A and zzso familiar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso is still zzso Previously, using a human zzso growth factor zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso it was shown that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso but, surprisingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso was not observed zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso In this report we describe early signaling events induced by the activated zzso fusion zzso in a cell line derived from zzso zzso zzso In these cells, activated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso complex formation of zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso also zzso is zzso This zzso was strong and sustained for at least 2 zzso zzso was abolished by the dominant negative zzso zzso showing that zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso can induce zzso zzso in a zzso dependent manner in cells derived from tissue where zzso is zzso zzso
