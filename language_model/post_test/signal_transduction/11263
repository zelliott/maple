zzso zzso signaling through G zzso stimulates zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso by an unknown mechanism that requires protein zzso zzso and zzso factor 6 zzso but is independent of zzso 3 zzso In contrast, insulin action on this process requires zzso but not zzso Here we report the identification of two proteins selectively zzso in response to zzso but not zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso scaffold protein zzso zzso zzso as well as expressed zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso protein were acutely directed to zzso zzso sites from the zzso zzso in response to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso is a dominant negative form of zzso containing the zzso portion of the zzso which binds zzso but lacks the zzso zzso site zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso to the plasma membrane without zzso insulin action on these zzso These data reveal the zzso zzso zzso as a required signaling element in the regulation of zzso recycling in zzso zzso by zzso whereas insulin signaling is directed through a different zzso
