In 2006, induced zzso stem zzso cells were generated from zzso cells by introducing zzso zzso zzso and zzso The original process was zzso maintaining the zzso of embryonic stem zzso and zzso cell cultures required an expensive zzso induced factor zzso Our goal is to find a pure compound that not only maintains zzso and zzso cell zzso but also increases zzso cell generation zzso From 15 candidate compounds we determined that 10 zzso zzso zzso an Angelica zzso zzso triggers the zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression levels in zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso cells treated with different zzso of zzso to test its usefulness for maintaining stem cell zzso zzso indicate higher expression levels of several stem cell markers in zzso zzso and zzso cells compared to controls that did not contain zzso including alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso body formation and differentiation results confirm that zzso containing medium culture was capable of maintaining zzso cell zzso after six time zzso zzso analysis data identified zzso zzso and zzso signaling as the top three zzso zzso We subsequently determined that zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels increased following zzso treatment and suppressed with the zzso zzso zzso The gene expression levels of zzso associated with the zzso zzso were also zzso zzso we used zzso zzso cells to test zzso generation efficiency following zzso zzso Our data demonstrate the ability of zzso to maintain stem cell zzso via the zzso zzso by inducing zzso expression levels, at the same time improving zzso generation zzso
