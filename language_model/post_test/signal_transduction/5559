The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso in plasma zzso zzso It is essentially expressed in the zzso zzso and along the kidney zzso The zzso convoluted zzso zzso and connecting zzso zzso in the kidney are involved in active zzso zzso but the function of the zzso has remained unclear in these zzso Here, the zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso 5 channel zzso determines active zzso zzso by forming the zzso entry zzso In this study we show that the zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso membrane of zzso Furthermore, by zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso of the zzso leads to elevated zzso currents and increases zzso zzso zzso in cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso initiated a signaling cascade that activated zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso of two putative zzso zzso sites, zzso and zzso in zzso prevented the zzso effect of zzso zzso on channel activity, as did a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the activity of zzso zzso closest zzso was not affected by the activated zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso stimulates zzso zzso influx via a zzso zzso zzso zzso
