The zzso activities of zzso have fostered a series of studies on the zzso relationship in these zzso The most extensively studied in this respect has been human zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso of the precursor protein to generate the mature zzso appears necessary for its full biological zzso The almost complete integrity of the mature zzso beta protein is also required for its ability to bind to the zzso and trigger cellular zzso However, by the use of zzso zzso and zzso or synthetic zzso it has been possible to map some zzso beta regions important for different zzso Both zzso and zzso fragments are important for zzso zzso A domain around zzso acids zzso is apparently involved in the zzso effects of zzso zzso Finally, the zzso in position zzso appears to be responsible for a restricted series of the zzso beta activities, mainly directed to the immune system, although irrelevant for zzso effects and unable of binding to the zzso The understanding of the zzso relationship of zzso obtained so far is expected to give rise within a short time to a new generation of synthetic and/or zzso derivatives to be experimented for clinical zzso
