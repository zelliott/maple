Acute zzso leukemia zzso is the most common cancer in zzso In recent years, the outcome has been globally improved by current therapies, but it remains poor in patients with high, persistent residual disease following the first course of chemotherapy, prompting evaluation of the possible beneficial effects of zzso zzso In this study, we hypothesized that the disruption of two zzso pathways controlling the zzso T cell response might zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the disease, which is considered to be poorly zzso In this study, we used zzso leukemia cells zzso transferred in mice, to generate zzso leukemia with poorly zzso cells as a model for human zzso zzso these animals were treated with several different zzso zzso We compared the efficiency of a classical, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells loaded with zzso zzso zzso to a combined treatment zzso injection of zzso zzso cells and disruption of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso T zzso zzso zzso We show that this combined treatment resulted in zzso zzso with in zzso generation of immune memory, and zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the disruption of these two zzso pathways zzso with zzso by zzso cells loaded with zzso zzso and zzso the way for the testing of this combination in clinical zzso
