Exposure of cells or zzso to zzso stress zzso the expression of some zzso proteins zzso including zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, heat stress zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso We examined whether zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso to elevate zzso activity and whether zzso zzso is involved in the recovery from HS zzso HS zzso degrees C for 3 zzso elevated zzso activity and expression of zzso in the zzso membrane zzso HS increased the zzso transport rate zzso but did not affect the apparent affinity constant zzso for zzso The zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso growth factor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso into the cells inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest that HS zzso zzso zzso and then zzso forms a complex with zzso and increases the distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso Next, we examined the effect of HS on plasma membrane zzso zzso of zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso was decreased by HS and then returned to zzso zzso This recovery was inhibited by zzso a selective zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the recovery of zzso zzso Taken together, the present results show that HS zzso zzso activity zzso via the zzso signaling zzso and that the increase in zzso zzso is necessary to repair plasma membrane zzso
