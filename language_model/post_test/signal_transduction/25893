zzso necrosis zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso that is zzso in various zzso diseases including zzso and diabetic zzso Recently, our studies have indicated that zzso contribute to the zzso of these zzso However, the impact of zzso on the functional properties of zzso is zzso 

zzso were isolated from bovine zzso Cellular zzso migration and gel contraction in response to zzso and the other inflammatory zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso chamber zzso and collagen gel contraction zzso zzso Furthermore, we estimated the effect of zzso on these properties of zzso 

zzso promoted zzso migration and gel contraction by zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation but not zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso gel contraction but further increased zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

This study indicates that zzso in zzso and zzso causes zzso of zzso and the activated zzso contribute to the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso treatment appears to inhibit the zzso of zzso in the early stages of the diseases, but might have adverse effects in the late stage through membrane zzso
