zzso properties of zzso compounds essential for zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso were investigated using a collection of 23 zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flux allowed zzso screening of different zzso molecules in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso We found an extended collection of zzso zzso and provide first evidence for zzso zzso The zzso fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein to the zzso retained full zzso function and permitted the selection of cells with defined zzso expression levels, which was an essential step for zzso our screening zzso Interestingly, cells with a low zzso zzso intensity exhibited efficient zzso cell surface targeting and zzso signal zzso in contrast, highly fluorescent cells displayed mainly incorrectly targeted, zzso zzso zzso cell sorting was used to separate zzso cells on the basis of their zzso zzso zzso intensity, thereby increasing the fraction of zzso cells to up to zzso of the total cell zzso
