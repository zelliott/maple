zzso receptors zzso are central to innate immunity and yet their expression is widespread and not restricted to professional inflammatory zzso zzso have been reported on zzso and have been implicated in zzso zzso such as zzso Why zzso are found on zzso is not clear although one hypothesis is that they may coordinate energy zzso for the energy intensive process of an immune zzso We have explored zzso zzso in primary human in zzso differentiated zzso and investigated the specific adapter molecules that are zzso Only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could induce the production of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso alone caused a strong induction of type I zzso as assessed by zzso zzso Using zzso it was confirmed that zzso zzso in zzso occurs via zzso utilizing the adapter molecules zzso Mal and zzso and caused rapid degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Mal (but not zzso However, the response to zzso observed in these cells appeared not to require zzso but zzso was required for induction of zzso zzso by zzso Despite this, zzso degradation could not be detected in zzso zzso zzso at any zzso up to 4 zzso Indeed, zzso zzso was not induced until zzso h after zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso signal via the expected routes in human zzso whereas zzso zzso may act via a zzso zzso zzso
