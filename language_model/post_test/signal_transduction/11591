zzso cells often show a decrease in zzso and/or zzso zzso An increasing body of evidence indicates that this reduction in cell zzso zzso with tumor invasion and zzso Two main groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in tumor zzso However, the specific role that these proteins play in the context of tumor progression remains to be zzso In this review, we discuss recent data pointing to a zzso relationship between the loss of cell zzso molecules and tumor zzso In addition, the direct involvement of these molecules in specific signal zzso pathways will be considered, with particular emphasis on the zzso of such pathways in transformed zzso Finally, we review recent observations on the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso In many cases, spreading of tumor cells from the primary site to distant zzso has been characterized as an active process involving the loss of zzso zzso and gain of invasive zzso On the other hand, various examples of zzso exhibiting a relatively benign zzso not zzso zzso have been zzso Together with our recent results on a mouse tumor model, these findings indicate that zzso zzso dissemination can occur, in particular as a consequence of impaired zzso zzso and of tumor tissue zzso
