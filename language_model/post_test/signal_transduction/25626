zzso zzso levels result in the zzso of pancreatic zzso cells into zzso through a process that requires a transient repression of zzso zzso upstream of the induction of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso interacts with zzso zzso is zzso A screen of zzso data showed that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1) was markedly induced in the model zzso pancreatic rat zzso cell line after zzso treatment (which converts them into zzso zzso zzso and this was confirmed at the level of zzso zzso an alternatively transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso using an zzso designed to target all zzso transcripts inhibited zzso zzso whereas zzso of the human C zzso (and also the human zzso zzso for which no zzso in the rat has been zzso alone - but not the zzso A form - inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor activity, and converted zzso cells into zzso zzso These effects were lost when the zzso functions of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity also inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was shown to directly zzso zzso zzso in zzso in an zzso zzso These data therefore demonstrate a crucial role for zzso induction in zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso and suggest that direct zzso of zzso by zzso represents the mechanism of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
