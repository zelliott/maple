To detect the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of rat treated by zzso and thus from the zzso level explore the disorder of central nervous insulin signaling and the possible molecular mechanism of zzso zzso 

zzso primary zzso zzso were treated with different zzso of zzso zzso rate was detected by flow zzso real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso were used to detect zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cultured cells mature in zzso zzso after detected by flow zzso early zzso rate in zzso 0, 30, 60, 100 zzso groups showed a zzso zzso zzso results showed that, in 30 zzso zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment groups levels of the zzso zzso gene were significantly higher than the control group zzso as 1) zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso group zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso of Western zzso showed 30 and 60 zzso protein level of the treatment groups are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which had same trend with zzso 

zzso induced altered expression of zzso receptors in rat zzso cells, maybe one of the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso
