Because studies have shown that zzso zzso produces zzso effects after various adverse circulatory conditions, we examined whether administration of zzso before spinal zzso injury zzso has any zzso effects in reducing zzso Spinal zzso injury was induced by the application of vascular clips zzso of 24 zzso to the zzso via a zzso zzso zzso To gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the zzso effects of zzso the following end points of the inflammatory process were zzso zzso spinal zzso inflammation and tissue injury zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso In another set of experiments, the zzso or zzso with zzso significantly ameliorates the recovery of limb function zzso by motor recovery zzso To zzso whether the protective effects of zzso were zzso via the zzso zzso we investigated the effect of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the protective effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 h before treatment with zzso significantly antagonized the effect of the zzso and abolished the protective effect against zzso Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that administration of zzso before zzso reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal zzso zzso
