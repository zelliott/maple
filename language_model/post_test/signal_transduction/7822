Recently studies have demonstrated that low doses of zzso in the form of zzso zzso can stimulate specific zzso hormones and advance signs of zzso development in immature female and male zzso In the present study, we used an in zzso system to evaluate the ability of 0, 50, zzso and 500 zzso doses of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and to assess the zzso mechanism of this action in adult male zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso at 500 zzso but not the lower doses, increased zzso release, zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso activity, and the content of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a competitive inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso increase in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso blue and zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso G zzso respectively, also blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso These in zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso mechanism of zzso action in adult males is by zzso of the zzso system, resulting in increases in zzso and zzso and thus the zzso of zzso from the nerve zzso These results indicate zzso can cause zzso release in adult zzso and this action is discussed in relation to age, zzso as well as zzso and functional differences between adult and immature zzso
