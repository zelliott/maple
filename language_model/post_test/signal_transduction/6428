The removal of damaged, superfluous or zzso cells is essential for biological zzso and occurs in every tissue zzso zzso cell death occurs through several closely regulated signal zzso including zzso in which cell components are broken down and packaged into small zzso fragments that are then removed by zzso cells or zzso This process is activated in the cardiac zzso in response to a variety of zzso including zzso and zzso stress, and involves zzso zzso Loss of cardiac zzso through zzso has been shown to induce zzso in a variety of zzso animal zzso Because cardiac zzso have strictly limited ability to zzso sustained programmed cell death is likely to contribute to the development and progression of heart failure in a variety of zzso zzso At the same time, the cardiac zzso possesses a number of mechanisms for zzso against short-term zzso and zzso zzso Our laboratory has recently examined the role of zzso oxide zzso as a regulator of the programmed death of cardiac zzso and the potential contribution of NO and zzso zzso to the loss of zzso in heart zzso We will review the role of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso stress, and zzso evidence for its role as a zzso zzso We will also review evidence implicating NO in the zzso of heart failure, in the context of the extensive and sometimes contradictory body of research on NO and cell zzso
