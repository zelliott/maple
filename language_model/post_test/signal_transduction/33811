zzso development critically depends on a surprisingly short list of zzso zzso How can such ubiquitous systems regulate a variety of zzso events at various zzso stages in different zzso and in different zzso In the fruit fly, the zzso cell polarity zzso zzso regulates widely different zzso It is known to be involved in the correct alignment of hairs on the wing and in the determination of zzso zzso cell fates in the zzso In the wing, zzso regulates the spatial structure of cells sharing the same zzso fate, while in the eye the zzso signaling zzso has been recruited to additionally zzso the zzso signal to the zzso in the two zzso members of a zzso zzso We have recently proposed a zzso model for zzso in the zzso this model zzso on the basis of all known data, that zzso polarity buildup is driven by zzso molecular complexes constructed around the zzso zzso and spanning the space between two zzso In this paper, we show that the same model, combined with a novel zzso zzso equally applies in the zzso The model provides insight into the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso in development and illustrates the ability of signaling zzso to robustly maintain vital zzso in a noisy zzso
