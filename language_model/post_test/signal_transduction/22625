zzso zzso requires faithful DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso transition requires zzso of zzso forms of the protein zzso zzso These complexes are held in an inactive state via zzso of zzso in the zzso loop of zzso by the zzso protein zzso The zzso and zzso gene products act as negative regulators of zzso zzso is a large zzso protein zzso with an zzso zzso domain and a very long zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso site of zzso in the bud neck in a zzso manner; however, the function of zzso was not previously zzso Using both indirect zzso with zzso zzso and a fusion of zzso to green fluorescent zzso we found that zzso also zzso to the bud neck, zzso with the zzso ring that faces the daughter zzso Both zzso and a segment of the C zzso of zzso (which has no sequence counterpart in two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso were identified as gene products that interact with zzso in a zzso screen of a random zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso plus zzso can be zzso from extracts of cells zzso these zzso confirming that zzso physically associates with both zzso Also consistent with the zzso results, zzso zzso with full-length zzso less efficiently than with a zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso does not zzso to the bud neck in an zzso zzso whereas zzso is localized normally in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso to its destruction, are severely reduced in cells lacking either zzso or zzso (or zzso as judged by an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso these data suggest that formation of the zzso rings provides sites for zzso zzso exposing its C zzso and thereby permitting recruitment of zzso zzso in turn, presents its cargo of bound zzso allowing zzso by zzso Thus, zzso and zzso promote proper timing of cell cycle progression by zzso zzso ring assembly to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, like zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are found in zzso zzso flies, zzso and humans, suggesting that its function in this control mechanism may be zzso in all zzso
