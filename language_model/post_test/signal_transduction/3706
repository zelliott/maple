zzso of T zzso within three-dimensional collagen zzso is regulated via different signaling states of the zzso zzso human zzso and zzso T cells developed a spontaneously zzso zzso of about zzso of the whole population immediately after incorporation into a three-dimensional collagen zzso analyzed by zzso zzso This spontaneous locomotion was accompanied by enhanced zzso zzso of the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso activity using zzso significantly reduced the spontaneous zzso zzso This reduction was overcome by subsequent zzso of protein zzso C zzso using zzso which led to a persistent increase of zzso activity to more than zzso of the zzso Thus, the zzso type of locomotion was independent of zzso activity, whereas spontaneous locomotion was not altered by zzso of zzso activity using zzso C or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso We zzso that zzso activity, especially zzso zzso of zzso is decisively involved in the regulation of spontaneous T zzso zzso which is independent of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso locomotion is independent of zzso zzso events, indicating that T zzso locomotion is regulated by more than one signal zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed an exclusive cellular distribution of these zzso suggesting a regulation of T zzso locomotion different from migration models developed for other cell types, which refer to a zzso of zzso and zzso in focal zzso
