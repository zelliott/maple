In rat frontal cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of 137 zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso (10 zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso 13 zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These pharmacological effects on zzso zzso formation in zzso are consistent with those observed in zzso zzso binding zzso Indeed, reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso exposure of zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 3 days produced a zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso zzso zzso was time dependent, reaching zzso levels within 2 zzso zzso exposure (2 zzso for 3 zzso resulted in a comparable enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso whereas this treatment had no effect on zzso zzso production induced by G zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso 8 zzso and significantly attenuated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that chronic zzso exposure produces an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso or zzso (5 zzso for 3 zzso zzso the effect of zzso The enhancement of zzso zzso activity after chronic zzso exposure may be a mechanism underlying the therapeutic zzso
