With the emergence of zzso zzso in clinical trials, improved knowledge of the molecular responses of cancer cells to these agents is zzso This will facilitate the development of tests to identify patients who may benefit from these agents, allow drug activity to be monitored and zzso the combination of these agents with other treatment zzso 

This study evaluated the molecular and functional effects of zzso inhibitor zzso in human lung cancer cells, by Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction, and by zzso for cell zzso migration, and zzso 

zzso was activated in four of five cell lines tested and the level corresponded with the invasive potential and the zzso zzso zzso relevant, zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso and focal zzso zzso resulting in significant zzso of cell migration and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso indicated a potential mechanism of zzso zzso gave a potent and sustained zzso of zzso and enhanced the sensitivity to zzso 

The results indicated that zzso aside from being a potent inhibitor of tumor cell invasion which could translate to zzso of disease progression in the clinic, may also lower resistance of lung cancer cells to zzso zzso
