The human mast cell line zzso zzso was used to study the effect of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and pH changes, because zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso and zzso its zzso This drug does not have these effects on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells can be zzso by zzso with zzso as well as with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso decreases spontaneous zzso release of zzso zzso cells, but increases the zzso response after zzso and not after zzso After addition of zzso zzso has a higher increase in zzso zzso cells, without changing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso increases also zzso release in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso inhibited by zzso show the same zzso In these cells, zzso pH increases more than in control zzso This is the first report of zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso It seems that different pathways zzso signals for proliferation and zzso zzso does not only inhibit zzso zzso but may also influence zzso pH after zzso in both cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso and this ends in induced zzso zzso This work is important since zzso zzso cells are reported in zzso of aggressive systemic zzso cases and the understanding of some zzso pathways involved in mast cell response could facilitate drug zzso
