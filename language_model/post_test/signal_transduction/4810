zzso is a hormone that is essential for normal reproduction and signals through two types of zzso Not only is the classical long form of the zzso zzso identified, but so are many short form receptors in zzso and human zzso Mouse zzso studies have offered insight into the biology of zzso family, providing compelling evidence that the different zzso have independent biological zzso The possibility that short forms mediate cell proliferation is important for a variety of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review summarizes our current knowledge about zzso signaling and its role in reproduction through either long or short zzso zzso
