zzso is a critical and ubiquitous environmental signal that zzso the development and zzso of diverse microbial species, including zzso zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso survival is contingent upon initiating appropriate responses to the cellular stress induced by severe environmental temperature zzso In the case of microbial zzso development and zzso are often coupled to sensing host zzso zzso As such, microbes have developed diverse molecular strategies to sense fluctuations in temperature, and nearly all cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso and DNA, can act as zzso that detect changes in environmental temperature and initiate relevant cellular zzso The myriad of molecular mechanisms by which microbes sense and respond to temperature reveals an elegant repertoire of strategies to orchestrate cellular zzso zzso programs, and zzso with spatial and zzso environmental zzso
