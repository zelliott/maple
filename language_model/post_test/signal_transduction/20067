While induced zzso T cells zzso zzso are promising cellular zzso to treat inflammatory diseases, a limitation in utilizing zzso cells prepared in zzso is their low stability in inflammatory zzso zzso zzso is an immune regulatory nuclear hormone with a potent zzso induction zzso We reasoned that this function of zzso would be zzso to generate zzso cells with highly zzso activity and improved stability in zzso Here we generated zzso cells with zzso in zzso and found that zzso generates zzso cells that are highly stable in inflammatory zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells highly express zzso zzso zzso and are efficient in regulating inflammation in multiple zzso whereas control zzso cells induced with zzso alone are less stable and ineffective in suppressing zzso The function of zzso in inducing zzso cells with improved regulatory activity is associated with the function of zzso in suppressing the zzso zzso Moreover, the function of zzso in inducing zzso T cells is decreased but not completely abolished on nuclear zzso zzso T cells, suggesting that both nuclear and zzso zzso receptors are involved in zzso the zzso We conclude that zzso can be zzso to generate zzso cells with a high therapeutic potential in treatment of tissue zzso
