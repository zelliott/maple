zzso of protein synthesis per zzso does not zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein synthesis inhibitor zzso however, is a potent zzso of zzso The mechanism of this zzso is zzso We provide evidence that in order to activate zzso zzso requires zzso that are zzso active at the time of contact with the drug, suggesting a zzso origin of the zzso signaling to zzso In support of this notion, we have found that zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind to the same region in the zzso zzso that is the target site for zzso are also potent zzso of zzso zzso of an zzso to the zzso zzso interferes with the functioning of the zzso by altering the structural interactions of critical zzso We hypothesized, therefore, that such zzso in the zzso zzso may act as recognition signals to activate zzso To test this hypothesis, we made use of two zzso zzso zzso A chain and zzso both of which catalyze zzso zzso damage in the zzso zzso zzso with our hypothesis, zzso A chain and zzso were strong zzso of zzso and of its zzso zzso and induced the expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso As in the case of zzso zzso that were active at the time of exposure to zzso A chain or zzso were able to initiate signal zzso from the damaged zzso zzso to zzso while inactive zzso were zzso
