zzso is a recently discovered gene that is zzso silenced in a number of tumor types, suggesting a potential role as a tumor zzso However, whether zzso has tumor zzso activity is not clearly zzso We have sought to investigate the effects of zzso on tumor growth and survival and to identify signaling pathways that mediate zzso mechanism of zzso zzso expression of zzso into zzso colon cancer cell lines blocked the ability of zzso tumors to grown in zzso in nude zzso In cell culture, zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso soft zzso colony zzso zzso zzso was also associated with a moderate reduction in in zzso proliferation characterized by an zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression of zzso resulted in a dramatic zzso of zzso as well as a large number of associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reversed zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso demonstrates tumor zzso and zzso activity, both in zzso and in zzso zzso with its zzso in a number of tumor types, our data provides evidence to support the role of zzso as a tumor zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso zzso likely represents the principal zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso
