zzso oxide zzso and zzso are zzso molecules that are zzso in response to oxygen zzso zzso plant zzso zzso have been demonstrated to act in roots under oxygen depletion to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso plants, the online zzso of NO or zzso was directly zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso or full zzso The production of both gases was increased with reduced expression of either of the zzso genes zzso or zzso whereas NO zzso decreased in plants zzso these zzso NO zzso in plants with reduced zzso gene expression represented a major loss of nitrogen equivalent to zzso nitrate per zzso under hypoxic zzso zzso gene expression was greatly enhanced in flooded roots, suggesting induction by reduced oxygen zzso The function could be to limit loss of nitrogen under NO zzso NO zzso with zzso to form zzso compounds, and it is demonstrated that zzso substantially increased the content of zzso zzso A parallel zzso of zzso gene expression in the zzso shoots of the flooded plants may reflect signal transmission from root to shoot via zzso and a role for zzso in the zzso zzso gene expression was correlated with zzso upward leaf movement zzso zzso but not with zzso growth, which was zzso zzso Taken together the data suggest that zzso can influence zzso zzso via zzso and, zzso zzso zzso
