zzso transition zzso occurs in several disease states, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced from zzso of zzso zzso cells are responsible for the deposition of zzso zzso components in a large portion of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, but the molecular mechanism governing this process remains largely zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso gene to complement zzso is critical for zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso is not normally expressed in the zzso However, zzso stimulation markedly activates zzso while inducing an zzso as shown by the induction of smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins collagen I and zzso as well as the reduction of zzso marker zzso zzso function is zzso by several signaling zzso but zzso expression in zzso appears to be mainly regulated by zzso zzso zzso appears to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso using short hairpin interfering zzso significantly zzso zzso induction of zzso marker gene zzso while zzso the expression of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression while restoring zzso zzso also zzso the expression of another zzso junction zzso zzso suggesting that zzso alone zzso the zzso conversion of zzso zzso cells to zzso Additional studies show that zzso stimulates the production of zzso zzso components zzso and collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of other zzso factors such as Snail and zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of Snail and zzso during zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
