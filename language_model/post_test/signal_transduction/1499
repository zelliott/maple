Small molecules that alter protein function provide a means to zzso biological networks with zzso zzso Here we demonstrate a potentially general and zzso method of identifying such molecules by application to a particular zzso zzso which zzso the zzso factors zzso and zzso By probing a zzso zzso of small molecules generated by zzso synthesis with zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso in parallel and identified several compounds that bind zzso One compound, which we call zzso specifically activates a zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso profiling and chemical zzso demonstrate the remarkable zzso specificity of zzso and its ability to zzso the zzso subset of genes downstream of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso synthesis and zzso zzso can be used to identify small molecules that bind to a protein of interest, and that these small molecules can regulate specific functions of the zzso
