zzso sense and respond to mechanical zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso of zzso zzso zzso forces to zzso signals are not zzso After removing the cell membrane and soluble proteins by zzso zzso zzso we found that the remaining complex zzso zzso activated zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso was required for this zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso in cell extract bound to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso dependent, correlated with zzso zzso zzso of proteins in zzso zzso including zzso at the contacts with zzso These in zzso findings were compatible with in zzso observations of zzso zzso signals, zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that mechanical force on zzso zzso activates local zzso zzso which provides zzso sites for zzso zzso and zzso signaling to activate zzso
