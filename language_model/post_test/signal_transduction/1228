The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso G protein is an important step of the signal zzso through zzso zzso signal system zzso The numerous literature data and own results show that G zzso regions, that are localized in zzso zzso of zzso have considerable positive charge, can form zzso zzso and are tightly associated with the zzso We studied the influence of model zzso peptides on both zzso and zzso by hormones and zzso agents zzso zzso zzso activity and on zzso binding activity of zzso G proteins in skeletal muscles of rats and smooth muscles of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso acid zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso values for zzso the influence of peptides on zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity were: for zzso zzso and 70 zzso for zzso zzso and 47 zzso for zzso zzso and 28 zzso zzso At the same time the peptides zzso decreased zzso activity zzso by zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso in both investigated zzso The maximum stimulating effects zzso of the peptides were observed at their concentration 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso binding in plasma zzso of zzso and rat muscles and strongly decreased the influence of the hormones on the zzso Based on the obtained data we supposed that zzso peptides with zzso zzso mimic G zzso regions of the receptors and can be involved in the regulation of functional zzso between the receptors and G zzso
