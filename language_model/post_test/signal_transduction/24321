zzso zzso 4 zzso mediates the host response to zzso zzso by promoting the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso To activate each zzso numerous signal zzso pathways are zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso of several and possibly all pathways via direct interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, additional zzso that are required for the zzso of specific zzso of pathways may exist, which could contribute to the differential regulation of target zzso Furthermore, it remains unknown whether direct interactions that have been reported between zzso zzso and other proteins are required for zzso zzso To address these issues, we systematically zzso the zzso zzso domain in the context of a zzso fusion zzso Several exposed zzso defining at least two structural surfaces were required in zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as promoters dependent on individual zzso zzso Interestingly, the same zzso were required by all promoters tested, suggesting that the signaling pathways diverge downstream of the zzso The zzso zzso provide a framework for future studies of zzso zzso as the interaction supported by each critical surface zzso will need to be zzso
