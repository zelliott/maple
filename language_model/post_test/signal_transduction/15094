The zzso barrier zzso is zzso by zzso tight junctions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso junctions and gap junctions zzso between adjacent zzso cells near the basement membrane in the zzso zzso While the concept of the zzso has been known for more than a century and its significance to zzso discerned for more than five decades, its regulation has remained largely zzso Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso signaling that plays a crucial role in cell movement, zzso cell survival and gene expression at the focal zzso complex zzso also known as focal zzso a zzso zzso junction zzso is an integrated component of the zzso associated with the zzso membrane protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso recent findings in the field regarding the significance of zzso in zzso zzso integrity based on some unexpected zzso We also critically discuss the role of zzso in regulating the timely zzso and zzso of the zzso to facilitate the transit of primary zzso zzso across the zzso at stage VIII of the zzso zzso cycle of zzso Lastly, we describe a working model, which can be used to design future functional experiments to explore the involvement of zzso in zzso dynamics by investigators in the zzso
