The von zzso zzso gene is lost in zzso zzso of all zzso cell zzso zzso however, increasing evidence supports the involvement of alternative mechanisms in the regulation of zzso zzso including suppression by zzso zzso zzso are small, zzso zzso molecules that regulate gene expression through binding to target zzso In this study, we found that zzso which are zzso in cases of zzso can target multiple members of zzso signaling zzso zzso both zzso and the zzso factor zzso gene are zzso validated and are likely direct targets of zzso and zzso as shown by both zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso We found a negative correlation between zzso and its two predicted targets, zzso and zzso and between zzso and its targets zzso and zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that downstream signaling pathways are also modulated by clear cell zzso zzso zzso from our zzso analysis show that a single zzso zzso can target multiple components of the same zzso and that multiple zzso can target the same zzso Our results also indicate that zzso represent a mechanism for the zzso of zzso in cases of zzso and can zzso a new dimension in cancer zzso As such, zzso exemplify new potential therapeutic targets with a significant effect on both tumor growth and zzso zzso
