The zzso (a zzso and zzso family of proteins is involved in a variety of cellular zzso including cell zzso and zzso domain zzso Here we show that zzso 12 binds to cell surface zzso Three forms of zzso zzso 12 were used in these zzso the zzso domain made in zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso and zzso domain made in insect cells zzso zzso and full-length human zzso zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein made in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cells specifically and in a zzso manner attach to zzso 12 via members of the zzso zzso After binding to zzso zzso cells spread and form focal zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso was responsible for cell spreading because zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited cell zzso and zzso lacking zzso zzso attached but did not zzso These data suggest that zzso cells use zzso as the initial zzso for the zzso 12 zzso zzso cell zzso and then the zzso zzso to induce cell zzso Interestingly, zzso cells attached but did not spread on zzso zzso However, spreading could be efficiently induced by the addition of either 1 zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that in these zzso cells, the zzso zzso complex fails to zzso the function of zzso zzso
