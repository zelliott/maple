Signal zzso via zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating the cellular processes of cell growth, survival, zzso and zzso The zzso generation of zzso oxygen species is a necessary component of the signal zzso mechanisms by which many growth factors and zzso activate this signaling zzso and elicit their cellular zzso Evidence now supports the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso acting upstream of zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso as components of the normal zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso However, the effects of chronic zzso stress appear rather different, particularly a proposed role for zzso of zzso and other targets leading to zzso of zzso zzso signaling during diabetic insulin resistance in zzso Recently, evidence has also begun to emerge, indicating that zzso zzso signaling may display the same tight spatial and zzso specificity as seen with many other signal zzso systems in terms of targeting individual proteins for zzso and of zzso reversal zzso This review will focus upon the details of these and other roles for zzso oxygen and nitrogen species in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso both during acute stimulation and chronic zzso stress, and the evidence for their zzso
