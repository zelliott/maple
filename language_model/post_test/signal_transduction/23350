zzso zzso stem cells zzso have been isolated from several tumors and are implicated to play critical roles to increase zzso cell growth, invasion and zzso Here, we show that the zzso cells were isolated from human colon cancer zzso These isolated zzso zzso colon zzso zzso stem zzso shared similar characteristic features with bone zzso zzso which include cell zzso surface zzso and specific gene zzso Additionally, the zzso could differentiate into zzso or zzso under appropriate culture zzso The zzso medium collected from the cultured zzso was shown to enhance the migration and invasive activity of zzso colon cancer cells in zzso Besides, transplantation of zzso cells along with zzso in nude mice increased the tumor growth and zzso Further study revealed that zzso present in the zzso medium sufficiently induced the levels of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, which contribute to enhance zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso By using zzso zzso the intense zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was predominantly detected in human colon cancer zzso Taken together, our findings suggest the importance of the zzso signaling axis in the interaction between zzso and colon cancer zzso
