The small (21 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso G zzso zzso comprises 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso that act as molecular switches to regulate numerous cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with cell growth and changes in the zzso and zzso zzso In other cells, the Ras zzso regulates cell growth whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulates cell zzso Thus, the involvement of small G proteins in zzso has become an area of significant zzso Hearts from transgenic mice expressing activated Ras develop features consistent with zzso whereas mice zzso zzso develop lethal heart zzso In isolated zzso rat cardiac zzso zzso or infection with activated zzso zzso or zzso zzso many of the features of zzso We discuss the mechanisms of zzso of the small G proteins and the downstream signaling pathways zzso The latter may include protein zzso particularly the zzso or zzso protein zzso We conclude that although there is significant evidence implicating zzso zzso and zzso in zzso the mechanisms are not fully zzso
