zzso is the hormone known to control adrenal zzso function and maintenance in the intact animal but, in culture, it zzso proliferation of zzso cells from different zzso species, a puzzle that has remained zzso for nearly 30 zzso In this paper we compare zzso and zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso effects on the cell cycle in the zzso cell line, a functional lineage of mouse zzso tumor zzso This cell line displays chronic high levels of zzso high active zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and low zzso zzso expression of zzso which accounts for a minor deregulation of the cell zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso of the dominant negative zzso zzso drastically reduces zzso levels, eliminating zzso zzso expression and zzso S phase zzso zzso seems to be the downstream zzso from zzso for deregulation of zzso zzso zzso since zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strong zzso for zzso cells, promoting -- in a manner dependent on the zzso zzso -- zzso zzso zzso zzso protein stabilization and S phase entry in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso causes zzso protein zzso partially blocking S phase entry induced by zzso by a process dependent on the zzso zzso A zzso zzso The whole zzso activated by zzso to destabilize zzso protein in zzso cells might comprise the following steps: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity liberation zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso regulation is a central key in the cell cycle control by these factors, since enforced expression of zzso through the zzso zzso abrogates the zzso zzso effect over zzso S phase zzso
