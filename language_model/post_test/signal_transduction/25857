zzso zzso are being used as environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical zzso as model systems for studying zzso zzso and as a resource of genes for zzso We present a comparative analysis of the zzso sequences of the zzso insect pathogen zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso structures of these two species are highly zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso evolved from plant zzso or zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a zzso larger proportion of genes zzso zzso proteins than other zzso while zzso of these have no functionally characterized zzso suggesting zzso zzso interactions between zzso pathogens and zzso The analysis of zzso genes provided evidence of zzso point zzso occurring in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso With the help of zzso interaction gene database, zzso of zzso genes were identified that are similar to zzso verified genes involved in zzso in other zzso particularly plant zzso However, relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso has evolved with many expanded gene families of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso detoxification, and toxin zzso that may facilitate its ability to adapt to zzso zzso zzso analysis of both zzso during early infection processes provided further insights into the genes and pathways involved in zzso and zzso Of particular note, zzso zzso transcribed distinct zzso coupled receptors on zzso from zzso (the natural zzso and cockroaches, whereas zzso zzso transcribed the same zzso on both zzso This study will facilitate the identification of zzso genes and the development of improved zzso strains with customized zzso
