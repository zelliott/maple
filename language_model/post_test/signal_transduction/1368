Taste perception depends not only on special taste information processed in the insular cortex, but also on oral zzso processing in the zzso zzso Many insular zzso zzso show zzso zzso Such zzso may be enabled by signal exchange between these two zzso By using the protocol that we have developed, a synchronized population zzso of synaptic zzso was induced in the zzso zzso by stimulation to the insular zzso in rat zzso zzso The zzso pattern of propagation of this zzso was studied by recording zzso optical signals and field zzso The first zzso of the zzso was zzso from the insular stimulation site to the zzso zzso However, the second and later zzso zzso back from the zzso zzso to the insular zzso The zzso was detected in the insular zzso as well, but was actually generated in the zzso zzso Thus, the initial peak of optical zzso sent from the insular to zzso cortex, served to generate zzso responses in the zzso cortex, which zzso back to the insular zzso zzso We propose that this zzso propagation may be an artificially exaggerated demonstration of an intrinsic mechanism relevant to signal exchange between the zzso and insular zzso
