We have used a zzso fusion protein to address the spatial control of zzso zzso and the nature of zzso zzso structures during zzso transit to the zzso zzso is activated during transit, particularly in zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso recycling zzso zzso out zzso or expressing a zzso zzso zzso suppresses both zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of active zzso to peripheral membrane zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso harbor proteins involved in zzso zzso and filament zzso for example zzso and newly zzso zzso can associate with these zzso in a zzso zzso This implies that zzso may regulate an zzso zzso nucleation zzso In keeping with this, zzso controls the zzso dependence of zzso zzso movement toward the plasma zzso This work identifies zzso as a component of zzso signaling pathways that coordinate zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso
