This zzso is addressed to the question how the zzso environment may affect traffic of receptors and zzso from zzso receptors on the outside of cells to zzso and targets on the zzso Signal zzso by zzso receptors to the interior of the cell and eventually to the zzso is a central issue in cellular zzso In this context the role of membrane fluidity and of the zzso in restricting the mobility of proteins are discussed and the evidence for a structural order in zzso which could limit the mobility of proteins is zzso
