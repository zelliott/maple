Aspirin has been reported to induce zzso in various cancer cell zzso However, the zzso effects of aspirin on human brain tumor cells are not well zzso Here, we have assessed the effect of aspirin on human zzso cell line zzso and found that aspirin induced the zzso of zzso cells, as determined by zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso The underlying mechanism of this effect consists of reduction in the level of zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor required for survival of zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso target genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are essential for cell growth and survival was apparently attenuated after aspirin zzso We also showed that the expression and zzso of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso When administered zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells, the zzso of zzso and cellular zzso were restrained compared to aspirin zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that aspirin causes zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that aspirin could be zzso useful for a potential zzso therapeutic zzso
