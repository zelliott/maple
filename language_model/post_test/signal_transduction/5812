In plants, a diverse group of cell surface zzso protein zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in sensing external signals to regulate gene zzso Roots explore the soil environment to zzso their growth via complex signaling zzso mainly analyzed in zzso zzso However, zzso roots have significant zzso differences, notably their capacity to establish symbiotic zzso These major agricultural crops are affected by environmental stresses such as zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is rapidly induced by salt stress in roots, and zzso interference zzso zzso specifically targeting zzso yielded transgenic roots whose growth was less inhibited by the presence of salt in the zzso zzso zzso indicate that this gene is expressed in zzso root zzso in response to salt zzso Two zzso zzso also failed to limit root growth in response to salt stress and accumulated fewer sodium zzso than zzso Furthermore, early zzso genes are zzso in zzso roots and in the zzso zzso lines when submitted to salt zzso We propose a role for zzso in the regulation of the adaptation of zzso zzso roots to salt zzso
