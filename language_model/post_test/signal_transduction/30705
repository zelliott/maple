zzso healing is dependent on an inflammatory reaction that results in zzso zzso and clearance of the wound from dead cells and zzso zzso However, optimal zzso healing requires timely zzso of zzso zzso that suppress inflammatory zzso synthesis and mediate resolution of the inflammatory zzso promoting formation of a zzso A growing body of evidence suggests that interactions involving the zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in resolution of inflammation and migration of zzso in injured zzso We examined the role of zzso signaling in zzso healing and cardiac zzso using a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly induced in the zzso zzso and was localized on zzso zzso wound zzso and vascular zzso In comparison with zzso mice, zzso animals showed enhanced and prolonged zzso and zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso following zzso zzso In zzso zzso the enhanced inflammatory phase was followed by decreased zzso zzso reduced collagen deposition, and diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso had reduced proliferation upon stimulation with serum and decreased collagen synthesis in response to zzso in comparison to zzso zzso The healing defects in zzso mice were associated with enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso without affecting the size of the zzso Our findings suggest that zzso interactions are critically involved in zzso zzso zzso signaling is important for resolution of the zzso inflammatory reaction and regulates zzso zzso
