zzso cells of the zzso tract play a central role in the zzso host zzso against pathogens and in the recognition of zzso that interact with zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso zzso family and their three human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the host zzso against pathogens that mediate zzso responses thus zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms by which zzso function, we examined the influence of zzso D zzso 1 and 2 on the activity and signal zzso of human zzso cell line zzso zzso is a key zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We inhibited zzso and 2 by small interference zzso zzso and determined the activity of zzso zzso receptors using Western zzso and zzso level zzso We then analyzed the distribution of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso compared to a zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the depletion of zzso and 2 resulted in a marked reduction of zzso zzso zzso activity due to inhibited zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso level zzso In addition, we observed an zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as a result of zzso recycling zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso rate was zzso Our results support the importance of zzso and 2 in zzso zzso zzso function and the role of zzso zzso recycling and zzso for zzso zzso
