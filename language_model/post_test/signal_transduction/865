The zzso signaling zzso controls the zzso cell zzso transition in zzso zzso by stopping the zzso cycle and promoting the zzso To understand how the zzso zzso coordinates this process, we have identified and performed a functional analysis of genes whose zzso is responsive to the zzso zzso at this zzso These genes include the zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso a regulator of the zzso zzso complex zzso and an inhibitor of the zzso complex, zzso zzso activity leads to zzso of String and zzso and zzso of zzso All three genes are independently responsive to zzso In addition, zzso an essential gene for zzso is sufficient to stop zzso cycle and promote precocious zzso when expressed prematurely during zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the growth controller zzso does not induce premature zzso but zzso the zzso of normal zzso We also show that zzso zzso a zzso is zzso for zzso but crucial for zzso progression in zzso zzso The results support a model in which zzso activity zzso the zzso switch by regulating all three major cell cycle zzso zzso of String blocks the zzso zzso of zzso allows zzso progression and repression of zzso assures entry into the zzso This study provides a comprehensive picture of the logic that external signaling pathways may use to control cell cycle transitions by the coordinated regulation of the cell zzso
