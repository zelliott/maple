zzso of zzso stem and zzso cells zzso from bone zzso into peripheral blood by the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has become the preferred source of zzso for stem cell zzso However, zzso fails to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells in up to zzso of donors, zzso zzso transplantation in those donors or substantially delaying transplant recovery zzso zzso new regimens are needed to increase the number of stem cells in peripheral blood upon zzso Using a forward genetic approach in mice, we mapped the gene zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso to a genetic region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso correlated with the zzso ability to be mobilized by zzso zzso a negative role for zzso signaling in zzso In combination with zzso treatment, genetic reduction of zzso activity in zzso (in zzso zzso zzso or treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso increased zzso Increased zzso due to suppression of zzso activity correlated with reduced activity of cell division control zzso zzso and genetic zzso zzso in zzso also enhanced zzso zzso Our findings reveal a previously unknown signaling zzso regulating stem cell zzso and provide a new pharmacological approach for improving zzso zzso and thereby transplantation zzso
