zzso zzso activity was zzso in zzso separately by T4 zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso In the presence of a fixed concentration of zzso additions of zzso and zzso M zzso reduced the T4 effect on the zzso zzso blockade with zzso zzso zzso prevented stimulation by zzso of zzso activity, but did not prevent the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso In contrast, alpha zzso blockade with zzso zzso restored the effect of T4 on zzso activity in the presence of zzso Like zzso zzso prevented enhancement of zzso activity by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso had any effect on the stimulation by T4 of red cell zzso in the absence of zzso Analysis of zzso zzso binding to human red cell zzso revealed the presence of a single class of zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Thus, the human zzso membrane contains alpha zzso zzso sites that are capable of regulating zzso zzso
