The zzso of the major zzso promoter zzso is a key event in the zzso replication cycle and is dependent on cellular zzso factors which are partially activated by viral zzso zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors that may be involved in the zzso of the major zzso zzso Using reporter gene zzso in human embryonic kidney cells, we found that zzso signaling was responsible for increased major zzso zzso activity which was independent of zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso only partially blocked the effect of zzso whereas treatment with a specific zzso zzso activated zzso zzso inhibitor fully zzso the zzso enhancement of promoter zzso Our results suggest that during human zzso zzso infection, zzso in zzso cells zzso the major zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso and downstream signaling that partially involves zzso
