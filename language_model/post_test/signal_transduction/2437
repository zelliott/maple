A zzso model of signal zzso that incorporates the possibility of multiple zzso states between the inactive and the active forms of the zzso was zzso The obtained equilibrium model is equivalent to the extended zzso complex of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 268 zzso zzso if only two states of the zzso zzso These multiple zzso between zzso states are modeled by two sets of equilibrium zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso The higher the value of these constants, the more efficiently the active form of the zzso is zzso zzso efficacy of the zzso is defined in the present zzso as the molecular processes induced by zzso in the zzso that lead to the active form of the zzso Both the zzso zzso to zzso and mechanism of the process of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso are important in zzso the maximum zzso Moreover, zzso expressions of zzso activity, potency and maximum response were zzso These definitions were used to zzso the extra cellular zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pure zzso
