zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is specifically expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso zzso Although the abnormal cortical zzso in zzso is thought to be attributable to zzso cell migration zzso the regulatory mechanisms governing interactions between zzso and zzso in the migration of zzso zzso cells remain zzso In this study we found that the zzso and protein zzso A zzso signal zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso signaling prevented zzso bundling and induced the zzso of zzso from zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and the zzso zzso zzso promoted cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso Our data reveal a dual zzso role for zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso dynamics that is indispensable for proper brain zzso
