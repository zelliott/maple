Mechanical signals are important both as environmental and zzso zzso cues in zzso Among the zzso measurable responses to mechanical stimulation zzso in plants is the zzso of specific zzso including zzso in zzso Little is known about the signaling events and components that link perception of mechanical signals to gene expression in zzso zzso has been identified previously as being potentially involved, and a role for zzso has also been zzso Using the protein zzso inhibitor zzso we determined that zzso zzso of zzso expression requires protein zzso activity in young zzso zzso Our data from studies on the zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso protein is also required, but that its role in mechanically induced zzso expression appears to be independent of zzso Challenge of zzso with protein zzso zzso zzso A and zzso acid zzso zzso expression even in the absence of zzso zzso protein zzso activity acting to zzso regulate zzso gene zzso This zzso activity acts either downstream or independently of zzso zzso and protein zzso activity, on the other hand, operate downstream of calcium to mediate mechanically zzso zzso zzso
