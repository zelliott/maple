zzso like other animals, require sodium zzso zzso as part of their normal diet and detect it with contact zzso on the body zzso By adjusting the responsiveness of the zzso zzso within these receptors insects can modify the intake of salt and other zzso and it has been hypothesized that the responsiveness of zzso zzso is regulated by zzso oxide zzso To identify potential sources of NO in the zzso the authors applied the zzso fluorescent probe zzso and the universal NO zzso zzso and found that in zzso NO is zzso within one particular class of cells of the zzso the zzso cells, from where it may diffuse to neighboring zzso zzso The effects of NO on zzso zzso were investigated by recording from contact zzso on the leg while zzso it with drugs that interfere with NO zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso NO decreased the frequency of action zzso in zzso zzso in response to stimulation with zzso by acting via a zzso zzso zzso zzso Variation of the zzso concentration in the zzso solution demonstrated that the synthesis of NO in zzso cells depends on the zzso concentration in the zzso By contrast NO increased the frequency of action zzso in zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The authors suggest that NO released from zzso cells zzso the responsiveness of zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso and zzso that NO may play a key role in the signaling of salt and zzso
