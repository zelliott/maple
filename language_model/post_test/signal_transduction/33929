Clinical and zzso studies have demonstrated an important effect of zzso zzso on the progressive loss of zzso function that occurs in chronic kidney zzso zzso kidney disease, in turn, promotes zzso in vascular zzso A modulating role for dietary salt has been suggested, with the amount of salt intake regulating zzso cell production of transforming growth zzso zzso a zzso growth factor that promotes zzso and zzso The purpose of the present studies was to determine how the interaction between dietary salt intake and zzso promoted the production of zzso in zzso Two different vascular zzso zzso rings and zzso were chosen for zzso zzso salt zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and further identified zzso as an important binding partner of zzso in these zzso Use of pharmacological zzso and dominant negative strategies confirmed that dietary salt induced complex formation of zzso and zzso with downstream zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and generation of zzso The experiments defined the molecular signaling events that promoted the production of zzso a key growth factor involved in the vascular response to increased salt zzso
