zzso signaling plays a prominent role in plants for zzso a wide range of zzso processes and responses to environmental zzso zzso generation of zzso calcium zzso decoding of calcium signatures, and transformation of the signal into cellular responses are integral zzso of the zzso zzso Several hundred proteins with functions in calcium signaling circuits have been identified, and the number of downstream targets of calcium sensors is expected to zzso We previously identified a novel, zzso nuclear zzso zzso which stimulates zzso zzso and plant defense in zzso zzso Here, we present a comparative zzso analysis of a new class of putative zzso target proteins in zzso and zzso 

We identified and analyzed 33 and 29 zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins contain a zzso domain of 67 zzso zzso acid zzso referred to as the zzso domain, which is characterized by a unique and repetitive arrangement of three different zzso recruitment zzso known as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso binding for zzso the smallest zzso protein in zzso which consists of a zzso zzso domain and a short zzso zzso A striking feature of zzso proteins is the high zzso point zzso zzso and frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared the zzso and rice zzso gene families in terms of gene structure, zzso location, predicted protein properties and zzso zzso zzso and evolutionary zzso The existence of an zzso gene in zzso suggests that zzso proteins are an ancient family of zzso proteins and arose during the early evolution of land zzso 

Comparative zzso analyses indicate that the major zzso gene lineages originated before the zzso zzso The extant zzso zzso in zzso primarily resulted from zzso zzso and reflect preferential retention of zzso zzso which is characteristic for proteins with regulatory zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso and the presence of predicted zzso binding sites in all zzso family members suggest that zzso proteins are a new class of zzso zzso The basic zzso point of zzso proteins and their frequently predicted nuclear zzso suggest that zzso proteins link calcium signaling pathways to the regulation of gene zzso Our comparative zzso analysis of zzso genes and zzso proteins in two model plant species provides the first step towards the functional dissection of this emerging family of putative zzso zzso
