To understand roles of zzso 6 zzso family zzso for pregnancy in mice, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso and early pregnant zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all zzso zzso and in pregnant zzso from the third day zzso 3) to the sixth day of pregnancy zzso 6; the day of plug zzso Day zzso zzso zzso signals were detected in zzso mice in the zzso and zzso zzso Signal strength varied according to the sexual zzso There was no correlation between the signal strength of the zzso zzso and the serum zzso of zzso and zzso which show a zzso rise in the zzso sexual zzso In pregnant mice, slight signals were zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso on Day zzso zzso zzso messages increased with progression towards Day 4, however, zzso changed drastically on Day zzso zzso cells abruptly expressed their zzso on Day 5, and these cells strongly expressed it on Day zzso The function of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso might be different from that in the zzso during the zzso zzso In addition, few signals were identified in the zzso cells adjacent to the zzso zzso on Day zzso This suggests that there are two types of zzso cells on Day 6 in zzso
