We have shown that adoptive transfer of zzso T cells from zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso rats causes hypertension and elevated inflammatory zzso during zzso In this study we tested the hypothesis that adoptive transfer of zzso zzso T cells was associated with zzso zzso as a mechanism to increase blood pressure during zzso zzso T cells from zzso or normal pregnant zzso rats were zzso transferred into zzso rats on zzso day zzso Mean zzso pressure zzso was analyzed on zzso day 19, and zzso were collected for zzso zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso rats versus zzso rats zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso and increased in zzso recipients of zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso 2 zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso T cells increased zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso T cell rats and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells exposed to zzso rat serum was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso rat serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso T cell serum, and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso T cell serum zzso zzso zzso To test the role of zzso in zzso zzso T zzso hypertension, pregnant rats were treated with an zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso via drinking zzso zzso was 92 zzso 2 zzso in zzso blockade and 108 zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso 95 zzso 5 zzso in zzso zzso T zzso blockade and 102 zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso T zzso zzso These data indicate the importance of zzso zzso to cause hypertension via chronic exposure to activated zzso T cells in response to zzso zzso
