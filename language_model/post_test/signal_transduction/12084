zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso that zzso regulates zzso signaling and zzso suppressed growth of zzso zzso tumors in combination with zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The ability of zzso to interact with zzso in zzso primary human immune cells was evaluated zzso by assessing its induction of zzso zzso zzso cells in human peripheral blood in zzso The significance of zzso cells was also investigated by assessing zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells but not zzso cells were induced markedly zzso in healthy peripheral blood by zzso in contrast to the modest induction by zzso alone zzso at its clinically achievable dose (20 zzso or by zzso zzso at its zzso of zzso schedule (30 zzso zzso at a higher dose zzso zzso was less effective alone zzso or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were induced after 4 or 16 h treatment with zzso within zzso and zzso zzso coincided with heightened zzso expression zzso zzso zzso was also more effective than the single agents in inducing zzso cells in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients, whose zzso zzso cell levels were approximately zzso of healthy zzso zzso tumor growth was inhibited by zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso These results demonstrate zzso interactions with zzso in zzso to activate key zzso immune cells in peripheral blood of healthy and melanoma donors, providing further evidence for proof of concept clinical trials for zzso zzso of zzso through zzso negative regulatory protein zzso zzso
