The zzso sensor zzso protein zzso zzso has emerged as an important link between cellular zzso status and zzso transport zzso We previously found that zzso binds to and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso channel gating in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further characterize the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso whole cell zzso zzso were performed with zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing either zzso active or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso was substantially greater than controls, suggesting that zzso zzso activity in these cells zzso zzso under zzso zzso Although baseline zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso was comparable to that of controls, zzso stimulation of zzso was completely blocked in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso renders zzso resistant to zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies of zzso in human embryonic zzso cells using zzso expression of zzso demonstrated zzso zzso of zzso in zzso However, zzso activity zzso had no effect on zzso in zzso zzso in response to graded doses of zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso renders the channel resistant to zzso by zzso and zzso without preventing zzso by these zzso We found that zzso a zzso R domain zzso considered to be an zzso zzso site, is the dominant site of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso at this site enhanced baseline zzso activity and rendered zzso resistant to zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso at zzso is required for its zzso of zzso In zzso our findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso thereby tuning the zzso of zzso to zzso and other stresses in the zzso
