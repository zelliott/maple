The zzso factor zzso has critical functions in zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to DNA double strand break zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso essential zzso Here, we show that the replication stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso also activate this zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso and zzso interacts with zzso but surprisingly does not cause zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by replication zzso Reduction or increase of zzso expression by zzso interference or zzso increased or reduced zzso association and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso caused complex patterns of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression with the overall outcome for the former being zzso whereas the latter zzso Thus, replication stress and zzso zzso activate zzso through a zzso zzso with opposite zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function at least in part by competing for zzso zzso
