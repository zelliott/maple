A zzso system based on embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso bodies zzso which zzso the in zzso zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso of mouse zzso was developed and used to investigate the effects of the disruption of the zzso gene on muscle cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was totally inhibited in zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso by the absence of zzso formation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso zzso muscle formation was also completely blocked in the absence of zzso On the other hand, there were no obvious effects on zzso differentiation in these zzso zzso zzso zzso However, reduced zzso expression in zzso zzso for the zzso zzso leads to partial zzso of cardiac muscle zzso These data suggest that in contrast to early zzso zzso zzso is indispensable for skeletal and smooth muscle zzso
