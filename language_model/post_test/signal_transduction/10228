From a forward genetic screen for zzso zzso in zzso zzso we identified a zzso that affects zzso recognition protein zzso zzso and zzso the ability to zzso the bacteria zzso zzso but not zzso coli and zzso zzso Because of the differences in zzso zzso linkages in these bacteria, our data suggest that zzso is necessary for recognition of the zzso zzso typical of most zzso zzso zzso zzso also fail to activate the zzso signaling zzso and are compromised for survival after zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is the first found for an zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso at the zzso bond between the zzso backbone and the zzso stem zzso By generating transgenic rescue flies that express either zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso activity is not necessary for Toll zzso but is essential for zzso of zzso zzso into the host zzso and for survival after zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that the zzso zzso activity can be zzso by zzso addition of free zzso suggesting that the presence of zzso zzso products is more important than the generation of zzso zzso on the bacterial surface for zzso zzso zzso
