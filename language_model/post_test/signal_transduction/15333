zzso zzso responds to zzso bacterial challenges through the zzso pathway, a signal zzso cassette that is driven by the coordinated activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso While many zzso of zzso activity were identified in cell culture and in zzso zzso the regulatory apparatus that determines zzso zzso into the zzso zzso is relatively zzso In this zzso we present the first quantitative screen of the entire zzso of zzso for novel regulators of zzso activity in the zzso zzso We identified a large number of gene products that zzso or positively impact on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In particular, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso In a series of in zzso and cell culture zzso we demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso drives zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which in turn act through the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso and zzso arms of the zzso zzso Our data illuminate a poorly understood arm of a critical and zzso zzso innate immune zzso Furthermore, given the zzso involvement of zzso in zzso cell biology, we believe that many of the novel regulators identified in this screen are of interest beyond immune zzso
