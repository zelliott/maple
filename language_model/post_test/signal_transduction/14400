zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a newly recognized zzso in cellular signal zzso However, a substantial challenge in zzso its diverse roles in complex biological environments is the lack of methods for probing this zzso oxygen zzso in living systems with molecular zzso Here we report the synthesis and application of zzso Green 1 zzso and zzso Crimson 1 zzso two new fluorescent zzso that show high selectivity for zzso and are capable of visualizing zzso zzso produced in living cells by growth factor zzso including the first direct imaging of zzso produced for brain cell zzso The combined features of zzso oxygen species zzso sensitivity to signaling levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso many new opportunities for zzso zzso and related synthetic zzso for exploring the zzso roles of zzso in living systems with molecular zzso
