The genetic elements specifying six putative zzso regulatory systems zzso were identified on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso appear to represent distinct zzso each containing a zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of the six zzso was performed either by generating zzso zzso to a reporter gene or by primer zzso Two of the systems appeared to be expressed zzso at a high level, whilst the remaining four exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso established that the two zzso expressed zzso are necessary for normal cell growth and/or zzso zzso analysis of the remaining four systems revealed that they are implicated in zzso to extreme zzso zzso or zzso conditions, or the regulation of zzso activity in zzso zzso
