In zzso zzso the zzso complexes are major targets of the zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso The zzso agent, zzso zzso a prompt zzso of the zzso zzso which is vitally important in zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism for the rapid zzso zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we show that the zzso complexes exist mainly on membrane structures through their association with zzso complex 1 zzso zzso abrogates this association and releases the zzso complexes into the zzso zzso of the zzso complexes occurs zzso following the release but at a much slower rate, presumably caused by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complexes from membrane structures also occurs when cells are deprived of zzso These findings suggest that the association of the zzso complexes with zzso represents an important mechanism by which zzso controls zzso signaling zzso In addition, our data support a model in which zzso acts not by zzso the zzso activity of zzso but by zzso its interaction with downstream zzso
