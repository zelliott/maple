zzso have been shown to induce zzso in different types of tumor cells, but the mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer cells have not been adequately zzso This study investigated the roles of zzso zzso zzso DNA damage, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso of zzso human gastric cancer cells, a commonly used cell culture system for in zzso zzso zzso were incubated with different zzso of zzso in a zzso and/or zzso zzso Cell zzso changes zzso and zzso were examined by a zzso zzso whereas cell viability and zzso populations were determined by flow zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fluorescent zzso zzso acid stain and zzso zzso were applied to detect zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso and -9 activities was involved in zzso zzso and they could be attenuated by zzso of specific zzso indicating that zzso triggered the zzso zzso zzso Further studies with flow zzso analyses indicated that cellular levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transition zzso pore opening were increased, but the level of zzso membrane potential zzso was zzso Also, the ratio of zzso levels and other zzso proteins associated with modulating the zzso were zzso zzso signaling was also zzso after exposure to zzso and determined by Western zzso and real-time zzso zzso In zzso it is suggested that zzso zzso cell death was involved in zzso zzso which led to release of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso G zzso zzso and caused the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso human gastric cancer zzso
