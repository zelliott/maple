The insulin zzso zzso form hybrids with the closely related zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso Because most human breast zzso zzso both the zzso and the zzso we evaluated whether the zzso hybrid zzso zzso is also zzso in these tumors and what role it plays in breast cancer zzso Using specific zzso and Western zzso we measured zzso content and function in 8 human cultured breast cancer cell lines and 39 human breast cancer zzso zzso content and function were also compared to the content and function of the zzso and the zzso zzso content exceeded the zzso content in zzso of breast cancer specimens and was directly related to the zzso ratio of both the zzso and zzso content, suggesting that zzso formation occurred by random assembly of zzso and zzso zzso zzso became zzso zzso when breast cancer cells were exposed to zzso but not when they were exposed to zzso In cells with an elevated zzso content, zzso zzso in response to zzso exceeded zzso zzso suggesting that most of the zzso effect occurred via the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso growth in response to zzso as indicated by experiments with blocking zzso to the zzso These data indicated therefore that: zzso zzso are present and play a major role in zzso the zzso signal in breast zzso zzso their expression is directly related to zzso zzso and zzso potential therapies designed to block zzso actions in breast cancer must take into account the role of these zzso
