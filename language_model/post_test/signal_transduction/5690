In this study we test whether functional screening of compounds to zzso G zzso receptors zzso would provide data that correlated significantly with zzso binding data, thereby permitting researchers to replace expensive zzso experiments with zzso zzso An increase in zzso calcium levels represents an important second zzso signal for several zzso zzso In this study, we describe the affinities of three alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso determined by monitoring the changes in zzso calcium levels and comparing them with their zzso zzso In addition to determining the functional affinities of the three alpha zzso antagonists, we evaluate their binding at two alpha zzso zzso and zzso the zzso for zzso zzso
