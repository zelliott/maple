Plant zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins with putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with striking resemblance in domain organization to the animal zzso zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso The recently zzso zzso zzso contains more than 600 zzso zzso representing nearly zzso of the zzso zzso genes in zzso Although only a handful of these genes have known functions and fewer still have identified zzso or downstream targets, the studies of several zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso zzso provide much-needed information on the functions zzso by members of this large gene zzso zzso control a wide range of zzso including development, disease resistance, hormone perception, and zzso Combined with the expression studies and zzso analysis of other zzso more details of zzso function and signaling are zzso
