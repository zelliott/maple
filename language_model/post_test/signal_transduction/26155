zzso zzso factor zzso was shown to produce its zzso effect through zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso But whether other pathways also mediate the zzso effect of zzso is less zzso In this study, we found that direct administration of zzso to rat zzso zzso area zzso increased the zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso also increased protein zzso zzso zzso II zzso activity and zzso zzso at zzso zzso Further, zzso of the zzso zzso DNA to zzso zzso increased nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso the zzso inactive zzso of zzso decreased these zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso small interfering zzso zzso blocked the enhancing effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results were further confirmed by treatment of zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso of zzso the dominant negative zzso of zzso prevented the enhancing effect of zzso on zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso of zzso is not affected by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate a novel zzso signaling zzso and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the protective effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso
