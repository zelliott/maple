Signaling via zzso receptors zzso is crucial to many zzso and zzso processes in zzso organisms, and zzso themselves are targets for important zzso Classical cell supplementation experiments suggest a collision zzso model, in which receptors and G proteins diffuse randomly within the cell membrane and interact only if receptors are zzso This model is also backed by kinetic and live cell imaging zzso According to the challenging theory, receptors and G proteins are zzso they are forming stable complexes in the absence of zzso which prevail during zzso This model has been favored on the basis of zzso and zzso of inactive receptors with G proteins and more recently by some approaches measuring energy transfer between labeled receptors and G zzso This article reviews key findings regarding the zzso protein zzso mode, including most recent findings obtained by optical zzso
