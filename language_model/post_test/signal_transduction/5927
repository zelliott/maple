We studied the effects of 17 zzso zzso on zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso release induced by drugs that activate different zzso signal zzso mechanisms in rat anterior zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso (6 zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 24 zzso Then, both zzso and zzso cells were incubated for 4 h with zzso or zzso respectively, with or without drugs, and in the presence or absence of zzso hormone zzso Media were zzso for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso treatment had no effect on zzso zzso release, but occasionally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso all zzso zzso and zzso release in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment increased both zzso and zzso release induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso acid, and zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso acid in combination with a zzso dose of zzso had additive effects on either zzso or zzso release, whereas zzso increased the zzso response to zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso depended on dose of zzso and presence or absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso release by interacting with the zzso and/or zzso and zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso
