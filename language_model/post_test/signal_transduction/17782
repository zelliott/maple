Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrated to improve symptoms and prognosis in heart failure zzso We compared the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso blockade on zzso zzso zzso in rabbits with zzso established 3 weeks after zzso zzso zzso with left zzso coronary artery zzso zzso with zzso were zzso to no treatment, the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso blocker zzso (3 zzso zzso examinations showed that, relative to rabbits with zzso zzso rabbits receiving zzso or zzso had a limitation of cardiac zzso and prevention of the development of zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso levels that were markedly elevated in zzso animals were strongly inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso zzso density, zzso proportion showing zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities were significantly reduced in zzso zzso These defects were similarly reversed by zzso or zzso zzso as found in human zzso zzso protein levels of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso were significantly elevated in zzso zzso suggesting that these molecules are contributing to the defects in zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of these molecules were zzso equally by both zzso The results suggest that zzso different interventions in the zzso system can zzso improve the zzso in the zzso signaling system in the failing zzso This may be important for the beneficial effects of these agents in zzso
