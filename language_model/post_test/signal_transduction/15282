The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso are essential zzso signaling molecules that regulate cellular zzso zzso factors from various pathogens alter the signaling of zzso by acting as zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso exchange factors, or direct zzso zzso however, bacterial zzso factors that sense rather than alter the signaling states of zzso zzso have not been previously zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso binds to the zzso zzso form of zzso This interaction stimulates the zzso activity of zzso which results in the zzso of cholesterol in the host cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of molecules downstream of zzso is not exclusive to zzso zzso and that a bacterial protein has evolved to recognize the zzso state of zzso which regulates its zzso activity as part of the zzso zzso
