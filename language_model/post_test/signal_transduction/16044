The aim of this study was to define the functional role of a recently identified zzso protein from zzso zzso in zzso and its role in bacterial zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on cell zzso or cell viability in human zzso zzso zzso Gene expression array of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso showed zzso of common transcripts (by zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso cellular analysis showed zzso cells incubated with zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso oxide zzso in the presence of zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was distinct from the known zzso of NO production: prednisone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly inhibited zzso activity of zzso cells toward zzso or zzso zzso from zzso zzso These reports show previously unknown zzso properties of zzso in modulating both microbial physiology and host innate zzso
