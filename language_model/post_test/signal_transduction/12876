zzso zzso signals from the zzso and autonomous signals due to a zzso zzso determine the sex of zzso zzso germ zzso These two signals have partially overlapping influences on downstream sex determination zzso The upstream zzso zzso factor is required for the viability of zzso germ cells, regardless of sexual identity, and for female zzso sexual zzso The influence of zzso and autonomous signals on zzso expression has been zzso We show that zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso germ cells in either a male or a female zzso This indicates that a zzso zzso controls zzso expression in the absence of zzso signals from the female zzso However, we also show that female zzso signals positively regulate zzso zzso in the zzso germ cells that do not require zzso zzso zzso analysis clearly indicates that zzso signals from the zzso are not required for zzso function in zzso germ zzso Thus, while zzso zzso signals and zzso zzso have overlapping regulatory zzso a zzso zzso is a critical zzso autonomous zzso of zzso function in the zzso
