We observed elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso Since zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in linking inflammatory and zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso expression in zzso cells under zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was dependent on zzso zzso zzso as zzso failed to induce zzso and zzso activity in cells zzso with dominant negative zzso Increased Ras expression was accompanied by increased zzso of Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While zzso of these zzso individually failed to block the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso elevated zzso expression in a zzso manner, and small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was independent of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, it regulated zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated elevated zzso zzso levels induced upon zzso zzso This was accompanied by increased interaction of zzso with zzso responsive element on the zzso promoter upon zzso treatment, under zzso Our studies highlights for first time that zzso Ras is a key zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso induction via zzso zzso Ras and zzso are intermediaries in the zzso zzso signaling zzso downstream of zzso and zzso zzso zzso drives a zzso zzso loop to maintain persistently elevated zzso zzso
