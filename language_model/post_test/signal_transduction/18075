zzso of zzso cells with zzso extracts results in extensive fragmentation of the zzso organized stacks of zzso The fragmented zzso zzso are subsequently dispersed from the zzso zzso We have shown previously that this process requires the zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso the known downstream targets of zzso are not required for this fragmentation zzso et zzso zzso We now provide evidence that zzso is specifically zzso during zzso The zzso zzso zzso upon partial zzso with zzso generates a different zzso population compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso with the lethal factor of the anthrax toxin can still be activated by its upstream zzso zzso and this form is fully active in the zzso fragmentation zzso We believe that the zzso zzso zzso a change in the zzso of zzso and that this form of zzso recognizes zzso zzso as a target zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that treatment of zzso normal rat kidney zzso cells with zzso zzso treated with or without lethal factor, converts stacks of zzso zzso zzso into smaller fragments composed predominantly of zzso zzso These fragments are similar in distribution, zzso and size to the fragments observed in the zzso stage of the cell cycle in zzso
