zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso dysfunction and impaired zzso relaxation in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso channels contribute to zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso channels and the underlying mechanisms of zzso dysfunction are zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso channel dysfunction and aimed to clarify the underlying zzso 

The animal model of zzso disease, zzso A zzso knockout mice, displayed zzso zzso channel zzso zzso current and the channel expression were significantly reduced in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso of aged zzso knockout mice, whereas they were not changed in zzso of zzso and young zzso knockout zzso In addition, zzso current and the channel expression were zzso reduced in zzso zzso In both zzso and aged zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso zzso inhibited class III zzso zzso and decreased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso relaxation was significantly attenuated in zzso mouse zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reduces zzso channel expression by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and the channel activity by decreasing zzso levels of zzso zzso thereby evokes zzso channel dysfunction, and the channel dysfunction in vascular zzso cells may contribute to zzso in zzso zzso
