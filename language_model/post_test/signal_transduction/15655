zzso zzso are important for growth and differentiation and require interaction with zzso proteins for activity and zzso We characterized the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso that form two functional zzso protein zzso The zzso complex is not only essential for zzso formation in zzso cells and during zzso but also functions during sexual zzso body development and zzso The two zzso proteins interact with both zzso zzso and control polar tip extension and branching by regulating zzso zzso The zzso region directly preceding the zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for the formation of zzso zzso but also for zzso zzso An additional zzso extension that is poorly zzso but present in most zzso zzso zzso is required for further stabilization of both types of interactions and for stimulating zzso zzso zzso lacking this region is zzso in a zzso zzso We propose a specific role of zzso during zzso cell fusion, zzso body development and zzso that is unrelated to the three other zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso
