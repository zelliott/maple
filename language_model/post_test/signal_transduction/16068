zzso is a well-known environmental zzso that can induce zzso zzso zzso acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso toxicity is likely zzso through zzso induced by means of multiple zzso Although zzso zzso are known to induce zzso stress and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying zzso is not fully zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the zzso expression profiles of human zzso leukemia zzso cells that had been exposed to zzso and its zzso This was carried out using whole human zzso zzso zzso to ascertain potential zzso Genes that were zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then classified with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All genes that were identified were then functionally zzso as being involved in the cell cycle, the zzso signaling pathway, zzso the zzso signaling pathway, or the T cell zzso signaling zzso zzso important genes were further validated by means of real-time zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes altered their expression zzso Similar expression profiles were also found in human zzso leukemia zzso cells and in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, gene expression profiles along with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis have provided an insight into the zzso as well as highlighted potential zzso zzso of human leukemia cell lines when they are exposed to zzso and its zzso
