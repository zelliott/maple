zzso zzso plays a vital role in DNA damage response zzso which is important for maintaining zzso integrity in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by the concerted action of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso generates a cascade of zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso zzso that may catalyze the removal of zzso from these zzso This study demonstrated that zzso an apparent zzso for zzso zzso is indeed the zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso sites, where the zzso is initiated by zzso Here, we showed that zzso expression of zzso led to the zzso of both zzso and zzso in response to zzso DNA zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso impaired the zzso of downstream repair factors zzso and zzso at the damage sites in response to both zzso and zzso We further identified that the zzso removes zzso at zzso 13 and 15 of zzso and zzso as well as zzso 118 and 119 of zzso in response to DNA zzso Taken together, the results suggested that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
