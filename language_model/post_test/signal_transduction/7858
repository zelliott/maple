Low molecular weight protein zzso zzso zzso was cloned from human lens zzso B3 cells zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso The pure zzso reacted positively with zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso activity and was extremely sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso system as demonstrated by both activity zzso and by mass zzso zzso The zzso study also showed that an zzso zzso bond was formed between zzso and zzso at the active site, and was reduced by the zzso zzso The putative role of zzso in regulating zzso derived growth factor zzso cell signaling was demonstrated in wild type mouse lens zzso cells zzso in which zzso was zzso zzso zzso with the transient zzso of zzso at the active site of zzso zzso and the downstream signaling components of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso activity in zzso zzso from zzso mice was progressively lost, zzso with the high zzso and sustained high zzso levels at zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso activity regulated by zzso zzso and zzso reduction is the likely mechanism of zzso signaling in lens zzso zzso
