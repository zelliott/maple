In zzso cells, zzso hormone zzso expression is zzso by zzso via zzso zzso zzso although no classical zzso response elements exist in the zzso zzso The response to zzso involves zzso and zzso however, targeted zzso of their binding sites in the zzso promoter do not completely abolish the zzso In this work we assessed whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso might represent alternative pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso using real-time zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cell line zzso We also explored the signaling zzso potentially zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased after zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso abolished the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired the effect on zzso and zzso and reducing zzso and zzso zzso activities curtailed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the nucleus after incubation with zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso sites, but not of zzso or zzso sites, precluded the response of a zzso zzso promoter to zzso In conclusion, in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso mainly through zzso although other zzso may also zzso zzso and zzso binding to the zzso promoter is essential to increase the activity of the zzso promoter in response to zzso
