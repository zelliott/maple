zzso anomalies are important birth defects that are incompletely understood genetically and zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso is a genetic cause of limb zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso syndrome and zzso zzso A closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso member, zzso causes zzso zzso syndrome in humans but has not been investigated in limb zzso During limb development, zzso processing of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso restricts Sonic zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso expression overlap in developing limbs and that zzso converts zzso from zzso to zzso in zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso loss of function abrogates zzso zzso expression in anterior limb zzso limits zzso in the zone of polarizing activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show rescue of the zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso These studies identify a previously zzso role for zzso in regulating limb zzso number via its zzso effect on zzso and zzso expression zzso Together, these results indicate that two zzso zzso members that cause disparate human zzso zzso syndromes interact genetically and demonstrate the importance of zzso in regulating zzso zzso in developing zzso
