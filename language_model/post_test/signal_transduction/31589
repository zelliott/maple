zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso essential in several cellular functions such as DNA repair, DNA transcription, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene is mainly dictated by the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso a component from the zzso zzso zzso expressed at high levels during wound healing of the zzso zzso was reported to exert a positive influence on expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter by altering the state of zzso zzso a process that depended on the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate whether zzso gene expression might be similarly regulated by zzso through the same signaling pathways and attempted to link expression of this gene to zzso wound healing in zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was monitored by Western zzso in cultures of rabbit zzso zzso cells zzso grown on zzso in the presence of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso were conducted to assess the binding of zzso and zzso in nuclear extracts from zzso grown on zzso in the presence of zzso zzso bearing the zzso promoter fused to the zzso reporter gene were also zzso into zzso grown under similar culture conditions to assess the influence of these zzso on zzso promoter zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso increased considerably in zzso grown on zzso and translated into increased binding of zzso and zzso to their DNA target zzso In addition, zzso increased zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso and the zzso pathways entirely abolished these zzso 

zzso gene expression was strongly activated by zzso through zzso in the zzso state of zzso and zzso that resulted from the zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso thereby suggesting that zzso may play a critical function during the highly zzso phase that characterizes wound healing of the zzso zzso
