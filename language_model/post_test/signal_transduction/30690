zzso cell zzso is associated with zzso and inflammatory diseases, but the natural controls of mast cell zzso are poorly zzso We hypothesized that zzso regulatory T cells zzso could function in mast cell zzso In this study, we demonstrate that mast cells can recruit both zzso and conventional zzso T cells zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso suppress mast cell zzso zzso Despite the known zzso functions of zzso and zzso zzso suppression was independent of zzso and zzso and required cell zzso Surprisingly, zzso with either zzso or zzso cells suppressed zzso zzso zzso production but enhanced zzso production by mast zzso This was accompanied by a selective increase in zzso zzso zzso which is a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data are the first direct demonstration that mast cells can recruit zzso and illustrate that T cell interactions can alter the mast cell zzso
