zzso zzso zzso has well characterized effects on memory and cognitive zzso Recently we have reported that repetitive administration of zzso lowers the threshold pulse number in inducing zzso long-term zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso in which a zzso high frequency stimulation zzso 30 zzso at 100 zzso for normal rats could induce robust zzso in zzso rats zzso et zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso could trigger the zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso rats, but not in control zzso We found in slices obtained from the zzso rats that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso which was essential for the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso a downstream factor of zzso family zzso was required for the zzso zzso The zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso but not its inactive zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso increase and abolished the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the chronic administration of zzso brings the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso state that causes an enough level of zzso increase for zzso induction even by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso transient by the zzso zzso may trigger the zzso zzso that will further zzso zzso followed by an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This novel zzso zzso signal amplification through zzso cycle may play a pivotal role in the zzso zzso zzso
