The zzso cycle intermediate zzso has recently been identified as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously found that this zzso is one of the most highly expressed zzso in human zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso and to explore the signaling pathways of this zzso in zzso 

Using zzso we demonstrated that zzso is expressed in human zzso at a level corresponding to that of the zzso zzso Light transmission zzso experiments showed zzso zzso induced by zzso reaching a maximum response at zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso was confirmed with flow zzso showing increased surface expression of activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling was found to result in decreased zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to depend on zzso generation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is subject to zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely prevented zzso zzso induced by zzso 

Our experiments show that zzso zzso full zzso of human zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso generation, zzso release, and zzso zzso
