zzso is a 50 zzso zzso protein important for regulating B zzso proliferation and zzso This novel zzso zzso is primarily expressed by zzso cells including B zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso Recently, human zzso from a variety of zzso were shown to display zzso however, its function was zzso Cellular responses zzso by zzso are naturally triggered by its zzso the zzso zzso which is displayed on activated T cells, mast cells, zzso zzso and B lineage zzso This study investigated the functional significance of zzso expression on zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso The experiments reported zzso demonstrate zzso zzso expression on cultured zzso ligament zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, cells of zzso origin displayed up to zzso higher zzso levels of zzso versus zzso from zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso treatment enhanced zzso expression on zzso and zzso zzso with up to zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso on zzso cells in both normal and acutely inflamed zzso zzso zzso of zzso in inflamed tissue was significantly higher than in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso triggered cells revealed the induction of zzso zzso on a 50 zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is an active signaling zzso in zzso zzso This concept was further substantiated by the fact that zzso engagement zzso zzso 6 zzso production by zzso zzso but not zzso ligament zzso Overall, these results demonstrate that zzso on zzso zzso may functionally interact with zzso zzso This zzso interaction can stimulate zzso zzso and synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso
