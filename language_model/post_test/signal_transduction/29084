The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso is a new therapeutic agent that preserves or restores pancreatic beta cell zzso We report that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso induce zzso signaling in pancreatic beta cells, both isolated zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proliferation of beta cells requires active zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso of cell zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling activity depends on zzso zzso receptors and the protein zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso protein zzso In contrast, zzso zzso enhance zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso of zzso and beta cell independent of zzso zzso of zzso signaling by small interfering zzso to zzso or a zzso zzso decreases both zzso and zzso beta cell zzso zzso signaling appears to mediate zzso beta cell proliferation raising possibilities for novel treatments of zzso
