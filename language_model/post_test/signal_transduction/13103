In the developing spinal cord, signals from the roof plate are required for the development of three classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso listed from zzso to zzso Here, we demonstrate that absence of zzso and zzso normally expressed in the roof plate, leads to diminished development of D1 and zzso zzso and a zzso increase in D3 zzso zzso This occurs without significantly altered expression of zzso and related genes in the roof zzso Moreover, zzso protein zzso expression of D1 and zzso markers in the isolated zzso region of the chick neural plate, and zzso does not interfere with this zzso Thus, zzso signaling plays a critical role in the zzso of cell types for zzso zzso
