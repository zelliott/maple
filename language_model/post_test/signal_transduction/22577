We isolated a dominant zzso zzso zzso accelerated cell death 6 zzso with elevated defenses, patches of dead and enlarged cells, reduced zzso and increased resistance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso are suppressed by removing a key signaling zzso salicylic acid zzso by using the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso This suppression includes zzso that are not induced by application of zzso to zzso plants, indicating that zzso acts with a second signal to cause many zzso zzso zzso plants show zzso of all zzso zzso after treatment with a synthetic zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso acid zzso suggesting that zzso acts with and also zzso the levels and/or activity of the second defense zzso zzso acts partially through a zzso OF zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso that activates defenses and zzso resistance to zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso plants develop many zzso abnormal zzso indicating a possible role for zzso in modulating cell zzso
