zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been classified as zzso to the zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso signaling has been revealed to be more complex and also involves zzso to zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso There are now many examples of selective zzso of independent pathways by G zzso zzso zzso zzso a concept referred to as functional zzso Because most zzso zzso had thus far only been functionally characterized by their ability to stimulate zzso production, we systematically determined the zzso and zzso of a panel of zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, we adapted three zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso to evaluate the respective pathways in living zzso Our results suggest considerable functional selectivity among the tested, structurally related zzso zzso was the most selective in zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso alcohol were the most biased for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed reversal in order of zzso between zzso 2 and zzso functional zzso comparing zzso alcohol and either zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso Most zzso were full zzso for the three pathways zzso Our results have implications for the use of zzso zzso in experimental and possibly clinical settings, because their activity zzso on zzso differ from that of the native zzso The zzso methodology used for this first systematic assessment of a set of zzso zzso should be zzso for the study of other zzso
