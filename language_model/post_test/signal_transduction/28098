In the present study, we aimed to zzso the mechanism responsible for zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso in zzso signaling zzso provides a rational approach for in zzso targeting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in 16 of 22 zzso investigated zzso cases and was, in general, associated with resistance to spontaneous zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso activity by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso In the majority of cases, zzso zzso activity was zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso and the Ras inhibitor zzso both inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of Ras zzso was caused by zzso in the gene zzso for zzso in zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso activity could so far not be ascribed to the zzso production of growth factors or to zzso in the zzso zzso since zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that Ras zzso is an important zzso for triggering the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
