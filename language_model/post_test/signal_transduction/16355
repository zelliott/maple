zzso from patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit zzso cell dysfunction, zzso deposition, zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso We sought to determine whether human zzso zzso zzso zzso the main component of zzso zzso might contribute to zzso inflammation by recruiting and zzso zzso Early zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused release of zzso and zzso by zzso and induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly diminished in zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso and in cells treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the significance of zzso signaling in zzso pancreatic zzso dysfunction, zzso from zzso or zzso transgenic mice were transplanted into diabetic zzso recipients implanted with zzso pumps containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly improved the impairment in zzso tolerance observed in recipients of transgenic zzso 8 zzso following zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso contained zzso deposits in close association with zzso zzso zzso zzso contained 50% more zzso than zzso zzso an effect that was inhibited by zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso recruitment and that zzso but not zzso or zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso These data raise the possibility that zzso zzso inflammation contributes to zzso cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso
