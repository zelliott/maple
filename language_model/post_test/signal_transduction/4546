zzso virus zzso establishes a persistent zzso infection in B zzso and is associated with the development of numerous human zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso has potent cell cycle deregulation capabilities, and functions as a regulator of both zzso and zzso zzso We performed zzso profiling on zzso zzso B cells and identified several zzso and members of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as cellular target genes that could be zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso is sufficient to reduce the migration of cells expressing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Gene repression by zzso zzso was accompanied by decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso In an zzso cell line expressing all zzso zzso we identified binding sites for zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and in a zzso regulatory region between zzso and zzso providing the first demonstration of zzso zzso association with zzso control zzso Our data zzso indirect mechanisms in zzso and zzso repression by zzso zzso In zzso we have unveiled key cellular pathways zzso by zzso zzso that are likely to contribute to the ability of zzso cells to zzso immune responses, zzso and zzso migration to facilitate persistence in the zzso
