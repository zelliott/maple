zzso cell death is the ultimate cause of vision loss in various retinal disorders, including retinal detachment zzso zzso cell death has been thought to occur mainly through zzso which is the most characterized form of programmed cell zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso plays a central role for inducing zzso and in experimental models of zzso dying zzso cells exhibit zzso zzso however, there is a paradox that zzso zzso alone does not provide a sufficient protection against zzso cell loss, suggesting that other mechanisms of cell death are zzso Recent accumulating evidence demonstrates that zzso forms of cell death, such as zzso and zzso are also regulated by specific molecular machinery, such as those zzso by zzso proteins and zzso protein zzso zzso Here we zzso the current knowledge of cell death signaling and its roles in zzso cell death after zzso and other retinal degenerative zzso A body of studies indicate that not only zzso but also zzso and zzso signaling are involved in zzso cell death, and that combined targeting of these pathways may be an effective zzso strategy for retinal diseases associated with zzso cell zzso
