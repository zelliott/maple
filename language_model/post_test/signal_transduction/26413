zzso heat shock proteins are molecular zzso whose expression is increased after many different types of zzso They have a protective function helping the cell to cope with lethal zzso Their zzso expression is low in zzso normal and zzso zzso However, in cancer cells and particularly in zzso zzso they are surprisingly zzso zzso cells have to zzso their zzso requirements and therefore have a higher need for zzso This cancer cell addiction for zzso is the basis for the use of zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso have been shown to interact with different key zzso zzso As a result, zzso can essentially block the zzso pathways at several steps, most of them involving the zzso of zzso zzso called zzso zzso and differentiation are zzso processes that share many common features, for instance, a controlled zzso zzso and zzso zzso are frequently zzso It is, therefore, not surprising that zzso may be implicated in the differentiation zzso zzso may determine the fate of the cells by orchestrating the decision of zzso versus zzso This review will focus on the role of zzso in zzso zzso and the emerging therapeutic options that are being either proposed or used to target these protective zzso
