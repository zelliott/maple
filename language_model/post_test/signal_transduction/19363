zzso use small zzso signals to access their local population zzso in a process called zzso sensing zzso Once a threshold signal concentration is reached, and therefore a certain number of bacteria have zzso bacteria use zzso to change gene expression levels and initiate behaviors that benefit the zzso These group processes play central roles in both bacterial zzso and zzso and can have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and the zzso The dependence of zzso on small zzso signals has inspired organic chemists to design non-native molecules that can intercept these signals and thereby zzso bacterial group zzso The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso has been the target of many of these efforts due to its prevalence in human zzso zzso zzso uses at least two zzso zzso zzso signals and three zzso zzso receptors to initiate a range of zzso behaviors at high cell zzso including zzso formation and the production of an arsenal of zzso zzso This perspective highlights recent chemical efforts to zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and offers insight into the development of zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso
