The zzso shuttling zzso factor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso interacting zinc finger zzso is a zzso expressed protein that regulates both zzso and nuclear zzso In the nucleus, zzso zzso zzso of genes crucial to zzso differentiation and genes activated by various anabolic zzso including zzso hormone zzso We investigated the role of zzso in the zzso increase in bone by engineering mice with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and treating zzso female mice with anabolic doses of human zzso zzso at 30 zzso 7 zzso for 7 weeks or vehicle zzso The zzso baseline zzso of the zzso mice between 8 and 16 weeks of age included a modest but significant increase in bone mineral density zzso and bone mineral content zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso Type I collagen zzso expression was moderately elevated in the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso decreased body weight by zzso when expressed on a mixed background but the same zzso on a pure B6 background yielded a zzso zzso increase in body weight among the zzso mice, compared to their zzso zzso zzso treatment equally enhanced zzso and zzso over zzso mice in both the zzso and zzso groups but zzso mice exhibited a significantly greater zzso acquisition of zzso zzso bone as compared to zzso zzso These data support our hypothesis that zzso is a zzso zzso that suppresses zzso synthesis and zzso acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
