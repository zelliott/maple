During zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso decision between vascular tip cells versus stalk zzso zzso zzso signaling depends on sequential zzso events, zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso triggers zzso processing, first by zzso and then zzso This zzso the zzso zzso domain, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate zzso zzso Here we report that conditional zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso the increased branching and density of the retinal zzso that is also caused by interfering with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice have additional vascular zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso enlarged zzso zzso zzso containing zzso cell masses, abnormal zzso zzso leading to stunted long bone growth and increased zzso zzso following zzso zzso Our findings support a model in which zzso is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso decisions, most likely because of its essential role in zzso zzso zzso
