Mice with zzso zzso 16 zzso which have zzso of a region of mouse zzso 16 zzso to the Down syndrome critical region in human zzso 21, are used as a model for Down zzso zzso of the central zzso transmission was studied in zzso zzso zzso analysis in cerebral zzso revealed no change in the number of zzso and a slight reduction of zzso The zzso zzso was assessed by analyzing zzso formation in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso under zzso conditions and after stimulation with zzso and zzso zzso production of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso mice compared to control, but not in zzso After zzso zzso net increments in zzso zzso were similar in both groups of zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso (10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso was much higher in zzso than in cerebral zzso of either zzso In both areas, but not in zzso the zzso responses were consistently and significantly smaller in zzso than in control zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were generated in the cerebral zzso zzso responses were lower in zzso than in control zzso however, in zzso mice the slope of the response curve to zzso was markedly depressed whereas that to zzso was similar to zzso It is concluded that zzso mice show severe deficiencies in the synaptic transmission of the central zzso system, which are selective for specific brain zzso
