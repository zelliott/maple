In this study, we describe an zzso zzso zzso activity in rat zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso we demonstrate an zzso activity that shares the major zzso properties described for zzso alkaline pH zzso zzso zzso dependence and blockade of activity by metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso values for zzso zzso were found to be 106 zzso 18 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that an zzso is zzso with an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso on the zzso surface, as part of a multiple system for zzso zzso since they can act under distinct zzso conditions and can be differently zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso decreased only zzso zzso Besides, zzso 10 and 20 zzso sodium zzso just inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso and 10 zzso affected only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso described here represents a novel insight into the control of zzso zzso zzso
