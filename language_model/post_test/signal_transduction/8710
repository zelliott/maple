Administration of zzso to female rats caused a rapid and severe decline in liver zzso and inhibited zzso protein synthesis in association with zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso two key regulatory proteins involved in initiation of zzso zzso zzso of both regulatory proteins is zzso through a signaling zzso that involves the zzso target of zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso protein zzso zzso plays a role in the cellular response to environmental zzso which zzso zzso and suppresses protein synthesis through zzso zzso zzso We investigated the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso of protein zzso The administration of zzso surprisingly decreased zzso activity compared with controls despite zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of protein synthesis by zzso is due to zzso zzso of zzso signaling following zzso zzso
