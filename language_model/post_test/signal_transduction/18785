The acquisition of zzso or zzso identity is highlighted in vascular zzso Previously, we have reported an embryonic stem zzso cell differentiation system that exhibits early vascular development using vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso cells as common vascular zzso In this study, we zzso induced differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso to zzso molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso 

zzso were induced from zzso zzso cells with various zzso zzso was essential to induce zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso alone mainly induced zzso zzso zzso (or zzso with zzso supported substantial induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso signal zzso in zzso The zzso effect of zzso and zzso was abolished in zzso recognition sequence binding protein at the zzso site deficient zzso cells lacking zzso signal zzso or in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso Nevertheless, forced zzso zzso by the zzso active zzso alone did not induce zzso zzso 

zzso is a novel signaling zzso to activate zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso signaling of zzso zzso and zzso is required to induce zzso zzso from vascular zzso
