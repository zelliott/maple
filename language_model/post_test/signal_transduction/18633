zzso is an zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso It is essential for primordial germ cell zzso development, for the development of the zzso and for zzso closure, as demonstrated by loss of zzso zzso By contrast, the appearance of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in thickened zzso zzso are zzso defects that have not been associated with loss of zzso zzso zzso We show that defects in zzso and zzso can already be detected at embryonic day zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso cells appear suddenly in thickened zzso at zzso and at a remote distance from the zzso and zzso primitive streak, suggesting a change of fate in zzso These zzso zzso zzso cells appear to be Stella negative and hence cannot be called bona fide zzso We demonstrate a robust zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as well as of zzso and zzso activity, in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of several zzso target genes in different zzso and the zzso presence of cells of several zzso lineages in the zzso zzso suggest that different levels of zzso zzso may determine cell zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso can induce zzso of zzso mimicking the early zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results support a model in which loss of zzso results paradoxically in gain of zzso function defects in the zzso
