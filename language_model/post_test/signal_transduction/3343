zzso cell migration as exhibited by zzso is distinct from zzso cell migration and is characterized by dynamic competition among multiple zzso which determines directional persistence and responses to spatial zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling is thought to play a broadly important role in cell zzso yet the zzso functions of this zzso have not been adequately zzso By mapping the zzso dynamics of cell zzso and zzso signaling monitored by total internal reflection zzso zzso we show that randomly zzso zzso zzso polarity through zzso branching and pivoting of zzso zzso zzso did not affect the initiation of newly zzso zzso nor did it prevent zzso induced by zzso of zzso Rather, zzso signaling increased after, not before, the onset of local zzso and was required for the lateral spreading and stabilization of nascent zzso During zzso the branch experiencing the higher zzso concentration was favored, and, thus, the cell zzso so as to align with the external zzso
