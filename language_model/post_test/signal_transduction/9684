Maintenance of zzso functional zzso and their robust recruitment to zzso in response to injury and/or microbial infection are crucial for host zzso Equally important, although less well zzso are the processes for removal of these short-lived zzso Here, we review recent findings of novel zzso characteristics that determine zzso These zzso signals, in turn, can shape the responses of other cells and surrounding zzso and promote a return to zzso If not removed, dying zzso disintegrate and release zzso cargo that can further contribute to ongoing zzso tissue destruction, or zzso
