zzso between zzso zzso receptors zzso and their zzso have a complexity and zzso that is unparalleled within known zzso Each developing B cell zzso gene zzso to generate a zzso zzso by a unique pair of zzso zzso variable region zzso which serves to make the zzso capabilities of primary zzso incredibly zzso Further diversification of the zzso repertoire takes place when zzso B cells enter the zzso center zzso response and undergo zzso zzso zzso of their zzso variable region zzso To develop optimal zzso responses against foreign zzso the key zzso survival and differentiation decisions made in the zzso are based primarily on the affinity of the zzso (and therefore subsequent zzso for foreign zzso However, the secondary diversification of zzso by zzso also carries the risk of generating new zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso we review the role of zzso zzso in controlling pivotal events both leading up to and during the zzso zzso The emergence of zzso during the zzso response is also zzso with particular focus on the threat posed by zzso zzso B cells that bind both self and foreign zzso
