The zzso acid zzso zzso beta zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso differentiation of human zzso In this study we show that zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 and zzso caused a marked induction of zzso promoter activity and had a synergistic effect with zzso that also zzso zzso The effect of zzso is zzso by two zzso responsive elements zzso whereas the IGF-1 and zzso actions are independent of the zzso and map to sequences that overlap the zzso zzso These results suggest that the signaling pathways zzso by zzso and IGF-1 could modify the components assembled at the core zzso promoter and activate zzso zzso of zzso mimics the effect of IGF-1 and zzso on the promoter, and a dominant negative Ras zzso abrogates zzso A dominant negative zzso also blocks zzso showing that the zzso zzso mediates stimulation of the zzso zzso Our results show that zzso differentiation induced by zzso agents that activate Ras is accompanied by increased zzso of the zzso zzso
