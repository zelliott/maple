In zzso it is well established that zzso contributes to learning and memory by orchestrating the translation of experience into the zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso requires the concerted action of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is not known, however, whether a comparable molecular sequence occurs in zzso despite the zzso contribution of these cells to brain zzso Here we sought to determine whether and how zzso and zzso cause zzso zzso in rat cortical zzso zzso Both zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso and the zzso of zzso a zzso regulator of synaptic plasticity zzso zzso We zzso a zzso and zzso protein zzso C at the uppermost position of the cascade leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially dependent on zzso and zzso but independent of zzso zzso zzso A or zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso activate zzso zzso in cortical zzso via an zzso protein zzso zzso It is of relevance that the signaling involved be starkly different to the one described in zzso since there is no convergence of zzso and zzso zzso pathways on zzso which, moreover, exerts a zzso rather than a central zzso Our data thus point to the existence of an alternative, zzso zzso role of zzso in zzso
