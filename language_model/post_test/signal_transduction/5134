Channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso proteins belonging to the zzso zzso that likely play an important role in the regulation of zzso immune cell zzso zzso zzso are expressed by zzso and zzso zzso and based on their structural features can be classified as either putative zzso or zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated at the zzso and functional levels that zzso zzso induced zzso signaling zzso resulting in immune cell zzso zzso we have shown that putative zzso zzso may abrogate immune cell responses by recruiting zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to their zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we used zzso virus to express zzso zzso proteins zzso the zzso and zzso regions of human zzso fused with the zzso tails of two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso This approach allowed us to study the specific effects of zzso signaling on zzso killing of B cell targets zzso zzso zzso using a standard zzso release zzso Our results suggest that both zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso cellular zzso Furthermore, using a zzso inactive zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso and zzso we also demonstrate that the zzso functional zzso response is zzso zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso is facilitated by both zzso and independent mechanisms, possibly involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso The involvement of this zzso zzso requires binding to a zzso zzso zzso in the unique membrane zzso zzso tail region of zzso Overall, this represents the first functional information for zzso zzso and reveals that zzso zzso engage zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways to abrogate zzso zzso
