zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso brain tumor in adults with a median survival of zzso zzso under the best available zzso New treatment strategies are therefore urgently required, for which a profound understanding of tumor biology is zzso Much effort has been devoted to zzso zzso signaling zzso Recently it was discovered that the zzso factor zzso which is activated by zzso zzso is a highly zzso marker in zzso as determined by zzso To determine whether zzso cells have zzso active zzso we performed experiments with reporter genes with cells isolated from surgically removed human tumors and cell zzso We also determined whether the zzso signaling inhibitor zzso influences reporter gene expression and cell zzso and we determined the expression of zzso zzso and zzso by quantitative real-time zzso zzso gene analysis of nine cultures and four cell lines demonstrated a significantly enhanced zzso activity in six tumor cell cultures and all cell zzso Analysis of cell viability in the presence of zzso revealed a response of all cell cultures with the exception of one primary culture and one cell line, but only one cell line responded to zzso with reduced zzso signaling zzso This indicates that the toxicity of zzso toward zzso cells is independent from zzso zzso Since no correlation between zzso activity and zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels was observed we conclude that other mechanisms aside from zzso regulation of these factors are responsible for zzso activity in tumor cells derived from zzso
