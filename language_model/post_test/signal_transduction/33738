The firing behavior of 47 zzso zzso zzso was studied in two alert zzso monkeys during zzso of whole body, head and zzso A total of 27 of these zzso zzso were sensitive to spatial motion of the head irrespective of the mode of zzso These zzso responded similarly when the head moved simultaneously with the zzso and when the head voluntarily or involuntarily moved on the stationary zzso These zzso did not respond to rotation of the trunk when the spatial position of the head was zzso Five zzso zzso responded only to zzso movement of the head produced by external force, but were insensitive to voluntary spatial head zzso They also did not respond to spatial motion of the zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso were sensitive to spatial motion, which included rotation of the zzso These zzso responded when the trunk moved alone, and when the trunk moved simultaneously with the head, but were not responsive to spatial movement of the head while the trunk was zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso comprises two distinct functional zzso In one of these channels, zzso spatial motion of the head is zzso In the other channel, zzso motion of the body in space is zzso Each of these channels further consists of two zzso In the principal division the motion signal is conveyed zzso irrespective of the behavioral context of zzso In the other auxiliary division the signal only codes movement caused by zzso applied zzso
