How drugs bind to their zzso initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound zzso or zzso remained unknown, even for zzso zzso zzso which constitute one-third of all marketed zzso We captured this zzso critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with zzso receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined zzso We found that several beta zzso and a beta zzso all traverse the same zzso dominant zzso as they bind to the zzso and zzso zzso initially making contact with a zzso on each zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, association with this zzso at a distance of 15 zzso from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to zzso despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the zzso to zzso and the drug to squeeze through a narrow zzso The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial zzso that takes place as the drug associates with the zzso Our zzso description of the binding process suggests opportunities for zzso zzso and provides a structural foundation for future zzso of zzso binding and zzso zzso
