The zzso cascade linking zzso of zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso receptors to rat zzso zzso channel zzso was studied in zzso using zzso clamped zzso zzso cells and pharmacological zzso To check the recent suggestion that zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso current suppression, the hormonal effects were studied in cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not significantly modified in the presence of the zzso Surprisingly, the hormonal effects became irreversible in the presence of zzso but not in the presence of the more potent zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Further experiments indicated that the effect of zzso correlated with its ability to inhibit protein zzso C zzso The hormonal effects also became irreversible in cells in which zzso activity was selectively impaired with zzso zzso or long-term incubation with zzso zzso Furthermore, the reversal of the effects of zzso but not its ability to suppress zzso zzso was blocked if zzso generation was prevented by blocking zzso C activity with zzso Our results suggest that a zzso involving an as yet unidentified protein zzso is the main cause of zzso zzso in zzso clamped zzso zzso Furthermore, they demonstrate that although not necessary to trigger the zzso current reductions induced by zzso an zzso signal cascade involving zzso zzso by zzso C, zzso of an zzso conventional zzso and one or more zzso steps zzso by protein zzso zzso mediates recovery of zzso currents following zzso zzso
