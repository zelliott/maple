Previously, we reported that zzso a saturated fatty acid, promotes zzso differentiation and zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms by which zzso promotes vascular zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso factor in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso by either supplementation of zzso zzso acid or zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso occurred through zzso of the zzso pathway, along with increased zzso differentiation and zzso of zzso Either zzso or the zzso inhibitor but not zzso or other fatty acid treatments also increased zzso stress as determined by the expression of zzso zzso and the spliced form of zzso which were directly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso differentiation and zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso with an zzso containing zzso induced vascular zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso of zzso mediates vascular zzso induced by zzso
