zzso anemia zzso is a fatal genetic disorder associated with zzso and zzso zzso lacking functional zzso genes are hypersensitive to zzso zzso agents, and are deficient in DNA zzso break zzso Multiple genes with zzso zzso have been zzso however, the molecular basis for zzso remains zzso The results presented zzso indicate that a zzso zzso process is zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso into normal zzso zzso them to DNA damaging agents, whereas this treatment had no effect on zzso from zzso zzso The DNA zzso process deficient in zzso cells also requires the zzso zzso and DNA zzso IV zzso These data reveal the existence of a previously zzso zzso DNA zzso break repair zzso in zzso zzso cells, and suggest that failure to activate this zzso is responsible, at least in part, for the defective DNA zzso observed in zzso zzso
