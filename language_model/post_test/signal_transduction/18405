Small zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso exchange reaction of zzso and the zzso and zzso family members and zzso their binding to zzso In zzso zzso zzso shows zzso and transforming activities in cooperation with zzso However, the zzso function of zzso zzso remains zzso Here we show that mice lacking zzso zzso died of heart failure shortly after birth, not resulting from zzso heart defects but from enhanced zzso of zzso triggered by cardiovascular zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and developing zzso cells underwent zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were susceptible to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were protected from zzso cell death by ex zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso partly coincide with those observed in zzso mice, suggesting that zzso zzso is involved in zzso cell survival signaling through zzso
