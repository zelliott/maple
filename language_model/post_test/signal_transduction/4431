The zzso response to stress results in the zzso of zzso protein zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are a zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso are involved in the zzso of activity of the zzso factor zzso by zzso modification of two of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity can also be elevated by increased expression of the zzso zzso a further zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso a zzso factor involved in the induction of the expression from the zzso promoter through the zzso serum response element, is known to be activated as a result of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, induction of zzso expression in response to noxious agents takes place in the absence of zzso zzso We therefore investigated whether zzso similarly zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso 

zzso is activated in response to stimuli other than zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso interact physically with, and zzso zzso The capacity of zzso to form a zzso complex with serum response factor in zzso is thereby zzso In zzso selective zzso of zzso stimulates formation of the zzso complex containing zzso serum response factor and the serum response element, and enhances zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso reveals zzso a zzso critical for zzso complex formation and zzso zzso to be the major zzso zzso 

zzso responds to zzso as well as zzso signals by stimulating zzso zzso through the serum response zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and the ensuing expression of zzso protein thus constitutes an additional mechanism by which cells can zzso zzso activity in response to zzso
