The zzso signal zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso and vascular zzso However, the function of this zzso in the pulmonary vascular smooth cell proliferation in response to zzso remains zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that the main components of the zzso pathway, including sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor 1 zzso are expressed in the human pulmonary zzso smooth muscle cells zzso Interestingly, zzso significantly enhanced the expression of zzso and zzso facilitated the zzso of zzso into the zzso and promoted the proliferation of zzso Furthermore, direct zzso of the zzso zzso through incubation with the zzso zzso human zzso or with zzso and zzso two zzso zzso also enhanced the proliferation of zzso zzso the treatment with zzso and zzso zzso or zzso a specific zzso zzso markedly inhibited the nuclear zzso of zzso and cell proliferation in the zzso induced by zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, the treatment with zzso increased zzso in the hypoxic zzso These data strongly demonstrate for the first time that the zzso signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of zzso growth in response to zzso
