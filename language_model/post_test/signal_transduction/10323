zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that survives and zzso in professional zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso has to cope with the panel of zzso host immune mechanisms, among which zzso plays a crucial zzso We report in this study that in zzso infection of zzso zzso with viable, but not with zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso signaling within the infected zzso Thus, infection of zzso zzso with zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of target zzso and zzso of zzso These effects were dependent on direct contact of the host cells with living zzso and were not due to zzso zzso In zzso we report the induction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is a known feedback inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced directly by viable zzso zzso zzso in zzso did not affect zzso proliferation per se, yet abolished the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso were diminished in zzso from zzso zzso The results suggest that induction of zzso proteins within zzso due to infection with zzso zzso contributes to the zzso immune evasion zzso
