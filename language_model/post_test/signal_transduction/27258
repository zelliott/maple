T zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout mice lack circulating zzso and fail to produce zzso zzso in response to stimulation with T zzso zzso We show here that these animals are able to produce significant levels of circulating zzso zzso when injected with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of circulating zzso zzso in T zzso mice was only partially reduced when the animals were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso independence of this response was further supported by experiments showing that zzso zzso induced circulating zzso when injected into zzso knockout mice, and sterile zzso zzso transcript production when cultured with zzso B cells from the same zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso signaling causes zzso zzso switching in zzso
