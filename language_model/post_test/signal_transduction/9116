zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that promotes differentiation and cell survival in the zzso zzso zzso and interacts with zzso zzso a scaffold protein of zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is altered in gastric cancer zzso patients, suggesting a zzso role for zzso in spatial regulation of zzso zzso We show here that loss of zzso accelerated proliferation of normal stomach and zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso 84 in zzso and enhanced nuclear zzso and zzso zzso of zzso target zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso through interaction of the zzso scaffolding domain zzso with a zzso zzso motif in zzso 7 of zzso zzso zzso zzso cooperated with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso protein 1 zzso to promote the zzso zzso activity of zzso and to inhibit cell zzso zzso zzso also reduced tumor growth and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso model of zzso These results suggest a novel mechanism of zzso regulation by which zzso zzso act as scaffold proteins that zzso and sensitize zzso to zzso limiting proliferation of gastric zzso zzso
