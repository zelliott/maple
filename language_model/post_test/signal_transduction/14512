zzso zzso alpha zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the zzso network controlling these phenomena, we investigated zzso gene expression in embryonic zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression program in control cells, but not in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the induction of levels of zzso zzso stress protection genes in response to increased zzso levels was dependent on zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso induction of zzso zzso gamma and nuclear respiratory factor 2 zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso zzso levels of zzso were decreased in the absence of zzso The absence of zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso zzso activity in response to zzso zzso Our results indicate an essential role for zzso as a key regulator of zzso zzso
