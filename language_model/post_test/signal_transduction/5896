The zzso zzso zzso functions as both an zzso and signaling zzso upon exposure to zzso Recent studies have indicated that zzso function can be activated via zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, signaling molecules that regulate zzso zzso in zzso are not well zzso A strong candidate zzso is the small zzso zzso the dominant zzso zzso of zzso which regulates zzso zzso 

We hypothesized that zzso positively regulates zzso during zzso zzso zzso 

To test whether zzso activates zzso downstream of zzso zzso or other zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso from zzso or zzso mice with diverse zzso and measured zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso We also examined the role of zzso in zzso signaling pathways by analyzing zzso and spreading of zzso or zzso zzso on zzso immobilized zzso Finally, we monitored the zzso status of related zzso zzso to detect changes in signaling pathways potentially associated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso displayed comparable zzso or zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased spreading on immobilized collagen but similar zzso to immobilized collagen compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso possibly revealing functional compensation among zzso family zzso 

zzso is required for zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
