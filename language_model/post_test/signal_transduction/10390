zzso rat zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This study determined signal zzso mechanisms zzso contraction of the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso muscle strips were exposed to zzso of zzso thought to be involved in signal zzso in zzso followed by a cumulative zzso zzso zzso zzso measures were the zzso contraction, the potency of zzso and the affinity of zzso for zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso C zzso with zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso C zzso with zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso the zzso maximum and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and protein zzso G zzso with zzso zzso reduces the zzso maximum and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso increases zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso with zzso zzso reduces the zzso potency while increasing zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso increases zzso zzso This study demonstrates that different signal zzso mechanisms mediate the zzso response in the zzso rat zzso than in normal rat zzso In normal rat zzso zzso and zzso mediate the contraction, but in zzso zzso only zzso is zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is more dominant than in normal zzso zzso seems to mediate a zzso response in normal zzso whereas it seems to inhibit contraction in zzso zzso
