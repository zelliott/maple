The zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and found to be active zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso and bacterial plant zzso It causes a rapid zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso encodes a signal sequence followed by a zzso zzso sequence that precedes the mature zzso zzso which is basic zzso point zzso zzso and 66 zzso acid zzso long zzso weight of zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso zzso flowers, shoot zzso and leaves, but not in roots, or zzso and is locally zzso by wounding and by zzso acid zzso zzso of this gene is also zzso after infection of potato zzso with the compatible fungus zzso zzso and zzso by the virulent bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations are zzso with the hypothesis that the zzso is a component of both zzso and zzso defense zzso
