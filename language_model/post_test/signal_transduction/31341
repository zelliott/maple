zzso in zzso genes that regulate different pathways and zzso processes are reported to cause a zzso zzso in zzso The observed zzso masses were generally linked to the zzso immune zzso To investigate whether all black masses are associated with the cellular immune response, we characterized zzso masses from zzso in 14 zzso We found that the zzso masses can be subdivided into zzso zzso engaging the zzso zzso and into zzso that are not zzso by zzso With rare exception, the zzso is carried out by zzso zzso zzso are found in the zzso or in association with the zzso zzso while zzso are located in the gut, zzso zzso and zzso In cactus zzso we found an additional kind of zzso mass containing various zzso The development of these tissue zzso is dependent on the function of the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso of each zzso not only reflects its connection to a particular genetic zzso but also points to the zzso role of the individual zzso
