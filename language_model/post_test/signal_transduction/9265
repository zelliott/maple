In most species, solar light is both a zzso agent and the key zzso stimulus for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is an attractive zzso system in which to study the influence of light on gene expression because the DNA repair proteins and zzso zzso in this species are zzso At the molecular level, light treatment of zzso cells zzso the production of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso both alters the zzso zzso state of these cells and stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso signals zzso the zzso of particular zzso zzso including some clock genes and some DNA repair genes involved in zzso To date, however, the zzso molecules responsible for zzso zzso production have not been zzso zzso zzso such as reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are versatile zzso that catalyze molecular zzso in numerous zzso zzso zzso light zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso leading to zzso zzso Here, we show in cultured zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso both suppresses zzso zzso and efficiently reduces zzso expression of clock and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso may be responsible for zzso zzso production and thus zzso gene expression in zzso Our findings also support the existence of a regulatory link between zzso and the zzso clock in this zzso
