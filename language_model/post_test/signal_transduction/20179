TRAIL is a member of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso cell death by engaging the zzso death receptors zzso and zzso The zzso potential of the TRAIL zzso has been targeted by several therapeutic approaches including zzso TRAIL and zzso zzso zzso among zzso Interest in zzso tumor cells to zzso zzso has driven investigations of zzso gene regulation, though regulation of the TRAIL gene has been less zzso Physiologically, TRAIL serves as a zzso zzso zzso in the immune surveillance of cancer that is zzso expressed by immune cells upon stimulation via an zzso element that was identified in early studies of the TRAIL gene zzso Here, we map the TRAIL gene promoter and review studies of TRAIL gene regulation that involve several zzso of gene regulation including zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and functionally distinct zzso
