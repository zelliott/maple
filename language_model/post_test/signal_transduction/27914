zzso of zzso zzso to cells in the form of zzso zzso complexes zzso strong cellular zzso During this process, zzso is delivered from zzso to the plasma zzso and the zzso zzso is then rapidly transported to an zzso zzso This transport appears to be important for certain cellular responses to zzso as drugs that block transport also inhibit signaling and cells from zzso zzso mice fail to exhibit this zzso To identify the zzso destination of zzso labeled zzso after its delivery from zzso into cells, we have made simultaneous observations of different zzso using fluorescent vital zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso apparatus were labeled using Texas red zzso zzso mark Red zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso After 30 zzso zzso did not zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso although some zzso zzso overlapped with the zzso marker, fluorescent zzso On the other hand, zzso did appear to zzso with two markers of the zzso apparatus, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin B zzso We further confirmed the zzso of zzso in the zzso apparatus using an zzso cell line, zzso which responds to zzso complexes in a zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso with zzso labeled zzso apparatus zzso in live zzso zzso zzso disruption of the zzso apparatus in zzso zzso zzso cells caused zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso These results are consistent with the zzso apparatus being the primary delivery site of zzso zzso
