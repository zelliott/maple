zzso receptors can mediate zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso To further examine the role of the zzso alpha zzso in these signaling functions, we assessed the contribution of the alpha 6 zzso domain zzso to the signaling properties of the alpha 6 beta 1 zzso using zzso cells that had been zzso with either the alpha zzso or the alpha zzso zzso The alpha zzso beta 1 and alpha zzso beta 1 receptors induced marked quantitative differences in the zzso zzso of several proteins after binding to zzso Specifically, the alpha zzso zzso domain was more effective than the alpha zzso zzso domain in inducing the zzso zzso of three major proteins zzso mass, zzso zzso and 76 zzso In addition to these zzso we also observed that the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso was increased significantly more by alpha zzso beta 1 zzso zzso to zzso than by that of alpha zzso beta zzso This differential pattern of zzso zzso induction does not appear to be a secondary event initiated by cell shape zzso Also, differences in zzso zzso in the alpha 6 zzso were not evident in response to attachment to other zzso These findings provide zzso evidence for functional differences between alpha zzso zzso domain zzso of the same zzso
