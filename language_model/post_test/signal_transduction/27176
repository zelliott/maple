A zzso zzso clone has been isolated that encodes a protein containing six imperfect zzso repeats zzso of approximately 22 zzso acids in zzso The putative zzso designated zzso also contains a signal zzso and six potential zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso and its zzso consensus sequences found significant zzso to the zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and some plant disease resistance zzso zzso from zzso gel zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso accumulates rapidly in zzso and juvenile leaves by 6 h zzso with the fungus zzso zzso Further experiments suggest that the gene zzso zzso is neither zzso induced by zzso zzso nor zzso activated in a zzso zzso The presence of zzso strongly suggests that the zzso protein is involved in zzso binding and therefore may be a component of a signal zzso zzso
