zzso regulation of zzso expression in response to iron loading appears to be the zzso mechanism for zzso zzso Iron normally zzso expression of the zzso zzso which, in turn, activates the zzso signaling cascade directing zzso zzso The molecular function of the zzso zzso involved in the most common form of zzso zzso is still zzso We have used zzso mice of different genetic backgrounds to test whether zzso has a role in the signaling cascade induced by zzso At 7 weeks of age, these mice have accumulated iron in their liver and have increased zzso zzso and zzso However, in contrast to mice with secondary iron overload, levels of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso both indicators of zzso zzso are not significantly higher in the liver of these mice than in zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso zzso levels in zzso mice are similar or marginally reduced, compared with zzso zzso zzso The inappropriately low levels of zzso and zzso zzso observed at weaning further suggest that zzso zzso triggers iron overload by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore appears to facilitate signal zzso induced by the zzso zzso
