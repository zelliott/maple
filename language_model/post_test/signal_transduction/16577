Iron regulatory proteins zzso and 2) function as zzso regulators that coordinate the cellular iron metabolism of zzso by binding to the zzso of target genes such as the zzso zzso or zzso In addition to zzso zzso serves as sensor of zzso oxygen species zzso As iron and oxygen are essential but potentially toxic constituents of most organisms, zzso zzso of zzso activity may be an important regulatory element in zzso iron zzso and zzso zzso The responses of zzso towards zzso oxygen species are zzso and rather zzso zzso activates zzso via a signaling cascade that leads to zzso of the zzso zzso and cellular iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a direct chemical attack being limited to the zzso zzso In particular, zzso of zzso by zzso has established a new regulatory link between inflammation and iron metabolism with new clinical zzso This mechanism seems to contribute to the anemia of chronic disease and zzso iron zzso in zzso In addition, the zzso side effects of zzso zzso drugs such as zzso may involve zzso zzso zzso These molecular insights open up new therapeutic strategies for the clinical management of chronic inflammation and zzso zzso
