zzso of signaling pathways by zzso radiation is a key event in the DNA damage response and initiated by different cellular zzso Here we show that zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso repair zzso initiate a rapid but transient zzso of the damage response proteins zzso and zzso by contrast, zzso cells display delayed but persistent signaling and zzso of cell cycle progression upon release from zzso zzso In the absence of repair, zzso checkpoint zzso zzso with the formation of zzso DNA breaks by the action of the zzso zzso Although temporally zzso zzso of checkpoint proteins in zzso and zzso cells depends on a common zzso involving the zzso zzso These data reveal that damage signaling in zzso cells proceeds via zzso and zzso processing of zzso zzso through generation of DNA strand breaks, ultimately preventing the transition from zzso to S zzso
