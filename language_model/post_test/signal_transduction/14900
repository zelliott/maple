Parkinson's disease zzso is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso remains incompletely zzso Environmental factors, zzso damage, zzso protein zzso zzso system zzso and zzso dysfunction might all be zzso Recent studies point to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death linked to zzso zzso of unfolded and/or zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To withstand such potentially lethal conditions, zzso signaling pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein responses zzso are zzso The zzso include zzso zzso induction of zzso resident zzso and degradation of zzso proteins through the zzso zzso In case of severe and/or prolonged zzso stress, cellular signals leading to cell death are zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso stress induced by zzso protein degradation is implicated in zzso Here the authors review the emerging role of zzso stress in zzso and related disorders, and highlight current knowledge in this field that may reveal novel insight into disease mechanisms and help to provide novel avenues to potential zzso
