zzso aberrations zzso govern the transformation of previously normal cells into cancer cells by changing key signaling pathways within the cells that control cellular zzso differentiation and zzso Such zzso are thus considered prime molecular targets for cancer zzso While some notable examples underscore the clinical relevance of this connection between zzso and drug response, there is a lack of zzso approaches to provide such novel zzso combinations in a broad and unbiased zzso We have therefore collected a panel of genetically and zzso characterized zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines to systematically screen for drug zzso of zzso as a function of genetic zzso We found such genetic zzso to predict activity of zzso zzso zzso as well as of the clinically approved zzso zzso This work may therefore help advancing our understanding of critical zzso zzso zzso and may impact future drug development by defining zzso patient zzso
