We investigated the role of Heat shock protein 90 zzso in vitamin D action in zzso cells using zzso zzso to block zzso function and zzso interference to reduce zzso zzso When cells were exposed to zzso vitamin zzso gene expression and zzso activity were inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso shift analysis indicated that zzso reduced vitamin zzso DNA binding activity of the vitamin D zzso zzso We tested the specific role of zzso by knocking down its expression with zzso expressed short hairpin zzso Vitamin zzso gene expression and zzso activity were reduced by zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso Nuclear protein for zzso and zzso its zzso partner, were not reduced in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is needed for optimal vitamin D responsiveness in the zzso and demonstrate a specific role for zzso in zzso zzso
