The detailed structure of molecular networks, including their dependence on conditions and time, are now routinely zzso by various experimental zzso zzso is a vital aid in zzso and interpreting such zzso We describe emerging approaches for representing and visualizing systems data and for achieving semantic zzso or changes in information density zzso with zzso A central challenge is to move beyond the display of a zzso network to zzso of networks as a function of time, space and cell state, which capture the zzso of the zzso We consider approaches for representing the role of protein complexes in the cell cycle, displaying zzso of metabolism in a zzso format, zzso experimental interaction data with structured zzso such as Gene zzso categories and representing zzso interactions among zzso groups of zzso
