Members of both the zzso and bone zzso protein zzso families of signaling molecules have been implicated in the regulation of cartilage zzso We explored the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso commitment of zzso zzso Treating cells with zzso zzso was tied to zzso commitment by zzso zzso zzso activity zzso 92 zzso type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by its specific inhibitor blocked zzso zzso commitment by stimulating zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso of zzso by zzso is associated with zzso commitment, and that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in this zzso
