The zzso is a zzso cell derived from zzso and branches from the zzso lineage early during the differentiation zzso The zzso zzso appears critical for zzso formation due to production of zzso zzso a recently described zzso differentiation factor, by zzso zzso cells in response to a variety of zzso zzso In addition, factors such as zzso a newly described inhibitor of zzso formation, as well as zzso products produced by the zzso itself and other cells in the zzso enhance or inhibit zzso zzso The identification of the role of zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso in zzso differentiation and bone zzso have provided important insights in the regulation of normal zzso zzso Current research is beginning to delineate the signaling pathways involved in zzso bone zzso and zzso formation in response to zzso and zzso The recent development of zzso cell lines may make it possible for major advances to our understanding of the biology of the zzso to be realized in the near zzso
