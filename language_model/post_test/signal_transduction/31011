The aims of this study were to determine effects of diabetes duration on zzso zzso zzso injury and test whether zzso differences in sensitivity of the zzso diabetic rat heart to zzso are related to differences in vascular density, levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso NO formation, zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso After 2 or 6 weeks of zzso diabetes, zzso injury was induced by zzso (30 zzso and zzso of the left descending coronary zzso After 2 weeks of diabetes, zzso size and zzso of zzso a zzso zzso were decreased as compared with zzso controls or rats that had been diabetic for 6 weeks, whereas zzso density and levels of zzso and zzso protein and cardiac zzso levels were all zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso was also significantly increased after 2 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable to controls after 2 weeks of diabetes, whereas levels of zzso a zzso zzso were zzso After 6 weeks of diabetes, zzso zzso was increased and levels of zzso and plasma NO were reduced as compared with controls or rats diabetic for 2 zzso Our results indicate zzso zzso mechanisms become zzso activated in this early stage of diabetes and that this may protect the heart from zzso injury through enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso NO formation, zzso of cell survival signals, and decreased zzso zzso
