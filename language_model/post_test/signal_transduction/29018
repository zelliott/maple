zzso has six zzso protein zzso zzso zzso five of which are expressed primarily in zzso zzso in all five affect zzso guidance, either alone or in zzso zzso zzso central nervous system zzso and motor zzso guidance zzso are usually observed only when specific combinations of two or more zzso are zzso Here, we examine the sixth zzso zzso which is broadly zzso 

zzso and zzso are closely related type III zzso zzso insect species have only one type III zzso which is closest to zzso We found that zzso zzso are viable and zzso We then examined zzso zzso double zzso These die before the zzso stage, and have a mild zzso zzso in which the outer zzso zzso bundle is zzso zzso zzso double zzso have a strong zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso cross the zzso and the outer and middle zzso zzso are fused to the inner zzso To examine if zzso also exhibits synthetic zzso in combination with zzso we made zzso zzso double zzso and zzso zzso zzso triple zzso No zzso was observed in the double zzso The triple zzso zzso differs from the zzso zzso zzso in two zzso First, the zzso tracts appear more normal than in the double zzso two or three zzso are observed, although they are zzso and zzso Second, zzso zzso by the zzso marker often cross in the wrong zzso We also examined motor zzso guidance, and found that no zzso are observed in any zzso double zzso zzso However, triple zzso in which zzso zzso was combined with zzso or zzso exhibited stronger zzso than the corresponding zzso double zzso 

Type III zzso are required for viability in zzso since zzso zzso double zzso die before the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso appears to be a relatively minor player in the control of zzso zzso Strong zzso are only observed in triple zzso in which both type III zzso are eliminated together with zzso or zzso Our results allow us to construct a complete genetic interaction zzso for all six of the zzso
