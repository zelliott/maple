In recent reports, zzso zzso factor zzso has been implicated as an injury factor involved in regulating zzso in the zzso In this study, we used a rat zzso zzso cell line that is highly responsive to zzso to examine zzso zzso that may play a role in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We determined that zzso zzso the transient zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso This nuclear zzso was followed by zzso promoter zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Level of zzso zzso zzso however, were unaffected by addition of the zzso zzso studies using an upstream zzso zzso rat zzso promoter linked to a zzso reporter gene revealed zzso zzso zzso within 1 h of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso to zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso zzso region as being important for zzso zzso promoter zzso These two regions showed a strong degree of overlap for zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of the two regions revealed several zzso that are thought to be involved in zzso regulation and/or the regulation of other genes by members of the zzso family of zzso Moreover, we are the first to report the presence of several putative zzso elements within our identified zzso and zzso regions in the zzso gene zzso
