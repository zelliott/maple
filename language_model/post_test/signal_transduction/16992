The relationship between drug resistance, changes in zzso and emergence of an invasive zzso is well zzso but the underlying mechanisms are not well zzso Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of zzso the gene that encodes the zzso transition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as exceptionally zzso of lack of response to zzso family zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and this zzso zzso activity diversified zzso signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by zzso zzso zzso signaling diversification was required for zzso zzso growth zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso associated with zzso other zzso zzso family members, zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso but not zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso From these zzso interaction data, we predicted zzso signaling zzso for additional zzso and validated these predictions in zzso This alternative mechanism of zzso zzso limits the use of zzso therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired zzso Further, zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso across all zzso zzso cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of zzso is principally a means to zzso zzso
