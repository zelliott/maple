zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that belongs to the zzso family of proteins and plays diverse roles in the zzso zzso In response to stress zzso it activates a variety of gene targets including zzso A, zzso D and zzso which are involved in zzso in various tissue zzso zzso expression has been correlated with maintenance of a cancer cell zzso However, other studies demonstrate an zzso or zzso role for zzso In this review, we zzso the signaling pathways that activate zzso as well as its downstream zzso We examine the role of zzso in zzso with respect to other zzso zzso using data from studies in human cancer cell lines, human zzso and mouse models, and we propose a potential model for its function in zzso as well as a theoretical basis for its utility in zzso drug zzso
