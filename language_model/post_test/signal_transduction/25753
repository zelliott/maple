zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by zzso body movement, cognitive impairment and psychiatric zzso A zzso expansion in the zzso region of the zzso zzso protein is the genetic cause of zzso zzso protein interacts with a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso causes cell signaling zzso in various neurotransmitter systems, including zzso zzso and zzso systems, as well as zzso factor zzso This review will overview recent findings concerning zzso zzso in cell signaling that involve different zzso and zzso factor systems, especially involving zzso as zzso plays a crucial role in zzso cell zzso The zzso cell death that takes place in the zzso and zzso of HD patients is the most important factor underlying HD zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso have a very controversial role in zzso cell death and it is not clear whether zzso zzso either protects or zzso zzso zzso Thus, understanding how zzso zzso protein affects zzso zzso signaling will be essential to further establish a role for zzso receptors in HD and develop therapeutic strategies to treat zzso
