To explore the expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and therefore to study the possible zzso 

zzso were collected from zzso zzso fluid from patients with zzso and then were zzso for 24 h with zzso at zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso 5 zzso 10 zzso and 20 zzso zzso The gene expression level of zzso induced by zzso was detected by zzso zzso and zzso activity was measured by zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso mobility shift zzso 

In zzso zzso the zzso unit rate of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso When zzso were zzso by zzso at zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso 5 zzso 10 zzso and 20 zzso the zzso unit rates of zzso zzso to zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso unit of active zzso was 10 227 zzso zzso but when zzso were zzso by zzso at zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso 5 zzso 10 zzso and 20 zzso the zzso units of active zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly elevated after zzso were zzso by zzso at the concentration of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression and activity of zzso can be induced by zzso and the induction was possibly related with the zzso signal zzso zzso
