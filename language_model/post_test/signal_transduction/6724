zzso play crucial roles in regulating immune zzso Two important characteristics of most zzso are zzso defined as the ability of one zzso to exhibit diverse zzso and zzso defined as the ability of multiple zzso to exert overlapping zzso zzso the zzso for unique cellular responses to zzso in the face of shared zzso zzso zzso and zzso will be essential in order to harness the potential of zzso as zzso Here, we discuss the zzso zzso geometry and zzso and cellular zzso trafficking and zzso abundance of signaling zzso parameters that contribute to the specificity of zzso zzso Whereas the role of zzso zzso complex geometry in zzso signaling is still not completely zzso zzso affinity is known to impact signaling through zzso of the stability and zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso trafficking also plays an important and likely underappreciated role in the diversification of zzso zzso but it has been challenging to zzso probe trafficking zzso We also review recent efforts to zzso levels of zzso signaling zzso as second zzso abundance can affect zzso zzso both zzso and zzso We conclude by discussing the application of protein engineering to develop zzso relevant zzso with reduced zzso and redirected biological zzso
