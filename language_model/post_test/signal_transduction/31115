zzso establish and maintain separate populations of cells critical for organ zzso We show that zzso signaling establishes the boundary between two types of zzso zzso cells, the zzso and the zzso zzso These cells will undergo zzso movements to generate the two sides of a simple organ, the zzso zzso tube of the zzso egg zzso The boundary forms due to a difference in zzso levels in adjacent zzso The zzso expression pattern mimics the zzso zzso levels are high in zzso cells and low in Broad zzso zzso zzso clones generate an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells arise in zzso cells adjacent to the zzso zzso cells but not further away from the zzso zzso zzso a component of the zzso pathway, is required for Broad expression and for zzso zzso We further show that Broad zzso zzso cell zzso Our data provide a foundation for understanding how a single row of zzso cells arises adjacent to the Broad cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a boundary by the zzso zzso might constitute an zzso zzso first step during organ formation in many zzso
