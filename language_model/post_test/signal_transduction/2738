zzso A systematic study is reported on the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which leads to the production of second zzso zzso and zzso In liver of normal male, adult, fed zzso rats the steady state activity of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso That the two zzso have short zzso was observed in zzso where in the rat liver or bone zzso activities rapidly decreased and on zzso were restored in a zzso zzso to rats of the protein synthetic zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso 80 zzso for the two zzso in bone zzso and zzso zzso 80 zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso zzso with proliferation was shown by the high activities as compared to liver of these zzso in rat zzso of high cell renewal capacity, zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso proliferation was indicated by the observation that in rat zzso the zzso activities increased zzso to zzso and were highest in rapidly growing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In human primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were elevated zzso and zzso respectively, and in zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso Similar increases were observed in zzso human breast zzso cells in comparison with normal breast zzso zzso zzso The linkage of signal zzso zzso activities with zzso proliferation was also observed in experiments when human breast zzso cells were zzso in zzso and expressed their zzso capacity in the log zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities steadily and zzso increased to a peak zzso rise in zzso zzso In late log and plateau zzso the zzso activities gradually declined to the starting zzso Similar observations were made for the two zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells and in rat zzso zzso cells in tissue zzso zzso In animals injected with zzso the bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso the shortest zzso rate in comparison with 8 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso activities in the bone zzso with zzso zzso 82 and 78 zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
