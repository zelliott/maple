zzso of zzso tumor zzso by zzso its negative regulator zzso double minute zzso has been considered an attractive strategy for cancer therapy and several classes of zzso binding zzso have been zzso However, these compounds do not inhibit the zzso interaction, and their effectiveness can be compromised in tumors zzso zzso Here, we identify small molecules that zzso block zzso binding with both zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso bind into and zzso the zzso pockets of zzso and zzso by inducing the formation of zzso protein complexes kept together by a zzso zzso zzso This mode of action effectively stabilized zzso and activated zzso signaling in cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso zzso activity in the presence of high levels of zzso and may offer a more effective therapeutic zzso for zzso zzso
