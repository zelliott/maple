zzso oxygen species play a critical role in inducing zzso The small zzso zzso Ras and the zzso zzso have been proposed as key regulators of the signaling cascade triggered by zzso stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are so far functionally zzso because they activate the same downstream zzso including zzso Moreover, zzso signaling has been involved in both protection and induction of zzso 

Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were subjected to zzso and zzso was detected by zzso cell sorting analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes in zzso was performed to evaluate the response to zzso We have found that, whereas zzso decreases tolerance to zzso stress, zzso has a potent zzso zzso Both effects are zzso by zzso zzso to zzso is zzso by a unique stretch of zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso lacking in zzso and it is relatively independent of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Ras signaling by zzso zzso increased the resistance to zzso in zzso zzso 

These findings explain the opposite effects of zzso stimulation on zzso found in different cell types and suggest that local zzso of zzso signaling may account for the opposing response to zzso stress by zzso or zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso to zzso stress by zzso Ras points to the specific and zzso effects of Ras zzso in zzso as potential therapeutic drugs in disorders produced by increase of zzso oxygen species inside the zzso
