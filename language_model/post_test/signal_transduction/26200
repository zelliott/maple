zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develops through zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso is known to activate growth factor signaling zzso resulting in cellular zzso but precisely how has not been zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of zzso and downstream factors such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed zzso in normal, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso was examined using an zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso The zzso effect on the zzso of zzso cells was assessed by the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were similar among zzso types but correlated with each zzso The nuclear zzso labeling index zzso was higher in cancer than in normal zzso and zzso The nuclear zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso was higher than that of moderately zzso or poorly zzso differentiated zzso The nuclear expression of zzso was correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The nuclear zzso level was significantly correlated with prognosis in cases of zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso was zzso into the nucleus from the zzso in 1 to 3 hours after zzso zzso Further, zzso induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso in the zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso into the nucleus by zzso may be related to the suppression of zzso by zzso and consequently to zzso zzso and prognosis in zzso zzso zzso
