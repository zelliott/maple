Whereas zzso zzso zzso chain zzso is zzso in a variety of human solid zzso including pancreatic cancer, we investigated its significance in cancer invasion and zzso We used two pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and generated zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso interference zzso zzso zzso zzso of invasion and signal zzso was compared between zzso and zzso cells and tumor zzso was assessed in zzso model for human pancreatic cancer with zzso zzso of zzso zzso treatment enhanced cell invasion in zzso cancer cell lines but not in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, gene transfer of zzso in negative cell lines enhanced invasion, whereas its zzso zzso invasion of pancreatic cell lines in a zzso invasion zzso In zzso study revealed that zzso cancer zzso to zzso zzso liver, and zzso at a significantly higher rate compared with zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso was found to be increased compared with primary tumors, and mice with zzso cancer displayed zzso and poor zzso Invasion and zzso also correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso activity in these zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso nuclear factors in zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in zzso cell zzso Taken together, our results show for the first time that zzso can signal through zzso in pancreatic cancer cells and zzso may serve as a zzso zzso of invasion and zzso in pancreatic zzso
