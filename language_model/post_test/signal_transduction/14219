In peripheral nerves, zzso cells form zzso which zzso the rapid zzso of action zzso along zzso in the zzso nervous zzso zzso zzso cells are derived from neural crest zzso in a zzso process that is regulated by zzso signals and zzso zzso In addition to forming the zzso zzso zzso cells orchestrate much of the zzso response that occurs after injury to peripheral zzso In response to injury, zzso zzso cells zzso into repair cells that are essential for zzso zzso and then zzso into zzso zzso cells to restore nerve zzso Although this remarkable plasticity has long been zzso many questions remain unanswered regarding the signaling pathways regulating both zzso and the zzso cell response to zzso
