In terms of a zzso zzso system zzso which is a kind of hybrid system model, this article discusses a series of approaches to zzso zzso and zzso a biological network such as a zzso zzso First, the input assignment problem, the zzso state set problem zzso and the input trajectory generation problem are emphasized as control problems to be addressed for biological zzso zzso after the zzso issue on biological networks developed in the systems and control community is briefly explained, the zzso is described in detail with reference to control of the zzso system in the pathogen zzso zzso Finally, an optimal control design method to the zzso system is proposed as a solution to the input trajectory generation zzso
