zzso are zzso stem cells that differentiate into zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso that differentiate into smooth, zzso and cardiac muscle, and zzso and zzso damaged skeletal muscle in a zzso model for zzso muscular zzso We report that the marker profile of zzso is similar to that of zzso isolated from embryonic zzso zzso zzso bone zzso and heart, but distinct from zzso derived from skeletal zzso We also demonstrate that zzso differentiate into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to peripheral nerve zzso in zzso muscles and exhibit zzso and marker expression of mature zzso cells, and zzso zzso In zzso zzso spontaneously express markers of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso hormone nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso initiated process extension by zzso and when combined with zzso growth factor 1, zzso and zzso hormone, enhanced zzso expression of zzso precursor markers and maturation into the zzso zzso zzso injected into the right lateral zzso of the brain migrate to the corpus zzso and zzso white matter, where they express components of zzso Because zzso differentiate or mature into cell types of both zzso and zzso origin, they may be useful for treatment of a variety of degenerative diseases, or repair and zzso of multiple cell types in severely damaged zzso
