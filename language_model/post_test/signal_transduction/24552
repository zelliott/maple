zzso of zzso zzso by zzso C is initiated by either zzso stimulation or opening of zzso zzso This was once thought to be the sole mechanism to produce the zzso that links zzso signals to zzso events through zzso of protein zzso zzso It is becoming clear that zzso zzso of other membrane zzso particularly zzso zzso by zzso D and zzso zzso may also take part in cell zzso The products of zzso of these zzso may enhance and prolong the zzso of protein zzso zzso Such prolonged zzso of protein zzso C is essential for long-term cellular responses such as cell proliferation and zzso
