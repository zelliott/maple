zzso protein beta zzso controls gene zzso and zzso processes in a variety of zzso zzso however, its role in regulating insulin responsiveness in zzso has not been zzso We performed zzso zzso in awake, zzso chronically zzso adult mice zzso for a deletion in the gene for zzso zzso zzso plasma insulin, zzso and free fatty acid zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso (4 zzso suppressed zzso zzso production, zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso to a similar extent in zzso and zzso mice, suggesting that zzso deletion does not alter the zzso and gene regulatory response to insulin in liver and zzso zzso In contrast, using zzso (5 zzso and zzso (20 zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso disposal was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso higher in zzso mice, respectively, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso muscle was zzso greater in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were zzso greater in skeletal muscle from zzso mice compared with zzso zzso The level of insulin zzso zzso protein was increased zzso in skeletal muscle from zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso deletion decreases plasma zzso levels and increases insulin signal zzso specifically in skeletal muscle, and both contribute to increased zzso insulin zzso
