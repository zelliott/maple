zzso zzso plays important roles in several neurodegenerative zzso For instance, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso peptides are zzso in the pathology of Alzheimer's zzso zzso protein zzso are therefore potential diagnostic and zzso zzso for their zzso zzso zzso of the zzso species requires sensitive tools that efficiently discriminate them from zzso of the same zzso Here we have established a proximity zzso zzso zzso for specific and sensitive detection of zzso zzso via simultaneous recognition of three identical zzso present in the zzso zzso is a versatile technology in which the requirement for multiple target zzso is combined with the ability to translate signals from detected target molecules to zzso DNA zzso providing very high specificity and zzso 

For specific detection of zzso zzso we have used a zzso zzso zzso selective for zzso zzso in a modified zzso where the same zzso zzso was used for the three classes of affinity zzso required in the zzso These zzso were used for detection of soluble zzso zzso in zzso zzso allowing detection of just zzso zzso zzso zzso and with a dynamic range greater than six orders of zzso Compared to a sandwich zzso setup of the same zzso the zzso increases the sensitivity of the zzso zzso detection by up to zzso The zzso was used to measure soluble zzso zzso in brain zzso from mice transgenic for a human zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

The proximity zzso zzso is a versatile zzso technology for zzso which can provide highly sensitive and specific detection of zzso zzso - and by implication other protein zzso of relevance in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative zzso
