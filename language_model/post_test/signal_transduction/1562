zzso is a zzso signal zzso protein responsible for zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was zzso as the zzso form in which oxygen was bound to the zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso rate zzso were determined to be zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 23 zzso respectively, revealing that zzso has a moderate oxygen affinity similar to that of zzso whale zzso zzso The rate constant for zzso at 37 degrees C was zzso zzso which is also close to that of zzso Although the electronic zzso zzso of zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso showed some unique characteristics in its resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso gave the zzso band at a noticeably low frequency zzso zzso which suggests a unique hydrogen bonding between a zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso atom of the bound oxygen zzso zzso zzso gave the zzso band at a higher frequency zzso zzso than those of ordinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gave the zzso and zzso bands at zzso and 1964 zzso respectively, which fall on the same zzso versus zzso correlation line as that of zzso Based on these results, the structural and functional properties of zzso are zzso
