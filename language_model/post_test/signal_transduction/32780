Recent studies have documented direct interaction between zzso proteins and key molecules in signal zzso pathways like zzso zzso and protein zzso In T cells, the zzso zzso has been shown to associate with protein zzso C zzso and to zzso regulate zzso zzso Here we present data that zzso interacts with protein zzso C zzso zzso a zzso that differs from other zzso members in structure and zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso and zzso can be shown in the T cell line zzso by zzso and by zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso proteins using zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso Using zzso deletion zzso the zzso binding region is mapped within the regulatory C1 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso is significantly enhanced upon zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and occurs via a zzso zzso containing consensus zzso However, zzso is not a zzso of zzso In contrast zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso activity in intact zzso We therefore conclude that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso in T zzso
