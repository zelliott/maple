zzso zzso zzso zzso is unique among the zzso zzso family not only for its zzso zzso but also for its regulatory zzso zzso whose zzso action is released upon binding to the zzso zzso It is generally assumed that during visual zzso both zzso sites are relieved of zzso zzso upon binding of two activated zzso zzso Because zzso shares structural and pharmacological similarities with zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso to probe the zzso sites of zzso The membrane zzso zzso we used to zzso zzso binding to zzso required zzso zzso to stabilize drug binding to the active zzso Under these conditions, zzso binds zzso to both the zzso and zzso of the activated zzso zzso zzso fails to bind to either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso consistent with zzso blocking access to the zzso zzso Following zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding increases in proportion to the extent of zzso zzso Both zzso binding and zzso activity of zzso zzso fail to exceed 50% of the value for the zzso zzso zzso However, adding a zzso excess of activated zzso can stimulate the zzso activity of zzso to its maximum zzso These results demonstrate that both zzso of the zzso zzso are able to bind zzso to the zzso active zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso manner, with only one-half of the maximum zzso activity efficiently attained during visual zzso
