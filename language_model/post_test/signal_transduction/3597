zzso target of zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso forms two distinct functional zzso zzso complexes that mutually zzso different zzso and regulate a wide array of essential cellular processes including translation, zzso and zzso zzso is active in several types of cancer and plays a role in a variety of other serious human diseases, including diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and zzso kidney zzso However, until recently, only very little was known about the function of zzso in zzso zzso 

Emerging studies highlight the important roles of the zzso signaling zzso in both maintaining and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Here we review the current understanding of zzso signaling in zzso biology and discuss its implications for the development of zzso zzso
