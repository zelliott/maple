Previously, we have investigated the possible role of zzso as zzso and zzso of bone zzso It was found that the proposed regulatory mechanism produced zzso of zzso bone, under particular loading conditions, which were consistent with zzso and adaptation as seen in zzso The main objective of this study was to discern whether lining cells or zzso could possibly play a similar role as effectively with regard to their capacity for zzso of the zzso architecture, in terms of a low apparent mass to zzso zzso For that purpose the earlier analyses with zzso as zzso distributed throughout the bone, were repeated for zzso located at bone surfaces zzso Compared to the zzso model, the surface cell zzso zzso was reluctant to change its architecture, which implies that it is less sensitive to changes in the loading zzso This resulted in less efficient bone adaptation, which was reflected by a considerably higher relative mass for a similar apparent zzso in the loading zzso In other words, more mass is needed to obtain an equally stiff structure, at the apparent level, with respect to the zzso applied zzso Furthermore, stresses and strains at the tissue level vary across a much wider range, relative to the zzso model, where the higher zzso of elevated strains indicates an increased failure zzso zzso we conclude that mechanical information at the bone surface may not be sufficient to adequately regulate functional bone zzso
