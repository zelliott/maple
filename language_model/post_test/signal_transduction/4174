The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vessels (8 to 12 zzso in length containing four to six zzso were immersed in an organ bath with input provided by a zzso filled with zzso zzso The vessels were zzso to pump by applying a 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso M zzso zzso zzso or zzso blue to the zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on spontaneous pumping zzso However, zzso reversed the zzso caused by zzso and zzso When tested between zzso and zzso M, sodium zzso zzso had variable effects on zzso zzso depressed pumping in approximately 2/3 of the vessels and increased pumping in the remaining 1/3 of zzso When the results were zzso zzso caused a significant depression in zzso However, the lower concentration of zzso zzso zzso was able to reverse the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso blue whereas the higher concentration zzso zzso caused further reductions in pumping zzso These results suggest that bovine zzso vessels produce zzso oxide or a related zzso zzso zzso appear to facilitate the pumping response by an as yet undefined zzso
