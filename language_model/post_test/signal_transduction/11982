Lung cancer zzso is the major cause of death by cancer and the number of zzso patients is increasing zzso This study investigated the therapeutic potential of gene delivery using zzso of zzso signaling 1 zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso signaling zzso for the treatment of zzso To examine the zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso lung cancer zzso cells, zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso were infected with zzso zzso zzso The cell proliferation zzso showed that zzso and zzso but not zzso were sensitive to zzso zzso suppression of cell zzso Although zzso inhibitor I could also inhibit proliferation of zzso and zzso cells, zzso gene delivery appeared to be more potent as zzso could suppress focal zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso as well as the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was detected by means of zzso array in zzso zzso zzso cells compared with control cells, whereas no zzso of zzso was observed when zzso inhibitor I was zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso zzso zzso in zzso significantly suppressed zzso proliferation in a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso gene is effective for zzso therapy by suppressing the zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso signaling pathways and enhancing zzso zzso activity in zzso
