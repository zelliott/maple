zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso such as zzso acids and zzso acid, serve as second zzso of various hormones and growth factors and play pivotal roles in the regulation of zzso zzso and cardiac zzso As discussed in the present review, virtually all of the major AA zzso zzso zzso accept a variety of other zzso fatty acids zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso as efficient alternative zzso The zzso of these alternative zzso also elicit profound biological zzso The zzso zzso respond to zzso in the zzso and double bond structure of their zzso with remarkable changes in the zzso and zzso of product zzso The omega-3 double bond that zzso zzso and zzso from their zzso counterparts provides a preferred zzso site for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that predominantly function as AA zzso show largely increased zzso activities towards zzso and zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso signaling pathways are highly susceptible to changes in the relative zzso of the different zzso and may provide novel insight into the complex mechanisms that link essential dietary fatty acids to the development of cardiovascular zzso
