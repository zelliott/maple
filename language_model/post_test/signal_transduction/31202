zzso zzso has broad zzso activity against zzso and zzso B zzso However, the role of zzso in regulating zzso during innate immunity has not been zzso In this study, we show that the zzso gene is uniquely regulated by zzso in a cell zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in liver cells and zzso but not in T zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, other zzso genes such as zzso protein zzso were induced in all these cells, suggesting additional cellular factors may regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso induction of zzso but not other zzso zzso was zzso inhibited by the drug zzso through a mechanism independent of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso requires both zzso and zzso Surprisingly, induction of zzso was zzso independent, but zzso dependent in liver zzso However, zzso signaling was functional and required for zzso induction of zzso in these zzso Our results indicate that zzso may participate in zzso cellular defenses through a novel zzso signaling zzso
