Novel taste learning is a robust zzso incidental learning process, dependent on functional activity of the insular zzso zzso In contrast to that of the cortex, the role of the zzso in taste learning is zzso We set out to identify the time courses of the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the insular zzso and zzso of rats subsequent to novel taste zzso Following taste learning, an early response (20 zzso occurred at the same time in the insular zzso and the zzso However, whereas zzso was activated specifically in the insular cortex, zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso In addition, the immediate early zzso zzso binding protein zzso was induced in both the zzso and the insular zzso 18 h following taste zzso The results zzso for the first time, zzso zzso and gene expression in the zzso following novel taste zzso Moreover, the results suggest that different signal zzso zzso necessary for taste learning are activated in concert in different brain structures, to enable taste learning and zzso
