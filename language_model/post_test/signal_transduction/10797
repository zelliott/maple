Type B zzso acid zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso that regulates neurotransmitter release and zzso zzso throughout the zzso In various zzso zzso are concentrated at zzso zzso Although these receptors are assumed to respond to zzso zzso from neighboring zzso zzso their function is not fully zzso Here we show a previously zzso function of zzso exerted independent of zzso In zzso zzso cells, interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso leads to a zzso increase in the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is clearly zzso by zzso because it is absent in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso does not require zzso proteins that mediate the zzso classical zzso Moreover, zzso reveals complex formation between zzso and zzso in the zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso can act as zzso zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso
