zzso immunity and development is essential to ensure survival despite changing internal conditions in the zzso zzso metamorphosis represents a striking example of drastic and systemic zzso changes that need to be integrated with the innate immune zzso However, nothing is known about the mechanisms that coordinate development and immune cell activity in the transition from zzso to zzso Here, we reveal that regulation of zzso cells zzso by the steroid hormone zzso is essential for an effective innate immune response over zzso Although it is generally accepted that steroid hormones impact immunity in zzso their action on zzso zzso zzso and zzso is still not well zzso Here in a simpler model system, we used an approach that allows in zzso cell autonomous analysis of hormonal regulation of innate immune cells, by combining genetic manipulation with flow zzso high-resolution zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso We show that in response to zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and acquire the ability to zzso to damaged zzso Most importantly, individuals lacking zzso zzso are defective in bacterial zzso and are fatally susceptible to infection by bacteria zzso at zzso zzso despite the normal systemic and local production of zzso zzso This decrease in survival is comparable to the one observed in zzso lacking immune cells altogether, indicating that zzso is essential for zzso immune functions and survival after zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a large set of genes regulated at metamorphosis by zzso zzso among which many are known to function in cell zzso cell shape or zzso This study demonstrates an important role for steroid hormone regulation of immunity in zzso in zzso and zzso the way for genetic dissection of the mechanisms at work behind steroid regulation of innate immune zzso
