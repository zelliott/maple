zzso little caves of cell surfaces, are enriched in cholesterol, a certain level of which is required for their structural zzso Here we show in zzso that zzso a peripheral membrane protein and one of 3 zzso zzso present in zzso from zzso zzso is zzso upon cholesterol depletion in a rapid fashion resulting in collapse of zzso We exposed zzso zzso to the cholesterol depleting agent zzso which results in a sudden and extensive degradation of zzso by the zzso and a zzso movement of zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso along with loss of zzso The recovery of zzso at the plasma membrane is zzso and is required for the return of zzso from the zzso to the cell surface and zzso zzso zzso of zzso directed against zzso also results in a zzso distribution of zzso and loss of zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso functions as a cholesterol responsive component of zzso that is required for zzso zzso to the plasma zzso and zzso structural zzso
