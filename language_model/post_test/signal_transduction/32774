zzso zzso compounds, zzso and its two zzso zzso and zzso have various biological zzso Here we show that these compounds inhibit zzso zzso zzso with different specificity with distinct zzso Although all three compounds inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso reporter zzso these compounds exhibited differential effects in separate zzso reporter zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Next we found that one of these compounds, zzso was a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso Recently, zzso was reported as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso and zzso showed distinct specificity to various zzso zzso pathways despite their structural zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso mechanism is zzso
