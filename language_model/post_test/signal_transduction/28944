T cell zzso zzso stimulates cellular metabolism to support the elevated energetic and zzso demands of growth, zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso is limiting in T cell zzso and that zzso zzso is required to allow zzso zzso zzso following zzso stimulation by zzso expression and promoting the cell surface trafficking of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of T cell zzso zzso and zzso was critical, as low zzso prevented appropriate T cell zzso Additionally, transgenic expression of zzso zzso T cell zzso and led to zzso of readily activated zzso T cells with signs of zzso in aged zzso To further examine the regulation of zzso zzso we analyzed zzso zzso of zzso which appeared necessary for zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and which we have shown can promote zzso cell surface zzso zzso with a role for zzso in zzso trafficking, transgenic expression of zzso active zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of resting T cells, but did not alter zzso protein zzso zzso zzso appeared to promote zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cell surface zzso In support of this model, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a synergistic increase in zzso zzso and zzso of activated T cells in zzso that were largely independent of zzso zzso of zzso protein and zzso regulation of zzso trafficking are therefore zzso functions of zzso zzso that cooperate to promote zzso metabolism for T cell zzso and zzso
