During pulmonary development, Sonic zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso both contribute to branching zzso In zzso lung disease, the complex zzso structure of the lung is disrupted and zzso which leads to fibrosis, loss of respiratory surface, zzso and zzso It is well documented that zzso is involved in zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso in damaged zzso This study examined whether or not components of the zzso zzso pathway, as well as zzso are expressed in human zzso lung disease zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in zzso experimental models of zzso and zzso chronic pulmonary zzso Using zzso it was observed that zzso like zzso is zzso in zzso cells at sites of zzso disease but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso patched was detected in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso as well as normal resting peripheral blood T zzso Neither zzso nor patched is expressed by zzso zzso cells in inflammatory zzso This study demonstrates that patched is present in human peripheral zzso and zzso zzso at both protein and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that components of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of damaged pulmonary zzso and that damaged zzso and cells of the immune system may communicate via this zzso
