zzso tissue growth factor zzso is a zzso protein that belongs to zzso zzso The proteins in this family are implicated in various biological zzso such as zzso zzso migration, and zzso In this study, we explored the roles of zzso in lung zzso The expression levels of zzso in 58 lung cancer samples were reduced by zzso fold in 57% of the samples compared with matched normal samples using real-time reverse zzso These results were confirmed by zzso zzso for zzso in normal lung zzso and lung zzso Cellular proliferation was inhibited in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed lung cancer cell zzso The growth zzso caused by zzso zzso was associated with growth arrest at zzso and prominent induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso of zzso suppressed zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso In zzso zzso cells expressed decreased levels of zzso compared with normal lung zzso this lower expression has an effect on lung cancer cell proliferation and its cellular response to growth zzso Our data suggest that zzso may behave as a zzso tumor zzso protein in the normal zzso and its expression is suppressed in many zzso
