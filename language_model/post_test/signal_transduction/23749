zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by a severe decrease in muscle mass and strength in patients and zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism involved in the muscle zzso is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso is affected in zzso zzso muscles, characterized by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso levels in both the zzso and symptomatic zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso phase of the zzso supporting zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso machinery was affected as indicated by the increase in the number of zzso and of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso were abnormal at late but not at early stages of the disease, suggesting that zzso acts both upstream in the zzso zzso and downstream on the balance between the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso into zzso muscles rescued muscle mass and zzso the expression levels of zzso zzso the zzso pathway, and zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that the unbalanced regulation of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso machinery is a primary cause of the zzso zzso
