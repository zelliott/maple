zzso zzso has been established as a model tree system for zzso research of the response to zzso zzso This study describes a series of induced zzso changes and the associated zzso characterization of local and systemic responses in hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after simulated zzso zzso zzso were measured in local source zzso systemic source zzso and systemic sink zzso leaves following application of forest tent zzso zzso zzso oral zzso to mechanically wounded zzso zzso zzso analyses identified zzso and temporally zzso distinct patterns of local and systemic gene expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly and rapidly zzso in zzso zzso Genome analyses and full-length zzso cloning established an inventory of zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso leaves showed a rapid and strong zzso response compared with a weaker and slower response in adjacent zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso response in distant, juvenile zzso leaves was faster and stronger than that observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso leaves have signatures of rapid change of metabolism and zzso followed by later induction of defense zzso
