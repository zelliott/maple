The study focuses on the interaction between zzso oxygen species and hormones that regulate the programmed cell death in plants of Melissa zzso exposed to zzso zzso between hormone and zzso signaling pathways has been investigated in zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso lemon balm to verify if the response resembles the zzso defense zzso In comparison to controls, plants exhibited zzso injury and the cell death was induced by zzso zzso production of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso hormonal regulation of zzso zzso formation with a significant production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ozone degradation to zzso oxygen species and their zzso by some zzso (such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso systems (such as zzso acid, zzso and zzso that worked in cooperation without providing a defense against free zzso (such as confirmed by the modification of the zzso properties of leaf zzso This integrated view showed that zzso oxygen species interact with hormonal signaling zzso regulating cell death and the sensitivity of lemon balm to zzso
