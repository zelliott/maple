zzso cancer zzso is one of the most common zzso and primary cause of death in Chinese cancer zzso zzso is a major factor leading to treatment failure and low level of zzso survival rate in zzso patients following surgical zzso zzso identification of zzso with potential in predicting recurrence risk is the key problem of the prognosis in zzso zzso 

A total of 74 zzso patients were selected for systematic analysis, consisting of 31 patients with recurrence and 43 patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods were used to characterize differential expressed zzso from primary tumor zzso zzso we used a zzso method to select signature with best sensitivity and zzso Finally, we validated the signature in zzso samples zzso fresh and blood zzso using quantitative zzso 

We have identified 12 differential zzso including 7 zzso and 5 zzso zzso in recurrence zzso Using zzso method, we further zzso zzso as a signature to recognize recurrence and zzso cases in the training zzso Moreover, we validated this signature using quantitative zzso method in 64 test samples with consistent result with training zzso A high frequency recurrence and poor survival were observed in zzso cases with high level of zzso zzso In addition, we evaluated that zzso were involved in regulating target genes in several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso has the potential to recognize the recurrence risk and relate to the prognosis of zzso zzso
