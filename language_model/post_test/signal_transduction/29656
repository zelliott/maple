During zzso the zzso zzso is blocked in zzso of zzso zzso It becomes competent to resume zzso in response to zzso at the end of its growing period zzso VI of zzso Stage IV zzso contain a store of inactive zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is also zzso However, the positive feedback loop that allows zzso zzso is not functional at this stage of zzso zzso We report that when zzso B is zzso in stage IV zzso zzso zzso does not occur and the newly formed zzso zzso complexes are zzso by zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso remains active and that zzso is prevented to be zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in full grown zzso is not expressed at the protein level in small stage IV zzso In order to determine if zzso could be the missing regulator that prevents zzso zzso polo zzso was zzso in stage IV zzso Under these conditions, the zzso feedback loop was zzso Moreover, we show that acquisition of zzso competence does not require the zzso zzso
