Two structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso present in zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso appear to play distinct and important roles in the control of zzso zzso zzso Mice deficient in the zzso zzso zzso exhibit altered responsiveness of the zzso clock to zzso zzso but display robust zzso patterns of zzso zzso By contrast, our studies of mice lacking the zzso zzso which responds to both zzso and zzso indicate that this zzso plays a critical role in rhythm generation in the zzso The zzso factor determining zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice is zzso by zzso zzso animals zzso immediately to advances or delays in the zzso cycle and do not exhibit robust zzso rhythms of zzso when in constant zzso The mice do not exhibit zzso expression of core clock genes zzso zzso zzso or of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso We propose that zzso zzso between zzso zzso provides a zzso reinforcing signal that is essential for sustained rhythm zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso may explain why zzso zzso are capable of generating long-lasting zzso zzso whereas rhythmic clock gene expression in other zzso is dependent on periodic reinforcement by neural or hormonal zzso
