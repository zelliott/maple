Previous studies in zzso have revealed the presence of four proteins with a zzso zzso zzso GAP domain that share the ability to suppress the conditional growth zzso of the zzso zzso Three of these proteins have been shown previously to be zzso factor zzso zzso proteins zzso We now demonstrate that the fourth also exhibits in zzso zzso GAP activity and zzso the zzso and zzso GAP activities for all zzso Because the four zzso GAP proteins are quite diverse outside the zzso GAP domain, a genetic analysis was undertaken to define the level of functional zzso between zzso A large number of synthetic defects were observed that point to a high degree of functional overlap among the four zzso zzso However, several differences were also noted in the ability of each gene to suppress the synthetic defects of others and in the impact of single or combined deletions on zzso of membrane zzso We interpret these results as supportive evidence for roles of zzso zzso in a number of zzso essential cellular processes that include cell growth, protein zzso zzso and cell zzso The description of the zzso of the zzso zzso for the different responses is viewed as a necessary first step in zzso biologically relevant pathways through a functionally overlapping family of zzso zzso
