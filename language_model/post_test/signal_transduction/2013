17 zzso zzso regulates growth plate cartilage cells via classical nuclear zzso mechanisms, as well as by direct effects on the zzso zzso These direct effects are zzso causing a rapid increase in protein zzso C zzso specific activity, are only found in cells from female rats and are zzso by zzso serum zzso zzso which cannot penetrate the cell zzso zzso and zzso stimulate alkaline zzso specific activity and zzso zzso in female rat zzso cartilage cell cultures, but traditional nuclear receptors do not appear to be zzso This study examined the effect of the zzso tamoxifen on these markers of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso effect on zzso if tamoxifen has an effect on vitamin D zzso zzso which is zzso via specific membrane receptors zzso zzso and whether the effect of tamoxifen is zzso by nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the effect of zzso on zzso alkaline zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cultures of female resting zone zzso cells and growth zone zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting that its action is at the membrane and not cell zzso Neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso affected zzso or zzso zzso in female zzso zzso also inhibited the increase in zzso activity due to 1 zzso or zzso in growth plate cells derived from either female or male zzso zzso of zzso by tamoxifen may be a general property of membrane receptors involved in rapid responses to zzso
