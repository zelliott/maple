zzso smooth muscle cell zzso plasticity has been implicated in a variety of vascular disorders including zzso zzso and abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso zzso While the pathways governing this process remain zzso zzso regulation by specific zzso zzso has been demonstrated in zzso We hypothesized that additional zzso might play an important role in determining vascular zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed on human zzso zzso undergoing zzso switching in response to serum withdrawal, and identified 31 significantly regulated zzso We chose the highly zzso candidate zzso for additional zzso zzso of zzso accelerated zzso zzso and also promoted zzso while zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso blunted zzso As a potential zzso we investigated whether zzso influences zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso signaling with zzso zzso and the opposite effect with zzso zzso in zzso human zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso increased gene expression of zzso and zzso while zzso inhibited zzso zzso was also found to be zzso in two mouse models of AAA formation zzso to zzso decrease, zzso in which enhanced switching from zzso to synthetic zzso zzso In zzso zzso promotes vascular zzso proliferation while zzso cellular differentiation and zzso and alters zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an important new regulator of zzso biology and a potential therapeutic target in AAA zzso
