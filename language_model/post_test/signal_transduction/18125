zzso are plasma membrane zzso that have been implicated in signal zzso In many cellular systems, zzso are rich in signal zzso molecules such as G proteins and zzso zzso zzso An important structural component of the zzso is zzso Recent evidence show that among the zzso gene family, zzso is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and zzso are present in cardiac zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso have been localized to the zzso of cardiac zzso in zzso These findings prompted us to conduct a further analysis of cardiac zzso In order to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of signal zzso regulation in cardiac zzso we isolated cardiac zzso by zzso zzso density zzso zzso from rat zzso and rat zzso zzso Our analysis of zzso content demonstrates that zzso G zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are concentrated within these zzso We also show that zzso stimulation zzso an increase in the amount of diverse zzso and zzso of G zzso as well as zzso in both in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso Our data show that cardiac zzso are an important site of signal zzso zzso This finding suggests a potential role for these structures in zzso and pathological zzso
