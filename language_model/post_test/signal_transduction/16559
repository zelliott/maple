The classical zzso for zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso by zzso binding to an zzso response element zzso in zzso zzso can also act via a zzso zzso by altering the activities of other zzso factors zzso zzso zzso or zzso at their zzso sites on zzso We previously generated a zzso form of zzso zzso that does not bind to zzso and therefore lacks signaling via the classical zzso but retains signaling via the zzso zzso In the current study, we introduce this zzso zzso into zzso zzso breast zzso cells to identify zzso zzso genes that respond to zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen zzso or zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a role for zzso signaling in zzso action, zzso analyses identify 268 responsive zzso zzso zzso target zzso zzso elicits the largest number of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso Custom zzso containing identified zzso zzso responsive genes are used to compare gene expression in human breast tumor zzso zzso 34) and normal zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 9) zzso A subset of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in breast zzso In zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso target genes exhibit a range of zzso responses to zzso and identify targets of this zzso as potentially relevant to breast zzso The identification of zzso zzso target genes offers new insight into zzso zzso signaling and cross talk with pathways that mediate breast tumor response to zzso zzso
