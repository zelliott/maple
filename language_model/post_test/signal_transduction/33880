zzso zzso zzso is a hallmark clinical symptom of zzso At least two components of zzso have been zzso 1) baseline zzso which is persistent and presumably caused by airway zzso due to chronic zzso airway zzso and 2) acute and variable zzso which is associated with an episodic increase in airway inflammation due to environmental factors such as zzso zzso Despite intensive research, the mechanisms underlying acute and chronic zzso are poorly zzso zzso to the complex variety of interactive processes that may be involved, in zzso model systems and animal models are indispensable to the zzso of these mechanisms at the cellular and molecular zzso The present paper focuses on a number of zzso studies addressing the emerging central role of the airway smooth muscle cell, as a zzso cell involved in acute airway zzso as well as structural changes in the zzso in the zzso of airway zzso
