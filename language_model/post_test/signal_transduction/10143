zzso zzso zzso is a known negative regulator of collagen zzso expression by two different mechanisms, acting directly through binding to an zzso response element within the zzso promoter and/or by physically interacting with zzso thereby zzso the zzso effect of transforming growth zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso via the zzso signaling zzso is required and sufficient to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso By binding to a bona fide recognition site within the zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso transcription, which was zzso enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect was not only supplied by induced zzso expression but was zzso in the context of the zzso promoter, where zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso effect in a dominant zzso In conclusion, zzso is the main target of zzso signaling via zzso that exerts zzso action by both interference with zzso signaling and direct zzso of collagen zzso
