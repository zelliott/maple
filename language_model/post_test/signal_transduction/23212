We have previously demonstrated that zzso regulates cell cycle exit and differentiation in zzso zzso zzso Here we investigated its function in white matter zzso development and adult injury with a newly generated transgenic mouse zzso zzso in the zzso lineage under the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso promoted zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso cells from zzso day zzso 15, then zzso and zzso cells at zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso zzso lineage cells first decreased between zzso and zzso through zzso increase in zzso cell death, and thereafter significantly exceeded zzso levels from zzso when cell death had zzso zzso mice showed increased zzso protein levels and zzso cells in zzso indicating that zzso promotes the generation of zzso lineage cells through zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented cell loss after zzso zzso by increasing zzso and zzso cells in response to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso abolished the zzso increase in zzso cells, and protected zzso from zzso by preventing decreases in zzso and zzso expression that were observed in zzso zzso Our study thus reveals a zzso effect of zzso zzso on cell survival and zzso formation in the developing zzso and that its zzso of zzso survival in the adult zzso resistance to injury and zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso of this zzso factor might be a viable protective strategy to mitigate the consequences of zzso in the adult zzso
