The study of sex determination in model organisms has been especially fruitful in increasing our understanding of zzso biology, gene regulation and evolutionary zzso The free living zzso zzso zzso can develop as one of two zzso male or zzso zzso Here we discuss the progress toward a genetic and molecular understanding of that zzso Numerous genetic zzso have been identified that affect sexual fate, and zzso analysis of these genes has led to a model of a regulatory hierarchy with zzso negative zzso It is becoming evident that many of the genes have numerous levels of zzso We also discuss the apparent rapid rate of evolution that many of the sex determination proteins have zzso zzso sequences of zzso from closely related species are more divergent than zzso of proteins involved in other zzso zzso Rapid evolution of sex determination genes may be a common theme throughout the animal zzso
