Exposure of cultured rat zzso vascular smooth muscle zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso produced an increase in zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso activity that was zzso between 2 and 5 minutes but then declined to zzso values within 20 minutes of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells leads to an even more rapid zzso of zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso thus, it was zzso that the zzso component of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was almost completely abolished by zzso cells with 30 zzso zzso a zzso zzso II zzso Treatment of cells with zzso did not antagonize the ability of zzso to mobilize zzso zzso but prevented zzso zzso II and zzso zzso with almost identical zzso zzso with a role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso exhibited an attenuated zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso growth factor were not significantly affected by zzso whereas the response to zzso II and zzso were attenuated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso delta 2 zzso zzso II in zzso cells resulted in increased zzso activity, whereas zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso resulted in a diminution of this zzso These data suggest that regulation of cellular responses by zzso pathways in zzso cells may be zzso in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso
