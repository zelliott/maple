zzso zzso is a component of oxidized low density zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso can induce various protein zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in vascular zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso remains zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso and investigated the role of zzso protein zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso The presence of zzso was evaluated by zzso criteria, zzso zzso and zzso of DNA fragments showing the characteristic zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso as the proportion of zzso cells by flow zzso The zzso induced zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The use of specific zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso (a zzso zzso suggesting involvement of an important segment in the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells through a zzso zzso
