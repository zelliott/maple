zzso signaling is an zzso zzso zzso signaling system that controls the fate of cells during zzso In this review, we will zzso the literature that notch signaling during development controls zzso number and zzso and therefore could influence kidney disease zzso We will also review the evidence that zzso is zzso in zzso diabetic kidney disease where it promotes the development of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso and zzso Finally, we will review the evidence that blockade of zzso zzso signaling alters the natural history of diabetic zzso and thus could represent a novel therapeutic approach to the management of diabetic kidney zzso
