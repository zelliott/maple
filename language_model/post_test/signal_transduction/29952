zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso protein zzso To investigate whether the zzso region of the fourth zzso domain of this zzso which forms putative zzso 8, plays a role in zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso individually to zzso In zzso cells, these zzso were expressed at equivalent zzso but at lower zzso than zzso zzso substitution for zzso or zzso did not substantially affect the affinity for OT zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, vs zzso zzso for the wild zzso whereas substitution for zzso zzso or zzso reduced the affinity zzso When expressed at equal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso turnover as well as zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso exhibited an impaired ability to respond to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the putative zzso interface appeared to influence both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To explore this further, five multiple zzso substitution zzso were zzso zzso modification at zzso and zzso did not substantially affect the affinity for OT zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas any combination of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso receptors that lost zzso zzso zzso While zzso exhibited zzso zzso equivalent to that of zzso receptors with two or more changes in zzso zzso and zzso lost the ability to respond to OT in a zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the opposite zzso interface were also zzso to zzso None of these zzso affected zzso zzso only zzso had a somewhat weaker ability to activate zzso These data are consistent with the prediction that these zzso lie within an zzso zzso and emphasize the importance of this zzso zzso and particularly of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
