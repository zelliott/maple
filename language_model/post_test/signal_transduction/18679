zzso contain small zzso that are physically separate from those of zzso Their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of zzso zzso Although complete zzso zzso sequences have been reported for more than 600 animals, the zzso sampling is highly biased toward zzso and zzso leaving much of the diversity yet zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and zzso zzso both values that are typical of animal zzso zzso It contains the 37 genes that are almost universally found in animal zzso with 15 on one DNA strand and 22 on the zzso The arrangement of these genes can be derived from that of the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso by a switch in position of two large blocks of genes and zzso of four zzso zzso There is strong skew in the distribution of zzso between the two zzso and analysis of this yields insight into modes of zzso and zzso There is an unusual number of zzso regions and their function, if any, is not zzso however, several of these zzso abrupt shifts in zzso zzso and there are several identical sequence elements at these zzso suggesting that they may play roles in zzso and/or zzso One of the zzso regions contains multiple repeats of a zzso zzso Some of the zzso genes appear to overlap on the same zzso but this could be resolved if the zzso were zzso at the beginning of the downstream zzso followed by zzso of the product of the upstream gene to form a fully paired zzso 

zzso zzso zzso contains an expected gene content that has experienced few zzso since the evolutionary split between zzso and zzso It contains an unusual number of zzso regions, especially considering that these otherwise often are generated by the same processes that produce gene zzso The skew in zzso composition between the two strands is strong and associated with the direction of zzso in various parts of the zzso but a comparison with zzso zzso implies that zzso bias during replication also plays a zzso This appears to be yet another case where zzso of zzso zzso restores what would otherwise be an incomplete zzso
