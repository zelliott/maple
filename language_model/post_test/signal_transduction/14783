In the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso surface and a zzso tube grows through the zzso zzso of the zzso toward the zzso The zzso has two basic zzso to prevent unwanted zzso from gaining access to the zzso and to support the growth of desirable zzso zzso signaling allows these different types of zzso to be zzso zzso zzso systems, controlled by the S zzso are the zzso zzso signaling zzso Other zzso systems have been investigated at the molecular level, but the physiology of zzso tube rejection is best understood in the field zzso zzso zzso This species has a zzso zzso system: zzso is rejected when its S zzso is the same as either of the two S zzso expressed in the zzso zzso Recent advances reveal new ways that zzso controls zzso tube zzso A soluble zzso is zzso as part of the rapid zzso response, and, over the long term, zzso of the zzso zzso lead to programmed cell death in incompatible zzso zzso zzso incompatible zzso tube metabolism in this way may leave more resources available for supporting the growth of compatible zzso tubes, the complementary function of the zzso
