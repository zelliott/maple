The assembly of zzso into zzso is essential for the zzso of DNA and zzso of the DNA template to zzso and repress gene zzso The zzso assembly protein 1, zzso assembles zzso independent of DNA synthesis and was shown to enhance zzso gene zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso known to harbor characteristics of a zzso of nuclear hormone receptors such as of the vitamin D zzso zzso binds in zzso and in zzso to zzso and zzso its activity by enhancing zzso zzso assembly on zzso Furthermore, zzso reduces the accessibility of the zzso zzso and zzso for zzso assembly zzso This indicates that zzso sustains and reinforces the formation of zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso suggests that different regions of zzso are involved in enhancement of zzso zzso assembly and in zzso the accessibility of the zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we provide evidence that zzso is associated with zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso and interacts with the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggest that zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso promoter in zzso a zzso target zzso Based on these findings, we present here a novel zzso linking zzso function with zzso assembly zzso
