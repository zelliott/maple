zzso is a zzso inhibitor whose targets include zzso and zzso both of which function in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso but which also have distinct downstream zzso The relative effects of zzso on zzso and zzso signaling in tumor cells remain zzso zzso We have now examined the effects of zzso as well as of zzso or zzso depletion by zzso interference on cell growth and zzso signaling in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines with or without zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in cells with zzso zzso but not in those with zzso zzso Despite this difference, zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso arrest in both cell zzso zzso of zzso but not that of zzso inhibited zzso zzso as well as suppressed cell growth and induced zzso arrest in cells with zzso zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso arrest, without affecting zzso zzso in cells with zzso zzso depletion of zzso did not induce zzso arrest in these zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling and zzso signaling play the dominant roles in regulation of cell growth in zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso arrest induced by either zzso depletion or zzso in cells with zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso Our results thus suggest that zzso zzso zzso cell growth by targeting zzso in cells with zzso zzso and zzso in those with zzso zzso
