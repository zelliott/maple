Recent studies have shown that, like zzso hormone zzso growth hormone zzso plays a critical role in development of the zzso However, it is still unclear whether the functions of the two hormones are locally orchestrated in the brain or whether zzso has a zzso effect on zzso in the central nervous system as it does in the zzso To address this question, the present study investigated the changes in local expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the activity of zzso signaling molecules in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso As demonstrated by zzso zzso and the zzso test, zzso rats had decreased zzso and weaker zzso zzso in the stratum zzso in the zzso and a reduced acquisition of safe place recognition zzso zzso of zzso and Western zzso revealed a substantially decreased zzso expression of zzso and zzso accompanied by a corresponding decrease in zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These changes were, at least in part, corrected by systemic supplement of zzso The findings provide the first direct evidence suggesting that the functional zzso and zzso regulation of zzso in the zzso is orchestrated by zzso
