We recently generated an zzso cell line called zzso that responds to zzso zzso treatment by undergoing cell growth arrest in association with zzso reorganization and induction of zzso cell zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso cells using zzso levels of zzso The arrested cells increase in cell size and contain a dramatic zzso of zzso zzso 5, and zzso A zzso zzso zzso changes were also apparent from time zzso video zzso that showed that zzso treatment resulted in the rapid appearance of zzso membrane zzso zzso profiling analysis using zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso zzso leads to the coordinate expression of numerous cell signaling genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso has been shown to have a role in tumor suppression and zzso differentiation in other cell types, we investigated zzso signaling functions in the zzso steroid zzso We found that steroid induction of zzso was zzso and that newly zzso zzso protein was zzso modified and localized to zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with a zzso zzso inhibitor reduced zzso growth arrest, suggesting that zzso zzso might function to inhibit zzso cell zzso This was directly shown by zzso zzso cells with zzso coding sequences containing zzso or dominant negative zzso
