zzso zzso zzso likely play a critical role in the signaling events that zzso synaptic plasticity and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade is suited well for such a role because its targets include regulators of gene zzso Here we report that the zzso cascade is recruited during long-term depression zzso of synaptic strength in area zzso of the adult zzso in zzso and selectively impacts on zzso of the nuclear zzso factor zzso Using a combination of in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found the zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso zzso activity are increased zzso albeit zzso after the induction of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso input to area zzso zzso cells in the zzso of zzso adult zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation fails to produce lasting zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which suggests that zzso zzso is necessary for the persistence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso results in increased zzso of zzso but not of the zzso factor zzso response zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso cascade zzso signals from the zzso to the nucleus during zzso in zzso area zzso in zzso as it does during long-term zzso in area zzso but that the pattern of zzso of the zzso cascade to zzso regulators differs between the two forms of synaptic zzso
