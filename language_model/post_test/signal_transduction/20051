A zzso zzso of zzso termed zzso has been associated with the zzso zzso in the zzso gene and linked with many human zzso However, the zzso properties and functionality of zzso remain zzso Here, using multidisciplinary approaches including zzso analysis and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso we showed that unlike zzso zzso failed to form complexes with either zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, using a zzso zzso deficient in zzso modification to purify zzso from zzso cells without the use of detergents, we further showed that the failure of zzso to form zzso with zzso was not due to the instability of the zzso in detergents, but rather, reflected the intrinsic properties of zzso Additional studies indicated that zzso is zzso and unable to zzso properly to the plasma membrane and to activate diverse zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso Thus, these data suggest that the pathological effects of zzso zzso zzso may result from the zzso of zzso zzso However, we found that the zzso zzso zzso signals primarily through zzso and zzso but not zzso to regulate zzso of several human zzso cell lines, indicating the effects of zzso zzso zzso are likely to be tissue and/or stimuli specific and its association with various disorders in different zzso should be interpreted with great zzso
