zzso zzso zzso formation is a critical factor in processes involving zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism by which zzso oxygen species zzso induce vascular damage are insufficiently zzso Specifically, zzso of zzso C gamma zzso is a probable candidate zzso involved in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso by zzso 

The zzso of human zzso zzso was measured as zzso free calcium zzso shape change and protein zzso focusing on the role of zzso zzso zzso 

The exposure of zzso to zzso zzso caused a rapid increase in zzso free calcium concentration zzso and induced a significant zzso shape zzso Both effects were dependent on a zzso zzso zzso as determined by the blockade of short-term treatment of zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Giving further support to the putative role of zzso C zzso zzso the zzso and zzso shape change response were equally inhibited by the specific zzso blocker, zzso zzso In addition, zzso had a protective effect against the deleterious action (24 zzso of zzso on zzso zzso As a further clarification of the specific zzso involved, the exposure to zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso and zzso similar to that of zzso zzso 

The present study reveals that zzso activates zzso on zzso through zzso zzso and that this zzso has a major role in rapid zzso zzso zzso actions and damage by zzso in this type of zzso These findings have direct implications for understanding the mechanisms of the vascular actions of zzso and may help to design zzso protective zzso
