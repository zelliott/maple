While the slow delayed zzso zzso current zzso is known to be enhanced by the stimulation of zzso in several zzso species, zzso regulation of the rapid delayed zzso zzso current zzso is zzso 

In the present study, therefore, the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the protein zzso A zzso zzso on zzso and zzso was studied in canine zzso zzso using the whole cell patch clamp zzso 

I zzso was significantly increased (by zzso following zzso with zzso zzso or zzso application of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso had no effect on baseline zzso The stimulating effect of zzso on zzso was completely inhibited by selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso In comparison, zzso was increased zzso by the zzso of zzso (by zzso or zzso and strongly reduced by the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso enhancement of zzso was decreased by zzso and completely inhibited by zzso 

The results indicate that the stimulation of zzso increases zzso similar to zzso via the zzso of zzso in canine zzso zzso
