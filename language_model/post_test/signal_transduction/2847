In this study we investigated the protein zzso C zzso expressed by human zzso cells harvested from a giant cell tumor of bone zzso zzso and by freshly isolated rat zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso are expressed by zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed by both zzso and zzso zzso cells, as well as by rat zzso Similar to authentic zzso zzso cells responded to an increase of zzso zzso concentration zzso with a zzso zzso of the zzso free zzso concentration zzso An increase of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the particulate zzso suggesting the involvement of this zzso in the signal zzso mechanism prompted by stimulation of the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso was not altered by exposure to elevated zzso whereas zzso underwent zzso zzso disappearing from the zzso fraction and increasing in the zzso The effects of zzso on zzso cell functions were investigated by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso of zzso by zzso failed to affect zzso onto the zzso but zzso the zzso zzso zzso The latter effect was specific, since it was reversed by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
