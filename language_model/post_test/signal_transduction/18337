The zzso of the binding of zzso to zzso factor zzso zzso normally quite low at approximately zzso zzso zzso was found to increase to a maximum of 1 zzso in the presence of zzso The mechanism of this action was found to result from the ability of these zzso to increase the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The existence of a zzso of zzso with low affinity zzso zzso for zzso is zzso The actions of zzso to increase the equilibrium binding of zzso is interpreted as evidence that these same zzso interact with and zzso the affinity of the inactive zzso for zzso A new model for these interactions among zzso zzso and zzso is proposed, and a preliminary test in cells is supportive of these observations with relevance to signaling in zzso
