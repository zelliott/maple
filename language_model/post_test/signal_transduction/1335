Previous studies have shown that the synthesis and stability of milk protein zzso are regulated by zzso zzso We demonstrate here in cultured mouse zzso zzso cells zzso 9) that insulin plus zzso also zzso increases the rate of milk protein zzso zzso zzso alone stimulates synthesis of both milk and zzso zzso whereas zzso alone has no effect, but insulin plus zzso selectively stimulate synthesis of milk proteins more than insulin zzso The increase in zzso zzso translation is also reflected in a shift to larger zzso indicating an effect on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso and zzso pathways block zzso total protein and zzso synthesis but not the synergistic zzso zzso zzso zzso synergistic stimulation of protein synthesis without affecting zzso zzso The zzso tract of zzso zzso progressively increases from approximately 20 to about 200 A zzso over 30 zzso of treatment with insulin plus zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso element is sufficient for the zzso enhancement and zzso zzso based on transient zzso of cells with a reporter zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso element binding protein zzso with no increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso
