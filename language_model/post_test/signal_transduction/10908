zzso production has been associated with zzso zzso into the joint during zzso arthritis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of this zzso have been shown to zzso their zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso mechanisms underlying this cellular regulation in the zzso zzso cell line zzso We report that zzso zzso rapidly and zzso increase zzso levels of various zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of second zzso zzso revealed that zzso exposure to zzso zzso led to zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso as well as to zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Of interest, specific zzso of the zzso zzso drastically reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso production and zzso of nuclear zzso Similarly, selective zzso of zzso suppressed zzso DNA binding activity and the induction of all zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso signals seem to be required for zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent zzso expression of the various zzso zzso In addition, zzso and stability zzso performed in presence of zzso D showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted solely from zzso control, whereas that of zzso zzso and zzso was due to both gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, the results of this study help to define the molecular events that govern zzso zzso regulation in response to zzso zzso which is of paramount importance to better understand, and eventually to zzso the inflammatory response during acute zzso
