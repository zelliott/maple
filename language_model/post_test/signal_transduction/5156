zzso products of the fungus zzso offer valuable therapeutic benefits and have been used extensively for centuries in zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso inflammation in the human zzso zzso cell zzso We found that 1, 5, and 25 zzso of zzso significantly attenuated several zzso zzso including zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression as well as zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation caused by zzso zzso Further, 5 and 25 zzso of zzso significantly reduced the generation of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso at both the protein and zzso zzso zzso (5 and 25 zzso decreased zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not that of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso to show that zzso inhibit zzso zzso through increased expression of zzso Thus, the zzso from zzso zzso may serve as a dietary source of zzso zzso
