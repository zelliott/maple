zzso necrosis zzso is known to zzso the expression of surface zzso molecules on zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this investigation was to study possible zzso signaling pathways responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso on normal human zzso induced by zzso We report that treatment with zzso (10 zzso for 30 zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso and zzso surface expression zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso with 15 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with either 15 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso or 5 zzso GO zzso a protein zzso C zzso had no significant zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso specifically through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and not through the zzso zzso zzso or protein zzso C zzso
