zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso cell polarity zzso zzso but not zzso gene expression was induced in zzso zzso cells during zzso process formation induced by zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso cells induced striking zzso process formation in the absence of zzso Since zzso binds to zzso zzso to induce its degradation in zzso we examined the participation of zzso protein in the zzso process formation of zzso zzso Upon induction of the zzso process formation, the amount of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso could associate with zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in the reduction of zzso protein in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso cells prevented the zzso process formation induced by zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso promote zzso process formation of zzso cells via the zzso dependent zzso
