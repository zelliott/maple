Bone mass zzso is a major zzso of skeletal mass, governed by bone zzso which consists of bone zzso by zzso and bone formation by zzso Bone mass zzso is inhibited by sympathetic signaling centrally regulated through zzso of receptors for zzso zzso and zzso However, skeletal activity of the zzso nervous system zzso has not been reported at the bone zzso Here we report skeletal zzso fibers for the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso into the zzso zzso zzso is identifiable in the zzso zzso cell column and central zzso nucleus, demonstrating zzso zzso zzso originating in the spinal zzso The zzso neurotransmitter zzso targets zzso zzso but not zzso receptors in bone cells, affecting mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and restrain bone zzso Mice deficient of the zzso zzso have increased bone zzso and low bone zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling in the central nervous system by zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to very low skeletal zzso expression and zzso zzso These mice also exhibit increased bone zzso and low bone zzso In zzso but not in zzso mice, the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso increases zzso levels and bone mass apparently by zzso bone zzso Taken together, these results identify a previously unexplored key central zzso axis that zzso the skeletal sympathetic tone, thus zzso favoring bone mass zzso
