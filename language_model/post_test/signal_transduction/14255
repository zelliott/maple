We have zzso zzso zzso binding site with zzso zzso or zzso complexes, using metal zzso as a probe to examine the pathways of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso We have used transient zzso zzso zzso intrinsic fluorescence, zzso of zzso labeled zzso combined with the steady state zzso zzso activity zzso of previously characterized zzso zzso construct zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not depend on metal zzso regardless of the zzso zzso of zzso binding and zzso The rate limiting step of zzso zzso depends on the metal zzso The rate of the recovery stroke and the reverse recovery stroke is directly zzso to the zzso radius of the zzso The rate of zzso release from zzso and zzso and zzso binding to zzso depends on the zzso coordination zzso
