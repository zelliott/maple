zzso of zzso depends on the availability of zzso a signaling zzso that is tightly and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by converting it to zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity and that zzso activity is required for this zzso We also show that zzso directly interacts with zzso in a signaling complex and that the binding site in zzso is located within the zzso zzso Because zzso can zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motif of zzso we tested whether this modification could affect their zzso zzso of this motif significantly attenuated zzso of zzso and zzso and abolished their zzso in cells, indicating that it zzso regulates zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that was unable to bind zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso activity by attenuating local zzso of signaling zzso This regulation is impaired by zzso zzso zzso
