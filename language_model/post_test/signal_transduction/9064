Response gene to complement 32 zzso is activated by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in smooth muscle cell zzso differentiation from neural crest zzso zzso The molecular mechanism governing zzso zzso of zzso however, remains to be zzso The present studies indicate that zzso regulates zzso gene zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso binding element zzso located in the region from zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso binding site is adjacent to the zzso zzso at either zzso or zzso site significantly inhibited zzso promoter zzso zzso at both sites completely abolished zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter, as revealed by gel shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso activated zzso zzso zzso appeared to enhance zzso zzso In agreement with their function, zzso but not zzso physically zzso with zzso In zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, zzso of zzso by short hairpin zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso marker zzso The zzso of zzso zzso however, was rescued by zzso introduced zzso These results demonstrate that zzso regulation of zzso zzso is essential for zzso differentiation from neural crest zzso
