Whether host DNA receptors have any capacity to distinguish self from zzso at the molecular level is an outstanding question in the innate immunity of zzso Here, by using quantitative zzso and electron zzso we show that zzso assembling into filaments on zzso may serve as an integral mechanism by which human zzso zzso zzso engages foreign zzso zzso is essential for defense against a number of different zzso and its zzso activity is also implicated in several zzso disorders, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso in a zzso manner and clusters into distinct protein filaments even in the presence of excess zzso zzso the assembled zzso zzso are clearly different from the conventional zzso entities resembling beads on a zzso The isolated zzso zzso of zzso engage zzso without forming filaments and with weak zzso and it is the zzso zzso domain of zzso that drives the cooperative filament zzso The surface zzso on the zzso domain that mediate the cooperative DNA binding are zzso suggesting that related receptors use a common zzso These results suggest that zzso clusters into signaling zzso in a zzso manner and that it is capable of using the size of naked zzso as a molecular ruler to distinguish self from zzso
