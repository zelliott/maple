zzso zzso C zzso is involved in several cell events including zzso survival and zzso The aim of this work was to investigate the role of zzso zzso on retinal cells zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a tumor promoter zzso zzso is able to decrease retinal cells zzso This effect was zzso by zzso receptors and dependent on zzso zzso increase, zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The effect of zzso was not via zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and brain derived zzso factor were both able to decrease retinal cells proliferation to the same level as zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso leads to a decrease in retinal cells proliferation through the release of zzso and brain derived zzso factor in the culture, and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
