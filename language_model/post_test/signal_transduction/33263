The effects of free zzso generated by zzso of a zzso salt solution, on various zzso responses to drugs in isolated rat left zzso were zzso Evidence for the generation of zzso zzso was obtained from an appropriate zzso zzso The amount of free zzso produced by zzso of the medium proved zzso Exposure of isolated rat left zzso to the medium which had been subjected to zzso caused a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso stress, as a result of the zzso of the zzso caused altered zzso responses to extra cellular zzso zzso control group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group), sodium withdrawal zzso in zzso force control group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lowering of stimulation zzso The response to zzso was diminished in zzso subjected to zzso stress and led to a rightward shift of the concentration response zzso zzso control group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso responses to zzso zzso control group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso force caused by 1 zzso zzso M zzso in control group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved blunted as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity revealed that free zzso attenuated the zzso (by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for control and zzso group zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso a well known zzso radical scavenger, was able to abolish the free zzso decrease in the response to zzso Surprisingly, addition of zzso zzso to zzso subjected to zzso free zzso led to a rapid decrease in zzso zzso zzso was unable to counteract the negative zzso effect of zzso in zzso subjected to zzso zzso This negative zzso response to zzso zzso in zzso subjected to zzso medium is unlikely to be the direct result of zzso C or protein zzso C zzso zzso II (which stimulates zzso as well) did not reduce zzso force and zzso (a zzso zzso was unable to counteract the negative zzso effect of the zzso zzso In addition, the negative zzso effect of zzso proved insensitive to zzso M zzso and zzso M zzso which indicates an zzso independent zzso From this study we conclude that free zzso alter responses to various zzso zzso These zzso may be the result of injured zzso zzso zzso molecules and molecules involved in signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso after zzso stress leads to a zzso zzso and zzso independent decrease in zzso zzso
