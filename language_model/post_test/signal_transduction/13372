The proper formation of zzso zzso requires ongoing synaptic activity that is translated into complex structural changes to produce functional zzso One mechanism by which activity could be converted into these structural changes is through the regulated expression of specific synaptic regulatory zzso Here we demonstrate that blocking synaptic activity with zzso reduces synaptic zzso expression in a zzso manner yet has little effect on synaptic zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes are associated with a fourfold increase in number and a twofold reduction in average size of synaptic zzso zzso clusters that appears to be caused by excessive zzso zzso with the formation of new, smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade also leads to zzso reductions in zzso zzso factor and zzso 3 expression in muscle without appreciably changing the expression of these same factors in spinal zzso Adding back these or other zzso factors restores synaptic zzso expression and maintains normal end plate band architecture in the presence of activity zzso The expression of zzso protein at zzso is independent of spinal zzso and muscle zzso zzso levels, suggesting that zzso zzso at zzso is independent of zzso These findings suggest a local, positive feedback loop between synaptic regulatory factors that translates activity into structural changes at zzso zzso
