zzso zzso molecules that convey the signal from the activated insulin zzso to the actual process of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are poorly zzso Various studies have suggested a requirement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso regulates the zzso status of the small zzso protein zzso which, in turn, is able to activate another zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known to regulate the structure of the zzso and zzso zzso We have examined whether zzso and zzso transfer the signals generated by zzso towards zzso zzso zzso For that purpose, we expressed in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso gene zzso The expression levels of the zzso protein were monitored by Western zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by expression of zzso was zzso from the observed loss of zzso acid release in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport were not affected by expression of the zzso zzso A possible contribution of zzso to stimulation of zzso zzso was examined by zzso of zzso with zzso acid zzso We observed a profound effect of zzso on the structure of the zzso and on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso respond to zzso and that zzso was activated by zzso However, no effect was detected on the zzso or on the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso are unlikely to be involved in zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible contribution of other zzso zzso downstream of zzso to this zzso
