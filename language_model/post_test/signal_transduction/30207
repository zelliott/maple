zzso zzso a putative zzso finger zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates synaptic growth at the zzso junction zzso in zzso zzso zzso have dramatically larger synaptic size and increased numbers of synaptic zzso Here we show that zzso binds to the zzso protein Medea zzso zzso is part of a zzso bone zzso protein zzso signaling cascade consisting of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to the zzso zzso factor zzso When compared to zzso zzso of zzso signaling components have smaller zzso size, reduced neurotransmitter release, and zzso synaptic zzso zzso signaling zzso suppress the excessive synaptic growth in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which in zzso does not cause additional growth, in zzso zzso does lead to further synaptic zzso These results reveal a balance between positive zzso signaling and negative regulation by zzso governing the growth of zzso zzso
