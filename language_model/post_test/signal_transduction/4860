Many zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso a phenomenon called zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain zzso In the present study we investigate the molecular basis of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth factor type I zzso in primary zzso We take a chemical biology approach by developing an zzso probe targeting the zzso zzso This probe enables us first to lock the zzso zzso in an inactive state and then activate it with a positive zzso zzso thereby permitting monitoring of the dynamic of the protein complex associated with zzso zzso We find that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a dynamic assembly and zzso of a protein complex, including both receptors and their downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso plays a key role in zzso this dynamic zzso zzso this dynamic of the zzso zzso complex is critical for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present study has identified an important mechanism underlying zzso zzso of zzso which was enabled by a new chemical biology tool generally zzso for zzso zzso zzso
