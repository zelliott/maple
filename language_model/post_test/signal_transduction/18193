In this study, we have investigated the expression of zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso Each product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso amplified by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction were detected as a single band in human zzso cells, surface zzso cells zzso and the zzso cancer cell lines zzso 3 and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso peptides based on 13 zzso zzso zzso cultured human zzso cells were used as a positive zzso Using zzso zzso zzso one major band corresponding to approximately 80 zzso and one minor band corresponding to 105 zzso were observed in the zzso One single band at approximately 60 zzso was detected in zzso 3 and a 50 zzso band was detected with zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso cell, zzso and zzso zzso Although no zzso change was induced in zzso 4 zzso in zzso 3, zzso 2 zzso levels were increased during 48 h treatment with zzso A zzso zzso zzso These data provide a better understanding as the first step in the mechanism of action of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
