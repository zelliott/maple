Many zzso processes rely on cortical zzso zzso however, the mechanisms of its fine control at the cell zzso are still largely zzso Our analyses demonstrate that the zzso and zzso protein zzso is crucial for zzso bristle development in zzso zzso Combined zzso cell biological and zzso analyses reveal that zzso triggers cortical zzso zzso nucleation by complex formation with zzso in bristle zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso was highlighted by zzso zzso zzso Such zzso experiments led to a severe zzso zzso which was zzso correlated with bristle zzso This zzso was dependent on zzso but not on zzso and required the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso knockout of zzso led to defects in both zzso and zzso bristle zzso zzso zzso and zzso flies displayed similar bristle zzso zzso of flies deficient for zzso zzso and zzso functions had zzso whereas those of zzso zzso flies did zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all led to distorted zzso with an excessive number of zzso Interestingly, despite the physical association of zzso with zzso and its ability to use the zzso complex zzso as an zzso zzso knockout did not affect zzso zzso This is in contrast to classical zzso complex zzso such as zzso or zzso Our work reveals that zzso is an important, zzso factor controlling cortical zzso zzso nucleation and zzso a novel layer of complexity in the scrupulous control of cortical zzso nucleation during sensory organ zzso
