zzso zzso zzso can be divided into three distinct classes zzso II, and zzso on the basis of their domain structures and the zzso signals that they zzso zzso have been assigned to the class I and class III zzso but have not been established for the class II zzso We have obtained the first evidence for a biological function for a class II zzso by expressing this zzso during zzso zzso development and by using deficiencies that remove the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inactive zzso zzso have opposite effects on the number of sensory zzso and on wing zzso zzso induced by modified zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso may act zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and downstream of, or parallel to, the zzso zzso A class II zzso motif in zzso can bind the zzso zzso protein in zzso primarily via the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso may thus be important for the zzso of zzso allowing it to modify signaling pathways downstream of cell surface zzso The zzso obtained are markedly distinct from those generated by expression of the zzso class I zzso which affects growth but not pattern zzso
