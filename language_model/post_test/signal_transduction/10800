To explore the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso gene zzso in alleviating injury of zzso treated with burn serum and zzso burn serum was collected from zzso rats inflicted with zzso zzso burn of the total body surface zzso The zzso of zzso zzso rats were cultured and then treated with burn serum and zzso (a gas mixture containing zzso zzso The constructed zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso was adopted to examine zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso were observed under an zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso T and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with Western zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso group changed zzso but the change was not so obvious in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso increased significantly in the zzso group as compared with the zzso zzso In the zzso group, numbers of zzso zzso were significantly higher than in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly expressed in the zzso group, and they reached a maximum at the 24th hour after zzso were treated with burn serum and zzso In the zzso group, however, expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso injury to zzso treated with burn serum and zzso probably through low expression of zzso and zzso
