The zzso transcript is zzso in colon zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso 

zzso profiling was performed on zzso colon zzso zzso profiling data were compared with transcript zzso zzso assessed zzso protein expression in zzso stage zzso zzso zzso years zzso The effects of stable zzso zzso in zzso cells (three different zzso were studied using zzso zzso proliferation and protein zzso 

The zzso transcript was strongly zzso in zzso of zzso Absent expression in normal zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso Nuclear and zzso zzso protein expression was identified in colon zzso and other types of zzso A zzso of patients with zzso strongly expressing zzso in the nucleus showed a better outcome with regard to recurrence as lung or liver zzso The zzso zzso affected the cell cycle and the zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression supported these zzso zzso zzso genes zzso expressed upon zzso zzso correlated with the zzso expression profile in clinical zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso the effects of the zzso zzso and it may thus be regarded as a regulatory part of this zzso
