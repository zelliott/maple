zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we have found that zzso acutely (1 zzso increased the zzso zzso rate zzso in zzso cells approximately zzso above zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso can be increased further by zzso hormone zzso indicating that the zzso pathways for these two zzso are not zzso In studies on the mechanism of zzso zzso we found that maximum stimulation of the zzso zzso by treatment with zzso or the zzso zzso with zzso did not inhibit the zzso response to zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso C and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on the zzso response to zzso Furthermore, zzso induced little or no change in zzso zzso zzso while zzso induced a large increase in zzso However, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely blocked zzso zzso suggesting involvement of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso causes an increase in zzso in zzso rat zzso cells, which is not dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but does require zzso zzso zzso
