Among zzso families, zzso and zzso share zzso acid sequence similarity and bind to zzso type zzso zzso signaling is implicated in the zzso of various zzso diseases, but its role in the regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso expression and its contribution to the zzso of systemic sclerosis zzso both remain to be zzso This study revealed that zzso expression was significantly increased in the involved skin and zzso of zzso patients, whereas the zzso levels did not zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso type A in zzso zzso significantly decreased in comparison with that in normal zzso due to the intrinsic zzso zzso in these cell zzso Moreover, zzso not zzso reduced the protein expression of zzso collagen and zzso tissue growth zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso increased due to zzso and zzso the zzso collagen zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso not zzso has an zzso effect via the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso tissue growth factor and zzso zzso zzso signaling is suppressed due to the zzso of the zzso by the intrinsic zzso of zzso in zzso zzso which may amplify the increased collagen zzso and zzso characteristic of zzso Increased zzso levels in the zzso and involved skin of zzso may be due to negative zzso zzso the novel regulatory mechanisms of zzso by the zzso network consisting of zzso and zzso may lead to a new therapeutic approach for this zzso
