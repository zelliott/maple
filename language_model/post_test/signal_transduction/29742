Although zzso mice share the same genetic zzso and lack zzso expression as in zzso muscular zzso zzso their limb muscles have a high zzso capacity that ensures a more benign zzso and essentially normal zzso The cellular pathways responsible for this enhanced zzso capacity are zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso signal zzso zzso is essential for the successful zzso following severe zzso observed in the limb muscles of young zzso mice zzso weeks old) and that zzso of this zzso using zzso A zzso would exacerbate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were treated with zzso for 16 zzso zzso administration severely disrupted muscle zzso in zzso mice, but had minimal effect in zzso zzso Muscles from zzso zzso mice had fewer centrally zzso fibers and extensive zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso than muscles from zzso zzso The deleterious effects of zzso on muscle zzso were accompanied by a zzso decrease in zzso force producing zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that the zzso signal zzso zzso is a significant zzso of successful skeletal muscle zzso in young zzso zzso zzso this zzso may have clinical significance for zzso
