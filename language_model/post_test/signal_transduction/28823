zzso zzso can interact with each other by zzso or zzso trans zzso interactions across zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso This interaction can also provide an zzso signal which is transmitted to the zzso side, thus forming a zzso between two zzso The two major zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso form, zzso zzso zzso are an example of a pair of zzso which can participate in these trans zzso interactions and trigger zzso zzso These zzso could interact across zzso zzso zzso at high cell density or when a zzso process of a cell contacts itself as it wraps around the zzso zzso and zzso also face each other in the zzso zzso surfaces of the multilayered zzso zzso Communication between the zzso sheath and the zzso regulates both zzso and zzso function and is necessary to prevent zzso Participation of transient zzso and zzso interactions in zzso between the zzso zzso surfaces of mature zzso might allow transmission of signals throughout the zzso sheath and thus facilitate zzso zzso
