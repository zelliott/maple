zzso zzso zzso is considered a powerful tool to identify cancer genes in mice, but its significance for human cancer has remained zzso Moreover, it has recently been debated whether common virus zzso are always a hallmark of tumor cells and contribute to the zzso zzso Acute zzso leukemia zzso is a zzso disease with a variable response to zzso zzso zzso defects and acquired zzso in regulatory genes are associated with zzso zzso and zzso Recently, gene expression profiling zzso has been applied to further risk zzso zzso Here, we show that mouse leukemia genes identified by zzso zzso zzso are more frequently zzso expressed in distinct zzso of adult and pediatric zzso than randomly selected genes or genes located more zzso from a virus integration zzso The candidate zzso showing zzso expression in primary zzso could be placed in regulatory networks mainly involved in signal zzso and zzso zzso Our data support the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in mice for human disease and indicate that combining these zzso screens for potential zzso with zzso in human zzso may help to identify critical disease genes and novel zzso networks in zzso
