The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso or zzso is essential for proliferation of B lineage acute zzso leukemia zzso cells in their zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso that stimulate zzso cells, but its interaction with zzso affecting zzso cells has not been zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso to regulate ALL zzso 

The survival of ALL cells in zzso cultures, with or without zzso support and zzso was assessed by flow zzso and proliferation by zzso zzso Signaling mechanisms were assessed by western zzso of zzso forms of signaling molecules and by the use of specific zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso had only marginal effects on ALL cell survival under zzso zzso However, these molecules individually induced significant zzso responses in zzso cultures of 11 cases of zzso The combination of zzso with zzso or zzso produced a variety of responses, with clear synergistic or additive interactions observed in four zzso zzso proliferation in response to zzso plus zzso was associated with enhanced zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and was partially inhibited by zzso of cells with zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso implicating these pathways in the proliferation in response to zzso plus zzso 

These findings indicate a complex interaction between signaling from the zzso zzso on ALL cells with those initiated by the zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may facilitate ALL proliferation by enhancing zzso pathways in responsive zzso
