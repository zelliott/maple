This study was done to investigate the effects of acute intermittent zzso zzso on zzso factors associated with energy balance and body weight, and on zzso zzso zzso Adult male zzso rats were exposed to either zzso zzso or zzso control zzso Food zzso locomotion and body weights were examined after zzso Additionally, plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso insulin and blood zzso were measured following exposure to zzso Furthermore, zzso tissue was removed and analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso nucleus zzso was assessed for zzso in protein signaling associated with zzso zzso reduced body weight, food intake and active cycle locomotion without altering zzso tissue zzso zzso protein content was reduced while zzso content was elevated in zzso tissue after zzso Plasma concentration of zzso was significantly increased while zzso decreased after zzso No changes were found in plasma zzso insulin and blood zzso In zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression were zzso In addition, zzso zzso were activated as determined by immediate early gene zzso zzso Finally, zzso and its zzso were reduced in response to zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso significant zzso to body energy balance through changes in the zzso of zzso which exert effects on zzso pathways within the zzso
