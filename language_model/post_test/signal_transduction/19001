zzso mechanisms in the zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in depressed patients and zzso by zzso It is, however, unknown whether zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso We subjected zzso mice zzso to zzso tests zzso zzso forced zzso tail suspension, zzso zzso We also investigated zzso in the zzso of stressed zzso zzso zzso mice showed reduced despair in the forced swim, and tail suspension test, and enhanced hedonic zzso Moreover, zzso mice exhibited resistance to zzso This resistance may be caused by the lack of zzso because stress increased zzso expression in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is a component in molecular mechanisms in the zzso of zzso zzso mice represent tools to study zzso signaling pathways in the zzso of depression in zzso Moreover, these mice may support the screening of compounds for depression by altering zzso zzso
