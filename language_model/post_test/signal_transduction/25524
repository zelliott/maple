We use the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso wing disc as a model to address the fundamental question of how a zzso of a growth factor can produce uniform zzso We first show that proper expression and zzso zzso of components in the Fat zzso pathway, which have been argued to depend on zzso activity differences, are not zzso on the zzso zzso We next analyzed cell proliferation in discs with zzso high zzso or zzso low Fat signaling activity and found that these pathways regulate growth zzso complementary zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth in the zzso primarily in the lateral regions, Fat zzso growth mostly in the zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that the activities of both signaling pathways are regulated in a parallel rather than sequential manner and that uniform proliferation is achieved by their complementary action on zzso
