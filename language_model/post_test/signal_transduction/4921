Maintaining sufficient levels of zzso activity is a prerequisite for proper regulation of blood zzso zzso and beta cell zzso Mice that are zzso for zzso display impaired zzso tolerance and lack the ability to increase beta cell mass in response to decreased insulin zzso Several studies have shown that zzso modifications are regulating zzso activity through zzso zzso and binding to zzso zzso the signaling cues zzso on zzso and modulating its activity is therefore an attractive approach in diabetes zzso We employed a novel technique called zzso zzso zzso to characterize the zzso profile of zzso Following zzso focusing in zzso this technology relies on a pan specific zzso for detection and it therefore allows the relative abundance of differently charged protein species to be examined zzso In all zzso cells tested we find that the zzso protein separates into four distinct zzso whereas zzso protein from bacteria only produces one zzso Of the four zzso in zzso cells we correlate one of them to a zzso Using zzso scanning and mass zzso we map this zzso to zzso 61 in both zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A single zzso is also present in cultured zzso but it remains unaffected by changes in zzso zzso It is present during zzso but is not required for zzso zzso
