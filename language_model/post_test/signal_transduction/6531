Members of zzso zzso are found to play important roles in many cellular zzso such as zzso zzso development, zzso and zzso In zzso there are seven zzso that function through combinations of three type I receptors and two type II zzso These signals can be roughly grouped into two major zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso which signal primarily through thick veins zzso and zzso zzso Few downstream targets are known for either pathway, especially targets expressed in the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso both affect the growth of zzso but have varying effects on zzso We have identified targets for the zzso and zzso pathways by employing zzso techniques using activated forms of the receptors expressed in the zzso In these experiments, we compare the similarities of target genes of these two pathways in the zzso About 500 of 13,500 examined genes changed expression at zzso confidence level zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso zzso fold by both the zzso and zzso zzso These regulated genes cluster into various functional groups such as zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso regulators, and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso of several of these genes show abnormal growth regulation, suggesting these genes may execute the growth properties of zzso 

Our zzso zzso analysis has revealed common targets for the zzso and zzso pathways and provided new insights into downstream zzso of two distinct zzso like zzso Many of these genes are novel and several genes are implicated in growth zzso Among the genes regulated by both pathways is zzso which further connects zzso with zzso zzso
