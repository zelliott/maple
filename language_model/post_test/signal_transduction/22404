The zzso are a family of proteins known to bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we provide data showing that zzso binds a zzso zzso protein on zzso zzso embryonic zzso cells expressing the large zzso of zzso virus 40) and zzso cells, a binding that is nearly completely blocked by treatment of these cell lines with zzso or zzso or by addition of the heavily zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso on these cells is essential for zzso binding of zzso zzso did not affect zzso binding to zzso receptors expressed on zzso zzso cells, indicating further that zzso binds an alternative zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are important for zzso binding of zzso and also for zzso binding to zzso These zzso zzso when introduced in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that zzso binding to cells zzso cellular zzso and influences cell zzso and cell zzso In conclusion, our data provide evidence for an unknown zzso zzso zzso involved in cellular zzso
