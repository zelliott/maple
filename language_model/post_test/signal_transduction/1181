In brain zzso cerebrovascular interactions regulate both, vascular functions, such as blood vessel branching and zzso cell zzso as well as zzso functions, such as local synaptic activity and adult zzso In brain pathology, including stroke, zzso encephalitis, zzso zzso multiple zzso bacterial meningitis, and zzso zzso of the zzso allows the entry of blood proteins into the brain with subsequent zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is not produced by cells of the nervous system, but accumulates only after disease associated with zzso zzso This review presents evidence from human disease and animal models that highlight the role of zzso in nervous system zzso Our review presents novel experimental data that extend the role of zzso from that of a zzso protein in cerebrovascular zzso to a component of the zzso zzso zzso that regulates inflammatory and zzso cellular responses in neurodegenerative zzso
