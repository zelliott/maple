The zzso family of zzso growth factors controls a number of central cellular processes such as zzso differentiation and zzso All the zzso proteins analyzed so far either activate or inhibit the zzso zzso signaling zzso that regulates zzso of the target zzso In addition, some of them activate zzso signaling pathways that involve components such as the zzso zzso G zzso protein zzso C, and zzso protein zzso II, although the precise signaling mechanisms are only just beginning to be zzso We demonstrate here that zzso signaling is sufficient to inhibit not only the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling but also zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso cells, thus serving as a zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso in part by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, protein zzso C is involved in the regulation of zzso by zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso with the central role of zzso zzso and zzso in cell survival and stress responses, zzso signaling promotes cell zzso Hence zzso is involved in coordination of key signaling zzso
