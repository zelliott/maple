The zzso zzso zzso regulates salt and water transport in the kidney as demonstrated by the association of gain of function zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso but the precise mechanism for this effect is not fully zzso We found previously that the zzso interacts with and zzso an inwardly zzso zzso channel, zzso which is expressed in the zzso zzso that contributes to the zzso zzso zzso and in which loss of function zzso are associated with a complex zzso that includes zzso salt zzso We now find that zzso zzso zzso by reducing its cell surface zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso cell surface expression and current density in zzso cells in proportion to their signaling zzso zzso activated zzso reduced cell surface expression and current density of zzso and these effects were blocked by zzso a protein that blocks signaling via zzso and zzso Other zzso zzso had insignificant zzso zzso of zzso blocked the effect of zzso on zzso whereas zzso of the zzso heavy chain had no zzso zzso had no comparable effect on the zzso outer zzso zzso channel, an zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso channel that is zzso by zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso and zzso physically associate with zzso in zzso cells and in kidney zzso Thus, the zzso decreases cell surface expression of zzso channels via a mechanism that involves zzso and zzso These results provide a novel molecular basis for the zzso of zzso zzso transport by the zzso
