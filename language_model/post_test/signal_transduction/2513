zzso cell death, or zzso is well documented as a zzso means of eliminating activated zzso and maintaining immune zzso zzso has also been implicated in the targeting of tumor cells by zzso T zzso and natural killer zzso One of the two primary mechanisms used in zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso or transformed cells expressing the zzso zzso on their surface are susceptible to killing by immune zzso cells that express the zzso zzso Many zzso cells, including those derived from patients with multiple zzso express zzso zzso on their surface, but do not undergo zzso in response to zzso zzso One possibility for the lack of zzso zzso includes zzso in the zzso zzso Loss of function zzso in the zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso disease in humans, and have been defined as the genetic zzso the in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso have not been previously described in cancer zzso In this study, we show that zzso occur in the zzso zzso which may cause loss of function and contribute to the zzso of the zzso disease, multiple zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and DNA sequencing, we examined the zzso structure of the zzso zzso in 54 bone zzso zzso specimens obtained from myeloma zzso Six patient specimens zzso did not express zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso Of the 48 zzso specimens which did express zzso zzso 5 zzso displayed point zzso All of the zzso identified were located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso known to be involved in zzso of an zzso zzso Two separate individuals demonstrated an identical zzso at a site previously shown to be zzso in the zzso zzso syndrome, zzso One patient exhibited a point zzso at a site only two zzso acids removed from the documented zzso of the zzso zzso Although the functional status of these point zzso remains to be determined, we propose that zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso and progression of myeloma in some zzso
