We showed previously that zzso zzso zzso stimulation produced a strong zzso overflow response from zzso acid zzso zzso Here we addressed this issue with a novel set of tools and methods, to distinguish the zzso pathways responsible for this zzso zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso receptors were used as a model zzso By using selective pharmacological zzso we showed that, in zzso cells, the zzso zzso was released as two distinct zzso zzso free AA and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso are responsible for this response: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the former cascade is responsible for part of the AA release, whereas the latter is responsible for all of the zzso release and part of the AA zzso Essentially only zzso released by zzso C but not by zzso D was implicated as a zzso for zzso production, although both zzso were strongly zzso The zzso released acted as a potent zzso zzso through zzso zzso receptors in an artificial zzso communication zzso that was zzso The zzso zzso in contrast, was involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also released upon zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results directly show, for the first time, that zzso receptors are able to generate potent zzso signals in addition to zzso acid signals, which may explain the proposed zzso interactions zzso in zzso
