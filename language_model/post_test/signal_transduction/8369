B zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso disorders since zzso depletion treatment improves such zzso However, B cells seem zzso zzso strains of zzso as well as zzso zzso conditions present with aggravated symptoms when B cells are zzso It is thus likely that some B cells are zzso while other have regulatory zzso There is not only one regulatory B cell zzso zzso but different types of zzso zzso Regulatory function can thus be ascribed to zzso B cells, marginal zone B cells, transitional type zzso B cells, or zzso B zzso Regulatory activity is induced only following cell zzso through a zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso Regulatory effects are then zzso by a soluble agent, such as zzso and/or direct zzso contacts that involve zzso or B7 zzso zzso zzso cells also vary from one disease to zzso zzso zzso T cells, zzso cells, zzso and regulatory T zzso can thus be either inhibited or activated to finally zzso the zzso zzso Taken as a whole, it appears that zzso cells participate in the control of zzso within a complex cellular network that may differ for each zzso Adapted stimulation and control of regulatory activity would thus be a prerequisite to an efficient usage of these B cells as an alternative therapy for zzso zzso
