zzso cartilage is a zzso tissue with superficial zzso middle zzso and deep zzso zzso zzso in the S zone zzso the zzso zzso zzso while zzso from the M and D zones are more specialized in producing large amounts of the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemicals and mechanical stimuli regulate cartilage development, growth, and zzso however, the mechanisms of regulation responsible for the distinct zzso and negative zzso of zzso are zzso The objective of this study was to determine if interaction between S and M zzso regulates zzso zzso as determined by zzso in zzso at different ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at different zzso zzso zzso zzso and 30,000 zzso and by measurement of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso of S and M cells resulted in significant zzso in zzso zzso and the percentage of cells expressing zzso with simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso Tracking M cells with zzso dye in zzso revealed that they maintained a zzso zzso and proliferated less than S zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso zzso expression in zzso is a result of preferential proliferation of zzso S zzso This finding may have practical implications for generating a large number of zzso normal S cells, which can be limited in source, for tissue engineering zzso
