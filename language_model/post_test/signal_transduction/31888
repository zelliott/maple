zzso is expressed in many cell types of most lineages in the zzso compartment and has specific roles in differentiation and function of various immune zzso zzso is required for development of zzso marginal zone B cells and regulates differentiation of zzso cells zzso in the zzso zzso appears to play some specific roles in the zzso zzso given that the fate of mast cells and a subset of zzso is regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso also has important roles in helper T cell divergence from zzso zzso T cells and zzso of zzso T zzso Moreover, recent genetic evidence suggests that both zzso zzso abnormalities of zzso cause transformation of immune zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso signaling pathways in chronic zzso zzso while zzso zzso are found in mature B cell zzso which reflects the role of zzso in the zzso process of these zzso
