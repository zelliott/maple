We have investigated the effect of zzso applied zzso protein of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso on zzso zzso zzso which represent a major signal zzso zzso of cells of the central nervous zzso zzso cultures of rat zzso zzso or zzso cells were incubated with synthetic zzso (10 zzso for various periods of time and analyzed for their zzso content by Western zzso In both types of cultures zzso was able to induce the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso although with different zzso and zzso zzso In addition, in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso increased the zzso content of zzso a protein involved in signal zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso This study shows that zzso applied zzso is able to induce the generation of zzso signals in zzso as well as zzso zzso
