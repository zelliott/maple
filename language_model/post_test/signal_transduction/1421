In zzso zzso production of zzso is triggered by signal molecules named zzso zzso A, B or C zzso B or zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Antibiotics zzso zzso zzso We have found a specific zzso binding protein from zzso zzso and characterized it by using a zzso zzso analogue as a zzso By equilibrium dialysis in the absence and presence of zzso zzso a crude extract from 1 g of wet zzso specifically bound zzso zzso of zzso The binding disappeared after zzso zzso and showed zzso specificity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than trans zzso much greater than zzso zzso indicating that binding was due to a zzso zzso specific binding zzso zzso analysis of the binding demonstrated a single class of high affinity binding sites zzso zzso zzso and low number of the binding sites zzso zzso zzso By gel zzso on zzso zzso and molecular sieve zzso the binding protein was shown to have an Mr of about zzso These results indicate that the substance is a novel zzso binding protein and suggest that it is a zzso zzso the zzso signal transmitted by zzso in zzso zzso
