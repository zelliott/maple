A zzso fusion, expressed in 103 muscle cells of zzso zzso reports on how zzso in muscle is controlled by neural and intramuscular zzso Upon acute zzso the fusion protein is zzso in the zzso 63 cells of the zzso muscle, but remains stable in 32 anterior zzso muscles and 8 zzso muscle zzso This distinction zzso with differences in the zzso of these zzso zzso protein in the head and zzso muscles becomes zzso upon genetic zzso in zzso that have blocks in zzso synthesis or release of zzso zzso or zzso reception at zzso zzso receptors zzso whereas protein in all 103 muscles is stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso does not stabilize muscle protein in zzso zzso that are zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso thus exert negative control over the zzso process in muscle by stimulating muscle zzso zzso zzso
