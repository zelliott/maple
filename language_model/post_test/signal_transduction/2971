Under blue light zzso zzso zzso zzso roots grow away from the light source, showing a negative zzso zzso However, the mechanism of root phototropism is still zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we showed that the zzso sensor zzso zzso the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were essential for zzso zzso flux in the root zzso transition zzso We also found that zzso fluorescent protein zzso localized to zzso compartments zzso in zzso root zzso and cortical cells, and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that caused zzso zzso to the plasma zzso When zzso roots were exposed to zzso A zzso zzso remained in zzso in darkness, and zzso caused zzso disappearance from zzso and induced zzso zzso within enlarged zzso In the zzso zzso both dark and zzso zzso treatments caused the disappearance of zzso from zzso However, in the zzso zzso zzso remained within zzso under both dark and zzso zzso treatments, suggesting that zzso and zzso play different roles in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso root phototropism is based on the zzso signaling pathway, which stimulates the zzso zzso flux by zzso the zzso targeting of zzso in the root zzso transition zzso
