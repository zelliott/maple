zzso show structural zzso with zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso properties of these compounds are unknown, we investigated their potential to relax zzso coronary arteries and determined the zzso of zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso rings were suspended in organ chambers, zzso with zzso (30 zzso and the zzso response was determined by measurement of changes in zzso zzso zzso on the chemical structure, the drugs induced zzso relaxation in rings with and without zzso zzso zzso was most potent and showed a 12- to zzso higher zzso effect than zzso zzso The zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso medium were zzso inhibited by zzso The effect of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso K zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which induced a zzso shift of zzso contraction, was blocked by zzso The zzso response to 8 was unaffected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel blockers, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of 8 was unaffected by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the protein zzso G inhibitor zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that 8, unlike zzso zzso and zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso zzso relaxation of coronary zzso the mechanism apparently involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso The drug may be protective against cardiovascular zzso
