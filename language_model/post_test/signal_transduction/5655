zzso cells zzso are the preferred targets for zzso protocols focused on stimulation of cellular immune zzso However, regardless of initial promising results, ex zzso generated zzso do not always promote zzso zzso The outcome of zzso immunity is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family, including substance P zzso and zzso zzso bind the zzso 1 zzso zzso and promote zzso immune zzso Nevertheless, the ability of zzso zzso to affect the immune functions of zzso remains zzso In the present work, we demonstrate that mouse bone zzso zzso zzso generated in the presence of zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso and zzso zzso express functional zzso Signaling via zzso with SP, zzso or the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso induced by deprivation of zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso binding promotes DC survival via zzso signaling zzso In adoptive transfer experiments, zzso zzso loaded with zzso exhibit increased longevity in draining zzso zzso resulting in enhanced and prolonged zzso cellular zzso Our results contribute to the understanding of the interactions between the immune and nervous systems that control DC function and present a novel approach for ex zzso of potent zzso zzso
