zzso immunity to the endemic zzso of North America requires zzso cells, but the pattern recognition receptors and signaling pathways that drive these protective responses have not been zzso We show that zzso zzso receptors exert divergent contributions to the development of zzso zzso cells and vaccine resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso immunity to zzso zzso requires zzso whereas vaccination against zzso zzso and zzso zzso infection depends on innate sensing by zzso and zzso but not zzso Tracking zzso T cells in zzso established that the zzso signaling zzso acts zzso and exclusively on differentiation of zzso cells, while leaving intact their zzso zzso survival, and zzso Whereas zzso signaling is essential, zzso zzso receptors offer distinct and divergent contributions to vaccine immunity against these endemic zzso zzso Our work provides new insight into innate immune mechanisms that drive vaccine immunity and zzso zzso
