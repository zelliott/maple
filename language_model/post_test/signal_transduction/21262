zzso zzso responds to signals of environmental and zzso stress by inducing over 40 general stress genes under the control of the zzso B zzso zzso zzso B activity is regulated zzso by a zzso network composed of two coupled zzso zzso zzso and zzso each containing a zzso zzso zzso or U), an zzso protein zzso or zzso and a switch zzso zzso zzso or zzso The upstream module zzso is required to transmit signals of environmental zzso In contrast, the downstream module zzso is required to transmit signals of energy stress as well as the environmental signals conveyed to it from the upstream zzso Until now the function of the zzso gene product was zzso zzso shares significant sequence similarity with the zzso and zzso zzso proteins whose zzso states control key zzso interactions within their respective zzso Here we present evidence that zzso is associated with zzso in the upstream, zzso zzso To investigate zzso function, we constructed deletion and point zzso within zzso and tested their effects on expression of zzso zzso reporter zzso both zzso and in combination with other zzso zzso To determine the possible interaction of zzso with other zzso zzso we tested the ability of zzso or zzso zzso to activate zzso in the zzso zzso system in conjunction with other zzso zzso On the basis of this genetic analysis, we conclude that zzso is a positive regulator which zzso zzso B activity in response to salt and heat zzso Our data further suggest that: zzso zzso influences the zzso function of zzso by direct zzso zzso and zzso this interaction with zzso is likely controlled by the zzso state of zzso
