zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expressed chiefly in bone and zzso We examined the zzso ability to engage zzso receptors and subsequently activate zzso signaling zzso Our data indeed show that the presence of zzso zzso triggers focal zzso point formation in human zzso stem cells and zzso zzso We determine that zzso acts via interaction with zzso zzso and stimulates zzso of focal zzso zzso Further zzso characterization confirms the zzso of downstream zzso of the zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso after zzso zzso This zzso is specifically zzso and can also be blocked by the addition of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso treatment with zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso to the nucleus and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The evidence presented here indicates that zzso is specifically involved in signaling via zzso zzso surface zzso Combined with the published zzso data zzso zzso zzso Ward, zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davis, zzso zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and White, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38, zzso it can be hypothesized that zzso could be a key zzso of zzso zzso
