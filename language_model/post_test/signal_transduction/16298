zzso cells, which are the main agents of the zzso process in zzso are lacking in the vessels of zzso These are limited by the basement zzso of zzso or zzso zzso This fact leads to the questions of how vessels grow in zzso and how zzso zzso zzso We zzso review the knowledge available about vascular growth in zzso The cases described include the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso All these processes of vascular growth in zzso show substantial differences with the zzso zzso although the zzso system zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso seems to be involved in all zzso However, zzso zzso is used by many processes of cell directional migration, and it cannot be considered as a hallmark of zzso We also describe the close similarity between the molecular control of the zzso zzso and the branching zzso of the zzso system of zzso In both cases, the process is regulated by zzso and activates a leading tip cell which zzso responsiveness of the adjacent cells through a zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso in zzso arose through zzso of this zzso mechanism by replacing the zzso axis of insects by a zzso system, and adding a second layer of control of the zzso state zzso or zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso This zzso new control mechanism of zzso zzso establishes an zzso cell zzso which does not exist in zzso
