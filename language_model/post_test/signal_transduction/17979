Ral zzso zzso zzso zzso and its family members zzso zzso and zzso are involved in Ras and Ral signaling pathways as downstream zzso zzso Here we report the precise zzso and cloning of two forms of human zzso gene differing at the zzso zzso zzso A, cloned from liver zzso libraries has the same zzso zzso as the mouse zzso whereas transcript B cloned from brain has a substitution of 45 zzso acids for the first nine zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso 1 of transcript A is replaced by two alternative zzso zzso and zzso in transcript zzso Both forms share zzso 2 through zzso The human zzso protein shares zzso zzso acid identity with the mouse zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that human zzso is expressed in a wide variety of zzso with strong expression being seen in the heart, brain, zzso zzso and zzso
