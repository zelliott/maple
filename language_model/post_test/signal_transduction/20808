The basic zzso recycling zzso can be modified to generate zzso zzso storage zzso and synaptic zzso zzso into synaptic zzso requires specialized sorting information not present in the zzso and storage zzso zzso Using zzso we have distinguished the signals for rapid zzso and zzso targeting in zzso Finally, we have evidence that synaptic zzso can be generated from an zzso compartment in zzso
