In zzso zzso zzso de zzso cortisol synthesis zzso only after zzso providing an interesting model to study the effects of maternal stress and abnormal cortisol deposition on zzso development and zzso We hypothesized that elevated cortisol levels during zzso zzso compromise cardiac performance in developing zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso to elevate zzso cortisol levels during zzso zzso zzso cortisol content increased heart zzso including zzso zzso and zzso chambers, and lowered resting heartbeat zzso This zzso coincided with suppression of key cardiac zzso including zzso cardiac zzso light chain 1, cardiac zzso type zzso and calcium transporting zzso underpinning a zzso link to heart zzso The zzso of the heartbeat response to a secondary zzso zzso also confirms a functional reduction in cardiac zzso Altogether, high cortisol content during zzso mimicking increased deposition due to maternal stress, decreases cardiac performance and may reduce zzso offspring zzso
