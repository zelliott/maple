zzso zzso cells exhibit rapid zzso calcium signals zzso that initiate in the zzso region but rapidly become global in zzso These characteristic zzso signals are important for effective fluid zzso which critically depends on a synchronized zzso of zzso separated zzso zzso zzso restricted zzso signals were never observed in zzso zzso zzso This is in marked contrast to the related pancreatic zzso cells, where the distribution of zzso has been suggested to contribute to restricting zzso signals to the zzso zzso zzso the aim of this study was to determine the zzso distribution and the role of zzso zzso zzso in shaping the spatial and zzso properties of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of cells stained with zzso zzso zzso Green zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that a majority of zzso is localized around the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signals were delayed as they zzso through the zzso This delay in the zzso nuclear zzso signal was abolished by zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso red and zzso Likewise, simultaneous measurement of zzso with zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso respectively, revealed that zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso red and zzso Finally, at zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a nuclear zzso zzso zzso also evoked a substantial increase in zzso zzso This zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso that was also sensitive to zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may zzso shape nuclear zzso signals but more zzso drive zzso metabolism to generate zzso close to the zzso These effects may profoundly affect a variety of nuclear processes in zzso zzso cells while zzso efficient fluid zzso
