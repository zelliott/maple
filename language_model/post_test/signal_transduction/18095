zzso in the zzso zzso is driven by cells of the zzso One of the genes that zzso zzso identity in zzso is zzso zzso which is required for normal zzso movements and ultimately for zzso zzso and zzso differentiation in the development of all zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and interference with zzso zzso leads to an zzso of zzso movements during zzso To understand this process, we have screened for downstream target genes of zzso zzso zzso Casey, zzso zzso zzso and Smith, zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso This approach has now allowed us to isolate zzso whose expression pattern is almost identical to that of zzso at zzso and early zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced in an zzso fashion by zzso and its expression in zzso is abolished by a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso like zzso of zzso zzso zzso extension zzso This zzso can be rescued by zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso and also by a truncated form of zzso which cannot signal through the zzso zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso Together, our results suggest that the regulation of zzso movements by zzso occurs through a zzso similar to that involved in zzso polarity zzso in zzso
