zzso release from zzso involves both zzso trafficking and subsequent fusion of synaptic zzso with the plasma zzso The mechanisms involving the formation and fusion of zzso that allow the zzso release of zzso are understood zzso Little is known, however, about the signaling mechanism involved in the trafficking of zzso along the zzso In this study, we used real-time zzso zzso to search for evidence that zzso trafficking in zzso requires the zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso fused to green fluorescent protein has been used to trace zzso zzso zzso II, an established zzso hormone, stimulates zzso of green fluorescent zzso zzso from the cell body to zzso This zzso was blocked by an zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by other means, such as zzso or zzso also resulted in the zzso of zzso in a manner similar to that observed for zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso signaling may be a general mechanism for the stimulation of zzso trafficking in brain zzso
