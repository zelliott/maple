In zzso zzso zzso zzso in the gap gene giant zzso have long been known to affect zzso zzso resulting in zzso delay and the production of large zzso larvae, zzso and zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso production has remained zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso and zzso delay by affecting the zzso of the PG zzso that produce zzso hormone zzso The zzso zzso zzso leads to random loss of zzso production in one or more of the 4 PG zzso in the zzso zzso In cases where zzso production is lost in all four PG zzso delayed development and giant larvae are zzso Since zzso shows no evidence for zzso expression in the PG zzso once zzso production is zzso it is unlikely that zzso directly regulates zzso zzso Instead, we find that zzso of the zzso zzso by the PG zzso is absent in zzso zzso larvae that do not express zzso In addition, PG zzso zzso zzso is abnormal in many zzso zzso zzso Since several other zzso expressed gap genes such as zzso and zzso have previously been found to affect the fate of the cerebral zzso a region of the brain that gives rise to the neuroendocrine cells that zzso the ring zzso we conclude that zzso likely controls zzso production indirectly by contributing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso
