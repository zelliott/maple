zzso capping protein zzso anchors the barbed ends of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from transgenic mice zzso expressing a reduced amount of zzso demonstrate altered function and protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso zzso Hart zzso Cooper zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 90 (2002) zzso The aims of the current study were to determine the direct effects of zzso on zzso function and on zzso signaling to the zzso Our studies compared mechanical properties of single zzso from zzso mouse hearts to zzso zzso from which zzso was extracted using zzso We found that zzso from zzso transgenic zzso exhibited increased zzso sensitivity and maximum zzso zzso The extraction of zzso from zzso zzso zzso the increase in maximum zzso tension, but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the extraction of zzso was associated with a reduction in zzso zzso and that zzso transgenic zzso also lacked zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso sensitivity, whereas this effect was attenuated in zzso from zzso zzso Our results indicate that cardiac zzso directly controls maximum zzso tension generation, and establish zzso as an important component in zzso zzso at the zzso and for zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso
