zzso zzso are zzso controlling major aspects of plant zzso including seed zzso growth and flower zzso zzso signaling is also involved in resistance to adverse conditions, thus providing a mechanism for environmentally responsive growth zzso We recently characterized the function of a core component of the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of negative zzso response zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso which in turn enhances the expression of zzso genes by zzso the activity of key zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are well known to play synergistic roles in plant disease zzso zzso we showed that zzso regulates plant defense responses by modulating zzso defense signaling zzso
