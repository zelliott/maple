zzso growth factor zzso zzso is an effective molecular target of zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell growth in zzso by suppressing gene expression of zzso and reduces tumor growth in various animal zzso To overcome zzso and zzso properties of zzso as zzso we designed and zzso six novel zzso zzso zzso with or without a zzso group originally present in zzso The cell viability tests indicated that zzso of the zzso containing zzso group were 3 to zzso lower than those of the zzso without zzso group in two colon cancer cell lines zzso Western zzso analysis indicates the zzso containing zzso group inhibited expression and zzso zzso of zzso Further protein analyses showed that the zzso had zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest properties associated with suppressed zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso groups in zzso and the zzso were critical for observed biological zzso
