zzso membrane trafficking is a fundamental cellular process, but its zzso relevance is little zzso Here we show that the zzso motor zzso complex acts in zzso zzso traffic of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso during early embryonic zzso zzso mouse zzso failed in developing zzso and primitive zzso lineages and died in the zzso stage, similar to previously reported zzso knockout zzso zzso associated directly with the zzso zzso on zzso zzso and transported them toward the plasma zzso To examine whether the zzso state of zzso serves as a switch for zzso we performed zzso zzso This dominant negative approach reproduced the whole putative sequence of zzso or zzso zzso impairment in zzso zzso zzso zzso basement membrane assembly by the primitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data provide one of the first pieces of genetic evidence that zzso membrane trafficking directly promotes early zzso
