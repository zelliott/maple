Using an established spotted zzso zzso platform, the nature of changes in the zzso profiles of zzso unique genes from the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso in response to the absence of either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso It is reported that 216 transcripts were altered in zzso in the zzso strain and zzso in the zzso strain, with a considerable overlap zzso zzso that were changed in both zzso Of note, these commonly altered transcripts were changed in the same direction in every instance, thus suggesting a considerable zzso in zzso control or extensive zzso To further knowledge of the potential impact on zzso of infection by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso was also investigated by Western zzso It was demonstrated that both zzso components were reduced in abundance to approximately 25 % of zzso levels, while their transcripts were slightly zzso zzso of a list of genes with altered expression in the presence of zzso to the data obtained in the absence of either zzso zzso showed that more than one-half of all the transcripts changed by zzso infection were also changed in at least one zzso zzso strain, with one-third being changed in zzso zzso 95 % of the zzso genes were altered in the same zzso These data provide the first evidence for zzso of zzso protein levels as well as the zzso pathways by zzso infection, and support the hypothesis that modification of zzso via both zzso and zzso provides for a significant contribution to zzso zzso
