zzso death of zzso in zzso retinal zzso can be prevented by zzso zzso Here, we report that adrenal zzso zzso released during zzso stress protect zzso from zzso after light zzso zzso stress is known to be the main type of zzso humans are exposed to and was induced here in mice by zzso of chronic subordinate colony housing zzso zzso damage was generated by subsequent exposure to white zzso zzso zzso stress prior to zzso significantly reduced the number of zzso zzso an effect that was absent in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was completely restored in zzso mice zzso with zzso Moreover, zzso of retinal zzso increased following zzso or zzso zzso treatment, an effect that was again absent in zzso mice exposed to zzso Finally, zzso of zzso signaling with zzso blocked the zzso and zzso zzso effects on zzso In zzso we provide evidence that 1) short-term zzso stress protects zzso from zzso damage and 2) the protective effect is most likely zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
