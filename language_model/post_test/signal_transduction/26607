Salt tolerance in plants is a complex trait involving multiple zzso zzso these mechanisms and their regulation will assist in developing novel strategies to engineer zzso zzso In the current study, we investigated zzso mechanisms in soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso salt zzso demonstrated the salt tolerance of zzso at the zzso stage and during zzso After a 10-day 200 zzso zzso treatment, zzso content in Union was reduced by 50 % compared to a 17 % reduction in zzso zzso was also less affected by zzso acid zzso and zzso during zzso than zzso Upon zzso and zzso treatment, the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso and Union zzso These results suggest that salt tolerance in zzso is in part regulated through an zzso zzso In addition, following a zzso 200 zzso zzso treatment, zzso produced more zzso than Union indicating the involvement of zzso oxygen species zzso in regulating salt tolerance in zzso Yet another mechanism zzso employs is withholding toxic zzso zzso zzso from aerial zzso Following 200 zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso was mostly localized to the roots of zzso In contrast, most of the zzso in Union was transported into the stems and zzso Taken together, our results demonstrated a role of zzso and zzso in regulating salt tolerance in zzso and the critical role of zzso in zzso mortality in zzso Key message Withholding toxic zzso zzso from leaves and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso salt tolerance to soybean zzso In addition, zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso signal zzso
