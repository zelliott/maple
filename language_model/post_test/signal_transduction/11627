In order to identify factors involved in zzso of the central nervous system, we undertook a functional screen in zzso animal cap zzso which involved zzso zzso zzso together with pools of zzso from a chick zzso zzso zzso In the course of this screen, we isolated a clone zzso a truncated form of zzso which induced zzso neural and zzso zzso markers when zzso with zzso in animal zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso and zzso suggesting that these effects are a consequence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether the zzso of zzso neural markers requires zzso zzso we performed experiments using a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso of this protein during zzso stages resulted in the induction of both zzso neural and zzso zzso while zzso during zzso stages induced only zzso neural zzso We show that this zzso activity occurs by an indirect and zzso mechanism requiring zzso zzso
