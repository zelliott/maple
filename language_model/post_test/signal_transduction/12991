zzso zzso are short-lived zzso cells whose zzso fate is determined by the specificity of their zzso A relatively small number of zzso zzso undergo positive selection in the zzso and these are signaled to differentiate either into zzso or zzso mature T zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso determine their appropriate zzso fate has been the subject of intense theoretical debate and rigorous experimental zzso In the last year, zzso zzso has been offered as a replacement for zzso zzso as a major zzso of the zzso decision, a deceptively minor refinement that requires a major change in our understanding of how signaled zzso zzso differentiate into mature T zzso Indeed, the kinetic signaling model provides a radically new perspective on the mechanism by which the zzso lineage decision is zzso
