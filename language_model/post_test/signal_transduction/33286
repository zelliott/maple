In an attempt to zzso the mechanism by which zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso cooperate in zzso tumor development, we have analyzed signaling by the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso regulation of zzso number in transgenic mice bearing the zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso analysis indicated a single class of high affinity receptors with the total number of binding sites of zzso X zzso zzso 600 and zzso X zzso zzso 1000 zzso in the normal and zzso zzso in primary culture, zzso After 72 h of zzso exposure in culture, the number of zzso zzso receptors on the cell surface of the zzso zzso was not reduced, whereas the number of zzso receptors on normal zzso was reduced to zzso that of zzso zzso Nuclear zzso experiments done with zzso isolated from intact zzso demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso higher in zzso zzso Increased levels of the zzso factor zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso and in primary culture, suggest a mechanism for the increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also increases the expression of zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso is also detected in zzso Thus, the increased number of zzso receptors in zzso expressing zzso even after prolonged exposure to zzso or zzso in zzso may allow greater triggering of the zzso zzso signaling zzso
