Many chronic diseases, such as zzso wounds are characterized by prolonged inflammation and respond poorly to conventional zzso zzso zzso are a major impediment to wound zzso zzso infection of the skin allows the formation of complex bacterial communities termed zzso zzso living in zzso are zzso distinct from their zzso counterparts and are orders of magnitude more resistant to zzso host immune response, and environmental zzso zzso zzso is prevalent in zzso infections such as chronic wounds and is an important human zzso 

The impact of zzso zzso soluble products in zzso medium zzso or in zzso medium zzso on human zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso revealed differential protein compositions with zzso containing several zzso involved in zzso Global gene expression of zzso exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was analyzed after four hours of zzso Gene zzso terms associated with responses to bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso were enriched in zzso treated zzso Several transcripts zzso zzso were also zzso by zzso after four zzso zzso analysis of zzso confirmed zzso results at four hours and revealed that after 24 hours of exposure, zzso zzso zzso induced sustained low level zzso production compared to near exponential increases of zzso in zzso treated zzso The reduction in zzso produced by zzso exposed to zzso was accompanied by suppressed zzso of zzso Chemical zzso of zzso did not drastically reduce zzso production in zzso zzso suggesting that the majority of zzso production is zzso through zzso zzso 

zzso the results indicate that zzso zzso zzso induce a distinct inflammatory response compared to their zzso zzso The differential gene expression and production of inflammatory zzso by zzso and zzso cultures in zzso could have implications for the formation and persistence of chronic zzso The formation of a zzso should be considered in any study investigating host response to zzso
