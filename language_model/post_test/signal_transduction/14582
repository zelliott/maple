Sex steroid receptors zzso traditionally have been regarded as zzso factors regulating the expression of target zzso However, alternative mechanisms of signal zzso have been identified zzso These actions of sex steroids do not require gene expression or protein synthesis and are independent of the nuclear zzso of the zzso Indeed, some of these actions are zzso by zzso at the plasma zzso In the recent years significant advances have been made in the characterization of these rapid actions of sex steroids in the vascular zzso zzso zzso actions of sex steroids at this level include the induction of rapid zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways traditionally believed to mediate the signals of growth factors or zzso have been found to be recruited by sex steroid hormones via their zzso These include zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso These zzso lead to rapid actions, such as the zzso of zzso oxide zzso but are also critical for the regulation of the expression of several target genes in the nucleus, indicating a tight integration of the zzso and zzso pathways of sex steroid zzso The understanding of the molecular basis of the zzso actions of sex steroids on the vascular system is important, and may become relevant for clinical purposes in the zzso
