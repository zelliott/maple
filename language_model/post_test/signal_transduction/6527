Administration of zzso zzso produces inflammation and zzso of the lung in humans and experimental zzso The molecular defects by which zzso zzso these pathological effects have not been studied in zzso We studied the expression of zzso family zzso key molecules involved in zzso transforming growth factor zzso signaling from the cell membrane to the nucleus, during the early and late zzso of zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso was induced in male zzso rats by a single zzso injection zzso zzso of zzso Control rats received zzso zzso were killed at 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 days after zzso zzso and nuclear proteins were extracted and isolated from lung zzso and zzso proteins were zzso with specific zzso In zzso lung zzso compared with control, zzso decreased persistently in the zzso and increased zzso in the zzso There was a persistent increase in zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was increased zzso in both the zzso and zzso A significant and progressive decrease in the expression of zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso was observed after zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that an imbalance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso may result in the unchecked zzso of an zzso zzso loop, which contributes to the zzso of zzso pulmonary zzso
