zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso humans to Multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to simultaneously zzso the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the loss of zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso The loss of zzso in mice results in embryonic zzso due to a lack of zzso zzso cells that fail to zzso correlate with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso may regulate expression of both zzso Also, zzso is expressed predominantly in neuroendocrine cells that give rise to the primary cell types affected in zzso Together these studies suggest that zzso is a downstream target of zzso signaling that prevents zzso of zzso and/or zzso We report that zzso zzso by zzso leads to a transient induction of zzso zzso and protein levels, and that zzso induction is required to maintain low zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels correlate with increased binding of zzso to an zzso consensus binding site in the zzso promoter, and this binding is zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso Finally, loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso is a downstream target of zzso zzso and propose that induction of zzso by zzso is a key step leading to lower zzso levels during zzso zzso
