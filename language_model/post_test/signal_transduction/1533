The zzso zzso is a zzso sequence zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso It belongs to a family of zzso receptors that share a common overall molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors belong to a larger family of zzso sequence receptors that include growth hormone and zzso zzso The signal zzso mechanism of these receptors has not been thoroughly zzso zzso zzso (or zzso has been suggested as the zzso However, at least for the zzso zzso zzso has been seen to occur in the absence of the zzso suggesting that an zzso as yet unknown effect of hormone binding is responsible for zzso zzso To understand the signaling zzso some of the functions and zzso of the zzso zzso critical for signaling have been identified, including the binding zzso zzso zzso the zzso hinge structure containing a signature motif critical for zzso zzso zzso site zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These structures and the functional sites have been identified in the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso The zzso domain contains a zzso domain that regulates the activity of the zzso domain responding to zzso binding and also to binding of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this regulatory role of the zzso domain is modulated by its own zzso zzso Although considerable data have been zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso signaling has not been well zzso Further studies are necessary to understand how zzso binds to the zzso what zzso effect is caused by zzso zzso how this effect is zzso across the cell zzso and how this zzso effect leads to stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso
