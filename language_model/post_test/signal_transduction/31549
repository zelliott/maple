zzso of zzso results in the formation of the zzso zzso a dramatic zzso zzso that accompanies cell zzso Here, we demonstrate that changes in the zzso zzso may regulate these zzso changes by altering zzso zzso trafficking of zzso zzso zzso The data reveal that zzso in contrast to zzso decreased zzso transport of zzso zzso 140 and the model viral protein zzso G, both proteins normally residing in the zzso zzso The underlying mechanism relies on an zzso zzso of zzso which causes stable zzso of zzso As a result, dynamic reorganization of the cortical zzso zzso necessary for the targeting of zzso trafficking to the zzso sheet is zzso a prerequisite for zzso zzso These data are discussed in the context of the zzso disease multiple zzso zzso that leakage of zzso across the zzso barrier may impede zzso by interference with zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso
