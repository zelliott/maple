Although a host of zzso signals is known to contribute to wound healing, the role of the cell zzso in tissue repair remains zzso Here we employed 2 different mouse models of genetic skin fragility to assess the role of the basement membrane protein collagen zzso zzso in wound zzso zzso zzso the attachment of the zzso to the zzso and its zzso cause a human skin fragility disorder coined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is associated with a constant wound zzso We show that zzso is instrumental for skin wound closure by 2 interconnected zzso First, zzso was required for zzso through organization of zzso at the zzso zzso Its loss zzso zzso organization during wound healing, which in turn abrogates strictly polarized expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso impacts the zzso zzso signaling axis guiding zzso zzso Second, zzso supported zzso zzso migration and regulates their zzso production in the zzso zzso These findings, which were validated in human wounds, identify zzso as a critical player in zzso wound healing in humans and mice and may facilitate development of therapeutic strategies not only for zzso but also for other chronic zzso
