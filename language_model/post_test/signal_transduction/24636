zzso of transforming growth factor alpha zzso to cultured human zzso results in enhanced expression of zzso zzso This phenomenon of zzso zzso is also observed in a zzso responsive colon cancer cell line, zzso zzso In the present study, regulation of zzso zzso is examined in these two cell zzso In human zzso but not in zzso zzso cells, the increase in zzso zzso zzso following administration of zzso is due to stabilization of the zzso zzso transcript, as determined by zzso D zzso zzso Nuclear zzso experiments confirmed zzso control in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression is zzso at least in part, through a protein zzso zzso zzso in both cell types, as determined by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso but not in the zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso expression is zzso through an zzso growth factor zzso pathway, as determined by zzso blockade of the zzso growth factor zzso Thus, differential regulation of zzso zzso exists in these zzso and transformed zzso cell zzso
