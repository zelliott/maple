In the present work we used patch zzso techniques to study the properties of a novel zzso zzso channel activated by the potent coronary zzso zzso zzso in freshly dispersed rabbit coronary artery zzso With zzso recording bath application of 10 zzso zzso evoked zzso channel currents zzso with zzso states of about 18, 34 and 51 and 68 zzso and a reversal potential of 0 zzso zzso evoked channel activity when zzso zzso was the charge carrier, illustrating significant zzso zzso zzso responses were inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso analogue zzso zzso also zzso zzso but the protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso did not inhibit either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso but greatly zzso the response to zzso and this effect was blocked by zzso Bath application of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso patches markedly inhibited zzso zzso but zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso studies demonstrated preferential zzso expression in the zzso whereas zzso was distributed throughout the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signals was observed at, or close to, the plasma zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso These results suggest that in rabbit coronary artery zzso zzso evokes a zzso zzso zzso channel with properties similar to zzso and zzso and indicates that these proteins may be important components of this zzso
