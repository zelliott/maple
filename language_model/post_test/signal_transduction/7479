The zzso zzso zzso can suppress the zzso zzso zzso through the last downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sterile zzso zzso 1 functions as the upstream zzso of the zzso pathway, and zzso zzso zzso zzso plays roles in the zzso signal zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, using tandem affinity zzso and zzso analysis, zzso was identified as a novel partner of zzso Further analysis showed that the interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso by their zzso zzso and enhanced by the zzso of zzso To exclude the interference of the zzso zzso the zzso from zzso to zzso was blocked using zzso zzso In the zzso cells, zzso still inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso by disturbing the interaction of zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso in the presence of zzso was effectively relieved by the downstream zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso the close zzso of zzso also displayed the similar function in suppressing the zzso zzso Therefore the results of the present study revealed that, in addition to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso can suppress the zzso zzso directly through zzso
