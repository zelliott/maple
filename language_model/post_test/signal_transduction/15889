zzso establish specific synaptic connections with their targets, a process that is highly zzso Numerous cell zzso molecules have been implicated in target recognition, but how these proteins are precisely zzso and targeted is poorly zzso To identify components that affect synaptic zzso we carried out a forward genetic screen in the zzso zzso We identified a zzso named zzso zzso zzso whose loss leads to synaptic specificity zzso Loss of rich leads to reduction of zzso in the zzso cell zzso but not of other proteins implicated in target recognition, including zzso zzso zzso belly, and zzso The Rich protein binds to zzso and zzso zzso display very similar zzso as the rich zzso The active form of zzso strongly suppresses the rich synaptic specificity zzso indicating that zzso is regulated by zzso We propose that Rich activates zzso to regulate zzso trafficking and affects synaptic zzso
