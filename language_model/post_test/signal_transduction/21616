The formation of zzso and functionally mature zzso is a key event in zzso maturation and the establishment of functional zzso networks, but the signals that regulate zzso zzso development remain poorly zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which zzso expression of several neurotransmitter zzso also regulates zzso development of zzso zzso cells in the intact zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may control a program of zzso development, from initiating zzso zzso to the formation and maturation of the zzso zzso
