A zzso pathway, called zzso or zzso zzso the ambient pH signal in zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso requires most of the components of the zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a functional analysis of the zzso zzso zzso was carried out by zzso deletions of each of the zzso zzso to test whether zzso functions in the zzso and zzso pathways could be zzso These two pathways were shown to zzso both the zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso However, the central zzso region seems to be required for neither of zzso Both pathways involve the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, identical zzso of zzso are required for both zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso domain was shown to bind the zzso protein zzso in the zzso pathway, whereas it binds zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is therefore required to link pH zzso and zzso
