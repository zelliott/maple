zzso wound repair is a highly ordered and zzso process involving various cell lineages and many molecular zzso zzso interactions through zzso molecules provide key signals important for wound zzso zzso is a zzso protein that may provide signals important during tissue development and zzso by interacting with several zzso zzso via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso in the process of zzso wound repair using zzso mice and by zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso We first determined the expression profile and zzso of zzso in a zzso wound repair model zzso zzso was robustly deposited in the zzso zzso beneath the extended zzso wound edges and at the zzso junctions in wounded zzso Moreover, zzso mice exhibited delayed in zzso wound repair, which could be improved by direct administration of zzso zzso In zzso analyses revealed that loss of zzso impaired proliferation and migration of zzso zzso but zzso supplementation or enforced zzso expression enhanced their zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso zzso the process of zzso wound repair by zzso zzso
