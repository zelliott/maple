The Kit zzso functions in zzso zzso development, gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the roles of different Kit signaling pathways in zzso we have generated zzso mice in which zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Whereas zzso zzso is normal in zzso and zzso mice, zzso is affected zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso blocks pro T cell and pro B cell development in an zzso zzso Thus, the zzso family zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso site in zzso mediates a critical signal for zzso zzso In agreement with these results, treatment of normal mice with the Kit zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso leads to deficits in pro T and pro B cell development, similar to those seen in zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso do not affect embryonic zzso but the zzso zzso blocks zzso at the zzso stages and in contrast the zzso zzso does not affect this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso family signaling is highly specific for different cellular contexts in zzso
