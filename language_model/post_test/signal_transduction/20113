zzso are key zzso of synaptic zzso By zzso zzso receptors expressed in the central nervous system, these zzso zzso can regulate several neural functions and zzso As experimental tools advance, the repertoire of known zzso effects at the zzso and their underlying zzso continues to zzso zzso signaling is the principal mode by which zzso mediate zzso and long-term forms of plasticity at both zzso and zzso zzso However, growing evidence suggests that zzso can also signal in a zzso zzso In addition to zzso synaptic zzso the zzso system is itself subject to plastic zzso Multiple points of interaction with other zzso and signaling systems have now been zzso In this Review, we focus on new advances in synaptic zzso signaling in the zzso zzso The emerging picture not only reinforces zzso as potent regulators of synaptic function but also reveals that zzso signaling is mechanistically more complex and diverse than originally zzso
