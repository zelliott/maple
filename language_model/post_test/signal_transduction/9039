The plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso insensitive zzso zzso 1 zzso is required for zzso molecular pattern zzso immunity zzso Here we show that a distinct member of the zzso family, zzso is required for the full functioning of zzso a zzso binding zzso repeat zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso insects, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a tobacco rattle virus zzso zzso gene zzso zzso screen in zzso zzso The screen was based on the suppression of a zzso hypersensitive response triggered by a zzso active form of zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso in zzso resistance, zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso Three zzso members were identified with zzso to zzso zzso or zzso and were named zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso transcript levels in resistant plants, using zzso zzso zzso revealed a role for zzso in zzso resistance to potato zzso but not to zzso In addition, zzso zzso gene regulation was compromised in zzso plants, placing zzso in the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso in a susceptible tomato background did not reduce the zzso to zzso indicating that zzso is unlikely to be an essential zzso zzso zzso is an active zzso mainly localized at the plasma zzso This work identifies a critical early component of zzso zzso and demonstrates a role for zzso in zzso zzso
