The zzso zzso acid has zzso significant attention due to its remarkable zzso activity, although its detailed mechanism of action remains zzso Here, we demonstrate the existence of a nuclear zzso stabilization zzso that promotes breast and pancreatic cancer growth in zzso and in zzso and serves as a bona fide target of zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso domain, thus protecting the zzso factor from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso this zzso stabilization zzso through two mechanisms, namely zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso Upon nuclear zzso zzso targets zzso zzso for zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and hence labels the factor for subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso domain prevents zzso from zzso zzso and degradation and consequently zzso cancer cells from growth suppression by zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates a critical role of the zzso signaling loop in the regulation of zzso protein stability and growth promotion and suggests that double targeting of this zzso is responsible, at least to a significant part, for the potent and reliable zzso effects of zzso zzso
