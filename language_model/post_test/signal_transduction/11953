The aim of this report is to provide a mathematical model of the mechanism for making zzso fate decisions about cell death or survival, during and after zzso zzso zzso treatment, and to supply the logical design for this decision mechanism as an application of rate distortion theory to the zzso processing of information by the physical system of a zzso 

Based on system biology models of the molecular interactions involved in the zzso processes previously established, and regarding a cellular decision-making system as a noisy communication channel, we use rate distortion theory to design a time dependent zzso zzso where the input is a stimulus zzso composed of the time dependent zzso of three zzso related cell death signaling molecules and the output is a cell fate zzso The molecular zzso are determined by a group of rate zzso The basic steps are: zzso the probability of the cell fate decision, zzso the conditional probability distribution that zzso the mutual information between input and zzso zzso the cell probability of cell fate decision that zzso the mutual information and repeat the last two steps until the probabilities zzso Advance to the next discrete time point and repeat the zzso 

Based on the model from communication theory described in this work, and assuming that the zzso of the death signal processing occurs when any of the molecular stimulants increases higher than a zzso threshold zzso of the maximum zzso for 1800s of treatment, the cell zzso necrosis within the first 30 minutes with probability range zzso and in the case of zzso it goes through zzso within zzso hours with probability range zzso zzso there is no experimental validation of the model at this moment, it reproduces some patterns of survival ratios of predicted experimental zzso 

zzso modeling based on cell death signaling molecules has been shown to be an independent and useful tool for prediction of cell surviving response to zzso The model can be adjusted to provide important insights for cellular response to other treatments such as zzso and diseases such as zzso
