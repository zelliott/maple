zzso are specialized zzso structures that control the exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the plant and the zzso The classical zzso mechanisms that define cell fate and tissue patterning - cell zzso zzso interactions and signals from a distance - are employed to make zzso and to define their density and distribution within the zzso Recent work has shown that two genes that are involved in zzso pattern may zzso components of a classical zzso signaling zzso Additional work has suggested that signals from the zzso zzso and the underlying zzso also influence zzso zzso These findings highlight the need for models that explain how the signals that regulate zzso development are integrated and how they act to regulate cell zzso the cell cycle and, ultimately, cell zzso
