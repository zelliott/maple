zzso zzso have been used to study zzso pathways involved in metamorphosis of some marine zzso However, the zzso mechanisms for zzso have been less zzso In the present study, participation of protein zzso C zzso zzso receptors zzso and calcium has been investigated during metamorphosis of the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae were induced with different drugs that activate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso or inhibit zzso zzso and zzso flux zzso zzso Six of the compounds were zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the calcium zzso zzso and the calcium zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was effective at zzso zzso zzso was effective at zzso zzso In the presence of zzso as zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso was effective at 10 zzso and zzso at zzso zzso In the presence of a bacterial film as zzso zzso was effective at 50 zzso and zzso inhibited metamorphosis at 1 zzso zzso was effective at 5 and 10 zzso and zzso at 50 and 100 zzso Our results indicate that zzso protein zzso C, and calcium participate in the metamorphosis of zzso zzso These elements of the zzso pathways triggered during metamorphosis may be part of a cascade of signal zzso routes that interact from induction to the end of the zzso events that shape the zzso zzso In addition, according to the results obtained with zzso zzso the zzso may be shared between the artificial zzso and natural zzso zzso
