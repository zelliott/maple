We recently showed by DNA zzso analysis that vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso human colon cancer cells, suggesting that several zzso factors may target colon cancer cells zzso In this study, transcripts zzso the zzso and zzso 3A zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were identified by reverse zzso in the human colon cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso invasion induced by zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso required zzso zzso protein zzso and signaling through zzso and zzso zzso zzso As expected, the zzso signaling inhibitor zzso selectively zzso the zzso activity of zzso in collagen gels zzso 10 zzso and chick heart zzso We identify a novel function for zzso and zzso as zzso factors for human zzso cancer zzso Interestingly, oral administration of the single drug zzso to zzso mice zzso zzso once zzso inhibited by zzso the growth of zzso tumor cell zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso or zzso resulted in additive therapeutic activity against zzso human lung tumor zzso Our data have significant implications for new therapeutic approaches and individualized treatment targeting zzso and zzso signaling pathways in combination with established clinical drugs at primary tumors and distant zzso in colon and lung cancer zzso
