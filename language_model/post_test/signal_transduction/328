zzso zzso cells zzso are known to zzso excess zzso that zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their tissue zzso zzso During spontaneous recovery from experimental liver fibrosis, the expression of zzso declines and zzso zzso activity zzso This is accompanied by zzso zzso In this study, we examine a potential mechanism zzso zzso activity might induce zzso zzso by zzso zzso at the cell zzso 

zzso expression was zzso in human zzso during zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso or a zzso targeting the zzso domain of zzso to cultured zzso promoted zzso During zzso there was zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso became activated early during zzso zzso and directly zzso zzso in zzso zzso of activated zzso to zzso in culture resulted in enhanced zzso and loss of zzso 

Together, these studies identify a role for both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso where zzso works to provide a cell survival stimulus and zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso
