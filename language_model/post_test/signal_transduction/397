zzso zzso regulate several zzso processes and mediate zzso zzso To study their roles in zzso base development, we created conditional mouse zzso deficient in zzso a critical primary zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso bases were zzso and their zzso growth plates were zzso zzso of Indian zzso zzso collagen X, and zzso was reduced and accompanied by decreases in zzso zzso Interestingly, there was excessive zzso zzso along the zzso accompanied by excessive zzso zzso suggesting that zzso distribution was wider and responsible for such excessive zzso Indeed, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso normally involved in restricting zzso distribution, was barely zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the data provides further evidence for the essential roles of primary zzso and zzso signaling in zzso base development and zzso zzso and point to a close zzso between zzso and zzso to zzso targets of zzso action in zzso
