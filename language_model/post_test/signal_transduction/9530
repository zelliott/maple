zzso is a highly zzso zzso killer cell zzso zzso zzso implicated in resistance to viral diseases such as zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso and is specific for zzso class I zzso molecules belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso second and third zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso but the role of the first zzso domain zzso in zzso recognition has remained zzso We found that zzso expressed in zzso cells and as a soluble zzso can zzso recognize additional zzso molecules including zzso and zzso This interaction is highly sensitive to blocking with zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso blocking zzso zzso Using zzso receptors between zzso and zzso expressed on zzso cells and as soluble zzso zzso we show that the zzso domain zzso the broad functional recognition and binding as well as the zzso with zzso These results suggest that the presence of a second and independent site of interaction between zzso and zzso and that zzso could bridge zzso molecules together in a manner that zzso zzso
