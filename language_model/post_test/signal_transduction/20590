The DNA damage checkpoint controls cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, and zzso of this checkpoint is in turn cell zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is essential for this checkpoint response and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies suggested that the zzso consensus sites of zzso are important for its checkpoint zzso However, the precise zzso sites of zzso involved have not been zzso Here we show that zzso consensus sites of zzso function in parallel to its zzso domain toward checkpoint zzso analogous to its zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso of multiple rather than any individual zzso site of zzso is required to completely eliminate its checkpoint activity in zzso Although zzso interacts with zzso zzso we provide evidence showing that elimination of this interaction does not affect DNA damage checkpoint zzso in zzso suggesting that additional zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the regulation of zzso by zzso and the role of zzso in DNA damage checkpoint zzso are more complex than previously zzso We propose that multiple zzso of zzso by zzso may provide a more robust system to allow zzso to control cell zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso
