zzso cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths zzso Despite the extensive body of research on gastric cancer, the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer remains poor, and therapy for advanced gastric cancer relies largely on zzso zzso zzso identifying the distinct molecular pathways underlying disease progression and treatment resistance may lead to novel therapeutic approaches, as well as improve the quality of life and survival of zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are now known to play an important role in cancer development and zzso Here, we review the expression and function of zzso and zzso as well as their clinical relevance in gastric zzso We also cover the current molecular zzso specifically the zzso pathway, by which gastric cancer zzso through the zzso zzso and discuss the potential of that axis as a therapeutic target in the treatment of gastric zzso
