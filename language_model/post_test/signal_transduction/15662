A wide range of cellular processes require molecular regulatory pathways to convert a graded signal into a discrete zzso One prevalent switching mechanism relies on the coexistence of two stable states zzso caused by positive feedback zzso zzso positive feedback is often supplemented with negative feedback, raising the question of whether and how these two types of feedback can cooperate to control discrete cellular zzso To address this issue, we formulate a zzso model of a zzso interaction network and analyze the dynamics of a zzso zzso zzso The appropriate combination of negative and positive feedback zzso can bring a zzso circuit close to the zzso zzso zzso sharply activated negative feedback can give rise to a zzso regime wherein two stable fixed points coexist and may collide zzso with two zzso zzso This specific type of zzso is found to allow for separate and flexible control of zzso and zzso events, for example zzso to combine fast and zzso zzso zzso to enable transient switching responses and zzso to display zzso zzso transition zzso Finally, we discuss the relevance of such zzso switching behavior, and the circuit zzso considered, to specific biological processes such as zzso zzso responses, zzso fate decisions and zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest an efficient mechanism by which positive and negative feedback zzso cooperate to drive the flexible and multifaceted switching behaviors arising in biological zzso
