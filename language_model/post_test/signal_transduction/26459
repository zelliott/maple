Heat shock protein zzso 72 is a molecular zzso which is zzso in response to a variety of stress situations and has a general zzso zzso Increased zzso levels were implicated in protection from acute zzso a hypothesis which was not tested in a transgenic mouse model zzso 

To analyze the role of zzso during acute zzso zzso transgenic animals zzso rat zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter were subjected to zzso and zzso acute zzso The severity of experimental zzso was determined via serum zzso levels, zzso evaluation and zzso of pancreatic zzso 

zzso mice displayed zzso zzso zzso but no changes in the remaining zzso zzso zzso signal was observed in pancreatic zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso In both models, elevated zzso did not protect from development of acute zzso and the zzso lung injury, but accelerated recovery from zzso tissue injury zzso zzso levels, zzso inflammation and necrosis 36 h after zzso zzso The observed protective function of zzso in zzso zzso is likely due to an attenuated zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the recovery from acute zzso and may represent a potential treatment zzso
