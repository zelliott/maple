Type I and II zzso zzso exert opposing effects on the progression of multiple zzso even though both zzso use the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso as a signaling zzso Here we report that zzso mice expressing a transgenic T cell zzso against zzso basic protein spontaneously develop experimental zzso zzso with dramatically increased zzso The heightened zzso to this zzso disease appears to be triggered by a reduced number as well as a functional impairment of the zzso zzso regulatory T cells in zzso zzso zzso transfer of zzso regulatory T cells into zzso hosts is sufficient to prevent the development of zzso zzso These results demonstrate an essential role of zzso in the maintenance of zzso zzso
