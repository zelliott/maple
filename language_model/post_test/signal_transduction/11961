In the present study, we have found that zzso zzso strongly influence zzso zzso inflammatory responses to diverse zzso including zzso particles like zzso and sterile zzso particles like zzso When zzso and zzso zzso mice are challenged with zzso zzso zzso are markedly impaired in their ability to zzso from blood into the zzso In contrast, in these animals, zzso can zzso in response to an zzso injection of the zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso recruitment upon inflammatory challenge requires stimulation by zzso through a zzso differentiation primary response gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial during the development of the immune system but depending upon the zzso it may be zzso at the time of the actual inflammatory zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso mice with a zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to restore zzso zzso In zzso this study provides insight into the role of gut zzso in influencing acute inflammation at sites outside the gastrointestinal zzso
