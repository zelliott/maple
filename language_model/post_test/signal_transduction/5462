zzso of zzso peptides zzso is a central defense mechanism used by zzso to combat zzso In zzso the synthesis of these peptides is a highly regulated process allowing their rapid release in the zzso upon contact with pathogens and the arrest of their production after pathogen zzso We observed that zzso genes have either a transient or sustained expression profile in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso Moreover, zzso genes containing zzso elements zzso in their zzso region zzso are subject to a zzso control affecting zzso stability, thereby contributing to their transient expression zzso zzso A1 zzso constitutes the zzso of this latter class of zzso zzso zzso bears in its zzso an ARE similar to class II zzso found in several short-lived zzso zzso In response to immune zzso cascade signaling activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso stabilized and subsequently submitted to zzso and zzso zzso by the ARE present in its zzso The functionality of zzso ARE relies on its ability to recruit zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we observed that zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Whereas early zzso is independent of zzso the later zzso phase depends on zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso We also report that in contrast to zzso its zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso cells and accumulates in zzso zzso distinct from processing bodies, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mechanism is markedly different in zzso and zzso
