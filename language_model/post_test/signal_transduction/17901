The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane has evolved considerably since its original zzso 30 years zzso zzso lipids do not form a homogeneous phase consisting of zzso zzso and cholesterol, but a mosaic of zzso with unique zzso zzso Among these zzso those containing zzso and cholesterol, referred to as membrane or zzso zzso have received much attention in the past few zzso zzso zzso have unique zzso properties that direct their zzso into zzso zzso floating in a zzso ocean of zzso These zzso are resistant to zzso zzso at 4 degrees C and are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso as small membrane patches that are tens of zzso in zzso Cellular and/or zzso proteins that interact with zzso zzso can use them as transport zzso on the cell zzso Thus, zzso act as molecular sorting machines capable of zzso the zzso zzso of signal zzso pathways within selected areas zzso of the plasma zzso In addition, zzso serve as a portal of entry for various pathogens and zzso such as human zzso virus 1 zzso In the case of zzso raft zzso mediate the lateral zzso and the zzso changes required for fusion of zzso with the host zzso zzso zzso are also preferential sites of formation for pathological forms of the prion protein zzso and of the zzso zzso associated with Alzheimer's zzso The possibility of modulating raft zzso using statins and synthetic zzso zzso offers new approaches for therapeutic interventions in zzso zzso
