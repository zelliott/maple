During zzso complex zzso events lead zzso cells to coalesce at the zzso and form the primitive gut tube and associated zzso While several genes have recently been implicated in zzso zzso we know little about the genes that regulate zzso zzso Here, we show that vascular zzso growth factor C zzso an zzso as well as a zzso factor, is unexpectedly involved in this process in zzso zzso zzso levels using zzso zzso zzso or through zzso of a soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso of zzso cells in the anterior zzso leading to the formation of a zzso gut tube and the zzso of the liver and pancreatic zzso Further analyses indicate that zzso is additionally required for the initial formation of the zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso as well as zzso in the zzso zzso These data argue for a requirement of zzso in the developing zzso and, more surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso in two distinct steps during zzso development, first during the initial differentiation of the zzso zzso and second in the zzso of the anterior zzso to the zzso
