The cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced in zzso zzso of breast zzso and zzso in a zzso feedback loop, which stimulates zzso cell growth in zzso and in zzso To define the molecular mechanism of zzso growth zzso a three-dimensional zzso model was developed that combines zzso breast zzso cells with immortalized human zzso zzso in collagen zzso By zzso zzso zzso induction with short interfering zzso and expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso it was determined that zzso cell zzso required zzso shedding of zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso growth signal was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso chains rather than the zzso of the core protein and required zzso growth factor 2 and zzso factor zzso This zzso zzso may provide an opportunity for the therapeutic disruption of zzso zzso
