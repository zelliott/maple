zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates a wide variety of cellular functions including proliferation and zzso zzso of class zzso zzso zzso has implicated zzso zzso in development of the early zzso and zzso zzso We have used embryonic stem zzso cells as an in zzso model to study the involvement of zzso zzso during early development and zzso Both pharmacological zzso and genetic manipulation of zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso signals, most likely via zzso protein zzso 1 zzso are required for proliferation of cells within developing zzso bodies zzso Surprisingly, the zzso potential of zzso cells was not blocked upon zzso zzso but rather zzso zzso with modest increases in expression of zzso marker zzso By contrast, zzso zzso progeny failed to generate terminally differentiated zzso zzso This zzso appeared to be due to a requirement for zzso zzso during the zzso phase of zzso cell zzso expansion, rather than as a result of effects on differentiation per zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for optimal generation of zzso and zzso zzso and their differentiation into mature zzso colony zzso These data demonstrate that zzso signals play important roles at different stages of zzso zzso
