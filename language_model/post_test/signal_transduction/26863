To study the application of the live cell imaging method to observe the whole process of zzso formation induced by zzso zzso in the blood system in order to clarify the origin of zzso and their zzso 

Blood samples (8 zzso were collected from the abdominal zzso of male zzso rats weighing 280 zzso zzso cells were obtained by density zzso zzso and induced by zzso and zzso The cells were cultured and divided into four groups: zzso phase contrast microscope zzso group, zzso group, zzso group and live cell imaging zzso zzso Images of the zzso group were captured by a digital microscopic imaging system and recorded zzso The zzso group was identified by zzso activity zzso after a zzso zzso zzso The zzso group was zzso after a zzso zzso zzso The zzso group was zzso and zzso observed for 35 zzso 

After zzso zzso zzso observations showed the formation of numerous zzso These cells displayed round, zzso zzso zzso or irregular zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that most zzso and zzso had zzso zzso observations showed many bone zzso zzso hollows and channels, in which many zzso with zzso activity were zzso Live cell imaging observations found that zzso zzso originating from peripheral blood were generated by fusion of zzso and zzso and zzso fusion of zzso and zzso occurred at the adherent stage of the zzso zzso observations showed that the cell form of zzso was complex and zzso 

zzso and zzso can induce differentiation and formation from zzso in rat peripheral blood into zzso zzso with bone zzso zzso The zzso were formed by various cell fusion processes at the adherent zzso The adherent property of zzso is important for their survival and zzso zzso have zzso and their zzso structure is zzso zzso involving not only zzso but zzso The zzso property of zzso giant cells formed by cell fusion may be a special biological behavior for their adaptation of functional needs and bone zzso zzso This experiment has further evidenced the theory of zzso zzso in the blood system and provided new experimental clues for clarifying the zzso and zzso properties of zzso
