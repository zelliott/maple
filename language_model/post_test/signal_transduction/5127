Clinical and laboratory investigations have provided evidence that ethanol suppresses normal lung zzso Our initial studies revealed that acute ethanol exposure results in transient suppression of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso as early as 3 h after initial zzso Focusing on mechanisms by which ethanol decreases zzso zzso zzso zzso we targeted the study on the focal zzso and zzso elements that are necessary for zzso zzso Ethanol inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso recruitment of zzso to the site of the zzso dampened the zzso of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso suggesting a loss in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our observations revealed that zzso induced zzso zzso which was increased by only 50% in ethanol exposed cells, compared to zzso in the absence of zzso This work is the first to show evidence of the cellular mechanisms involved in the zzso suppression of zzso zzso
