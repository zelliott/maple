The existence of cancer stem cells has long been zzso but was proven less than 20 years ago following the demonstration that only a small zzso of zzso cells from acute zzso leukemia patients were able to zzso the disease in zzso These cells were termed zzso stem cells since they exist at the zzso of a loose zzso possess extensive zzso and the ability to undergo limited differentiation into zzso zzso Acute zzso leukemia is a zzso condition at both the zzso and molecular level with a variety of distinct genetic zzso giving rise to the zzso Recent studies have highlighted that this zzso extends to the zzso stem cell, with this dynamic compartment evolving to overcome various selection pressures imposed upon it during disease zzso The result is a complex situation in which multiple pools of zzso stem cells may exist within individual patients which differ both zzso and zzso Since zzso stem cells are thought to be resistant to current zzso regimens and mediate disease zzso their study also has potentially profound clinical zzso Numerous studies have generated important recent advances in the field, including the identification of novel zzso stem zzso cell surface zzso and gene expression zzso These tools will no doubt prove invaluable for the rational design of targeted therapies in the zzso
