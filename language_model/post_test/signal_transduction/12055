zzso from the zzso growth factor zzso zzso have typically been considered to provide zzso activities in zzso cartilage, and accordingly have been suggested to have a zzso role in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine in zzso roles for zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso mice with zzso zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso were generated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to confirm zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso cartilage and zzso and to analyze zzso consequences of zzso loss on zzso cartilage zzso zzso expression of zzso cell zzso presence of zzso zzso and degradation of zzso cartilage zzso 

The zzso cartilage of zzso knockout zzso mice was dramatically and significantly thicker than normal zzso cartilage at 6 and 12 weeks of zzso zzso zzso cartilage contained a population of zzso in which zzso signaling was zzso and which were three to four times more zzso than normal zzso zzso zzso These cells expressed high levels of the master zzso regulatory factor zzso as well as high levels of putative zzso cell markers including superficial zone protein zzso growth and differentiation zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were also high for activated zzso and the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso zzso Anabolic effects of zzso zzso in zzso cartilage were followed by zzso events, including zzso degradation, as determined by zzso of zzso zzso fragments, and onset of zzso as determined by type zzso collagen zzso By 16 weeks of age, the zzso cartilage of zzso knees was no longer thickened and was zzso 

These results demonstrate unexpected anabolic effects of zzso signal zzso in zzso cartilage, and suggest the hypothesis that these effects may promote the expansion and/or activity of an zzso zzso cell population within the zzso zzso
