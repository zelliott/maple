G zzso receptors zzso traverse the plasma membrane seven times and produce zzso effects through interaction with G zzso Three classes of zzso bind and regulate the activity of zzso zzso antagonists, and inverse zzso To describe the activity of these zzso at zzso a two-state zzso model has been proposed in which receptors exist in an equilibrium between inactive zzso and active zzso zzso zzso zzso bind and stabilize the active zzso zzso This results in an enrichment of the proportion of active zzso producing an increase in zzso zzso In contrast, inverse zzso zzso bind and stabilize receptors in the inactive zzso zzso This results in an enrichment of the proportion of inactive zzso producing a reduction in spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso have equal preferences for both R and zzso states, lack any intrinsic activity, and are able to block actions produced by either zzso or inverse zzso zzso observations reported in two recent manuscripts by zzso et zzso and zzso et zzso indicate that some inverse zzso act not only in opposition to zzso by suppressing zzso zzso activity, but may also initiate unique signal zzso zzso as zzso Specifically, it is proposed that these unique zzso are able to enrich several distinct active zzso zzso each demonstrating a preference for regulation of a discrete zzso zzso This suggests that inverse zzso are not merely zzso opposite of zzso but instead may serve as useful tools to investigate zzso zzso of zzso
