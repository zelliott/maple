zzso regulation of signal zzso pathways is essential for normal development and is often disrupted in zzso zzso many regulatory mechanisms and feedback zzso have evolved to ensure appropriate zzso One mechanism previously suggested to zzso a range of signal zzso pathways involves the zzso and destruction of zzso receptors by the zzso trafficking zzso zzso a recent report has suggested that the zzso trafficking of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not act to zzso zzso activity, but rather is necessary for in zzso zzso Here, we examine this relationship to address the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that Dome is zzso through zzso zzso and a directed zzso screen identified several components of the zzso machinery as negative regulators of zzso zzso We demonstrate that Dome signals both from the plasma membrane and zzso zzso and show, using zzso experiments, that zzso components zzso regulate zzso zzso in zzso As such, disruption in zzso trafficking represents a potent negative regulator of the disease relevant zzso zzso zzso
