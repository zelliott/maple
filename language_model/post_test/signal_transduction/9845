To study the effect of zzso mature zzso on the zzso of zzso to explore the mechanism of pulmonary impairment in severe forms of zzso 

zzso mature zzso zzso zzso was administered to culture with human lung zzso cell line zzso After 24 hours, the zzso the concentration of calcium of the cells were zzso The zzso zzso structure was observed and zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso At the same time, after the zzso of zzso with zzso specific inhibitor zzso adding an appropriate amount of mature zzso of zzso to act on the cells for a period of time, then detection same zzso 

zzso mature zzso could induce the increase of zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso expression in zzso level, the activity of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso But after blocking the signal zzso of zzso zzso mature zzso reduced the increase degree of zzso zzso rate, the expression of zzso zzso the activity of zzso compared with the zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso mature zzso involves in the pathological processes of zzso zzso invasion and increase zzso in zzso by increase of zzso through signaling zzso of zzso
