Plant organisms possess a complex set of zzso mechanisms that are responsible for preventing zzso interactions with other living organisms in their natural environment or for reducing negative effects of such zzso They can be classified into two groups: early responses that occur immediately or shortly after contact with a zzso zzso usually in the proximity of the infection site, and late, usually zzso and zzso responses that take part in minimizing the long-term effects of the infection and in preventing further zzso Early responses are a mixture of distinct zzso zzso leading to quick zzso of zzso structural changes in components of the living cell, zzso of zzso pathways and synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso An important part of early responses are zzso zzso especially the synthesis of large amounts of zzso oxygen zzso
