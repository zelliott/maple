The zzso of zzso DNA, zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso I, II, and III, respectively, is rapidly and zzso zzso upon interruption of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We find that repression of zzso and zzso synthesis in zzso cells involves zzso of the cell integrity zzso zzso repression requires the upstream components of this pathway, including the zzso family of putative plasma membrane sensors and protein zzso C zzso but not the downstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These findings reveal a novel zzso zzso zzso that controls more than zzso of nuclear zzso It is proposed that the coordination of zzso and zzso synthesis with cell growth may be zzso in part, by monitoring the zzso pressure of the zzso
