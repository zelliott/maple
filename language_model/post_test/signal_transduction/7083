zzso zzso cells zzso are dental zzso cells and the genuine precursors of zzso zzso and dental zzso A previous study showed that the zzso factor zzso zzso less zzso 3) supports the zzso differentiation in zzso via a positive feedback loop with the bone zzso protein zzso zzso Until today, however, the control of this zzso zzso by additional signaling pathways remains zzso Previous studies also suggested that the zzso signaling zzso plays a role in the zzso differentiation of zzso In this study we showed that zzso zzso and the initiation of the zzso differentiation by zzso or zzso induced the zzso signaling zzso in zzso However, the induction of zzso impaired not only the zzso differentiation zzso activity and zzso zzso but also the expression of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso So, zzso signaling plays a regulatory role for the zzso differentiation of zzso In conclusion, results of our study suggest that the zzso pathway, which is activated during the zzso differentiation of zzso regulates the zzso directed differentiation of zzso via a negative zzso zzso
