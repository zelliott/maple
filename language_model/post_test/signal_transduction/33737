Although activated spinal zzso zzso contribute zzso to zzso pain, how nerve injury activates zzso remains zzso It has recently been proposed, on the basis of genetic approaches, that zzso zzso 4 zzso may be a key zzso for initiating zzso zzso following zzso spinal nerve zzso The present studies extend this idea zzso by showing that zzso is key for maintaining zzso pain following zzso nerve chronic zzso injury zzso zzso zzso pain was reversed by zzso delivered zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso Additionally, zzso zzso and zzso which we show here to be zzso zzso in zzso on both zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, suppressed zzso pain with complete reversal upon chronic zzso zzso analyses of spinal cords following chronic infusion revealed suppression of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso reversal of zzso zzso Together, these zzso data support the conclusion that zzso signaling through zzso is important not only for initiating zzso pain, as suggested zzso but also for maintaining established zzso zzso Furthermore, these studies suggest that the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso can each fully reverse established zzso pain upon zzso zzso This finding with zzso is of potential clinical zzso This is because zzso is an zzso that is inactive at the zzso selective receptors on zzso that produce zzso Thus, these data suggest that zzso zzso such as zzso may be useful clinically to suppress zzso zzso yet zzso zzso suppress zzso
