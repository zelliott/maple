zzso has become the most important issue in stem cell biology, but it is still a hypothetical notion that cannot be defined in a better way than the zzso surrounding stem zzso Using a zzso stem cell system as a model, we have analyzed the cellular and molecular requirements for differentiation of zzso stem zzso Our results demonstrate the multiple zzso within the stem cell compartment and thus suggests the complexity of zzso
