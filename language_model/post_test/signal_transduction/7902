zzso zzso signaling involves complex zzso events culminating in the stabilization of zzso which enters the nucleus and binds to zzso zzso factors to stimulate gene zzso zzso was identified as a genetic modifier of zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso and encodes a zzso domain protein that associates with the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified, but their roles in development and zzso signaling remain zzso In this study, we report that zzso of zzso expression in mice causes defects in zzso of both zzso and zzso derived zzso including brain, eyes, hair zzso and zzso However, no gross zzso was observed in embryonic zzso Using a zzso reporter, we found zzso signaling at most body sites to be reduced in the absence of zzso Taken together, our studies show for the first time that zzso deletion affects embryonic development of some but not all zzso zzso
