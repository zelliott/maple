zzso nutritional zzso zzso is known to predict risk of complex disorders like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many neurological disorders in the offspring and vitamin B12 is one such critical zzso Here we performed zzso followed by zzso zzso analysis to identify proteins that are zzso expressed in liver of zzso born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient diet zzso control zzso To further establish zzso we analyzed the effect of B12 rehabilitation at zzso on the protein levels and the zzso in zzso We identified 38 zzso expressed proteins that were enriched in pathways involved in the regulation of zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso Further, three zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient zzso We observed zzso differential expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the deficient zzso Interestingly, expression of 27 proteins that were zzso expressed was restored to the control levels after rehabilitation of female rats with vitamin B12 from zzso Our study thus provides the first evidence that maternal vitamin B12 zzso influences zzso and other zzso metabolism in zzso through regulation of zzso signaling zzso 

zzso vitamin B12 zzso has been shown to predict the onset of complex disorders like zzso type II diabetes zzso in the next generation during their zzso We have shown earlier that zzso born to female rats fed with vitamin B12 deficient diet were obese and developed high levels of other intermediate traits such as zzso cholesterol zzso that are related to the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular zzso In this piece of work using differential zzso approach we have identified the altered zzso processes in the liver of vitamin B12 deficient zzso We have also documented that the proteins involved in zzso zzso are zzso Further, differential expression of zzso and zzso was evidently documented as the master regulator for the zzso of zzso zzso acid and zzso metabolism during maternal vitamin B12 zzso
