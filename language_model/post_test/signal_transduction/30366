Recent advances toward understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cancer initiation and progression provide new insights into the therapeutic value of targeting tumor zzso by interfering with zzso signaling zzso The functional contribution of key zzso factors toward increased zzso characterizing zzso tumors and their therapeutic exploitation is considered in three major zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso With the realization that the success of the therapeutic efficacy of the various zzso approaches for the treatment of zzso tumors has yet to be proven zzso the challenge remains to select critical zzso pathways that can be targeted for an individual zzso Here we discuss the major mechanisms that support formation of zzso in zzso zzso and prostate tumors and the current results of targeting of specific zzso for therapeutic intervention against zzso zzso
