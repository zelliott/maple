zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso and plays an important role in cardiovascular zzso In this study, we delivered the AM gene locally into the heart, using a zzso technique to investigate the signaling mechanism zzso by AM in protection against zzso zzso induced by acute zzso After zzso gene delivery, highly efficient and specific expression of zzso green fluorescent zzso or zzso human AM was identified in the left zzso zzso of the AM gene 5 days before zzso attenuated zzso zzso identified by in zzso zzso zzso labeling and DNA zzso and the effect was blocked by the AM zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 to zzso AM gene transfer increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but reduced zzso and zzso activities in the zzso The effects of AM on zzso and zzso activities were blocked by zzso zzso and by zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in cultured zzso AM also attenuated zzso induced by zzso which was accompanied by increased zzso but reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were both blocked by zzso and lithium, whereas only zzso was inhibited by its inhibitor zzso The effects of AM on zzso and promoting cell viability were blocked by zzso but not by zzso active zzso lithium, or zzso These results indicate that AM protects against zzso zzso induced by zzso injury through the zzso signaling zzso
