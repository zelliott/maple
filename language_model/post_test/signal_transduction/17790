Previously, we demonstrated that the zzso releasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression through a zzso protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso et zzso 1999, J zzso zzso zzso However, the specific role of zzso zzso zzso binding regulatory proteins zzso that are coupled to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression has not been zzso In this report, we zzso embryonic zzso from transgenic mice containing double gene zzso zzso for zzso and zzso to demonstrate that zzso promoter zzso by zzso requires zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso gene zzso as assessed by a zzso reporter zzso zzso was induced in cells lacking zzso but was blocked in cells that did not express zzso zzso zzso promoter induction in zzso deficient cells was rescued by expression of wild type zzso but blocked by zzso of calcium signaling in zzso media or in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso deficient cells with zzso and zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by expression of zzso or expression of zzso A zzso resulted in zzso promoter zzso in zzso deficient zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso toxin blocked zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso induced the zzso promoter which was blocked by expression of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that calcium signaling zzso by zzso and zzso play critical roles in zzso zzso expression in zzso
