zzso zzso proteins zzso are a growing family of molecules zzso to zzso Whereas all 7 previously reported zzso zzso zzso are expressed by B cells, here we report a new zzso zzso that is expressed by zzso cells including natural killer zzso cells and zzso and zzso zzso T zzso zzso contains a novel zzso zzso motif and recruits zzso through a zzso zzso indicating a potential signaling function in zzso zzso In zzso zzso does not greatly influence zzso or zzso zzso zzso and has minimal impact on zzso zzso However, zzso expression among T zzso is greatly expanded in human zzso virus type 1 zzso individuals, and includes not only zzso and zzso zzso T cells but also populations of zzso T zzso Expansion of zzso zzso is not related to viral load, but is indicative of the zzso expansion of terminally differentiated zzso zzso populations in response to chronic zzso infection and may serve as an important marker for chronic immune zzso and for tracking the generation of zzso cells following immune zzso
