zzso therapy reduces vascular zzso and delays progression but may ultimately promote an aggressive zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to identify mechanisms responsible for zzso resistance to zzso zzso 

zzso stem cell zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with acquired resistance to zzso were developed from zzso zzso in nude mice treated with zzso zzso analyses were used to identify changes in tumor zzso and specific factors associated with zzso 

Mice with established parental zzso and zzso cells responded to zzso whereas zzso cell lines derived at the time of acquired resistance to zzso therapy were resistant to zzso and did not have zzso of survival compared with zzso zzso Gene expression profiling comparing zzso zzso cell lines to zzso controls showed an increase in genes associated with a zzso origin, cellular zzso and zzso zzso enrichment analysis showed that zzso tumors showed a highly significant correlation to published zzso gene zzso Mice bearing resistant tumors showed significantly greater zzso of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were also zzso in both zzso and zzso resistant cells which had higher invasion rates in zzso compared with their respective parental cell zzso 

Our studies identify multiple zzso factors associated with resistance and identify a zzso to zzso transition in tumors resistant to zzso zzso
