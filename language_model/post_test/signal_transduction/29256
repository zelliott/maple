The regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors at zzso is critical for synaptic function and zzso However, the molecular machinery that controls active transport of receptors into zzso is largely zzso We found that, in rat zzso the zzso of zzso receptors zzso into spines during synaptic plasticity requires a specific motor zzso which we identified as zzso zzso We found that zzso Va associates with zzso through its cargo binding zzso This interaction was enhanced by active, zzso zzso which is also transported by the motor zzso zzso Va zzso the zzso zzso of zzso receptors from the zzso zzso into zzso but it was not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Va was specifically required for long-term zzso but not for zzso synaptic zzso In zzso we identified the specific motor protein and zzso zzso that catalyze the directional transport of zzso into spines during zzso synaptic zzso
