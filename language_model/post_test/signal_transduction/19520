Stem cell research has been focused on niche signaling and zzso programming of stem zzso However, zzso programming of niche cells remains zzso We showed previously that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso regulation and functions in the niche cells to maintain zzso stem cells zzso in the zzso zzso To investigate the zzso programming of niche cells by zzso we screened zzso in the zzso and zzso group zzso and an zzso of zzso and zzso called zzso for their potential genetic interaction with zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso division in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a gene that regulates zzso expression in niche cells to maintain zzso zzso with this, zzso appears to be expressed in the niche cells and is not required in the zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso is restored in niche cells, which is likely responsible for zzso suppression of the zzso and zzso stem cell defects of zzso zzso These results reveal a novel zzso mechanism involving zzso and zzso that defines the fate and signaling function of niche cells in maintaining zzso
