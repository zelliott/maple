zzso high-fat zzso diet has long-term consequences on the zzso zzso of the zzso Here, we determined the effects of zzso exercise in offspring of rat zzso fed zzso diet during gestation and zzso zzso zzso rats were maintained on zzso or zzso diet throughout gestation and zzso All zzso were weaned onto zzso diet on zzso day zzso zzso At 4 zzso of age, male zzso were given free access to running wheels zzso or remained sedentary zzso for 3 zzso after which all rats remained zzso resulting in four groups: zzso zzso zzso and zzso Male zzso offspring gained more body weight by zzso compared with zzso zzso and maintained this weight difference through the entire zzso Three weeks of zzso exercise did not affect body weight gain in either zzso or zzso zzso but reduced zzso in zzso zzso Plasma zzso was decreased at the end of the zzso running period in zzso rats but was not different from zzso 9 zzso after the exercise period zzso At 14 zzso of age, zzso injection of zzso suppressed food intake in zzso zzso and zzso while it did not affect food intake in zzso zzso At death, zzso rats also had higher zzso zzso level in the zzso nucleus than zzso zzso Both maternal zzso diet and zzso exercise had effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in adult zzso Our data suggest that zzso exercise improves central zzso sensitivity and signaling in this zzso
