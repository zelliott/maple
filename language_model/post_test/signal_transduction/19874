zzso mice present with zzso effects observed in zzso syndrome patients however, the molecular mechanisms of zzso regulating zzso and tooth development are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mice reveal zzso zzso small cervical zzso and zzso labeling reveals a zzso in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice zzso are lacking normal cusp zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso with cell cycle zzso is up regulated in the dental zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression to allow for cell proliferation in the dental zzso cervical loop, however zzso does not directly regulate zzso zzso A new molecular mechanism has been identified where zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and decreases the expression of zzso target zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein is increased in zzso transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso reveal increased zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso double zzso mice present with an extra zzso tooth revealing a genetic interaction between these zzso The ability of zzso to repress zzso zzso of zzso may promote cell zzso In addition, zzso regulation of zzso reveals a new role for zzso in zzso cell zzso These data demonstrate new functional mechanisms for zzso in tooth zzso and provide a molecular basis for zzso defects in zzso syndrome zzso
