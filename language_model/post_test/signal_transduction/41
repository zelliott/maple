Although defense responses zzso by the plant zzso zzso acid zzso are often necessary for resistance against pathogens with zzso zzso in this report we demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso through zzso in zzso zzso is responsible for zzso to zzso disease caused by the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso Despite compromised zzso defense responses, the zzso perception zzso zzso insensitive 1 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso exhibited a high level of resistance to zzso disease caused by zzso zzso This response was independent from salicylic zzso defenses, as zzso plants showed similar disease resistance to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso made between zzso and zzso plants revealed that zzso resistance occurred primarily through the zzso rootstock zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso of zzso DNA during infection indicated that zzso resistance was not associated with reduced zzso penetration and colonization until a late stage of infection, when leaf necrosis was highly developed in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso leaves, zzso leaves showed no necrosis following the application of zzso zzso culture zzso and showed reduced expression of zzso genes during disease development, suggesting that zzso resistance is most likely achieved through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso development and plant zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso zzso hijacks zzso aspects of the zzso zzso to cause zzso symptoms that lead to plant death in zzso
