Type I zzso zzso zzso are key zzso of innate zzso zzso zzso of zzso signal zzso by dengue viruses zzso zzso zzso of immense global health importance, probably plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the zzso zzso zzso the molecular basis of zzso antagonism by zzso would therefore provide critical insight into disease zzso and new opportunities for development of zzso therapies and rationally attenuated zzso Here we examine the effects of expression of zzso zzso proteins on cellular zzso zzso We show that expression of zzso protein 5 zzso alone zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso is sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso zzso binds signal zzso and zzso of zzso 2 zzso and zzso its zzso zzso alone did not, however, induce degradation of zzso which occurs when all zzso proteins are expressed zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a potent and specific type I zzso zzso
