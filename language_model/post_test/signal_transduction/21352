zzso regulating cell behavior and zzso zzso composition in response to mechanical stimuli remain zzso Our previous studies have established that the zzso cascade plays a specific role in the zzso joint formation process by promoting the assembly of zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso for their zzso Here we zzso zzso novel zzso between zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways that is specific for mechanical stimuli and zzso a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso production by cells derived from the zzso surface of embryonic chick zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso blockade restricts zzso assembly of zzso zzso and reduces zzso as well as mechanical zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso increases but restricted sustained increases in zzso zzso at later times; zzso zzso at zzso 325 was found to parallel this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso had no zzso effect on the zzso zzso induced by zzso growth factor 2 or zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso zzso confirming both the specificity and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells at, or derived from, developing zzso joint zzso Unlike the zzso pathway, however, zzso zzso was not further zzso by mechanical stimulation in zzso Thus, zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso and downstream signaling in response to mechanical zzso These results suggest that zzso active zzso zzso serves an essential, zzso role in mechanically induced changes in zzso zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso that serve a key role in joint zzso
