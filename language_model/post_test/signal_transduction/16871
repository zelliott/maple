zzso zzso zzso is the proposed zzso for the cellular prion protein zzso ), which is thought to facilitate recovery following zzso Whether zzso expression is affected by stroke and how its zzso zzso recovery remain zzso Brain slices from patients that died of zzso stroke were collected for zzso zzso These findings were compared to results from cell cultures, mice with or without the zzso zzso and zzso Based on these findings, molecular and pharmacological interventions were administered to investigate the underlying mechanisms and to test the possibility for therapy in experimental stroke zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso brains from humans and zzso The increase in zzso expression in zzso was not zzso specific, as it was found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Likewise, this increase in zzso expression can be zzso by zzso zzso in primary cortical cultures zzso in zzso and appear to have resulted from the direct binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso promoted bone zzso derived cells zzso proliferation and migration in zzso and recruitment to the zzso brain in zzso and zzso its zzso facilitated neurological recovery in part by recruiting zzso to the zzso zzso Our results thus identified a novel mechanism by which zzso insults can trigger a zzso mechanism to facilitate zzso
