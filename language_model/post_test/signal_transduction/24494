In zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso display a wing vein gap zzso resembling that of zzso gain of function zzso The zzso protein may therefore act as a negative regulator of zzso but its activity on actual zzso zzso levels has not been zzso Here we show that zzso does regulate the level of zzso zzso in zzso upstream of zzso target genes and in different zzso zzso including a previously unknown role in leg joint zzso zzso of zzso was capable of blocking both the zzso activity of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso of zzso an zzso zzso binding zzso In addition, using the conditional zzso of the zzso zzso we show that loss of zzso activity is rapidly followed by an zzso of zzso zzso the immediate target of zzso signal zzso during wing vein zzso While zzso adult wing vein zzso are quite mild, only affecting the zzso tips of the zzso we show that the initial consequence of loss of zzso activity is more severe than previously zzso Using a zzso experiment we show that the zzso is zzso by feedback regulation illustrating how zzso networks can make development robust to zzso
