A major zzso for zzso exchange in plants involves zzso zzso the small pores that connect adjoining zzso This article considers the nature of zzso complexes zzso that pass through zzso and the pathways and mechanisms that guide them to the zzso zzso Recent zzso studies have identified proteins involved in the directional trafficking of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso studies have isolated novel host proteins that interact with viral movement zzso zzso these studies are yielding important clues in the search for components that compose the plant zzso zzso trafficking zzso Here, they are placed in the context of a functional model that links the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso trafficking of zzso
