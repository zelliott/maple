We determined whether selective zzso of components of the zzso zzso by different type I zzso zzso occurs in human zzso zzso that exhibit much higher sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso than of zzso Similar levels of zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor were induced in response to either zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and formation of the zzso gene factor 3 zzso complex occurred to a much higher degree in response to zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that differential zzso of distinct components of the zzso zzso by different type I zzso can zzso Furthermore, they strongly suggest that such selective zzso accounts for the occurrence of differences in the zzso properties of distinct type I zzso in certain cell zzso
