zzso migration zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso has been shown to play a role in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso cells and human zzso vein zzso cells, but other zzso including zzso and zzso failed to do zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso mediates zzso expression in response to zzso The effects of zzso were blocked by zzso III, but not by zzso indicating that zzso might enhance zzso production directly rather than via zzso zzso The synthetic zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso zzso zzso expression in response to zzso zzso the signal zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a nuclear factor zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas a zzso inhibitor zzso had little zzso These facts indicate that zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso is regulated by zzso zzso protein zzso pathways and zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was enhanced by zzso Furthermore, we examined the inflammatory response induced by zzso and zzso zzso injected into the mouse zzso As shown by zzso zzso an indicator of zzso zzso mice zzso were much less sensitive to either zzso or zzso zzso than zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso contributes to the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process in concert with zzso and zzso via zzso and zzso
