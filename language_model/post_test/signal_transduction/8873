Studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can either zzso or zzso colon zzso One hypothesis suggests that zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and a related hypothesis suggests that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso drugs zzso The present study examined these possibilities using in zzso and in zzso zzso While zzso expression of zzso D1 was observed in zzso and in zzso expression of zzso zzso was not different in colon or zzso zzso from zzso or zzso zzso mice or in human colon cancer cell lines with zzso in zzso and/or zzso No difference in the level of zzso zzso was found in colon from zzso or zzso zzso mice following treatment with zzso aspirin zzso zzso inhibited cell growth in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human colon cancer cell lines but expression of zzso zzso was not zzso in these cell lines in response to a broad concentration range of zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso and protein that was accompanied with increased expression of a known zzso zzso target zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso alpha was also increased in the human colon cancer cell lines by several zzso at the highest concentration zzso zzso from these studies provide additional evidence indicating that zzso zzso is not zzso by the zzso zzso Further, these studies suggest that increased zzso zzso and/or zzso alpha by zzso in human colon cancer cell lines could contribute to the mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso
