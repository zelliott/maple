zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso signaling and for zzso zzso Cell zzso is presumed to cause the zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso to the plasma membrane where the zzso interacts with its zzso zzso zzso Thus, a zzso and therefore zzso active zzso could help zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence of zzso containing the consensus sequence for zzso and zzso was fused to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso anchor directed zzso zzso to the membrane and led to zzso elevated zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulted in the continuous zzso of downstream zzso such as protein zzso B zzso also known as zzso which was recently shown to regulate zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was abolished by the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso was marginal in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso of the zzso factor zzso is required for the rapid assembly of the zzso zzso zzso upon stimulation with zzso of zzso zzso We show here that the expression of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso results in a zzso continuous zzso of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso to the site of its preferred zzso leads to zzso zzso enhanced zzso and is sufficient to regulate different signal zzso zzso
