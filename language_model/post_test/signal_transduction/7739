zzso zzso is governed by a zzso clock that generates zzso in expression of several zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Using a combination of pharmacological zzso and zzso zzso we show that zzso and zzso two zzso zzso represent functionally distinct signals within the zzso zzso Using high-resolution fluorescent in zzso zzso the zzso were divided into zzso based on eight distinct zzso patterns of zzso zzso for 140,000 zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was examined in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified areas within the zzso where the clock is set up in the zzso cells zzso where the clock starts running zzso and where the clocks of zzso cells are zzso zzso We find that the clocks of zzso cells are primed by zzso in a zzso zone in the zzso zzso and that zzso is required for cells to initiate zzso on zzso this zzso zzso of adjacent cells are synchronized and amplified by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as cell movement subsides and cells maintain stable zzso zzso
