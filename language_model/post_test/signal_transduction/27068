The zzso zzso has been shown to be expressed on activated zzso zzso has also been shown to be associated with signal zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated the expression of zzso on zzso at inflammatory zzso Whatever the disease, lung zzso obtained from the zzso zzso fluid or zzso zzso expressed significant levels of zzso whereas most peripheral blood zzso zzso did not express zzso Further, in zzso stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso expression on zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso expression on zzso is restricted to local inflammatory sites and zzso may be a useful marker for activated zzso at inflammatory zzso
