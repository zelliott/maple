This review considers various functional aspects of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Good evidence now exists that they are actively involved in numerous zzso zzso The zzso responsible for formation and zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit high sensitivity to various stimulating zzso This determines the content of individual cell zzso and therefore the mode of cell zzso Special attention is paid to preferential zzso of zzso in the rigid plasma membrane zzso zzso coupled to many signal zzso The suggestion is discussed that zzso signaling may be based on the modification of fine molecular interactions in zzso zzso resulting in its zzso inducing the signal zzso The review also highlights involvement of zzso in cell zzso zzso and in processes implicated to zzso
