zzso zzso zzso triggered cellular signaling processes often begin with the zzso of the cellular receptors such as zzso and zzso The sizes of these initial protein complexes or clusters are tens to 100 zzso in zzso therefore, engineered zzso could provide effective mimics of zzso for investigation and control of the initial and downstream specific signaling zzso This current topic discusses recent advances in zzso in the context of design and production of matching chemical functionality and geometry for control of specific cellular signaling zzso Two investigations are reported to demonstrate this zzso zzso how the presentation of zzso at the zzso scale would influence the zzso of zzso which would impact the formation of zzso complexes, leading to the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso or zzso of mast zzso zzso how the engineered zzso could guide the initial zzso zzso which would impact the formation of focal zzso and downstream cell signaling zzso leading to zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso to engineered zzso using synthetic zzso or zzso or zzso control at the zzso scale, zzso of designed geometry and chemical functionality provide new and effective zzso cues for regulation of cellular signaling processes and downstream zzso
