zzso and zzso impair wound healing, but the mechanism of this side effect has not been zzso The zzso zzso zzso is released from activated zzso and zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso Because it may play a role in wound healing, the authors studied the effects of local zzso on zzso signaling in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso G zzso zzso receptors were zzso clamped and studied in the presence or absence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso were zzso To determine the site of action of the local zzso on the signaling pathway, the authors studied 1) the effects of local zzso on signaling induced by zzso injection of the second zzso zzso and 2) the effects of local zzso on functioning of zzso expressed zzso II zzso signaling through the same pathways as the zzso zzso 

zzso signaling was inhibited in the presence of local zzso The half zzso zzso concentration zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Neither responses induced by zzso injection nor zzso signaling were influenced by local zzso 

zzso signaling is inhibited by the zzso application of zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso signaling was not affected by local zzso Therefore local zzso have a specific, zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso As the local zzso zzso used were similar to those observed after injection around surgical wounds, LP zzso may play a role in the observed zzso effects of local zzso on wound zzso
