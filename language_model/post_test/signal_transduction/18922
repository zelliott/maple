zzso drugs may induce cellular zzso in the zzso By using representatives of 5 different categories of zzso drugs, that is, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we investigated whether these zzso channel zzso or zzso affect cardiac zzso in cell zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with the drugs at varying zzso To determine the degree of zzso the percentage of zzso cells, zzso zzso potential zzso and activities of zzso were measured zzso At 24 h after administration, only zzso induced zzso in the zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso or higher decreased zzso and activated zzso within 3 h of administration, and it caused the appearance of zzso cells and zzso of zzso and -9 at 6 h or zzso Thus, zzso but none of the other zzso drugs tested, possesses a zzso effect, mainly via the zzso pathway, suggesting that this effect is distinct from the blocking action of zzso zzso and zzso channels or the zzso zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso in a zzso manner by zzso indicates the importance of monitoring the serum concentration in order to avoid its adverse zzso
