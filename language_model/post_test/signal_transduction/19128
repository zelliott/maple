Spinal zzso injury zzso results in progressive waves of secondary injuries, which via the zzso of a barrage of noxious pathological mechanisms exacerbate the injury to the spinal zzso Secondary injuries are associated with zzso zzso zzso excessive zzso release, zzso zzso and cell zzso This study was aimed at investigating the possible zzso effects of zzso zzso from zzso zzso by comparing an experimental zzso rat group with zzso control zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell death, including zzso zzso activity, and reduced zzso and zzso which occurs in areas of active cell death in the spinal cords of zzso zzso The zzso protective effect of zzso in zzso would therefore be zzso in the suppression of the acute secondary zzso cell zzso However, it does not zzso active zzso and zzso zzso This finding is supported by a lack of zzso changes in the areas of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso has been linked with zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and signal zzso and with zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso immediately after zzso significantly diminishes functional zzso The zzso group recovered zzso zzso more rapidly and a higher percentage of these rats regained responses compared with the zzso injured zzso The overall zzso functional improvement of zzso as measured by the zzso zzso and zzso scale, was significantly enhanced in the zzso group relative to the zzso control zzso Our data show that the therapeutic outcome of zzso probably results from its comprehensive effects of blocking zzso cell death, resulting in the protection of white matter, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Our finding that the administration of zzso prevents secondary pathological events in traumatic zzso and promotes recovery of motor functions in an animal model raises the issue of whether zzso could be used zzso in humans after zzso
