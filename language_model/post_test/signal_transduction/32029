Our earlier study has demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso extract of zzso has the bone sparing effect on the zzso zzso induced bone loss zzso In the present study, we have addressed the question whether treatment of osteoporosis benefits zzso zzso or vice versa, because both zzso and zzso originate from the same zzso cell of the bone zzso cell zzso zzso 

Bone zzso cells were isolated to study the effect of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso For in zzso effect zzso were fed high fat diet and the effect of zzso zzso studied on zzso plaque formation and zzso zzso 

zzso undergoing induced zzso or zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso show increase and decrease in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveal lineage dependent expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a progressive increase, whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso with same pattern of expression being for late zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso led to increase in zzso cells and zzso an important upstream zzso In zzso experiments in zzso after induction with high cholesterol diet zzso show improvement in zzso function by zzso zzso with lowering in total plasma cholesterol zzso zzso zzso led to vascular preservation of the zzso zzso with impairment of the zzso dependent relaxation which was zzso by zzso and zzso sections of the zzso region of the zzso 

From this data, it can be implied that zzso zzso controls bone loss, zzso and lowers zzso risk factor after zzso zzso
