A better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern zzso trafficking is of major relevance for the zzso Both normal and zzso zzso of zzso are a fine-tuned zzso event of migratory zzso likely regulated by molecular guidance cues underlying cell movements in other zzso We have recently reported that members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and one of its zzso zzso zzso can mediate in the traffic of chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and presumably of normal B cells between the blood and the zzso The importance of zzso interactions at the zzso interface during zzso could rely on their zzso zzso In the present work, we expand on those results by including additional insights and new suggestions for future studies that discuss the relevance of these molecules in overall cell zzso dynamic zzso
