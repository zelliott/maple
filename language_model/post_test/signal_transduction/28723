zzso regulatory systems, typically composed of a sensor zzso to detect a stimulus and a response regulator to execute a response, are widely used by zzso for signal zzso Response regulators exhibit a high degree of structural similarity and undergo analogous zzso zzso changes upon zzso The activity of particular response regulators can be increased by specific zzso acid zzso which either prolong the lifetime or mimic key features of the zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of response regulator zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso that activate 11 different response regulators were identified from the zzso To determine whether the activated zzso would be retained in the context of a different response regulator, we recreated 51 analogous zzso acid zzso at corresponding positions of zzso About zzso of the tested zzso completely or partially zzso zzso approximately zzso were zzso silent, and approximately zzso activated zzso Three previously zzso activated zzso zzso were zzso The zzso (and presumably zzso zzso resulted in resistance to zzso zzso The zzso substitution led to enhanced zzso and may increase the fraction of zzso zzso molecules that populate the activated zzso The locations of zzso zzso on the response regulator three-dimensional structure are generally consistent with current understanding of the zzso zzso The best candidates for potentially universal zzso zzso of response regulators identified in this study were zzso and zzso
