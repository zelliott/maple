zzso incubation temperature determines offspring sex in many zzso species, including zzso zzso zzso where zzso incubated at low temperatures during the initial stages of zzso formation develop as zzso while those kept at higher temperatures develop as zzso zzso at the zzso or zzso temperature zzso yields an even ratio of males and zzso This strong zzso to temperature indicates that each zzso of this species is competent to develop as a male or a zzso However, the mechanism that determines sexual fate at the zzso has not been zzso One possibility is that sexual fate is zzso at the zzso but coordinated by systemic signals within a single zzso If this is the case, zzso zzso separately to culture should not coordinate their zzso Here we show that zzso pairs from zzso incubated at the zzso share a strong predisposition for one sex or the other when cultured in isolation, indicating that they were affected by shared genetic signals, zzso zzso hormones or other transient influences received prior to the stage of zzso In zzso studies involving shifts from the zzso or zzso temperature to the zzso further indicate that zzso adopt a sexual differentiation trajectory many days prior to the onset of zzso differentiation into zzso or zzso and usually maintain this fate in the absence of an extreme temperature signal favoring the development of the other zzso Our findings therefore suggest that the outcome of sex determination in these zzso is heavily influenced zzso by an inherent predisposition at the zzso and zzso by the sexual differentiation trajectory established early in zzso development under zzso or zzso zzso
