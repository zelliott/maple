zzso acid zzso zzso an abundant constituent of serum, mediates multiple biological responses via G zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express the zzso receptors zzso zzso which, once zzso have the potential to signal through zzso to activate zzso and zzso zzso through zzso to activate zzso C, or through zzso to activate the zzso zzso We found that the addition of serum or zzso to zzso zzso cells rapidly (10 zzso induced the appearance of zzso stress fibers via a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to rescue zzso cells from zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased the expression of zzso protein zzso in zzso cells in a zzso manner but dependent on protein zzso zzso By means of pharmacological and zzso approaches, we found that the novel zzso protein zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso Thus, the multiple effects of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso survival, and zzso gene zzso appear to be zzso through the different G zzso pathways activated by the zzso zzso
