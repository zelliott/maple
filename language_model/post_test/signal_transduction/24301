We investigated the mode of zzso between zzso during zzso by monitoring the zzso of zzso zzso following microscopic zzso of half the zzso in single human zzso cells loaded with zzso Following partial zzso of cells, zzso zzso underwent a rapid zzso zzso 10 zzso The zzso was not inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso but was suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso such zzso occurred even after prior conversion of extended zzso zzso into individual zzso structures, indicating that zzso continuity is not required for communication between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso release from zzso zzso at a delayed but unpredictable time zzso (between 30 minutes and more than zzso zzso following zzso which was unaffected by zzso Once zzso zzso zzso release occurred within a 10 minute zzso zzso failed to reveal the recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso which suggests that zzso does not mediate the release of zzso c from zzso We conclude that signals zzso by zzso emanating from zzso zzso are processed by their zzso counterparts and comprise two temporally distinct zzso both independent of zzso amplification, which generate an initial rapid zzso and subsequent delayed release of zzso zzso
