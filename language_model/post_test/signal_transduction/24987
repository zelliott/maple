zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso in the zzso Recent studies suggest that the activity of several different neurotransmitter zzso can be rapidly regulated by a variety of zzso In the present study, we report that zzso of primary zzso zzso cultures with zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso nearly doubled the zzso for zzso zzso of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso also increased the net zzso of zzso zzso providing evidence that the increase in zzso of zzso was not related to an increase in zzso zzso and a subsequent increase in exchange of zzso zzso zzso for zzso radioactive zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and (1 zzso zzso acid did not mimic the effect of zzso with zzso and the zzso increase was not blocked by zzso zzso However, compounds known to interact with the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused variable increases in transport activity and attenuated the increase induced by zzso suggesting that the increase is related to the interaction of zzso with the zzso Several studies were attempted to define the mechanism of this zzso We found no evidence for increases in zzso synthesis or cell surface zzso zzso of signaling molecules known to regulate other neurotransmitter zzso had no effect on this zzso Using a variety of cultures, evidence is provided to suggest that this zzso zzso of zzso transport is specific for the zzso and zzso zzso and does not influence transport zzso by zzso These studies suggest that the interaction of zzso with some of the zzso of zzso zzso causes an increase in transport zzso zzso this phenomenon provides an zzso mechanism to increase the clearance of zzso during periods of prolonged zzso in zzso zzso
