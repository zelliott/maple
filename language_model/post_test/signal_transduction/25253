Certain zzso pharmacological agents and growth factors can stimulate pancreatic zzso zzso however, zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso have not been particularly well zzso As a model system we have zzso on characterizing the signal zzso pathways immediately downstream of the zzso and zzso receptors in zzso The original idea was to gain an idea of important elements in zzso signaling pathways which might then be exploited to generate a marked increase in zzso zzso Such an approach could eventually reveal a means to increase the number of human pancreatic zzso cells in zzso in order to obtain an abundant source of zzso for routine transplantation therapy of zzso zzso However, in the course of our studies, we have also unveiled an unexpected insight into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It has been observed that free fatty acids inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that a gradual zzso of zzso fat in zzso during obesity can eventually lead to an zzso of zzso mass expansion and hence failure to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance, so that zzso diabetes zzso
