In a previous publication we provided evidence of a novel zzso zzso for the control of zzso zzso by zzso The action of zzso appeared to be exerted through the zzso B2 zzso In this study we demonstrated that the zzso B2 zzso is densely localized in the zzso nucleus, median zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso area, regions known to be critical for the control of zzso zzso To determine the mechanism of action of zzso in stimulating zzso release, we used immortalized zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso from zzso cells appears to involve zzso of the zzso C signaling zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso calcium zzso Evidence to support this contention was derived from the observations that incubation of the zzso C zzso zzso with zzso blocked the ability of zzso to stimulate release from zzso zzso This effect was specific, as a zzso oxide zzso inhibitor and a zzso inhibitor were found to have no effect on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso oxide and zzso do not mediate zzso zzso zzso toxin also had no effect on zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso B2 zzso may be coupled to a zzso zzso G protein in zzso zzso With respect to calcium involvement in zzso action, zzso calcium indicator studies revealed that zzso can rapidly increase zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso A role for zzso zzso in zzso action was further suggested by the finding that an zzso calcium zzso zzso acid zzso zzso significantly attenuated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso calcium by zzso appears to be due to zzso of calcium from the zzso zzso as incubation of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso stores, significantly attenuated zzso action on zzso zzso zzso calcium may also be involved in zzso action, as the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso release, whereas the zzso zzso channel blocker, zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso Taken as a whole, these studies demonstrate that the zzso B2 zzso is densely localized in key zzso zzso responsible for regulation of zzso release, and that the mechanism of zzso stimulation of zzso zzso involves zzso of the zzso C signaling pathway, with a critical role implicated for calcium in zzso action in zzso zzso
