zzso is the most recently discovered but most ancient member of the zzso zzso In marked contrast to zzso zzso is highly expressed in embryonic zzso and in the zzso zzso layers of many zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso mouse dies at birth and lacks zzso zzso zzso breast and zzso zzso apparently zzso to the loss of stem cells required for these zzso zzso several dominant human syndromes involving limb development and/or zzso zzso have been mapped to zzso zzso and ultimately the gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso are distinct for each of the syndromes and are thought to act through both zzso and zzso mechanisms rather than a zzso zzso The zzso specificity of these syndromes offers unique molecular insights into the poorly understood actions of zzso in limb development, zzso interactions and stem cell zzso
