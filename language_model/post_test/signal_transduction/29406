The ability of an zzso to zzso to its environment is a key zzso in its global distribution and capacity to compete with other zzso The heat stress response, a highly zzso environmental and zzso program in zzso and zzso organisms, is an important component of the zzso response of zzso Previous studies have shown that heat shock zzso factors play an important role in zzso in plants and other organisms, controlling the expression of different heat shock proteins and detoxifying zzso In contrast, although several other zzso involving zzso salicylic acid zzso and zzso were recently shown to play a central role in zzso in plants, a key regulator of these responses was not zzso Here we report that the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bridging factor zzso is a key regulator of zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein accumulates rapidly and is localized to zzso during heat zzso zzso is required for zzso and functions upstream to zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 during heat zzso In contrast, zzso is not required for the expression of transcripts zzso zzso and different heat shock zzso Interestingly, zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is also zzso and zzso deficient in zzso are zzso Our results provide evidence for the existence of a tightly coordinated heat zzso network, involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso that is under the control of zzso
