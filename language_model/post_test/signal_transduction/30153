zzso and natural zzso receptors zzso are essential recognition structures that mediate zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso signaling is achieved through membrane association with signaling zzso The zzso that associate with zzso as zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs that activate zzso protein zzso zzso Human zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso which bears a zzso motif and activates the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso a short zzso zzso generated by zzso alternative zzso can associate with either zzso or zzso Here, we report that neither short human zzso alternative transcripts nor zzso association with zzso was detected in activated human zzso zzso Despite these results, zzso cell triggering by both zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced similar zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso triggering by zzso zzso did not lead to any zzso zzso zzso These data thus show that target recognition via zzso or zzso triggers all aspects of zzso zzso and pave the way for further dissection of the signaling pathways induced by zzso cell recognition of zzso and zzso
