The zzso zzso factor genes zzso and zzso were induced at hypoxic conditions in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not its related gene zzso was zzso regulated by zzso Treatment with 1 zzso zzso promoted zzso expression zzso This induction did not occur in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso expression positively regulated alcohol zzso zzso activity, which was analyzed as a marker zzso for zzso adaptation to hypoxic zzso The knock out lines zzso and zzso showed lowered zzso zzso the zzso lines zzso and zzso displayed elevated zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso resulted in higher induction of zzso activity than that observed with zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plants that were exposed to zzso zzso did not show enhanced zzso activity after treatment with zzso indicating that the zzso response with respect to zzso activity was saturated in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso lines displayed zzso zzso activity pointing to redundant zzso that can mediate zzso regulation of zzso activity in the zzso zzso Our data show that zzso regulates zzso adaptation to low oxygen stress in the zzso root through zzso zzso
