zzso of zzso budding zzso onto zzso zzso media stimulates a zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells include a specific pattern of gene zzso zzso cell shape, polar budding pattern, persistent attachment to the mother cell, and a distinct cell cycle characterized by cell size control at zzso Although a requirement for zzso signaling in zzso gene expression is well established, the role of this zzso in the regulation of zzso and the cell cycle remains zzso We find that zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso a cell cycle shift to zzso zzso with other changes characteristic of zzso zzso These effects are zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In turn, zzso deficient for zzso or carrying zzso an zzso of zzso defective for zzso functions, display enhanced zzso differentiation and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso of zzso is not required for the zzso zzso to affect the zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso or deficient for zzso exhibit zzso zzso growth and are further induced by an zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso promotes zzso growth by a novel mechanism that zzso zzso zzso complexes and thereby zzso cell shape, budding pattern, and zzso zzso
