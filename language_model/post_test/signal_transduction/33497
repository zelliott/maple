zzso is a zzso protein with both zzso and zzso regulatory activities in the zzso zzso We have identified a novel interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our results also suggest that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso This conclusion is based on the following zzso 1) zzso and the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso interact in a bacterial zzso system and in a zzso pull-down zzso 2) zzso of the zzso zzso also zzso zzso from human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso was detected in cultured zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso 4) a putative zzso binding motif is located at zzso 233 to 240 of the zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso of the third zzso zzso zzso which does not bind zzso does not contain this zzso and 5) zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells selectively increased zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
