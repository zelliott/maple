zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role in the zzso of several human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the zzso zzso that can bind zzso zzso We zzso that zzso plays an important role in zzso cancer zzso 

To test this hypothesis, zzso and genetic pathways involved in the zzso gene zzso and expression of zzso genes were analyzed in 4 zzso tumor cell lines and 54 zzso tumor and matched normal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was significantly enhanced after zzso treatment in zzso tumor cell zzso zzso promoter zzso level was significantly higher and zzso zzso expression was significantly lower in zzso tumor samples than in zzso zzso zzso In the total zzso tumor and zzso zzso samples, an inverse correlation was found between promoter zzso and zzso zzso transcript zzso However, zzso at zzso zzso close to the zzso gene zzso was a rare event zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was significantly more frequent in zzso tumor than in zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso In addition, known targets of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, such as zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso tumor compared with zzso zzso and this zzso was associated with reduced zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso small interfering zzso into zzso tumor cells expressing zzso zzso transcripts had increased levels of zzso and zzso D1 and accelerated cell zzso 

This is the first report showing that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is a frequent event in zzso tumor and may contribute to zzso of zzso cancer through zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The present study zzso novel pathways that are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
