Mice carrying a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene show a dramatic reduction in body zzso Growth hormone signaling zzso by the zzso zzso factors is zzso We show that zzso proteins physically interact with zzso and zzso is present in zzso on zzso zzso and ALS regulatory zzso Interestingly, mice with a zzso zzso but an zzso ability to interact with zzso zzso have a normal body size and normal levels of zzso zzso These findings strongly support the model in which zzso acts as a zzso for zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation and reveal an essential role of zzso zzso in the control of body zzso
