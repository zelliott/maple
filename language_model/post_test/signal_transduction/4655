zzso acid zzso is a zzso zzso zzso germ cells zzso in the developing zzso are exposed to zzso resulting in entry into zzso In contrast, zzso in the developing zzso enter zzso arrest to differentiate into zzso zzso cells express zzso an zzso zzso providing a simple explanation for why zzso zzso do not initiate zzso However, regulation of entry into zzso arrest is likely more zzso To investigate the mechanisms that regulate male germ cell zzso we cultured zzso and zzso germ cells at zzso and zzso days zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso initiation zzso was suppressed in all zzso However, expression of zzso a zzso zzso during zzso was elevated but only in zzso zzso germ zzso This suggests that zzso zzso signaling is not sufficient for male germ cell differentiation but that the male zzso environment also contributes to this zzso To define the influence of zzso cells on male germ cell zzso zzso cells at zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso After culture, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells increased zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, these zzso established zzso zzso imprints of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with zzso cells at late embryonic ages did not commit to the male zzso These findings suggest that male germ cell differentiation is induced both by zzso of zzso signaling and by zzso production by embryonic zzso zzso zzso
