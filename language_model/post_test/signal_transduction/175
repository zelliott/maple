Adult human bone zzso zzso cells zzso containing or consisting of zzso stem cells zzso are an important source in tissue zzso and zzso Although many processes involved in their differentiation into diverse lineages have been zzso substantial inroads remain to be gained to zzso a complete regulatory zzso The present study suggests that structural zzso of zzso collagen I, the major organic zzso component in musculoskeletal zzso plays, along with differentiation zzso a decisive role in the selection of differentiation zzso It introduces a novel concept which proposes that structural transition of collagen I zzso regulates cell differentiation through distinct signaling pathways specific for the structural state of the zzso Thus, on native collagen I zzso inefficient zzso is zzso whereas on its zzso counterpart, an efficient zzso is primarily regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation occurs efficiently on native, but not on zzso collagen I zzso with a low zzso threshold on the former and a substantially higher one on the zzso zzso on collagen I zzso in both structural zzso is fully dependent on zzso However, whereas on native collagen I zzso zzso differentiation is zzso on zzso collagen I zzso it is zzso The zzso zzso regulation appears to be one of the mechanisms determining differentiation lineage of zzso It allows a novel interpretation of the bone zzso cycle, explains the marked zzso zzso zzso shift in musculoskeletal zzso and can be a principal contributor to zzso shift seen in a number of clinical zzso
