zzso and inflammatory death zzso expressed within zzso tissue could potentially target zzso to transformed zzso To develop approaches that accentuate the zzso potential of the inflammatory response, the zzso zzso zzso library was screened for compounds that zzso zzso in a strictly zzso zzso We identified a number of novel compounds with this activity, the most active of these, zzso and zzso zzso colon cancer cells to zzso at zzso zzso and 2 zzso respectively, without inducing zzso on their zzso The activity of these compounds was zzso and general, as they zzso cell death by zzso or zzso zzso in multiple colon cancer cell zzso Both zzso and zzso arrested cells in zzso with live cell imaging indicating that zzso arrested cells were the source of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with little effect on zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponded to an increased expression of zzso on the cell zzso To determine the general interplay between zzso arrest and zzso sensitivity, Aurora zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to sensitize cells to zzso zzso zzso was particularly effective and influenced zzso surface presentation and zzso zzso like zzso even though it arrested zzso at an earlier zzso We propose that zzso and zzso represent a new class of zzso inhibitor and that selected zzso zzso may be useful for treating colon zzso or earlier zzso that have a high level of inflammatory cell zzso
