The role of zzso zzso as a second zzso in signal zzso has been well established in many cell zzso However, conflicting reports have led to a controversy regarding the role, if any, of zzso zzso zzso in skeletal zzso Indeed, expression of the zzso zzso zzso has not previously been demonstrated in skeletal zzso In the present study we used in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding to demonstrate that rat skeletal muscle zzso contain zzso zzso zzso zzso protection and partial sequencing suggested that the zzso zzso receptors expressed in skeletal muscle was most similar to the zzso form of the type 1 zzso zzso zzso While in zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso in all types of skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and specific zzso zzso binding sites were zzso expressed in slow zzso zzso I) and fast zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in fast zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that an zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso of skeletal zzso
