Cell migration is the hallmark of cancer regulating zzso independent growth and zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is shown to regulate this zzso In the present report, we demonstrated, supplementation of zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso from human zzso zzso enhanced migration potential of highly invasive melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the cell surface zzso and was shown to interact and zzso with zzso zzso a regulatory zzso of cell zzso In zzso treated cells, the zzso of nuclear factor inducing zzso zzso and zzso was observed, followed by nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso along with its zzso and zzso resulting in zzso of zzso expression and finally zzso zzso To substantiate our findings, prior to zzso treatment, the expression of zzso was reduced by small interfering zzso zzso zzso and confirmed the zzso of nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the use of zzso an zzso drug, or zzso the blocking zzso along with zzso zzso inhibited such zzso pathway, confirming that zzso cell migration is zzso zzso and downstream signaling by zzso Finally, we translated the in zzso data in mice model and observed enhanced tumor growth with higher zzso expression and zzso zzso in the tumors upon injection of zzso treated melanoma zzso The treatment of zzso the zzso drug along with zzso inhibited the migration, expression of zzso and zzso of zzso and finally tumor growth supports the involvement of zzso in tumor zzso
