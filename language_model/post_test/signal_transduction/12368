zzso zzso has been reported to disrupt zzso class II zzso zzso presentation by a dual strategy that comprises a reduction in cell surface levels of zzso mature zzso molecules and a zzso of immature zzso zzso We show that zzso achieves relocation of zzso away from the cell surface in zzso cells by both delaying its transport to the cell surface and by accelerating zzso removal of cell surface zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso but zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules traverse the early zzso system and zzso with zzso cargo before reaching zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso activity and zzso function, whereas zzso trafficking of zzso zzso molecules requires zzso zzso We further show that a similar zzso can remove zzso complexes from the surface of zzso cells not expressing zzso Our data suggest that zzso uses mechanisms involved in normal zzso recycling and turnover to mediate the delivery of cell surface zzso to a zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso provides a novel perspective on the regulation of normal zzso zzso
