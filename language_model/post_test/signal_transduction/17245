Full length zzso is a potent immune zzso zzso zzso upon the actions of several immune zzso zzso zzso burst has been shown to decrease in response to zzso and we speculated that it could have other effects on zzso zzso Here we report that zzso reduces the zzso ability of human zzso decreasing significantly the zzso of zzso zzso coli by these cells in whole blood zzso and as isolated zzso zzso We then determined the mechanisms zzso We observed that the zzso of zzso the zzso engaged in zzso zzso was decreased by zzso in response to zzso coli zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso with zzso prior to incubation with zzso coli significantly inhibited zzso through the zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso with a parallel reduction of zzso zzso Studies with pharmacological zzso showed that zzso of zzso but not zzso 1/2 zzso was able to prevent the zzso of zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso zzso affects zzso zzso reducing the zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso the latter by blockade of the zzso signal zzso
