The zzso signaling pathways responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso were studied in mouse zzso zzso with the zzso clamp zzso zzso zzso to 100 zzso activated a zzso current that showed a zzso zzso a linear zzso relationship in symmetrical zzso solutions, an zzso selectivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso by a zzso specific inhibitor zzso 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso these properties matching those of zzso zzso zzso The potency order of zzso for an zzso of the zzso current was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whereas zzso acid zzso 100 zzso another zzso zzso zzso induced little zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso was sensitive to protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso failed to activate the zzso current when the cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso without zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the current zzso zzso was persistently activated with a mixture of zzso + zzso in the zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso reaction in the current zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso is due to the zzso of zzso zzso channels through zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso in mouse zzso
