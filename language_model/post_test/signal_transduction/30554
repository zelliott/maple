zzso a zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso is induced in systemic inflammatory response syndrome, but its zzso function in zzso is zzso Our aim was to determine the roles of zzso in zzso tissue damage in zzso and in zzso We examined serum levels of zzso in zzso patients and healthy volunteers, determined the in zzso effects of zzso on lung zzso cells, liver cells, and zzso and analyzed the tissue expression of zzso and its receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer of mouse zzso zzso zzso DNA was used to determine the effects of zzso depletion in preventing zzso zzso tissue damage in zzso We found that serum levels of zzso were higher in patients than in healthy volunteers zzso zzso 28, P zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in lung zzso cells and zzso oxygen species production in liver cells in zzso zzso also promoted zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and induced the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in lung zzso zzso In zzso mice, transcripts of zzso and its receptors were zzso in heart, zzso liver, and kidney zzso zzso zzso in lung and liver zzso and serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were lower in mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso DNA before zzso treatment compared with control zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in lung and liver tissue injury in zzso zzso zzso
