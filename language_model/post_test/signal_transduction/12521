Complete zzso of E protein zzso factors by zzso blocks the zzso transition of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the underlying mechanisms, we observed that zzso levels of zzso as well as zzso were dramatically elevated in zzso zzso which could result in zzso arrest by attenuating zzso zzso In support of this hypothesis, we found that zzso zzso enabled zzso zzso to differentiate to the zzso zzso zzso stage, which was accompanied by enhanced zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso drove the differentiation of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso levels zzso whereas zzso levels increased in zzso transgenic zzso When zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso commitment may be controlled by the interplay among E zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulators, which influence zzso function through the expression of zzso
