zzso injection of zzso growth factor zzso into mice resulted in the zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso with the time course of nuclear membrane zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso in mice liver zzso was attributed to a 120 zzso protein zzso This 120 zzso protein was zzso with the zzso specific zzso zzso and was found to be sensitive to a zzso specific blocking zzso The zzso sequence analysis revealed that the 120 zzso protein contains the zzso sequence at its zzso end and the zzso sequence at its zzso end, which reveals that this protein is a major zzso of zzso devoid of an zzso acid portion at the zzso zzso The zzso 120 zzso protein interacts with activated zzso binds zzso zzso zzso enhances nuclear zzso zzso activity, and generates zzso zzso in response to the zzso signal to the nucleus in zzso The zzso 120 zzso protein zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso These results establish the capacity of zzso nuclear signaling which is zzso by zzso itself, located on the inner nuclear zzso This is the first report identifying a 120 zzso zzso zzso generated in zzso in the nucleus and capable of discharging the function of nuclear zzso
