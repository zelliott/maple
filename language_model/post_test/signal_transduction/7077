To investigate the molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell resistance to zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and explore a feasible therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance in patients with pancreatic zzso 

Western zzso was conducted to find out whether zzso induced zzso feedback zzso and to identify whether zzso in combination with zzso inhibitor zzso could effectively block the feedback zzso of zzso and downstream zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso and colony formation were used to detect the effect of the combination treatment on cell growth and zzso finally, the effect on mouse subcutaneous zzso was examined to confirm the efficacy of the combination treatment in zzso 

zzso effectively inhibited the expressions of zzso and its downstream zzso and induced the feedback zzso of zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso inhibitor zzso eliminated zzso zzso of zzso zzso and reversed pancreatic cancer cell resistance to zzso compared with the zzso alone, zzso had a zzso zzso effect with zzso And the tumor growth zzso effect of the combination was also proved in mouse subcutaneous zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso feedback zzso contributes to pancreatic cancer cell resistance to zzso zzso of zzso may improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso in patients with pancreatic zzso
