Like other members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso lacks intrinsic signaling capacity and zzso signals by recruiting zzso zzso The zzso associated death domain protein interacts with the zzso zzso zzso domain and recruits the zzso death domain protein (which directly activates the zzso zzso the protein zzso zzso interacting zzso and zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso has previously been demonstrated to activate both zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, which in turn stimulates zzso factor zzso protein 1 zzso mainly via zzso of the zzso zzso We have investigated the signaling properties of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso that mediates zzso zzso zzso was found to be unable to activate zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was not required for zzso zzso by zzso thus representing the first zzso complex component to dissect the zzso and the zzso zzso Despite being unable to activate zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso strongly activated zzso and was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso links zzso to a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso
