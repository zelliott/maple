We review the physical properties of zzso zzso zzso that determine both its specific interactions with protein zzso of known structure and its zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Several investigators have zzso the existence of distinct pools of zzso within the cell to account for the myriad functions of this zzso Recent experimental work indicates certain regions of the plasma zzso zzso and nascent zzso indeed concentrate zzso We consider two mechanisms that could account for this zzso local synthesis and zzso zzso We conclude by considering the hypothesis that proteins such as zzso bind a significant fraction of the zzso in a cell, helping to zzso it in lateral membrane zzso then release this zzso in response to local signals such as an increased concentration of zzso or zzso of protein zzso zzso
