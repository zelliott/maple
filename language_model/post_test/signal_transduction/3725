zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso and expression of zzso type I zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study showed that zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso To examine the mechanism of zzso action in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso currents were measured in acutely zzso rat zzso In about zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso which was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the blocker of zzso zzso channels, zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso increase was zzso by zzso of protein zzso A zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and was reduced by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso caused inward currents with a reversal potential of zzso zzso and facilitated zzso zzso zzso It further revealed that zzso inward currents were zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso and that zzso of zzso facilitated zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso entry mechanisms of rat zzso by zzso of zzso zzso channels via zzso and zzso of zzso zzso channels via zzso
