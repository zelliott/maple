zzso zzso is a zzso growth and differentiation factor that belongs to the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso has been well characterized as a regulator of zzso and has been shown to play a critical role in zzso muscle zzso zzso we report for the first time that zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso of zzso and human skin and that zzso mice exhibited delayed skin wound healing attributable to a combination of effects resulting from delayed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso reduced zzso migration and protracted zzso proliferation were observed, which subsequently led to delayed recovery of zzso thickness and slower zzso Furthermore, primary zzso derived from zzso mice displayed reduced migration capacity and increased proliferation rate as assessed through in zzso migration and zzso zzso as well as zzso incorporation and Western zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso both zzso transformation and collagen deposition were zzso reduced, resulting in a delayed zzso wound zzso These decreases are due to the zzso of zzso zzso In agreement, the expression of zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso moreover, topical treatment with zzso protein rescued the impaired skin wound healing observed in zzso zzso These observations highlight the interplay between zzso and zzso signaling zzso specifically through zzso regulation of zzso levels during the skin wound healing zzso Thus we propose that zzso zzso might be beneficial for skin wound zzso
