Little is known about the signal zzso mechanisms involved in the response to zzso and other zzso factors in zzso beyond the zzso of the zzso zzso activity of the zzso receptors belonging to the zzso zzso We have previously shown that the introduction of the zzso product zzso zzso into the zzso of chick embryonic zzso can reproduce the survival and zzso promoting effects of the zzso nerve growth factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso and of zzso zzso factor zzso To assess the potential zzso role of zzso zzso zzso we introduced zzso zzso zzso or their zzso fragments into cultured chick embryonic zzso The zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced to below control levels, and the zzso survival of E9 zzso root zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in a specific and zzso zzso Both effects could be reversed by zzso the zzso sites with biologically inactive zzso zzso before zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso did not promote the survival of zzso zzso chick sympathetic zzso and the zzso survival in these cells was not inhibited by the zzso The survival effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso could not be blocked by zzso zzso zzso These results indicate an involvement of zzso zzso in the signal zzso of zzso factors in zzso but not sympathetic or zzso zzso pointing to the existence of different signaling pathways not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso
