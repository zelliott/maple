zzso are zzso growth and differentiation factors which signal through a zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso A reveals zzso species of approximately 50 and 75 zzso known as the type I and type II zzso zzso zzso cloning has yielded genes zzso two type II receptors zzso and zzso and at least two type I receptors zzso and zzso These receptors are members of a larger family of zzso zzso zzso which includes receptors for transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso bone zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso zzso I and II form a stable complex after zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso I by zzso zzso We have begun to identify zzso targets of these molecules by using the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso as zzso in the zzso system, a cloning strategy designed to detect interacting proteins in zzso
