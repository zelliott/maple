zzso zzso T cells zzso found in mouse skin are zzso zzso T cells involved in immune surveillance and wound zzso It is assumed that the interaction of an zzso zzso on zzso and an zzso class zzso zzso zzso on zzso activates zzso which then zzso zzso promoting wound zzso However, direct evidence that zzso zzso through zzso signaling promotes wound repair is not zzso In the present study, we generated zzso for an zzso zzso zzso previously suggested to be expressed specifically on skin zzso Local administration of zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and significantly delayed wound zzso Likewise, administration of zzso zzso impaired wound repair to a similar zzso The delay in wound closure resulting from the blockade of the zzso zzso was comparable to that observed in zzso T zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso interactions play a critical role in wound zzso zzso of binding affinities showed that zzso zzso bind to zzso with affinity zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso comparable to those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso is transcribed not only in skin but also in zzso such as tongue and female zzso tract known to contain zzso zzso T cells expressing zzso zzso suggesting a more general role for zzso in the maintenance of zzso zzso
