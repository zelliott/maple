In zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is zzso zzso by an zzso retention zzso Here, we analyze the roles of three zzso trafficking motifs zzso zzso and zzso providing molecular links between insulin zzso cellular trafficking machinery, and the motifs in the specialized trafficking of zzso Our results support a zzso retention model that involves two linked zzso zzso one between zzso and a retention zzso and the other between zzso and specialized zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso to the former is dependent on the zzso motif and its targeting to the latter is dependent on the zzso zzso These two motifs act independently in zzso with the zzso step being under the control of signaling downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso although positively correlated with the degree of zzso zzso does not completely account for zzso retention or zzso zzso of the zzso motif slows return to zzso zzso retention after insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso causes a delay in the return to zzso retention after insulin zzso The effects of mutating the zzso motif and zzso of zzso were not zzso establishing that zzso regulation of zzso trafficking requires the zzso zzso
