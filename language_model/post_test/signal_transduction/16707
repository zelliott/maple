zzso germ cells comprise a privileged cellular class within the zzso charged with the elite task of maintaining species zzso While in lower organisms zzso fate is determined by the allocation of germ zzso zzso zzso differentiation requires zzso signals that zzso upon the zzso zzso Studies using zzso mice or zzso zzso have identified some of the factors controlling primordial zzso zzso such as members of the zzso family, but considerable gaps still exist in our understanding of the complete signaling zzso Comprehensive investigations of zzso zzso zzso have been hampered by the zzso of this cell population in the early zzso Recently, however, several labs including our own have derived primordial germ cells from embryonic stem cells in zzso thus providing a powerful new technique for the study of germ zzso In this review the different methods used for the in zzso generation of germ cells and how these techniques may be improved and applied to further advance our knowledge of zzso biology are zzso
