Mechanical zzso has been shown to zzso a wide variety of changes in second message signals and patterns of gene expression in zzso zzso chick zzso were subjected to a dynamic zzso uniform zzso strain zzso applied zzso at zzso zzso for a single zzso period, and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reached a zzso zzso increase 9 h after the end of the mechanical zzso that was not inhibited by zzso thus demonstrating that zzso of zzso expression is a primary response through the zzso of pre-existing zzso zzso The signal zzso zzso which zzso the increased expression of zzso in response to mechanical zzso were shown to be dependent on the zzso of a zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso or a zzso zzso Selective zzso of protein zzso C zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso even though zzso has been demonstrated to be an early response gene to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso integrity since zzso blocked the zzso of the zzso zzso however, zzso disruption had no effect on the zzso induction of the zzso The zzso component of the zzso was not related to the mechanism of signal zzso involved in controlling zzso expression in response to mechanical stimulation since zzso did not block zzso zzso Mechanical stimulus was shown to activate focal zzso zzso zzso which specifically became associated with the zzso after mechanical zzso and its association with the zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the signal zzso zzso for mechanical zzso of zzso is uniquely dependent on the structural integrity of the zzso component of the zzso In contrast, the zzso pathway, which also activates this gene in zzso acts independently of the zzso in the zzso of its zzso
