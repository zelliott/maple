The zzso modification of proteins by lipids is a key mechanism in the regulation of protein zzso and zzso zzso is a process critical for the membrane association of a plethora of zzso proteins with fundamental roles in cell biology, including G proteins and nuclear zzso zzso is irreversible but is frequently associated to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso that act like switches that zzso the dynamics of zzso or zzso interactions and target the modified proteins to specific membrane zzso The severe zzso of animals deficient in the zzso involved in zzso and zzso processing highlights the significance of these zzso Moreover, zzso in the genes involved in the maturation of zzso proteins have been found at the basis of some severe human diseases, like zzso or the premature zzso zzso zzso Given their critical role in the transformation potential of the Ras zzso zzso and zzso processing are targets for the development of zzso with zzso zzso The recent generation of animal models genetically engineered to target the zzso involved in zzso and associated modifications has unveiled zzso aspects of these zzso Moreover, these models are proving of crucial importance for the zzso of the mechanisms of disease, and the identification and validation of therapeutic zzso This review attempts to zzso general aspects of the zzso modification of proteins by zzso paying special attention to the zzso obtained from the use of genetically engineered animals and the avenues that these models zzso
