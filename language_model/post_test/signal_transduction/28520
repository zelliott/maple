zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso encounters zzso stress during zzso by the zzso and following zzso zzso during an acquired immune response, and also from internally generated sources of radical oxygen zzso through zzso zzso We have identified the zzso zzso a sensor in 1 of the 11 complete pairs of zzso signal zzso systems in zzso zzso as a possible zzso of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is known to sense zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso system was the top scoring hit in a zzso search with the zzso coli zzso global control system of zzso zzso Using structural zzso techniques we have determined that zzso contains a zzso domain found in a variety of zzso and zzso sensors of oxygen and zzso zzso with zzso of zzso or of the accompanying zzso regulator zzso were constructed and found to have reduced zzso in a mouse model of tuberculosis infection, the zzso bacteria zzso for up to 4 months zzso zzso zzso had regained zzso confirming that it was zzso of this zzso system that were responsible for the zzso zzso This work identifies the zzso domain as a possible drug target for tuberculosis and zzso in the zzso signal zzso system as potentially useful components of live vaccine zzso
