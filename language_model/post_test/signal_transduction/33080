zzso which belongs to the zzso family of proteins composed of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso has a putative role in zzso However, the downstream events of zzso signaling remain zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso zzso is moderately activated by zzso in both zzso zzso cells and chicken zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso or zzso activated zzso in human zzso kidney cells, zzso zzso of a zzso zzso exchange protein zzso which specifically binds to zzso zzso domain, further enhanced the zzso activity as well as growth rate and zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso form of zzso lacking the zzso zzso exchange domain abolished both the zzso activity and the colony forming potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso The requirement for zzso zzso in zzso induced transformation was demonstrated by the suppression of colony forming activity of zzso zzso zzso cells when a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in these zzso These data strongly suggest the existence of a novel signaling cascade involving an zzso protein zzso which zzso signals through zzso toward zzso zzso
