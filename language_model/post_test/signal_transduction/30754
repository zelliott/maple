Growth and zzso of zzso processes is key to establishing zzso connectivity critical for an zzso functioning nervous zzso zzso activity clearly influences zzso connectivity and does so via zzso calcium zzso A number of zzso and zzso convey the calcium signal initiated by zzso zzso Several of these zzso interact with zzso in close proximity to the plasma membrane and alter zzso structure locally via these local zzso However, many zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso target proteins in the nucleus, either by zzso a downstream zzso that is a component of a signaling cascade or by directly acting within the zzso It is the zzso of nuclear signaling and gene zzso that is thought to mediate global changes in zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso provides substantial evidence that gene zzso is a prevalent mechanism by which zzso activity is translated into changes in zzso zzso The present review presents an overview of the role of zzso activity in the development of zzso zzso the signaling mechanisms that translate zzso activity into gene transcription, and the transcribed zzso that regulate zzso zzso
