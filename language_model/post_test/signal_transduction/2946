We have tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso can be used to manipulate the threshold for zzso zzso zzso thus accelerating the onset of zzso cellular zzso in response to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso we assessed whether zzso treatment modified the zzso zzso that is activated in response to DNA damaging zzso zzso significantly enhanced the number of zzso entering a zzso stage in response to zzso an zzso that zzso cell zzso by zzso DNA damage signaling pathways zzso zzso in a zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso we explored whether zzso supplementation throughout their entire zzso lifespan may promote the early appearance of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso lifespan by accelerating both the loss of zzso potential and the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso enlarged and flattened cell shapes, loss of arrayed arrangement, zzso of zzso and zzso debris and zzso zzso zzso functioned as a bona fide stressful agent, inducing zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso which are highly resistant to zzso premature zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was accompanied by the striking zzso of several zzso belonging to the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso and zzso thus mimicking a recently described ability of zzso to zzso cancer cells by specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because the unlimited zzso potential of stem cells results from their zzso zzso to zzso we finally tested if zzso treatment could circumvent the stress zzso zzso zzso of induced zzso stem cells zzso zzso treatment drastically reduced both the number and the size of zzso colonies and notably diminished the zzso of the zzso marker alkaline zzso Our current findings, altogether, reveal for the first time that zzso can efficiently lower the threshold for zzso to generate an zzso cell zzso that becomes zzso to zzso zzso including DNA damaging, zzso and/or zzso zzso
