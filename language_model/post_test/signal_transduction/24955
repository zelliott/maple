zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso on the resistant zzso zzso Dijon zzso results in the development of a hypersensitive response zzso on the zzso zzso To assess the role of the recently cloned zzso gene in zzso resistance, we monitored both zzso and resistance zzso of viral spread to systemic zzso in the progeny of a cross between resistant zzso and susceptible Columbia zzso As expected, zzso development zzso as a dominant trait that corresponded with the presence of zzso However, all of the zzso plants and three-fourths of zzso zzso plants were susceptible to the zzso These results suggest the presence of a second zzso termed zzso that regulates resistance to zzso The zzso present in zzso appears to be zzso to the zzso or zzso present in zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso formation and zzso resistance are dependent on salicylic acid but not on zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, these phenomena are unaffected by zzso in zzso Thus, zzso resistance requires a yet undefined salicylic zzso zzso signaling zzso
