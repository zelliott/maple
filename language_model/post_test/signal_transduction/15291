zzso receptors zzso recognize zzso molecular patterns in invading pathogens and trigger innate immune zzso zzso recognizes zzso a molecular signature of most viruses via its zzso zzso The zzso structure consists of a 23 turn zzso bent into the shape of a zzso with specialized zzso capping the N and zzso ends of the zzso zzso bind as zzso units to zzso zzso of at least 45 zzso in zzso the minimal length required for signal zzso X-ray analysis has shown that each zzso of a zzso binds zzso at two sites located at opposite ends of the zzso zzso on the one lateral face that lacks zzso zzso zzso contacts between the zzso zzso of two zzso stabilize the zzso and position the zzso zzso within zzso A of each other, which is thought to be essential for zzso a signal across the plasma membrane in intact zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso 1, 2 and 4, which bind zzso zzso using very different interactions from zzso the zzso nevertheless promote the formation of a zzso in which the same two lateral surfaces as in the zzso complex face each other, bringing their zzso in close zzso Thus, a pattern is emerging in which zzso substances bind to zzso thereby promoting the formation of a zzso in which the zzso zzso binding surfaces face each other and the two zzso are brought in close proximity for signal zzso
