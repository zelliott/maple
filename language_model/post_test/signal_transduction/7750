We used manual zzso or laser capture zzso zzso to isolate tissue sections of the zzso area of zzso wild type and knockout mice zzso and analyzed their zzso patterns using commercial zzso zzso zzso between the zzso of zzso and zzso samples showed that the zzso samples allowed detection of significantly higher numbers of zzso expressed zzso with higher statistical rates of zzso These results validate zzso as a reliable technique for in zzso zzso studies in the brain zzso where contamination by surrounding areas (not expressing zzso increases background noise and zzso identification of zzso expressed zzso zzso between wild type and knockout zzso zzso samples revealed that zzso elimination caused significant gene expression changes, mostly affecting signal zzso and related neural zzso The list of 36 most zzso expressed genes included zzso concerned mainly with zzso protein signaling and zzso organization zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso shown by zzso knockout mice, many of these zzso expressed genes play functional roles in processes such as sensory development and function zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or neurological zzso processes affecting memory and zzso Indeed, potential links to neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso disease zzso or zzso disease zzso have been reported for a number of zzso expressed genes identified in this study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data, together with the previously described role of zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso in zzso warrant further investigation of a potential functional link of zzso to neurodegenerative zzso
