The unfolded protein response zzso is a network of signaling pathways that responds to stress in the zzso zzso zzso The general output of the zzso is to zzso genes involved in zzso function, thus restoring and/or increasing the capacity of the zzso to fold and process zzso In zzso many organisms have mechanisms for limiting the load on the zzso by attenuating translation or degrading zzso zzso Despite broad conservation of these signaling pathways across zzso interesting variations demonstrate a variety of mechanisms for managing zzso zzso How do zzso zzso respond to stress when they lack traditional zzso zzso What is the role of the zzso stress sensor zzso in zzso species that are missing its main zzso Here I describe how diverse species have zzso the zzso to fit their zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso and structural diversity of zzso zzso
