zzso have essential roles in zzso regulating a large array of zzso zzso Studies have revealed that zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso interact to regulate hundreds of expression in zzso governing many biological zzso However, whether their interaction is through modification or intersection of their primary signaling zzso or by independent or parallel pathways remains a big zzso Using zzso and molecular markers of zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso signaling zzso as indicated by the zzso status of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso of zzso further revealed that the zzso zzso complex is not required for zzso to act on zzso signaling zzso However, when the zzso downstream signaling component zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso signaling zzso Also, using a set of zzso insensitive zzso we found that regulation of zzso on the zzso primary signaling zzso depends on the zzso early signaling zzso zzso and zzso We propose that the signaling zzso of zzso and zzso primarily zzso after zzso perception, but before their zzso zzso This model provides a reasonable explanation for why a large proportion of zzso genes are also regulated by zzso and provides an insight into the molecular mechanisms by which zzso could interact with zzso
