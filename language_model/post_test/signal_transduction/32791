We describe a zzso response of zzso coli strains lacking most of the known zzso machinery but containing high levels of the response regulator zzso The bacteria accumulated in zzso zzso they formed rings on zzso zzso zzso and the probability of zzso zzso rotation zzso increased in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso the response was zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso response was partial and delayed, as was the response of a control zzso strain having a high zzso zzso zzso a zzso analogue of zzso as well as other known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso and zzso caused a similar zzso So did low zzso of zzso and zzso (which, at higher zzso act as zzso for zzso zzso zzso Other tested zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso increased the zzso zzso These observations raise the possibility that, at least when the conventional signal zzso components are missing, a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso might be functional in zzso zzso Potential molecular mechanisms are zzso
