zzso may result either from positive induction by zzso binding to a plasma membrane zzso or from negative induction attributable to loss of a zzso zzso For example, zzso of developing sympathetic zzso may be induced in culture either by exposure to leukemia zzso factor zzso or by deprivation of nerve growth zzso This study compared the cell death pathways activated in sympathetic zzso by these two different zzso Both types of cell death were zzso zzso both were zzso in the immediate zzso period and disappeared over the next 2 zzso Both types of cell death were reduced by genetic deletion of zzso or by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both were reduced by zzso of zzso activity or by zzso of zzso synthesis with zzso zzso Finally, both involved zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by sympathetic zzso declined in parallel with the zzso loss of zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso of the zzso during development may zzso the loss of zzso zzso Treatment of sympathetic zzso with an zzso that blocks the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso cell zzso zzso genetic deletion of zzso prevented zzso after zzso zzso These observations suggest that concurrent zzso signaling is necessary for zzso cell death and that zzso cell death and growth factor deprivation appear to activate the same zzso pathways involving zzso zzso
