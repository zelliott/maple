The mechanism of zzso zzso after cellular stress remains poorly zzso Evidence suggests that zzso zzso cell death by a multitude of molecular pathways involving zzso of target genes and zzso independent direct zzso zzso play a key role in zzso We show here that a fraction of zzso protein zzso to zzso at the onset of zzso zzso but not during zzso zzso or zzso cell cycle zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso is rapid zzso 1 h after zzso zzso and precedes changes in zzso membrane potential, zzso c release, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso analysis of isolated zzso show that the majority of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso whereas a fraction is found in a complex with the zzso import motor zzso zzso After induction of zzso zzso without additional DNA damage in zzso cells, zzso again partially zzso to zzso preceding the onset of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso abrogates stress zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not cell cycle arrest, suggesting a feedback signaling loop between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bypassing the nucleus by targeting zzso to zzso using import leader zzso is sufficient to induce zzso in zzso zzso We propose a model where zzso can contribute to zzso by direct signaling at the zzso thereby amplifying the zzso zzso of zzso
