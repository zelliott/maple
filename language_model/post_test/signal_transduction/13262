A simple zzso which combines a zzso preparation technique with an in zzso zzso technique modified from zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been developed for in zzso detection of plant programmed cell death zzso at the zzso zzso After exposure of zzso and zzso on slides by zzso zzso or zzso was used to incorporate zzso or zzso at sites of DNA zzso After zzso zzso the signals were amplified by a cascade of zzso reaction according to the detection system of zzso This method enables in zzso detection of plant zzso in zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso nuclear and DNA levels without cell culture and zzso zzso This technique permits zzso of DNA breaks with high sensitivity due to increased zzso and nucleus exposure to the zzso solutions, as well as due to the zzso amplification of the zzso Moreover, the changes in the cells were easier to be observed because the spatial obstacle of the cell wall and its zzso were zzso It is potentially useful for in zzso detection of zzso in plant root zzso cells triggered by various environmental zzso zzso It is proposed that the root tip is a versatile in zzso system for studying zzso induced by environmental zzso zzso
