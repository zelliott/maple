zzso play central roles in plant growth, development, and stress zzso To better understand zzso function and zzso we have characterized the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso derived from zzso leaf zzso Total zzso zzso proteins were then subjected either to zzso liquid zzso mass zzso or to one-dimensional zzso coupled with zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso To ensure maximum coverage of the zzso a zzso fraction was also analyzed separately by one-dimensional zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso 402 proteins were zzso The sensitivity of our analyses is indicated by the high coverage of membrane zzso Eleven of the twelve known zzso zzso were zzso Here, we present evidence of four zzso soluble zzso factor attachment protein receptors zzso representing each of the four groups of zzso proteins necessary for membrane zzso In addition, potential cargo of the zzso and zzso zzso sorting zzso association of the zzso with the zzso and the zzso zzso of 89 proteins of unknown function are zzso A detailed analysis of these proteins and their roles in zzso function and zzso is zzso
