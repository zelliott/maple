The zzso zzso zzso transition factor zzso signaling zzso has been considered to be an attractive target for cancer intervention zzso to the important roles it plays in tumor formation, zzso zzso zzso and drug zzso Based on the historical zzso evidence, a number of zzso zzso targeted agents are being developed in the clinic, and recent clinical data have begun to provide some insight into which tumor types and patient populations a zzso zzso inhibitor may be beneficial zzso 

Through reviewing recent publications in the literature and information disclosed in other public zzso we describe the current understanding of zzso biology in human zzso and discuss the latest progress in the development of zzso zzso zzso for cancer zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso currently being evaluated in the clinic have demonstrated compelling evidence of clinical activity in different cancer types and may provide significant therapeutic zzso The challenges, however, are to identify the tumor types and patient populations that benefit most, and find the most effective combinations of therapies while minimizing potential zzso
