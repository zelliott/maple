An important focus in cell biology is understanding how different feedback mechanisms regulate G zzso zzso zzso Toward this end we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso by measuring zzso signals in single zzso zzso We monitored zzso signals using genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This high resolution approach allowed us to make several zzso zzso Exposure of cells to 1 zzso zzso triggered transient increases in zzso levels near the plasma zzso zzso of cells with 10 zzso zzso a zzso zzso prevented the decline in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso triggered a zzso twofold increase in zzso type 4 zzso zzso zzso The decline in zzso zzso levels was not significantly altered by including 20 zzso zzso a zzso zzso or 3 zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso however, the decline in the zzso levels was prevented when both zzso and zzso were included in the zzso zzso zzso After an initial zzso stimulation with zzso and a zzso zzso little or no recovery of the signal was observed during a second zzso stimulation with zzso zzso The zzso of the signal in response to the second zzso stimulation was not altered when zzso was included in the zzso solution, but was significantly increased when zzso was zzso Taken together, these data indicate that either zzso zzso of zzso or zzso stimulation of zzso activity is sufficient to cause declines in zzso zzso In addition, the data indicate that zzso zzso is primarily responsible for a sustained suppression of zzso zzso To better understand the interplay between zzso zzso and zzso activity in controlling zzso signals, we developed a mathematical model of this zzso zzso of zzso signals using this model are consistent with the experimental data and demonstrate the importance of zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and regulation of zzso activity in controlling zzso signals, and zzso on the overall sensitivity of the zzso
