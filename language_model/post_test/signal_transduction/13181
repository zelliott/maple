The target of zzso zzso signaling zzso allows zzso cells to regulate their growth in response to nutritional zzso In zzso zzso zzso controls the expression of genes involved in several zzso zzso zzso In particular, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates a concise cluster of genes zzso zzso target zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso required for de zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acts in part by regulating the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso Nuclear entry of this complex requires the zzso protein zzso whose precise function has remained ill zzso Here we establish that the likely role of zzso is to antagonize the activity of another zzso zzso which we demonstrate is itself a negative regulator of zzso target gene zzso zzso of zzso analyses suggest that zzso and zzso act downstream of zzso and upstream of zzso and zzso Moreover, we find that zzso zzso responds to zzso as well as to each of the zzso zzso indicative of complex regulation within this branch of zzso zzso In addition to zzso target zzso zzso analysis reveals robust expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso cells, which depends on a functional zzso zzso This latter result provides a molecular explanation for the previous identification of zzso as zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso
