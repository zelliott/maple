Evidence from zzso studies in both zzso and zzso indicates that growth cones are not guided by simple stop or go zzso Rather, the navigation of growth cones through the zzso tissue is controlled by a continuous integration of both positive and negative zzso The path taken by an zzso is determined by the continuously changing situation encountered by the growth cone at any given site along the trajectory of the zzso to the zzso The signals derived from interactions of surface molecules with these cues provided by the environment of the growth cone are constantly changing both temporally and zzso zzso each growth cone encounters a unique set of guidance cues directing it to its specific target, thus allowing for the tremendous complexity required for the guidance of millions of zzso in the developing nervous zzso
