zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso protein with the zzso site zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso is a 12 zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Historically, when we zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso cells, a 12 zzso protein was identified along with zzso which was later proved to be zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso form a complex in the cell and the culture zzso of zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso has a specific affinity with zzso We also found that zzso zzso was more effectively zzso into the zzso cells expressing zzso on the cell surface, than the zzso T cells which do not express surface zzso Moreover, zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso suggesting that the cell surface zzso is involved in zzso zzso into the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited zzso enhancement of zzso production from zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the cell surface zzso serves as one of the zzso binding molecules or zzso zzso component and zzso zzso inflammatory zzso
