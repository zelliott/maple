zzso of lung zzso after injury remain poorly zzso Bone zzso protein 4 zzso is critical for lung zzso and regulates differentiation of the airway zzso during development, although its mechanism of action is zzso The role of zzso in adult lungs is zzso We zzso that zzso zzso is involved in zzso of damaged adult airways after zzso Our aims were to zzso the zzso process in zzso zzso injured zzso to determine if and when zzso zzso is activated during this process and investigate the effects of zzso on normal adult airway zzso cells zzso zzso were injected with 50 zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso was examined by Western zzso of lung zzso zzso and by zzso at 6, 24, 48 and 96 h post zzso zzso of zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso in zzso peaked at 6 h post injection, zzso with zzso inflammation and prior to airway zzso which occurred at 24 zzso While airways were zzso by zzso zzso proliferation peaked later at 96 h post zzso zzso In zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso expression and increased migration in a wound closure zzso Thus, following acute injury, increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso with inflammation and precedes airway zzso and zzso Our data indicate that, similar to its role in controlling tissue architecture during development, zzso zzso regulates zzso of the airways following acute injury, involving zzso of zzso and induction of migration in zzso
