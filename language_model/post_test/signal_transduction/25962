In the present paper, gene expression analysis of mouse embryonic stem zzso cells zzso in a novel ultrasound standing wave trap zzso zzso et zzso zzso at variable acoustic pressures zzso zzso and times zzso zzso was zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso cells at the highest employed acoustic pressure for 60 zzso does not modify gene expression and cells maintain their zzso zzso bodies zzso also expressed the early and late neural differentiation zzso which were also unaffected by the acoustic zzso Our results suggest that the ultrasound trap zzso is minimally invasive as the zzso consequences of zzso cell replication and zzso differentiation proceed without significantly affecting gene zzso The technique holds great promise in safe cell manipulation techniques for a variety of applications including tissue engineering and zzso zzso
