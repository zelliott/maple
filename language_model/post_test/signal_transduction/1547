Basic zzso element binding zzso protein is one of at least 20 zzso family members that function as zzso zzso or zzso by binding to zzso sequences within target genes to influence cellular zzso in zzso Previously, we demonstrated that increased expression of zzso in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso resulted in serum zzso zzso which was accompanied by heightened expression of cell zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the mechanism underlying the altered zzso potential associated with zzso by the identification of additional zzso downstream gene targets and by the demonstration of zzso zzso of promoters for a number of zzso zzso Using zzso differential display in the analysis of zzso populations from zzso zzso with high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso cellular content, we identified 10 distinct zzso expressed zzso nine of which had higher levels in S than in As zzso The expression levels of two of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso products are implicated in cellular zzso were modestly induced by serum, albeit in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso growth zzso a zzso present in serum, had no significant effect on their expression in either zzso In transient reporter zzso the zzso activities of the zzso gene promoter and those for two other zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso were increased by serum and were significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso However, while zzso and its ubiquitous family member zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso when added as expression zzso in the parental zzso cell line, only zzso activated zzso transcription, despite the presence in all three gene promoters of zzso regions that presumably can bind zzso and zzso with similar zzso To zzso zzso signaling pathways that might involve zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso were used in transient zzso zzso involving the zzso gene promoter in zzso and zzso zzso While zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso pathways zzso similar effects on the zzso gene promoter activity, irrespective of cellular zzso content, that for zzso had a more pronounced effect on zzso zzso exhibiting higher zzso expression zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso mediates the expression of zzso genes through direct and indirect zzso mechanisms, one of which may involve the participation of a zzso family zzso
