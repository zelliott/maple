The zzso zzso and zzso are widely used in the treatment of breast, zzso and other zzso Although their zzso has been attributed to zzso arrest through stabilization of zzso the mechanisms by which tumor cells die remains zzso zzso has been shown to induce soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso production in zzso but the involvement of zzso production in zzso zzso or resistance in tumor cells has not been zzso Our study aimed to correlate zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and the acquisition of zzso zzso 

zzso cells or zzso drug-resistant zzso zzso by selection for surviving cells in increasing zzso of zzso or zzso were assessed for zzso production in the absence or presence of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and for sensitivity to zzso or zzso by using a zzso zzso (in the absence or presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Nuclear factor zzso activity was also measured with zzso whereas zzso changes associated with zzso resistance in zzso and zzso cells were determined with zzso analysis and quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso and zzso cells increased production of zzso in the presence of zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso produced high levels of zzso although only within a particular zzso threshold (between 3 and 45 zzso Increased production of zzso was zzso dependent and correlated with decreased sensitivity to zzso decreased levels of zzso and increased survival through zzso and zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells identified changes in the expression of zzso genes consistent with reduced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso survival zzso 

We report for the first time that zzso can promote zzso zzso production in tumor cells at clinically relevant zzso which can contribute to their zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso survival genes may, in contrast, contribute to zzso resistance in tumor zzso These findings may be of strong clinical zzso
