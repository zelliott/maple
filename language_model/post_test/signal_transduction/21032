An early event that follows zzso of the high affinity zzso for zzso zzso is the zzso of protein zzso especially those on the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of the receptors leads to their rapid zzso but even zzso zzso receptors undergo continual rounds of zzso and zzso We developed zzso to study zzso of the receptors and other cellular zzso Whole cell extracts zzso both zzso of the receptors rapidly and were as active against zzso as against zzso zzso Upon zzso the in zzso zzso of the zzso and several other proteins followed zzso zzso with closely similar rate zzso despite substantial differences in the extent of zzso These results suggest that the level of zzso of zzso is largely controlled by the zzso action of zzso and not from changes in zzso to or activity of the zzso Much of the total zzso is lost when the cells are zzso but the rate of zzso of zzso zzso was comparable in intact and zzso zzso Thus, much of the activity zzso by the cell to zzso the zzso is likely to be associated with the plasma zzso
