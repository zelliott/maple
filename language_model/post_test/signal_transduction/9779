The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso development when exposed to zzso The zzso open and expand, the zzso hook opens, and the zzso zzso to zzso Using the large and easily dissected zzso of soybean zzso max zzso zzso we show that genes involved in photosynthesis and its regulation dominate transcripts specific to the zzso even in zzso zzso Genes for cell wall zzso and metabolism are expressed at higher levels in the zzso while examination of genes expressed at higher levels in the hook region (including the shoot zzso zzso reveals genes involved in cell division and protein zzso The early zzso events in these three zzso in response to a zzso treatment of zzso light are highly zzso Not only are different regulatory genes rapidly regulated by light in each organ, but the zzso genes in each organ contain a distinctive subset of known zzso zzso zzso We detected specific zzso gene expression for the root phototropism gene zzso in the zzso hook and also zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that the gene is necessary for normal zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso promoter fused to a zzso reporter gene shows differential expression across the hook zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso networks are active early in zzso in the aerial parts of zzso zzso
