In the present study, we clarified the molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso and the involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso The exposure of zzso human zzso leukemia cells to zzso resulted in the zzso of the zzso progression that coincided with the zzso zzso The experiment using the zzso synchronized cells demonstrated that the zzso zzso cells are more sensitive to undergoing zzso stimulation by zzso than the cells in other zzso We also confirmed that zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso at the concentration required for zzso zzso An experiment using a zzso inhibitor zzso or a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso indicated that zzso zzso might be regulated by the zzso of these two zzso zzso zzso is likely to zzso the zzso cells in the zzso phase mainly through the zzso zzso zzso because only the zzso zzso inhibitor significantly attenuated the zzso of inactive zzso zzso protein and the zzso cell zzso We reported here for the first time that the zzso zzso protein was zzso by the zzso treatment without significant zzso of the zzso total protein zzso This was zzso by a zzso specific inhibitor zzso at the concentration required for specific zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, the spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso synchronized cells was enhanced zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso induction also was observed in zzso and zzso zzso Thus, we identified the zzso zzso as a key zzso linking the zzso zzso cell cycle arrest with the zzso zzso by zzso
