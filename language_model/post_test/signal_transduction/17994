Gene 33 zzso is a zzso gene regulated in rat liver and zzso cells by insulin and other zzso It is thought to participate in the transition from zzso to proliferation in zzso zzso The zzso by which insulin exerts its action on zzso are not totally understood; it is unclear whether a functional insulin zzso is required for this zzso In this study, we evaluate the mechanism for insulin induction of zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso human insulin zzso zzso and a zzso insulin zzso zzso at the zzso site zzso zzso cells had higher levels of insulin binding than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and its zzso zzso were impaired in zzso zzso zzso insulin induction of zzso occurred 3 h after hormonal exposure in all cell zzso The degree of insulin stimulation of zzso zzso levels was zzso to zzso higher in zzso than in zzso or zzso cells, which had minimal levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso levels was observed at zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, consistent with insulin interaction with its own zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso had some effects on insulin stimulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso had minimal effect on insulin stimulation of zzso zzso in all cells zzso By contrast, zzso acid zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of the insulin zzso zzso zzso caused complete zzso of insulin stimulation of zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the insulin zzso with intact zzso activity is required for insulin stimulation of zzso zzso zzso They also suggest that zzso a zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso could mediate insulin stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso of insulin regulation of zzso expression downstream of zzso do not seem to rely entirely on the classic insulin zzso zzso pathway, as a minor effect was observed upon zzso of zzso suggesting that multiple pathways may be zzso
