zzso zzso is the precursor protein for a number of zzso hormones and zzso and the zzso gene is zzso very active in the zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the expression of this gene during zzso zzso in order to examine whether it can function as a zzso neural zzso We investigated the zzso distribution of zzso zzso using a zzso probe that zzso to the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso gene B zzso Gene transcripts were first detected at stage 25 of development via zzso protection zzso In zzso zzso analysis performed at stage 46 showed clearly that these transcripts are zzso in a region representing the future zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso indicate that the zzso gene can be used successfully as an indirect marker in studies on neural zzso in the absence of interactions with zzso zzso fails to express the zzso zzso whereas zzso transcripts are readily zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso application of two different signals, which are likely to be relevant for neural differentiation zzso zzso acid and the zzso of protein zzso C via zzso zzso was not effective in evoking zzso gene expression in cultured zzso zzso However, zzso acid treatment of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso successfully prevented zzso zzso We conclude that zzso gene expression can be used as an indirect marker for anterior neural differentiation in zzso
