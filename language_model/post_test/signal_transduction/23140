zzso of the zzso zzso are newly identified potential driver zzso in lung zzso zzso However, the absence of cell lines harboring zzso fusion genes has hampered the investigation of the biological relevance of zzso and the development of zzso zzso Thus, we aimed to identify a zzso fusion positive zzso cell zzso Eleven zzso cell lines were screened for zzso fusion transcripts by reverse zzso chain zzso The biological relevance of the zzso gene products was assessed by cell growth, survival and zzso of zzso and zzso with or without the suppression of zzso expression using zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso using a culture system and in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fusion gene in zzso cells was demonstrated by the zzso and protein levels, and the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were not observed in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso active, and the introduction of a zzso targeting the zzso 3' region decreased cell proliferation by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso including zzso reduced cell zzso which was accompanied by the zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso exhibited zzso effects in the zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso contributed to cell zzso The zzso of zzso activity could be an effective treatment strategy for zzso zzso is a useful model for developing fusion zzso zzso
