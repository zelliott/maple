The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with zzso failure is extremely high and accounts for a large part of the morbidity and zzso zzso zzso zzso in host defense against infectious agents and injury, but also contributes to the zzso of many diseases, including cardiovascular zzso which is a main problem in patients with zzso zzso zzso of blood zzso to the injured vascular zzso characterizes the initiation and progression of zzso and involves many inflammatory zzso modulated by cells of both innate and zzso zzso zzso inflammatory and immune responses, communicated by these different cell types, are driven by inflammatory zzso that promote associated tissue damage if zzso signaling pathways remain zzso Thus, pathways capable of suppressing zzso zzso signaling hold the potential to limit life-threatening cardiovascular events caused by zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso are a family of zzso zzso several of which have emerged as key zzso regulators of zzso zzso including innate and zzso zzso zzso evidence supports the idea that zzso of zzso signaling by differential zzso expression is involved in the zzso of various zzso and zzso diseases, including zzso Based on recent zzso in which zzso expression levels are profoundly altered in kidney disease, we discuss the possibilities of zzso as new zzso markers of inflammation as well as their potential zzso properties in zzso failure related cardiovascular zzso
