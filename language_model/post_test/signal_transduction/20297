zzso induced by innate immune zzso promotes zzso arthritis and inflammatory zzso zzso However, its role in zzso type 1 diabetes is zzso Our aim is to define the role of zzso in the zzso of diabetes in the zzso mouse zzso 

We generated zzso mice expressing a zzso repertoire of T cell zzso zzso zzso or a transgenic zzso and monitored diabetes onset and zzso zzso zzso (full name zzso zzso and zzso zzso (full name zzso zzso ( zzso zzso mice were used to distinguish the requirement for zzso zzso in zzso T cells and zzso cells zzso to induce zzso We examined the effect of blocking zzso zzso on diabetes onset in zzso zzso 

At 7 months of age, more than zzso of the zzso zzso female mice remained diabetes free compared with only zzso in the control zzso Diabetes zzso was also decreased in zzso (full name zzso zzso mice expressing a highly zzso transgenic zzso on zzso T zzso zzso transfer of zzso from diabetic zzso and zzso donors induced disease in zzso zzso recipients but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso at the onset of zzso prevented diabetes in zzso zzso 

Our results show that zzso is needed for the initial zzso of zzso zzso T cells as well as for sustaining the zzso potential of zzso cells, acting on both zzso T cells and on zzso Our findings demonstrate a critical role for zzso in the zzso of zzso diabetes and suggest that zzso is a promising therapeutic zzso
