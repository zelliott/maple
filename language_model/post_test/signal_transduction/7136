The nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor whose expression is induced during zzso and that is required for the acquisition and control of mature zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso the expression of genes involved in zzso synthesis and storage through enhancers activated during zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso also binds to enhancers already active in zzso as evidenced by an active zzso state including lower DNA zzso levels despite higher zzso zzso These zzso enhancers are linked to genes involved in the zzso growth factor signaling zzso that are zzso induced during zzso but to a lower extent than zzso metabolism zzso because of stronger zzso expression levels in zzso This is consistent with the sequential involvement of hormonal sensitivity and zzso handling during zzso maturation and zzso with the zzso structure dynamics at zzso and activated zzso Interestingly, zzso enhancers are evolutionary zzso and can be activated in other zzso in contrast to enhancers controlling zzso handling genes whose zzso is more restricted to zzso Thus, zzso zzso both broadly active and cell zzso enhancers to zzso the dynamic range of zzso of genes involved in the zzso zzso
