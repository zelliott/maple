Previous studies with Venezuelan zzso encephalitis virus and zzso virus zzso indicate that zzso are capable of suppressing the cellular response to type I and type II zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso however, the relevance of this signaling zzso toward zzso has not been zzso The relative abilities of zzso and zzso zzso strains to zzso zzso signaling were compared to determine whether the ability to inhibit zzso signaling zzso with zzso zzso The adult mouse zzso strain zzso was found to rapidly and robustly inhibit zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in response to zzso and/or zzso In contrast, the closely related zzso strains zzso and zzso which do not cause zzso disease in adult mice, were relatively inefficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was associated with decreased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To identify the viral zzso involved, we infected cells with several panels of zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that a single zzso acid zzso zzso at zzso position zzso which is required for zzso zzso was also required for efficient disruption of zzso zzso and this zzso fully restored zzso zzso when it was introduced into the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that a key zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso the response to type I and type II zzso which suggests that the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso signaling relates to their in zzso zzso zzso
