zzso zzso C zzso is a family of 11 zzso that are zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been shown previously to zzso to the nucleus at zzso and this was coupled to the generation of nuclear zzso However, it is not clear how zzso selective zzso and nuclear targeting is achieved during cell zzso To investigate further the role of nuclear zzso we measured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species at different stages of the cell cycle in zzso cells synchronized by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the membrane zzso an indicator of zzso occurred at S and zzso although zzso was targeted to the nucleus only at zzso zzso of nuclear zzso specifically zzso species, increased during zzso By contrast, there were no obvious changes in nuclear zzso acid species or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso nuclear zzso was able to activate classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso but was less effective for zzso of novel zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso nuclear zzso during zzso phase transition is zzso in part by generation of zzso at the zzso
