Natural zzso zzso cell functionality is controlled by zzso receptors that recognize zzso class zzso zzso cells that do not interact with zzso class I are zzso to many stimuli and fail to reject zzso class zzso zzso Thus, although the mechanisms are unknown, interactions with zzso class I zzso zzso cells respond zzso Surprisingly, these licensed zzso cells fail to control viral zzso During mouse zzso zzso infection, zzso signaling downstream of zzso receptors for zzso class I limits zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso class I prevent licensed zzso cells from controlling of zzso replication and zzso rather, it is the zzso zzso cells that are not inhibited by zzso class I that efficiently control zzso zzso zzso the licensing hypothesis is not sufficient to explain zzso cell functionality during viral zzso
