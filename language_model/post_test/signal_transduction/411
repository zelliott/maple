Ras zzso are zzso G zzso which play a fundamental role in cell signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso Ras have shown that zzso Ras molecules segregate into zzso zzso Several models have been developed in attempts to obtain quantitative descriptions of zzso formation, but all have relied on assumptions such as a constant, zzso independent ratio of Ras in clusters to Ras zzso zzso zzso However, this assumption is inconsistent with the law of mass zzso Here, we present a zzso model of Ras zzso based on short-range attraction and long-range zzso between Ras molecules in the zzso To test this model, we performed zzso Carlo simulations and compared statistical zzso properties with experimental zzso We find that we can recover the zzso zzso across a range of Ras expression levels, without assuming a constant zzso ratio or the existence of zzso zzso In addition, our model makes predictions about the signaling properties of Ras zzso in support of the idea that Ras zzso act as an zzso zzso for high zzso zzso
