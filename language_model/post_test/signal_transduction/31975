Mechanical overloading of zzso cartilage producing zzso stress, zzso strain, and fluid flow results in irreversible cartilage erosion and zzso zzso Application of high fluid zzso to zzso zzso the earmarks of zzso as evidenced by the induction of zzso zzso and zzso which are capable of inducing the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is detected at early but not late stages of zzso However, the underlying zzso of the zzso zzso regulation remains zzso Using the zzso zzso cell line as a model system, we demonstrated that high fluid zzso zzso a marked increase in zzso expression at short zzso exposure times zzso zzso which falls below zzso levels after prolonged zzso exposure zzso zzso High fluid zzso stress induced the rapid and sustained synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are in turn responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso which exerted an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso thereby suppressing zzso expression in human zzso zzso the signaling network that regulates zzso zzso expression in human zzso may provide insights for developing strategies to treat zzso zzso
