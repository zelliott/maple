Not all of the cardiovascular effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to changes in zzso II and zzso zzso Because the zzso tail of zzso is zzso we determined whether zzso zzso affect the zzso of zzso and whether zzso possesses the characteristics of a signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso enhanced the activity of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 7 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and stimulation of zzso cells with zzso zzso increased the activity of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was however unable to activate zzso or to stimulate the nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso or in zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso increase in zzso expression has been linked to the formation of zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso signaling via zzso contributes to this response in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso expression in primary cultures of human zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso a response that was prevented by zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso Thus, zzso is involved in zzso signaling in zzso cells and zzso zzso may be an important cellular mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of zzso zzso
