The members of the zzso of transient zzso potential zzso zzso channels are involved in a plethora of cellular zzso During the last decade, a vast amount of evidence is accumulating that attributes an important role to these zzso channels in different regulatory aspects of the zzso zzso In this review we discuss the expression patterns and roles of zzso channels in the regulation of gastrointestinal zzso enteric nervous system zzso and visceral sensation, and provide our perspectives on pharmacological targeting of zzso as a strategy to treat various gastrointestinal zzso We found that the current knowledge about the role of some members of the zzso zzso in zzso is rather zzso whereas the function of other zzso channels, especially of those implicated in smooth muscle cell zzso zzso zzso visceral sensitivity and hypersensitivity zzso zzso zzso tends to be well zzso Compared with expression data, zzso information about zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enteric nervous system zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso is zzso It is clear that several different zzso channels play important roles in the cellular apparatus that controls gastrointestinal zzso They are involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal zzso and zzso visceral sensation and visceral zzso zzso channels can be considered as interesting targets to tackle zzso diseases, zzso disorders and visceral zzso At present, zzso zzso are under development for the treatment of heartburn and visceral zzso but interference with other zzso channels is also zzso However, their role in gastrointestinal zzso first needs to be further zzso
