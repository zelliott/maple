zzso control of cell proliferation is zzso and abnormal principal cell proliferation may contribute to zzso in zzso kidney zzso This study investigates roles of zzso and its primary zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control of cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso principal cell zzso These cultures had similar zzso zzso characteristics upstream of zzso zzso distribution but differed in predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures were zzso before zzso with zzso higher proliferation in zzso zzso NC cultures achieved levels similar to those of zzso cultures on pharmacological manipulation of zzso production or zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso I zzso zzso of overall zzso activity, or of zzso zzso II zzso diminished zzso proliferation in NC cultures but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained zzso but NC zzso lost zzso No large proliferation changes resulted from treatments of polarized cultures; however, polarized NC and zzso cultures differed in zzso handling of zzso zzso and type zzso regulatory zzso Our results support zzso zzso regulation of zzso proliferation in NC principal cells and altered regulation of zzso in zzso cells and suggest that differences at or downstream of zzso can contribute to altered proliferation in a zzso zzso zzso
