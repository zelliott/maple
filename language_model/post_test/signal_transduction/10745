To determine whether zzso a zzso zzso virus is effective on the growth of a human head and neck zzso cell zzso cell zzso 

In zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso cells, a human oral floor zzso cell zzso cell line, were treated with zzso and the number of cells was zzso by an zzso using zzso blue zzso In zzso tumor growth zzso zzso cells were injected zzso into zzso nude mice, which were given an zzso injection of zzso to a maximum four times in every zzso The tumor size was measured once a zzso zzso zzso and necrosis of zzso cells were investigated, using technique of zzso 

In zzso the zzso of the zzso cell was inhibited depending on the concentration of zzso In zzso zzso nude mice bearing zzso tumors were injected with the virus zzso and the tumor growth was suppressed zzso depending on the injection time of zzso zzso was recognized extensively in the pathological zzso On the other hand, zzso effect was not obvious in these zzso 

zzso suppressed tumor growth of zzso cells in zzso as well as in zzso The possibility that zzso could become the means of treatment for head and neck zzso was suggested with further zzso
