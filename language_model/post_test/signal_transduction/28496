The zzso family of zzso factors is activated in response to many zzso including zzso zzso environmental stresses and, in the case of B and T zzso by zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso T and B zzso from zzso mice fail to activate zzso in response to zzso stimulation and, as a consequence, are unable to zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to activate zzso a process that requires the zzso essential zzso zzso (also known as zzso which is the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the cellular mechanism by which zzso activates the zzso zzso remains zzso Here we show that zzso targets zzso for zzso zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso that cannot be zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were both required for zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Furthermore, short interfering zzso that reduced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso the effects of zzso Thus, the zzso protein zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso factors through zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
