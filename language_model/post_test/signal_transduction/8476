The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways constitute the zzso coli signaling systems that detect and respond to zzso of the bacterial zzso Contributions of these systems to stress response have previously been examined zzso however, the possible zzso between these pathways are zzso Here we investigate the dynamics between the five stress response pathways by determining the zzso of each system with respect to zzso conditions, and monitoring global zzso changes in response to transient zzso of each of the zzso Our studies show that different zzso stress conditions elicit a combined response of these zzso zzso of the five pathways in the various tested stress conditions is explained by our unexpected finding that zzso responses induced by the individual systems show little zzso The zzso stress signaling pathways in zzso coli thus regulate mainly complementary functions whose discrete contributions are integrated to mount the full zzso zzso
