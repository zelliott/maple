zzso of receptors is of crucial importance for the physiology of most zzso and zzso zzso It is not known yet if the same mechanisms are used for sorting in the zzso and zzso pathways in the different zzso zzso In this work, we have used a deletion zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso that is normally localized on the zzso membrane when expressed in zzso canine kidney zzso This internal zzso acid deletion of the zzso tail leads to a relocation of the protein from the zzso to the zzso membrane and to rapid and efficient zzso These events are zzso by a signal localized within 9 zzso acids of the zzso zzso tail that is strictly dependent on a zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso sorting efficiency and zzso capacity of this signal in Fischer rat zzso zzso cells, in which zzso and zzso zzso have not yet been zzso We found that this targeting signal can mediate efficient transport to the zzso membrane also in zzso cells with similar zzso dependence as in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso cells, this zzso signal was not able to mediate coated pits zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These data represent the first characterization of zzso signals in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that requirements for zzso zzso sorting signals are zzso among cell lines from different zzso but that the recognition of the zzso zzso signal is tissue zzso
