The nucleus zzso zzso zzso is essential for orchestrating zzso control of blood zzso When a change in blood pressure occurs, the information is transmitted by zzso zzso fibers to the central network by zzso binding to zzso zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso zzso also activates zzso group II and III zzso zzso receptors zzso depressing both zzso and zzso release to zzso zzso signal zzso Here we present a novel role for zzso group II zzso to further fine-tune zzso signal transmission at the first central zzso In a zzso slice with zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso recordings of zzso zzso zzso revealed that two group II zzso zzso evoked zzso membrane zzso The zzso remained when a zzso contribution was prevented with zzso was blocked by a zzso intervention of zzso dialysis of the zzso signaling zzso was zzso by zzso release of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and was prevented by a group II zzso zzso zzso zzso of group II zzso was confirmed by fluorescent zzso zzso and light zzso Group II zzso zzso consisted of zzso outward and inward zzso prevented by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to group II zzso zzso there was no effect on intrinsic zzso as determined by action potential shape or firing in response to zzso current zzso The data suggest a novel mechanism for zzso group II zzso to fine-tune zzso signal transmission in the zzso
