It is generally accepted that one of the major and important contributions to skin aging, skin disorders, and skin diseases results from zzso oxygen zzso More than other zzso the skin is exposed to numerous environmental chemical and physical agents, such as ultraviolet light, causing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aging, photo aging, is only one of the harmful effects of continual oxygen radical production in the zzso Interestingly, our zzso zzso of zzso in skin of young and old zzso mice showed that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso DNA damage in skin of zzso mice occurred independently of their vitamin E status, while no zzso of zzso was zzso in the skin of young zzso This suggests that vitamin E is not the major protector of skin against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells is one of the characteristic features of skin damage by zzso stress that, in the absence of effective scavenging by zzso dramatically enhances zzso damage and inflammatory zzso In our model experiments, we demonstrated that zzso zzso significant zzso stress in zzso of normal human zzso zzso zzso whose characteristic feature is an early and profound zzso of zzso zzso likely related to zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is a signal for recognition of zzso cells by zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso may be zzso into elimination of thus damaged zzso zzso are now zzso to determine whether zzso of zzso zzso by antioxidants may interfere with important signaling functions of zzso stress in eliminating zzso zzso
