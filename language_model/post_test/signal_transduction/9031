Our understanding of, and approach to, pulmonary zzso hypertension has undergone a paradigm shift in the past zzso Once a condition thought to be dominated by increased zzso tone and zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension is now seen as a zzso in which structural changes driven by excessive vascular cell growth and zzso with recruitment and zzso of circulating cells, play a major zzso zzso of a number of molecular mechanisms have been zzso including pathways involving growth factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that may zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso their contribution to the zzso of pulmonary zzso hypertension could offer new drug zzso The role of zzso cells in vascular repair is also under active zzso The right zzso response to increased pressure load is recognized as critical to survival and the molecular mechanisms involved are attracting increasing zzso The challenge now is to integrate this new knowledge and explore how it can be used to categorize patients by molecular zzso and tailor treatment more zzso
