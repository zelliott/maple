The development of zzso zzso structures, in particular the zzso and zzso is regulated by a complex series of interactions between zzso neural crest and zzso zzso although in many instances the signals that mediate these interactions are not zzso In this study we have investigated the function of Indian zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso We show that zzso is expressed in a population of zzso cells located in the developing zzso adjacent to the zzso The analysis of zzso zzso mice demonstrates that the zzso and developing zzso zzso are direct targets of zzso signaling and that zzso is required for the normal pigmentation pattern of the zzso and the zzso of zzso cells to form the zzso Our findings also indicate that zzso signals indirectly to promote proliferation and zzso zzso in the neural zzso This study identifies zzso as a novel zzso signal that regulates zzso zzso and neural zzso zzso
