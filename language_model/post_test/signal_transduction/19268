zzso zzso is a hybrid zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose fruit is highly appreciated due to its zzso properties and health zzso Despite recent studies on the control of its growth and zzso zzso information about the role played by different hormones on these processes remains zzso Further advancement of this knowledge is hampered by the limited sequence information on genes from this species, despite the abundant information available on genes from the wild zzso relative zzso zzso However, the zzso species, or one zzso only partially contributes to the zzso of the cultivated zzso We have produced a collection of expressed sequence tags zzso from different zzso libraries prepared from different fruit parts and zzso zzso The collection has been zzso and the sequence information used to explore the involvement of different hormones in fruit zzso zzso and for the comparison of transcripts in the zzso of ripe fruits of zzso and zzso zzso The study is particularly important since the commercial fruit is indeed an enlarged flower zzso with the true zzso the zzso on the surface and connected through a network of vascular vessels to the central zzso 

We have zzso over 4,500 zzso from zzso zzso thus doubling the number of zzso available in the zzso of this zzso We then assembled this information together with that available from zzso zzso resulting a total of zzso zzso The identification of zzso and zzso in many of the zzso allowed their conversion into functional molecular zzso The availability of libraries prepared from green growing fruits has allowed the cloning of zzso zzso for genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by expression studies in selected fruit parts and zzso zzso In addition, the sequence information generated in the project, jointly with previous information on sequences from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso has allowed designing an zzso zzso that has been used to compare the zzso of the ripe zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso grouping the genes by biological zzso points to differences being quantitative rather than zzso 

The present study generates essential knowledge and molecular tools that will be useful in improving investigations at the molecular level in cultivated zzso zzso zzso This knowledge is likely to provide useful resources in the ongoing breeding zzso The sequence information has already allowed the development of molecular markers that have been applied to zzso characterization and could be eventually used in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis can be of utility to target specific genes to be further zzso by their involvement in the different plant zzso zzso
