zzso molecules play vital roles in airway zzso zzso or airway zzso Our previous study indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is relevant closely to asthma zzso but its biological function or significance is still zzso In the present study, we observed the zzso and spatial distribution of zzso expression in mouse lung tissue with the zzso asthma model and found that the level of zzso zzso showed a prominent negative correlation with pulmonary resistance zzso To study the function of zzso in zzso effects of zzso on proliferation and wound repair activity of human zzso zzso cells zzso was investigated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that: zzso zzso zzso could zzso the repairing zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso expression was increased on the edge cells of mechanic wounded area in culture; zzso zzso zzso component zzso zzso obviously promoted wound repair activity and proliferation of zzso which could be blocked by zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed that zzso could promote zzso zzso which also be inhibited by zzso zzso In conclusion, the level of zzso zzso expression is highly correlated to airway zzso zzso may contribute to the wound repair and proliferation of zzso Furthermore, it may serve to zzso zzso zzso zzso and its signal zzso
