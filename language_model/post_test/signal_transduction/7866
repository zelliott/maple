The 2 zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso of worse or better zzso likely derive from zzso zzso B cells, or zzso zzso B cells, zzso Different clinical behavior could relate to the ability of tumor cells to respond to surface zzso zzso zzso cases zzso have an increased ability to zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso compared to zzso cases zzso We now confirm and further investigate this differential signaling in a large cohort by zzso zzso Cases responding to zzso zzso express higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso does not influence signaling in zzso or associate with response in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso expression is not required for response in either zzso or zzso zzso partially or completely zzso zzso responses from each subset can recover both zzso expression and signal capacity spontaneously in zzso or following zzso This provides direct evidence for engagement of putative zzso in zzso Signaling via zzso differs markedly being almost universally positive in both zzso and zzso with no association with zzso or zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso therefore, appear intact in zzso locating zzso to zzso mainly in zzso zzso of differential zzso effects zzso by zzso may determine tumor zzso
