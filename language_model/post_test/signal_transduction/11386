The study of the zzso zzso system has been greatly advanced by the development of immortalized cell zzso Of particular relevance are the so-called GT1 zzso Not only do they exhibit many of the known zzso characteristics of zzso zzso in zzso but in approximately one decade have yielded new insights regarding the intrinsic physiology of individual cells and networks of zzso zzso as well as the nature of central and peripheral signals that directly zzso their zzso For instance, valuable information has been generated concerning intrinsic properties of the system such as the inherent zzso pattern of zzso displayed by networks of GT1 zzso Concepts regarding feedback regulation and zzso feedback of zzso zzso have been dramatically zzso Likewise, the nature of the receptors and of the zzso and zzso signal zzso mechanisms involved in the actions of multiple zzso signals has been zzso zzso this zzso system allows a better comprehension of the zzso axis and of the regulatory influences that ultimately control zzso zzso
