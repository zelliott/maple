zzso signaling is implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation during zzso development from studies of mouse and chick models, but its action at the cellular level has been poorly zzso In this study, we examine the in zzso function of zzso signaling in embryonic neural stem cells, zzso from zzso derived from zzso mouse zzso zzso media containing active zzso proteins are added to the neural stem cells and its effect on zzso of zzso and differentiation into zzso and zzso cells was zzso zzso proteins inhibit zzso of zzso but promote differentiation into zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins also increase the number of zzso zzso but suppress the number of zzso lineage cells expressing zzso or zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling can inhibit the maintenance of neural stem cells, but rather promote the differentiation of neural stem cells into several cell zzso
