Under zzso limiting conditions, zzso components are randomly zzso into zzso zzso called zzso and delivered to the zzso for degradation and zzso In the last few years, however, it has been observed that several zzso components such as zzso pathogens or specific protein complexes can also be selectively targeted for degradation by zzso pathways zzso in zzso zzso We have recently shown that in zzso zzso mature zzso are subject to such selective degradation by zzso under zzso conditions, in a process that we termed zzso By genetic zzso we found that selective degradation of zzso large zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso that zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso proteins accumulate in zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells, suggesting that the regulation of zzso by zzso may be zzso Here we present data on a potential role of the zzso zzso zzso as a positive regulator of zzso and discuss the possible involvement of zzso as a signaling zzso in this zzso
