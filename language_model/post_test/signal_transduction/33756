The zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso protects zzso zzso against the toxicity of Alzheimer's zzso zzso however, the role played by the zzso receptors zzso has not been zzso We report here that zzso mediates the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the protective effect of zzso against the toxicity of zzso zzso was modulated by zzso expression levels in both zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased cell survival induced by zzso and diminished zzso zzso while zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not a zzso inactive zzso version, prevented the toxicity of zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso target genes may be involved in these zzso This was confirmed by zzso both zzso and the inactive form of zzso which does not zzso protection levels similar to those showed with zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso protects from zzso toxicity by zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso through the zzso zzso suggesting a therapeutic potential for this signaling zzso in the treatment of Alzheimer's zzso
