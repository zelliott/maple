Previously, we observed that zzso treatment enhances zzso of the zzso nerve after crush injury zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso In this research, we studied expression of zzso receptors and effects of zzso on gene expression in the zzso spinal cord, following zzso nerve crush zzso Using the zzso Mouse zzso zzso changes in the expression of 267 of zzso genes were registered 4 days after nerve zzso Those genes that exhibited a change in signal intensity ratios of zzso or greater were selected as zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso treated mice, we have observed zzso of the genes known to control zzso cell zzso and growth, which might account for the positive effects of zzso on the zzso of motor zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso localized in the nucleus and zzso of zzso motor zzso and in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso was shown by traditional zzso Using real-time quantitative zzso we demonstrated increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the injured side of the zzso spinal zzso Western zzso analysis showed the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and revealed a zzso increase of activated zzso in zzso treated mice, compared to zzso Our findings indicate that: zzso zzso motor zzso increase expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the expression of genes which accelerate the growth and maturation of zzso and zzso zzso receptors are transported from the zzso into zzso zzso and zzso promotes zzso locally through the zzso zzso signaling zzso
