zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso is a progressive genetic syndrome with an zzso of zzso in the population, arising from inherited zzso in the genes for zzso kidney disease 1 zzso or zzso kidney disease 2 zzso Typical onset is in middle age, with gradual replacement of zzso tissue with thousands of zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso disease requiring dialysis or kidney zzso There currently are no approved therapies to slow or cure zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso genes zzso activate multiple signaling proteins and pathways regulating cell zzso many of which we observe, through network construction, to be regulated by heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso zzso with a small zzso zzso zzso the degradation of many zzso zzso client proteins in zzso primary kidney cells and in zzso Using a conditional zzso mouse model to zzso zzso in zzso we find that weekly administration of zzso over 10 zzso significantly reduces initial formation of zzso zzso and kidney growth and slows the progression of these zzso in mice with zzso zzso These improved disease zzso are accompanied by improved indicators of kidney function and reduced expression and activity of zzso clients and their zzso with the degree of zzso zzso with zzso expansion in individual zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is zzso and zzso zzso are selectively retained in zzso versus normal kidney zzso analogous to the situation observed in solid zzso These results provide an initial justification for evaluating zzso zzso as therapeutic agents for zzso
