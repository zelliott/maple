zzso a common toxic side effect of chemotherapy, is characterized by an arrest of cell proliferation and a loss of gut barrier function, which may cause treatment reduction or zzso zzso integrity depends on nutritional and zzso factors, including the balance between protein synthesis and zzso The effects of zzso zzso a frequently used zzso zzso on zzso zzso and gut barrier function were investigated in zzso Male zzso rats received zzso zzso of zzso zzso during 3 days and were zzso at Day 4 zzso or Day 7 zzso We observed at zzso that zzso induced zzso damage and increased zzso zzso zzso and the zzso concentration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso In addition, zzso height and zzso content significantly zzso zzso zzso was also affected by zzso as zzso D activity increased at zzso whereas zzso zzso activity decreased and zzso activities remained zzso At zzso zzso D activity was restored to control levels, but zzso activity remained zzso This disruption of zzso pathways strongly contributed to zzso and requires further zzso zzso zzso activity may be considered the main zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso integrity and zzso zzso during zzso as zzso D activity was found to be correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulation could possibly be an zzso process for zzso Future investigation is warranted to target zzso pathways with protective nutritional or pharmacological therapies during zzso
