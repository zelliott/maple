zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso muscle increases protein synthesis at 3 days after zzso zzso and degradation at zzso such that net protein breakdown is evident by zzso On the basis of existing models of protein balance, we examined zzso changes in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso which can lead to increased protein synthesis via zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and increased protein degradation via zzso box protein O zzso zzso zzso was measured using Western analyses through zzso zzso zzso decreased at 1 h and 6 h after zzso compared with sham despite decreased zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso returned to sham levels by zzso zzso of their downstream zzso zzso zzso did not change at any time point after zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso increased only by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso increased zzso at zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso Thus, following zzso there are differential effects on protein synthetic pathways with preferential zzso of zzso and zzso over zzso zzso nuclear zzso occurred by zzso consistent with its role in increasing expression of zzso necessary for subsequent zzso zzso evident by zzso On the basis of our results, increased protein synthesis following zzso is associated with changes in zzso zzso but protein degradation results from zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso No single trigger is responsible for protein balance following zzso zzso balance in skeletal muscle depends on multiple zzso pathways that should be studied in zzso
