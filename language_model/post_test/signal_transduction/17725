Plasma HDL has been reported to protect against the initial development of inflammatory zzso Although cellular and molecular mechanisms of this HDL protection are not fully zzso they may involve prevention of the zzso trafficking of circulating zzso via its zzso of inflammatory zzso To test this hypothesis, HDL zzso of zzso adherence to the zzso and of the expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and its zzso regulatory mechanism were zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso by zzso zzso Plasma HDL zzso zzso zzso markedly prevented the zzso zzso to zzso zzso with zzso the increased expression levels of zzso protein and its zzso at a zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that in the activated zzso HDL substantially inhibited DNA binding activities of zzso factors of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have binding sites in the promoter region of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso analysis confirmed that HDL inhibited zzso zzso expression via reduced nuclear zzso of zzso These results suggest that HDL zzso the expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso at zzso levels via blunted zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Plasma HDL may block the initial zzso process via inhibited zzso zzso to the zzso which is independent of modulating the cholesterol reverse transport of plasma zzso
