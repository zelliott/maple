zzso signaling molecules released from a restricted source are of great importance during embryonic development because they elicit zzso zzso zzso and patterning events in target cells zzso zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor family with key zzso functions during zzso development of, for example, the zzso , zzso , zzso , heart , inner ear , and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which the signaling range of zzso is controlled in a field of target cells is zzso We studied zzso as a potential zzso in the nascent zzso of living zzso zzso We find that spreading of zzso zzso through target tissue is carefully controlled by zzso and subsequent degradation in zzso or zzso zzso from zzso zzso If zzso is zzso zzso protein accumulates zzso spreads further, and activates target gene expression over a greater zzso zzso enhanced zzso increases zzso zzso and shortens its effective signaling zzso Our results suggest that zzso spreads zzso by a zzso mechanism and demonstrate that target cells can actively influence, through zzso and subsequent degradation, the availability of zzso zzso to other target zzso
