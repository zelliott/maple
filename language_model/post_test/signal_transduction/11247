zzso cells from patients inheriting the rare zzso and zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso exhibit defects in the zzso of zzso checkpoints after exposure to zzso zzso In particular, the failure of AT cells to arrest zzso the DNA de zzso replication machinery immediately after zzso zzso DNA synthesis zzso often taken as a molecular hallmark of the zzso Recently we reported that: zzso the zzso zzso checkpoint operating in normal human cells is zzso by a signal zzso zzso involving zzso protein zzso II zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of AT cells is associated with failure to mobilize zzso from zzso stores, which is required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso of AT zzso zzso can be zzso in the absence of zzso expression of functional zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso by the gene zzso in zzso Correction of zzso was observed when AT zzso were zzso with normal zzso under conditions in which the 2 different cell cultures shared the same medium but were completely separated zzso The zzso trait was also zzso when AT zzso were briefly incubated with zzso zzso in the absence of normal zzso cells, signifying that this ubiquitous zzso can serve as the zzso zzso zzso for AT cells in the aforementioned zzso zzso It would therefore appear that zzso zzso can assume the role of an zzso signaling zzso of the zzso checkpoint in AT cells exposed to zzso radiation, inducing DNA synthesis shutdown via an alternative, zzso signal zzso zzso
