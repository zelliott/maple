The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso receptors detect viral zzso acid and signal through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso and zzso during a viral zzso zzso zzso leads to the rapid production of zzso zzso including type 1 zzso Although zzso is vital to zzso zzso its regulation from within the zzso remains zzso Here we describe human zzso a highly zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso family member zzso as zzso that zzso to the zzso outer membrane and interacts with zzso zzso of zzso results in the potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso promoter activity and in the disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with small interference zzso promotes zzso type I zzso production and decreases viral zzso This work identifies zzso as a check against zzso zzso responses and represents an intersection of three ancient cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso virus detection and the use of zzso as a platform for zzso zzso This represents a conceptual advance, in that zzso is a zzso of zzso molecular pattern receptors rather than a zzso and identifies a key therapeutic target for enhancing zzso zzso
