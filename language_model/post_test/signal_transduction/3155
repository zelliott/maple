zzso mapping has identified both zzso and zzso zzso stem cells, but the molecular zzso controlling stem cell zzso is incompletely zzso By lineage zzso we show zzso a zzso zzso marks predominately zzso zzso stem cells that are located at the zzso base and that, upon injury, zzso and divide to replenish damaged zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso stem cells differs markedly from the profiling of highly zzso zzso zzso stem zzso genes zzso in the zzso population include those involved in cell cycle repression and response to zzso zzso Loss of zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso results in heightened zzso expression and zzso zzso These results shed light on the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso stem cells and zzso model in which zzso stem cell zzso is maintained by zzso zzso signaling with loss of a negative regulator zzso to zzso
