The possible role of the peripheral zzso zzso zzso in zzso migration was investigated by using human zzso zzso cells differentiated into zzso cells and human zzso isolated from whole zzso Cell surface expression of zzso on zzso cells, on zzso zzso cells, and on human zzso was confirmed by flow zzso Upon stimulation with either of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells rapidly extended and zzso one or more zzso containing zzso in different directions instead of developing zzso polarity typically exhibited by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso decreased in response to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso Moreover, treatment of cells with zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso yielded zzso organization similar to that of zzso zzso In human zzso neither zzso nor zzso induced zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with these zzso disrupted zzso zzso zzso polarization and migration and also substantially suppressed zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might play a role in regulating excessive inflammatory response by controlling zzso zzso thereby suppressing zzso zzso
