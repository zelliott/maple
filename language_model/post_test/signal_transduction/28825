The innate immune system is the first line of defense against zzso zzso such as bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso play an important role in the innate immune system by zzso zzso and eliminating zzso It has been suggested that zzso membrane zzso of zzso are involved in these innate immune responses, including zzso generation, cell migration, and zzso zzso zzso a neutral zzso forms zzso zzso together with the zzso family zzso zzso on the zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso have been suggested to play important roles in innate immune function of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain largely zzso Recent zzso analyses of zzso from zzso have provided insight into membrane zzso functions in the processes of zzso In this review, we discuss the membrane zzso immune functions of zzso focusing on those functions of zzso zzso and recent zzso approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso
