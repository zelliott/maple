zzso pathways are the cornerstone on understanding cell function and predicting cell zzso Recently, logical models of zzso pathways have been zzso with zzso zzso data to construct zzso specific zzso However, less is known on how zzso pathways can be linked to a cellular response such as cell growth, death, zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

In this work, we measure the zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso behavior zzso zzso of normal and cancer zzso treated with a combination of zzso and zzso Using the two zzso we construct zzso pathways that integrate zzso activity with cellular responses using a hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso logic is used whenever a zzso knowledge is accessible zzso construction of zzso zzso whereas a zzso approach is used for linking cellular behavior to zzso activity via zzso zzso The extended zzso is subsequently zzso to fit zzso and zzso data using an zzso Linear zzso zzso As a result, we are able to construct maps of primary and transformed zzso downstream of 7 receptors that are capable of explaining the zzso of 22 zzso 

We developed a method for constructing extended pathways that start at the zzso level and via a complex zzso zzso zzso identify those mechanisms that drive cellular zzso Our results constitute a zzso for construction of zzso zzso that are capable of linking zzso activity to diverse responses such as growth, death, zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso
