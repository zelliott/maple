zzso acid zzso is a zzso released from zzso that has multiple zzso zzso The present study evaluated the potential of zzso to zzso tissue repair and zzso by zzso human lung zzso contraction of three-dimensional collagen zzso The contraction of native collagen gels caused by human fetal lung zzso was zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso The estimated median effective concentration was 3 zzso zzso zzso which was well below the zzso likely released by zzso in zzso zzso contraction was not blocked by zzso toxin or zzso toxin but was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso Neither calcium zzso nor protein zzso C appeared to play a zzso In contrast, the effect of zzso appeared to depend on a zzso inhibited by zzso but not by zzso or zzso suggesting a process that depends on zzso C and may involve a novel protein zzso By modulating zzso zzso zzso could play a role in the tissue zzso that characterizes wound zzso
