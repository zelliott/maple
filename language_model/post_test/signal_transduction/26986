zzso and zzso zzso in human Alzheimer's disease zzso are correlated with selective zzso loss in nucleus zzso of zzso In search of an animal model of zzso zzso deficits, we examined the effects of zzso (2 weeks) and long- (3 and 6 zzso term zzso of the nucleus zzso zzso zzso on zzso parameters in rat zzso zzso zzso were performed by unilateral injection of zzso acid into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in the zzso remained significantly decreased zzso as compared to zzso up to 6 months after the placement of the zzso zzso zzso content was increased by zzso in the zzso frontal zzso 6 months zzso but not at shorter time zzso zzso of zzso Y (which is extensively zzso with zzso in the zzso were not significantly altered after unilateral zzso zzso at any time zzso A zzso decrease in zzso binding capacity as well as a marked reduction of zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicative of a loss of functional zzso zzso was observed in zzso versus zzso frontal zzso on brain tissue zzso after short-term unilateral zzso zzso By film zzso the loss in zzso binding sites was localized to both superficial and deep layers of the frontal zzso This loss persisted up to 3 months but was no longer apparent after 6 months due to a decrease in zzso binding capacity on the zzso zzso
