zzso zzso factor 3 zzso is a zzso gene and encodes a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso However, the zzso significance of zzso induction by stress signals is not zzso In this report, we describe several lines of evidence supporting a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso First, zzso is induced in beta cells by signals relevant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide, and high zzso of zzso and zzso Second, induction of zzso is zzso in part by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso signaling zzso two zzso pathways implicated in both type 1 and type 2 zzso Third, transgenic mice expressing zzso in beta cells develop abnormal zzso and defects secondary to zzso zzso Fourth, zzso knockout zzso are partially protected from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in the zzso of zzso diabetic mice that have developed zzso or zzso Taken together, our results suggest zzso to be a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso
