zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso is an zzso member of the zzso lacking the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso loop, carrying a unique zzso extension and being mainly regulated by its own protein stability and/or by zzso Here we show that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso protein zzso 5 zzso or zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and to zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is independent of zzso zzso activity, but depends on its own zzso activity as well as on a region in the zzso extension of zzso In mouse embryonic development, zzso expression patterns of zzso and zzso suggest zzso zzso of both zzso zzso of zzso leads to strong reduction of zzso protein levels and embryonic zzso at about stage zzso where zzso expression in zzso mice is zzso indicating a role of this zzso module in zzso
