zzso acid zzso is a fatty zzso signaling zzso that regulates a broad range of plant defense responses against zzso and some microbial zzso zzso genetic studies in zzso have established that zzso also performs a critical role in zzso and zzso development but is not essential for other zzso aspects of the plant's life zzso Here, we describe the zzso and molecular characterization of a sterile zzso of tomato zzso zzso zzso that is defective in zzso zzso Although the zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso was caused by a zzso in the maternal control of seed zzso which was associated with the loss of zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor proteins in zzso zzso zzso plants exhibited several zzso zzso including the inability to express zzso zzso severely compromised resistance to zzso zzso zzso and abnormal development of zzso zzso We demonstrate that these defects are caused by the loss of function of the tomato zzso of zzso zzso an zzso protein that is required for zzso processes in zzso These findings indicate that the zzso signaling zzso regulates distinct zzso processes in different plants and suggest a role for zzso in the promotion of zzso zzso zzso
