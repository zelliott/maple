zzso is thought to induce zzso differentiation toward multiple lineages including zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a long-standing paradox in stem cell zzso Here we zzso zzso function in zzso and mouse zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with zzso (via zzso to induce zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso These conditions induced cells with high levels of zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso was necessary for and preceded zzso zzso both genes were essential for expression not only of zzso genes but also of zzso zzso zzso expression of the latter was seen in the absence of zzso but these cells zzso zzso genes and zzso they differed in cell surface and zzso properties from zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso human and mouse zzso stem cells primarily to form zzso rather than zzso acting through zzso and zzso
