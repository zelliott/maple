zzso zzso cells zzso isolated at the same time and then cultured with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso keep a zzso of immature DC zzso et zzso zzso As DC from other sources are known to undergo a rapid maturation in zzso we hypothesized that the maintenance of zzso DC in an immature state might be caused by zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso DC could change their zzso in response to zzso stimulation of zzso Over an zzso period of culture, the population of DC increased zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso and decreased by more than zzso in the absence of zzso The increase in the DC population was related to DC zzso whereas the reduction of the number of DC was secondary to a loss of zzso zzso and subsequent cell zzso In the presence of zzso DC acquired and maintained a high capacity for zzso labeled zzso expressed the zzso zzso and exposed zzso class II molecules at the cell zzso On the contrary, DC cultured without zzso were devoid of zzso activity and zzso zzso and, after 2 days, no longer exposed zzso class II molecules at the cell zzso Using zzso media and enriched DC zzso we show that zzso in response to zzso produce soluble factors capable of zzso proliferation and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso stimulating factor and transforming growth zzso known to be produced by zzso reproduced the effects of zzso zzso These data, giving evidence of a zzso signaling process between zzso and zzso cells in zzso suggest that zzso could promote the maintenance of a population of immature DC within the zzso zzso
