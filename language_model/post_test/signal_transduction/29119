zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a key player in the regulation of cell growth and energy metabolism via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The activity and zzso zzso of zzso are regulated by multiple zzso zzso in response to diverse zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs through the action of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and tumor zzso zzso and zzso We report here that, in addition to zzso zzso are zzso in zzso The pattern of zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso point to zzso degradation of zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso of zzso are located in the zzso domain and that the zzso and zzso regulatory regions zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso also could be regulated through the zzso turnover of zzso
