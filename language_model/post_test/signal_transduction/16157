zzso peripheral zzso T cells can be converted into zzso regulatory T cells under appropriate stimulation zzso Considering that continuous exposure to zzso is one of the zzso for the differentiation and maintenance of zzso cells, we investigated whether preventing zzso cell death while providing continuous zzso stimulation could promote the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso T zzso Among the several zzso agents tested, zzso acid zzso was found to induce the in zzso conversion of zzso zzso T cells into zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso studies with an zzso against transforming growth factor zzso revealed that zzso requires the presence of zzso to induce zzso expression in zzso zzso T zzso Although zzso itself did not activate the zzso signaling pathway, it zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso signaling cascade in activated T zzso Lastly, combined exposure to zzso and zzso had a synergistic effect on the rate of induction and maintenance of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso could be exploited to efficiently prepare zzso regulatory T cells in zzso and may aid in more precisely identifying the specific signaling pathways that drive zzso expression in T zzso
