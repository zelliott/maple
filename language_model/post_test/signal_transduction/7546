Fibrosis in response to tissue damage or persistent inflammation is a pathological hallmark of many chronic degenerative zzso By using a model of acute zzso zzso we have examined how repeated inflammatory zzso promotes zzso tissue zzso In this context, zzso was strictly dependent on zzso zzso Repeat inflammation induced zzso T helper 1 zzso cell zzso commitment and the emergence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity within the zzso zzso Fibrosis was not observed in mice lacking zzso zzso zzso or zzso Here, zzso and zzso signaling disrupted the turnover of zzso zzso by zzso Whereas zzso mice resisted fibrosis, transfer of polarized zzso cells or zzso of zzso activity reversed this zzso Thus, zzso causes compromised tissue repair by shifting acute inflammation into a more chronic zzso state through induction of zzso cell responses as a consequence of zzso zzso
