Research on programmed cell death in plants is providing insight into the primordial mechanism of programmed cell death in all zzso Much of the attention in studies on animal programmed cell death has focused on determining the importance of signal zzso termed zzso However, it has recently been shown that cell death can still occur even when the zzso cascade is zzso revealing that there is an underlying zzso default zzso Many programmed plant cell deaths also appear to be zzso Shared features of plant and animal programmed cell death can be used to deduce the primordial components of zzso programmed cell zzso From this perspective, we must ask whether the zzso is a common factor that can serve in plant and animal cell death as a stress sensor and as a zzso of programmed cell zzso
