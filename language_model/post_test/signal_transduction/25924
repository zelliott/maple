zzso acid zzso has shown efficacy in the treatment of diabetes and zzso however, its molecular targets and the mechanisms of action underlying its zzso effects remain zzso This study investigates the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso as molecular targets for zzso We demonstrate that zzso increases zzso zzso reporter activity in zzso zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso expression in zzso although it does not bind to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies provide evidence that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso with the association of zzso with G zzso we provide evidence that zzso increases zzso zzso in immune zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso production via a zzso zzso mechanism possibly involving zzso of zzso zzso and suppression of zzso and nuclear factor of activated T zzso zzso challenge studies in zzso zzso and immune zzso zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 expression in zzso and T cells in zzso through a zzso zzso zzso Global zzso profiling and zzso quantitative zzso suggest novel candidate targets and demonstrate that zzso treatment zzso the effect of zzso on the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and cell zzso in part, through zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso decreases zzso inflammation and regulates innate immune responses through a zzso zzso involving zzso and an alternative, zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
