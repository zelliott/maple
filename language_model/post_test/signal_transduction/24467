zzso zzso in the plasma zzso zzso rich in cholesterol and zzso have been implicated in a number of important membrane zzso zzso zzso has been used to define membrane zzso zzso However, such an approach does not directly contribute to the understanding of the size and the lifetime of zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso and the function of zzso in the membrane in zzso To address these issues, we have developed pulse zzso spin labeling and single zzso tracking optical techniques for studies of zzso in both artificial and cell zzso In this review, we zzso our results and perspectives obtained by using these zzso We emphasize the importance of clearly distinguishing zzso zzso zzso shorter than a zzso in zzso cells and stabilized zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso lifetime over a few zzso We propose that these stabilized zzso further induce zzso greater zzso zzso zzso lifetime on the order of a zzso for signaling by coalescing other zzso zzso including those in the inner leaflet of the zzso each containing perhaps one zzso of the downstream zzso zzso At zzso with the general view, we emphasize the importance of cholesterol segregation from the zzso zzso zzso membrane for formation of the zzso rather than the affinity of cholesterol and saturated zzso zzso In the zzso mixture of cholesterol and an zzso zzso cholesterol is zzso out from the bulk zzso zzso phase, forming zzso zzso or clustered cholesterol zzso probably due to the lateral zzso between the rigid zzso zzso ring structure of cholesterol and the rigid bend of the zzso zzso chain at zzso However, such zzso zzso are small, perhaps consisting of only several cholesterol zzso and are short-lived, on the order of zzso zzso We speculate that these zzso zzso may be stabilized by the presence of saturated zzso chains of zzso or zzso and also by clustered raft zzso In the influenza viral zzso one of the simplest forms of a biological zzso the lifetime of a protein and zzso domain was evaluated to be on the order of 100 zzso again showing the short lifetime of zzso in an zzso zzso Finally, we propose a zzso Lego model for zzso as the basic building blocks for signaling pathways in the plasma zzso
