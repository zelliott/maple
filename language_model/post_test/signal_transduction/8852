zzso G protein signaling regulates many processes in zzso such as development, zzso and secondary zzso zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso regulates zzso and secondary zzso production in this zzso The dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso active zzso zzso zzso was introduced in zzso zzso by zzso resulting in a zzso characterized by low zzso and slow zzso In this work, the effect of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso stress zzso and zzso C production of zzso zzso was zzso zzso triggered zzso in the absence of a carbon source, in addition to zzso regulating zzso and zzso stress zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso also had an important effect on zzso C zzso increasing production and maintaining high levels of the zzso throughout a culture period of 30 zzso Together, the results suggest that G zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of these three processes in zzso zzso
