A novel strategy has been suggested to enhance zzso cancer therapy through combining zzso target of zzso zzso with an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, recent study demonstrated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso acid zzso differentiation of acute zzso leukemia zzso cells, prompting us to investigate the effects of zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso on both proliferation and zzso capacity of zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso exerted minimal zzso effects, and combining zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso inhibited proliferation more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells, but the combination of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells more than zzso inhibitor zzso These results demonstrate that, although the combination of zzso inhibitor and zzso is more effective in zzso proliferation of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso has more zzso effects on zzso differentiation than the presence of zzso alone, and diminishes positive effects of zzso on leukemia cell zzso
