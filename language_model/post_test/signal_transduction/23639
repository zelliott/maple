Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the zzso zzso However, a limitation to such treatment is the occurrence of zzso Several mechanisms have been identified to be responsible for the development of resistance, either zzso or zzso In order to overcome resistance due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are being clinically developed with promising zzso However, also in this case resistance inevitably zzso It has been recently reported that zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, may be involved in the establishment of drug zzso 

Three melanoma cell lines were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by an zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed on total protein extracts using zzso zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso The expression of zzso after zzso treatment was assessed by Real Time zzso and Western zzso The growth zzso effects of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso were evaluated by in zzso colony formation zzso 

In the present study we demonstrate that zzso is the main zzso undergoing rapidly zzso upon either treatment with a zzso inhibitor or with a zzso inhibitor in a panel of melanoma cell lines harboring a variety of zzso zzso and that this results in a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is fully zzso by the simultaneous use of zzso zzso zzso which are also shown to zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso of both zzso and zzso pathways and in the zzso of melanoma cell zzso We show that zzso of zzso is due to an zzso loop involving increased zzso and production of zzso by melanoma zzso 

On the basis of these results, we propose that initial zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be pursued as a strategy to reduce the zzso feedback survival mechanism and enhance duration of clinical zzso
