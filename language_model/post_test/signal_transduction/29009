Although many of the zzso effects of zzso stress hormones on zzso function are well zzso the underlying zzso mechanisms are only starting to be zzso Linking physiology and zzso has proven to be a complicated task, despite the emergence of large-scale gene expression profiling technology in the last zzso This is in part due to the complexity of zzso in part due to the complexity of the brain zzso The presence of a zzso zzso system for zzso hormones in zzso brain structures, the coexistence of membrane and zzso receptors and the highly contextual action of zzso contribute to this zzso In addition, the anatomical complexity, extensive cellular zzso of brain and the modest changes in gene expression zzso in the range of zzso hamper detection of responsive zzso in particular of low abundant zzso such as many neurotransmitter receptors and growth zzso Nonetheless, ongoing research into central targets of zzso has identified many different functional gene classes that zzso the diverse effects of zzso on brain zzso These functional classes include genes involved in energy zzso signal zzso zzso structure, zzso zzso neurotransmitter zzso cell zzso genes zzso zzso factors and their receptors and genes involved in regulating zzso The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current status of the field on identification of central zzso targets, discuss the opportunities and pitfalls and highlight new developments in understanding central zzso zzso
