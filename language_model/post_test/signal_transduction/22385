zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso the production of zzso inflammatory zzso by binding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso in zzso has been identified previously as the binding site of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso signaling after binding to zzso remains zzso The present study demonstrated, using zzso that zzso interferes with zzso interactions between zzso and its zzso zzso Among 10 different human zzso zzso selectively bound to zzso The time course of the zzso effect of zzso on inflammatory zzso production corresponded to that of the binding of zzso to zzso zzso inhibited the association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso response element in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was also inhibited by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso binds selectively to zzso and subsequently zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso signal zzso and its downstream signaling zzso This work proposes a novel paradigm of a small zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso
