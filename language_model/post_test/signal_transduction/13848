Cell zzso to the zzso zzso is an essential element of various biological zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso components and zzso zzso The present study investigates the molecular organization of zzso zzso zzso The study demonstrates that in various mouse and human zzso cells zzso zzso cellular structures containing 2 zzso zzso bridged by a stretch of zzso zzso These structures are similar to zzso stress fibers zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference reduces zzso in majority of cells zzso zzso while zzso of zzso fragments revealed a critical role of a distinct sequence in the zzso domain of zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, the integrity of zzso fibers and zzso zzso activity contribute to zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in mouse and human zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly zzso formation of zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso is localized at zzso fibers and zzso zzso of zzso and might bridge zzso zzso to zzso zzso These findings provide a platform for defining the molecular mechanism regulating the organization and activities of zzso in response to zzso
