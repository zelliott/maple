zzso has been reported to induce zzso in a variety of zzso but little is demonstrated in oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The present study investigated the zzso of zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso effects of zzso in zzso human oral cancer zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells in a zzso manner and an zzso value of zzso was about 125 zzso for 24 h treatment using the zzso zzso Moreover, the cell cycle distribution was arrested at the zzso phase in zzso cells after zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso the expression of zzso was significantly decreased while that of zzso zzso and zzso was increased compared to the control group by western zzso zzso An increase in the expression of the active form of zzso was found in zzso cells, and the zzso activities were also zzso zzso zzso was blocked by specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells zzso zzso active zzso zzso were exposed to zzso at different zzso and cell growth remained zzso zzso exhibited minimal zzso effects on zzso zzso Taken together, zzso induced zzso phase arrest and provoked the intrinsic zzso zzso via zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso could be potentially zzso in the treatment of oral cancer in the zzso
