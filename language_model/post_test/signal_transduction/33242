The pharmacological effects caused by use of zzso are exerted through the zzso receptors zzso zzso couple to the zzso G protein zzso and result in decreased zzso levels upon zzso by specific zzso To initiate study of the zzso relationship during this process, we first zzso expressed the zzso delta OR and a zzso truncated zzso in zzso cells to investigate the necessity of its zzso The binding potency of both the zzso and truncated delta zzso to zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Their membrane zzso and ability to mediate signal zzso were also zzso We conclude that the zzso of delta OR is not essential for plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
