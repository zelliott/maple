The expression of zzso zzso in cardiac zzso is markedly induced during the development of heart failure in zzso and by stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Although recent studies have suggested a role for zzso zinc finger zzso factors in the zzso pathways that zzso cardiac zzso it is unknown whether these factors are also involved in cardiac zzso zzso and if so, how these factors are modulated during this zzso Using transient zzso zzso in primary cardiac zzso from zzso rats, we show here that the zzso element in the rat zzso promoter was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso element and activated the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso zzso by zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso and increased its ability to bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso responsive zzso cascade with zzso blocked the zzso increase in the DNA binding ability and the zzso of zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in cardiac zzso and that zzso responsive zzso 1/2 zzso plays a role upstream of zzso
