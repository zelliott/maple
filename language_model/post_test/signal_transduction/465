zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso play critical roles in zzso transition zzso a process that is essential for heart zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso and zzso signaling zzso induce Snail expression in zzso cells, which is required for zzso in cardiac cushion zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways by decreasing the expression of zzso and zzso and their target zzso In contrast, zzso increases zzso zzso expression and protein zzso and regulates the expression of zzso target genes in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the cardiac cushion of mouse embryonic hearts reduces zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a subset of genes by recruiting zzso to both zzso and zzso binding sites and zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso This is the first evidence that zzso zzso affects zzso expression and that cooperative induction of zzso zzso at specific promoters zzso the selective zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso
