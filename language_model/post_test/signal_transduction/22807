zzso signals are transmitted to zzso targets through many zzso zzso Each signaling zzso is composed of a network of interacting signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular zzso A zzso of the functional activities of these signaling molecules as a result of altered nutritional status could lead to qualitative and quantitative changes in cellular responses to zzso zzso Growing evidence now suggests that fatty acids can directly and indirectly zzso signaling pathways at multiple zzso zzso the mechanism of this zzso could help us to understand how different types of dietary fat modify the risks of many chronic zzso
