zzso zzso exploit the mutual zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso pathways to coordinate the zzso zzso of the main body axis with the progressive patterning and differentiation of its zzso and zzso zzso zzso The evolutionary history of this patterning system is still poorly zzso Here, we investigate the role played by the zzso and zzso signals during the development of the tail structures in the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso belonging to the sister zzso of zzso in which the zzso zzso body plan is established through very derived zzso zzso zzso zzso are constituted of few cells and develop according to a fixed zzso zzso of the tail occurs largely by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso We show that in the zzso zzso the antagonism of the zzso and zzso signals is required to control the zzso patterning of the tail zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways control the zzso patterning of the tail peripheral nervous system, and reveal the existence of distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso with different responsiveness to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data provide the first demonstration that the use of the antagonism between the zzso and zzso signals to pattern the main body axis predates the emergence of zzso and highlight the evolutionary plasticity of this patterning strategy, showing that in different zzso it can be used to pattern different zzso within the same zzso body zzso
