zzso act on zzso via zzso zzso receptors zzso but they also have rapid zzso zzso We have identified the zzso processes involved in the rapid actions of zzso in male zzso which also possess the classical zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso pm, zzso rapidly increased (1 zzso the zzso of the zzso factor zzso and this was inhibited by zzso toxin zzso zzso activated zzso a zzso of zzso within 15 s but had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all blunted the zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso within 5 zzso this was blocked by conventional protein zzso C and zzso zzso zzso The first activated membrane protein was the zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso which triggered a rapid (5 zzso increase in zzso calcium and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not modify the responses to zzso zzso an zzso zzso directed against the zzso binding domain recognized a protein at the plasma zzso The cascade of rapid effects triggered by zzso may involve the classical zzso at the plasma membrane or an zzso form of zzso that is insensitive to nuclear zzso
