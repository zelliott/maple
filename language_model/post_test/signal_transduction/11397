Because zzso zzso zzso frequently display zzso zzso zzso of zzso and increased expression of the zzso protein zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso by allowing zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cell lines having zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso Using normal zzso zzso we found zzso by zzso zzso to be zzso expressed in the lower zzso (which zzso zzso with zzso expression zzso Thus, zzso by progressively decreasing zzso and increasing zzso from zzso bottom to top, may limit the population size of stem cells and other zzso cells in the lower zzso zzso zzso may allow expansion of these zzso thereby initiating zzso
