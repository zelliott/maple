zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso development and zzso zzso signaling has been shown to protect immature or mature B cells from zzso zzso In this study, to understand the fate of zzso zzso B cells zzso by zzso engagement in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells were cultured with zzso and zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso We found that zzso was induced in the cultured B cells even in the presence of zzso signaling during the zzso days zzso We detected zzso of zzso expression followed by zzso zzso in this zzso process and zzso of the zzso in zzso B cells, indicating that zzso is a key regulator of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso signaling in zzso B zzso zzso this zzso zzso in zzso B cells was shown to be induced at the initiation of plasma cell differentiation at around the zzso stage, and zzso B cells cultured under these conditions differentiated into plasma zzso Additionally, transforming growth zzso was found to protect zzso B cells from zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Our identified zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso suggests a potential mechanism that regulates the elimination of peripheral B cells, which should be derived from zzso zzso zzso of bystander B cells and continuous stimulation with zzso including zzso in the presence of T cell help through zzso
