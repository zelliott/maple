zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso are the hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Opening of these channels is thought to trigger zzso zzso through the generation of zzso oxygen zzso However, we found that zzso zzso of the widely used zzso oxygen species indicator zzso in isolated liver and heart zzso was observed in the absence of zzso or zzso and therefore independent of zzso zzso The response was blocked by zzso zzso a role for the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso though, did not increase hydrogen zzso zzso production zzso measured with zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso but it also zzso zzso state 4 zzso even in zzso zzso excluding a role for zzso zzso Furthermore, we have shown previously that zzso is partially zzso and we hypothesized that fatty acid metabolism may explain the ability of this putative zzso zzso channel blocker to inhibit zzso zzso fluorescence, commonly used as an zzso of zzso channel zzso Indeed, consistent with our hypothesis, we found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data question the zzso zzso zzso hypothesis of zzso zzso did not evoke zzso (which zzso to zzso from the respiratory chain by a direct zzso and the zzso effects of this compound on zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not due to the opening of zzso zzso
