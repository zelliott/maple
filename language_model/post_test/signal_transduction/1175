zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an important classical zzso zzso that is expressed in zzso cells in the peripheral blood and zzso Recently, various novel zzso have been identified from several origins, such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso is closely related to inflammatory responses in the host defense mechanism and neurodegenerative zzso In the present study we identified several novel peptides by screening zzso libraries that inhibit the binding of one of zzso zzso zzso zzso to its specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso Among the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the most potent activity in terms of zzso zzso binding to zzso We also found that zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso resulting in the complete zzso of the zzso calcium increase, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso migration of cells toward zzso For the zzso specificity of zzso to the zzso family, we observed that zzso specifically inhibit the increase in zzso calcium by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and F zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cellular responses, we examined its effect on zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso generation and zzso migration of zzso were inhibited by zzso which also completely inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso is the first specific zzso zzso and is expected to be useful in the study of zzso signaling and in the development of drugs against zzso zzso
