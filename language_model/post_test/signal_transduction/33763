The zzso zzso zzso is recognized primarily as the site of synthesis and folding of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso provides stringent quality control systems to ensure that only correctly zzso functional proteins are released from the zzso and that zzso proteins are zzso The efficient functioning of the zzso is essential for most cellular activities and for zzso zzso that interfere with zzso function can disrupt zzso zzso impose stress to the zzso and subsequently cause zzso of unfolded or zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins detect the onset of zzso stress and initiate highly specific signaling pathways collectively called the zzso protein zzso zzso to restore normal zzso zzso However, if zzso zzso cannot be zzso in response to intense or prolonged zzso stress, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to protect the zzso by removing the stressed cells that produce zzso or malfunctioning zzso This chapter summarizes current understanding of zzso zzso zzso and reliable methods to examine zzso stress and zzso in zzso zzso Since the liver is the major organ dealing with zzso or pathological stress and is responsible for the zzso of chemical compounds, the experimental protocols described here focus on identification and characterization of zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso
