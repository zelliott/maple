To investigate the expression of zzso zzso and their correlation with pathological changes in the skeletal muscle of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 

We chose 7 zzso patients who were confirmed through clinical, zzso and pathological data as zzso patients group, and 7 patients without muscle pathological change as control zzso The age range of zzso patients group was from 6 to 35 years and disease duration was from 1 to 20 zzso The clinical spectrum included zzso zzso muscle weakness and zzso The serum zzso zzso ranged from zzso to 1 325 zzso zzso showed zzso changes together with zzso zzso zzso We performed muscle zzso in all the patients and tested total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso We compared the zzso zzso activity of zzso patients group with that of the control group and analyzed their correlation with the ratio of muscular zzso internal zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso muscle zzso revealed muscular zzso changes accompanied by peripherally placed zzso masses and numerous internal zzso Increased optical density zzso of zzso zzso zzso had been noted in zzso patients as compared with the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive linear correlation was observed between zzso zzso activity and muscle zzso proportion zzso group: zzso zzso zzso group: zzso zzso zzso group: zzso zzso But, no correlation was observed between zzso zzso and zzso masses or internal zzso 

zzso signaling zzso activity increased zzso in skeletal muscle of the zzso zzso Such zzso might be the cause of pathological muscle zzso
