zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in several zzso zzso and this study investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso reporter gene zzso activity in zzso cells zzso with a construct zzso containing the zzso to zzso region of the human zzso gene promoter linked to bacterial zzso This promoter sequence contains zzso zzso binding sites, zzso zzso zzso response element zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso promoter showed that both zzso and zzso sites were required for zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and DNA zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso bound the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso were also activated by zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso expression zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating that the mechanism of zzso induction by zzso involves zzso of zzso through zzso pathways of zzso zzso
