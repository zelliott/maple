The zzso peptides derived by zzso zzso from the zzso precursor protein zzso play a major role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso by forming zzso zzso complexes that have been shown to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the key zzso leading to zzso formation, and zzso mechanisms have been shown to control zzso zzso The present study sought to determine whether zzso expression is controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso of cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso expression up to twofold over zzso zzso Similar effects of zzso zzso were observed when protein zzso C was directly activated by zzso zzso However, when the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso expression was no longer zzso by the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso expression was suppressed by stimulation of zzso pathways via selective zzso binding or direct zzso of zzso zzso with zzso an effect that was prevented by zzso protein zzso zzso These results may explain the observed deterioration of zzso patients after initial improvements with zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso zzso
