zzso zzso are known to increase vulnerability to medical illness, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly zzso 

To identify zzso control pathways that are modified by chronic stress, we conducted zzso expression zzso on familial zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and matched control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso were conducted on peripheral blood zzso which are cells that have the ability to initiate and maintain many inflammatory zzso zzso cortisol was collected over the course of 3 days as volunteers went about normal zzso 

zzso patterns of cortisol zzso were similar to those of matched control zzso However, their zzso showed diminished expression of transcripts bearing response elements for zzso and heightened expression of transcripts with response elements for zzso a key zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed relative zzso in the inflammatory markers zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that even in the absence of excess zzso zzso stress brings about functional resistance to zzso in zzso which enables zzso of zzso zzso control zzso This persistent zzso of inflammatory mechanisms may contribute to stress-related morbidity and zzso
