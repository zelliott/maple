zzso the zzso of the global zzso regulator zzso is required for the induction of the zzso apparatus in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the precise role of zzso in photosynthesis zzso gene expression and its zzso with other regulators of zzso gene expression are of considerable importance to our understanding of the regulatory zzso governing spectral complex zzso Using a zzso and zzso double zzso strain, we obtained results which suggested that zzso is not involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso by which zzso gene expression is zzso emanating from the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso under zzso zzso The dominant effect of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso strain with respect to spectral complex formation under zzso conditions and restoration of a zzso zzso suggested that zzso of the zzso zzso to some extent zzso the requirement for zzso in the formation of spectral zzso Additional analyses revealed that zzso induction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in the zzso zzso zzso requires zzso Thus, zzso appears to be involved at multiple zzso involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso Additionally, zzso was also shown to be regulated by the zzso zzso system, in conjunction with zzso and zzso These and other results to be discussed permit us to more accurately describe the role of zzso as well as the interactions between the zzso zzso and other regulatory circuits in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
