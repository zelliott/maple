zzso interactions between zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso have been implicated in vascular zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso mechanisms underlying this are zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso is critically involved in synergistic interactions between zzso and zzso II and that it is upstream of zzso signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso 

zzso from zzso rats were zzso At low zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II alone did not influence zzso zzso whereas in combination they rapidly increased zzso zzso an effect blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso was attenuated by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively), but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso without effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso II zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso migration, effects blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso II zzso activate zzso an immediate signaling response, through zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso This is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso II interact to stimulate zzso such effects are zzso These findings indicate differential signaling in zzso II zzso and highlight the importance of zzso in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso II may be zzso useful in vascular zzso associated with abnormal zzso zzso
