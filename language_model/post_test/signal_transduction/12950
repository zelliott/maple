zzso of cold are zzso by specific zzso nerve endings excited by low temperature and zzso Here we identify a population of zzso cultured mouse zzso zzso zzso with a unique set of zzso zzso Their impulse activity during cooling and zzso application was similar to that of cold zzso fibers in zzso We show that cooling closes a background zzso channel, causing zzso and firing that is limited by the slower reduction of a zzso inward current zzso In zzso zzso firing is prevented by a slow, zzso zzso zzso current zzso that acts as an zzso zzso In addition, pharmacological blockade of zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso a finding that may explain cold zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that cold sensitivity is not associated to a specific zzso zzso but instead results from a favorable blend of zzso channels expressed in a small subset of sensory zzso
