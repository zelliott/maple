Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso played a critical role in zzso cochlear injury and that zzso known as a zzso zzso channel zzso induced a zzso effect against zzso zzso in zzso cells by the zzso of zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso cascade through zzso signaling but zzso zzso We report here that zzso markedly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso by gene transfer or pharmacological approaches attenuated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso of zzso signaling by pharmacological zzso or specific small interfering zzso significantly abolished the beneficial effects of zzso zzso also attenuated zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso especially zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso effectively blocked zzso zzso after zzso zzso Finally, orally zzso zzso the trade name of zzso suppressed the increase of zzso zzso by zzso in both serum and zzso of mice, whereas it increased zzso expression in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso a protective effect against zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and the resulting zzso of zzso zzso production in zzso and in zzso
