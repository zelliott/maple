zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was studied in slices and membrane preparations of zzso zzso from zzso aged zzso days zzso zzso of zzso promoted by zzso declined with age, the highest value being observed in zzso zzso and the lowest in zzso zzso However, when the slices were incubated with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the differences between the two ages were zzso suggesting a higher zzso activity in zzso zzso In membrane zzso although zzso zzso zzso activity was lower in zzso zzso the zzso zzso concentration zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso activity indicated a higher sensitivity of G protein to zzso at this zzso This hypothesis was reinforced by the observation that the binding of zzso to the membrane preparation was greater in zzso zzso In spite of these differences, the percentage of zzso zzso activity stimulation by zzso zzso was the same at both zzso These findings suggest that the decreased response evoked by zzso during development is probably due to increased zzso activity and a lower sensitivity of zzso zzso activity to zzso
