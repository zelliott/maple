zzso proteins are a family of zzso receptors that coordinate zzso cell fate decisions and differentiation in zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso signaling contributes to maintaining zzso zzso by modulating the zzso of cell zzso zzso in an in zzso model of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were grown at different stages of zzso representing zzso zzso and zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was blocked with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso gene expression was determined by zzso real-time zzso chain zzso 

Here we demonstrate that zzso is highly expressed in zzso and differentiated zzso and zzso cells, and that zzso and zzso zzso is enhanced by induction of differentiation with zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling with zzso impaired zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso cells at both zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso In contrast to protein levels, the amount of zzso transcripts were not significantly reduced after zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells grown at different stages of differentiation revealed no differences in the levels of zzso and zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso signaling at early stages of zzso cell zzso and suggest that zzso zzso contributes to maintaining a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
