The zzso of zzso zzso to electron transfer by the zzso zzso during biological nitrogen fixation is an important example of a zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure has been determined for the complex between the zzso and zzso components of zzso stabilized by zzso zzso zzso previously used as a zzso zzso analogue in zzso zzso The structure reveals that the zzso zzso has undergone substantial zzso zzso The zzso and zzso groups are stabilized through zzso contacts that are critical for zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso to facilitate electron zzso zzso in the zzso complex have broad implications for signal and energy zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso
