zzso transport zzso complexes A and B build and maintain primary zzso In the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso complex B genes cause zzso zzso but the influence of zzso complex A proteins on zzso development is not well zzso In the present study, we found that zzso deletion of the complex A gene zzso from collecting ducts zzso but did not completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developed collecting duct zzso by zzso day 5, with rapid zzso expansion and zzso dysfunction by day 15 and little remaining zzso tissue by day zzso In contrast to many models of zzso kidney disease, zzso zzso collecting ducts showed normal zzso positioning and no zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that disruption of oriented cell division is not a prerequisite to zzso formation in these zzso zzso collecting ducts had an increased zzso index, suggesting that cell proliferation may drive zzso expansion even with normal orientation of the zzso zzso In addition, we observed significant increases in expression of zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso of zzso and tissue zzso in highly zzso but not zzso zzso Taken together, these studies indicate that loss of zzso causes pronounced zzso zzso disease and suggest that abnormalities in several different pathways may influence zzso zzso
