To determine whether serum vascular zzso growth factor zzso levels and zzso gene expression in tumor tissue predict survival of diffuse large zzso zzso zzso patients treated with zzso 

zzso levels were measured in serum samples from 102 patients zzso zzso with high-risk zzso using a quantitative sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso array data set of tumor zzso from 32 patients was zzso used to determine zzso zzso and gene zzso All patients were treated in a zzso phase II study with six zzso zzso courses followed by systemic central nervous system zzso 

After a median follow-up time of 40 months, zzso zzso survival zzso was inferior in patients with high zzso levels compared to those with low levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The relative risk of progression or zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso capacity of zzso levels on zzso was most pronounced in the zzso of zzso center zzso In contrast to serum data, zzso zzso expression in the zzso tissue did not predict outcome, and no correlation was found between zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso level is a predictor of zzso after zzso and may help to further zzso high-risk zzso patients into low- and high-risk zzso
