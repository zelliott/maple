One important mechanism zzso T zzso zzso use to kill zzso transplanted or zzso targets is zzso of zzso that contain zzso agents such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso target cell killing is a complex process, involving initial zzso zzso zzso zzso that includes zzso influx and zzso of protein zzso C, shape changes that serve to bind the zzso to the target and, finally, zzso of zzso zzso at the site of contact with the target zzso Although there is reason to propose that multiple steps in the zzso process could involve the zzso zzso of zzso few studies have examined this issue, and those that have do not allow the specific zzso involved to be zzso We have used the potent zzso zzso zzso drugs zzso and zzso A to investigate the zzso dependence of defined processes that are expected to be important for zzso zzso zzso Our results, obtained using zzso human zzso zzso as a model system, are consistent with the idea that a functional zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso influx and for zzso shape zzso When cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment with either zzso or zzso A abolished zzso zzso However, when cells were zzso in a manner that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly altered, suggesting that the zzso zzso does not function as a barrier to zzso
