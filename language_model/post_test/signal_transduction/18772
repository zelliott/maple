zzso zzso signaling plays pivotal roles in tissue patterning and development in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso syndrome, a human genetic disorder associated with zzso abnormalities and increased zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also occur in sporadic forms of zzso and zzso zzso studies with mice have verified that zzso is a tumor zzso We previously identified a second zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated its distinct expression pattern during zzso suggesting a unique role in zzso Most notably, zzso is expressed in an overlapping pattern with zzso in the zzso compartment of developing hair zzso and is highly expressed in the developing limb zzso zzso and zzso Here, we describe the generation and zzso analysis of zzso zzso Our molecular analysis suggests that zzso likely represents a zzso zzso Despite the dynamic expression of zzso during zzso zzso mice are viable, zzso and apparently zzso Interestingly, adult zzso male animals develop skin zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso While functional compensation by zzso might account for the lack of a strong zzso zzso in zzso mice, our results suggest that normal zzso function is required for adult skin zzso
