zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a dynamic process that regulates cell zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are unique, zzso cells with a complex cellular organization consisting of a cell body, major zzso and foot processes zzso The zzso form a characteristic zzso pattern with zzso of neighboring zzso leaving in between zzso zzso that are covered by the slit zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso form the final barrier to zzso zzso affecting several zzso proteins cause disruption of the zzso barrier and zzso of the highly dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso regulating the plasticity of the zzso zzso zzso are therefore of critical importance for sustained kidney barrier zzso Dynamic regulation of the zzso zzso apparatus in zzso zzso is essential for sustained kidney filter zzso Thus, the zzso represents an excellent model system to study calcium signaling and zzso dynamics in a zzso zzso Here, we discuss the regulation of zzso zzso dynamics by zzso or zzso calcium influx and downstream zzso zzso signaling pathways and how these pathways are operative in other cells including zzso and cancer zzso
