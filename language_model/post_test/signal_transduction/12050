During the last decade, stem cell research has developed at an accelerated zzso Various types of stem cells have been tested for zzso zzso zzso Despite the zzso benefits of cell therapy success in clinical trials remains zzso The main obstacles to zzso of the zzso heart using stem cells are: 1) not every stem cell type can differentiate into zzso and 2) low survival rates of transplanted cells, due to the harsh environment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to improve transplantation efficacy of zzso stem cells and cardiac zzso cells in animal models of zzso zzso It has also been shown that transplantation of zzso cells decreases zzso size, prevents zzso zzso of the heart, and positively zzso development of zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevents extensive death of transplanted cells due to necrosis and zzso during long-term zzso or zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso is based on three main zzso zzso modification of cell zzso to help survival during zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso expression and zzso production, and an zzso in levels of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso of various zzso factors including the vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso and expression of zzso and zzso zzso enhancement in the formation of zzso and zzso zzso which play an important role in zzso and zzso of stem cells in the zzso zzso
