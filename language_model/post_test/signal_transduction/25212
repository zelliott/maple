Among the zzso C that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are activated through G zzso receptors zzso Although the regulation of the zzso by zzso and zzso G proteins has been extensively zzso little is known about the molecular zzso that regulate their zzso The zzso zzso carry a putative zzso zzso binding motif zzso at their zzso zzso which is implicated in specific interactions with anchor zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we identified zzso zzso regulatory factor 2 zzso as a protein that zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso interacts specifically with zzso but not with other zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso rather than with other zzso zzso This interaction required the zzso zzso sequence of zzso and the second zzso domain of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso cells, while zzso zzso lacking the second zzso domain, had no such zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso may act as a zzso underlying the process of zzso zzso
