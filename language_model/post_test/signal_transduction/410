zzso zzso zzso is one of most common and still poorly treated primary brain zzso In search for new therapeutic approaches, Bone zzso zzso zzso induce zzso commitment in zzso cells in zzso However, we recently suggested that zzso which is characteristic of the brain niche where zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso It seems apparent that a more complete understanding of the biology of zzso cells is needed, in particular considering the role played by zzso as a signaling pathways zzso zzso is controlled at the zzso and zzso level by zzso and, alike zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation in central nervous system zzso stem zzso 

Here, we investigate the role of zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso stability in primary zzso cells maintained under zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso cells, when acutely exposed to high oxygen tension, undergo zzso zzso zzso and that zzso acts in an analogous zzso zzso repression of zzso signaling is maintained by zzso through zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso stability by modulating zzso zzso and by controlling zzso zzso 2 zzso protein through zzso of zzso a zzso protein zzso 

In this study we zzso the molecular mechanisms by which two zzso zzso zzso and acute high oxygen exposure, control zzso zzso We previously reported that both these zzso by inducing zzso zzso affect zzso cells zzso We also found differences in high oxygen and zzso sensitivity between zzso cells and normal cells that should be further investigated to better define tumor cell zzso
