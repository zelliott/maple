The effects of a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on liver zzso after partial zzso were zzso A single injection of zzso inhibited DNA synthesis and caused zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was observed at 4 h after partial zzso with zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased to a zzso level at 15 zzso after partial zzso in zzso rats, while it was not detected until 30 zzso in the zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the injection of zzso markedly increased zzso and zzso zzso protein levels at 30 zzso after partial zzso An increase in zzso was also observed at 30 zzso after the zzso and was followed by the zzso of zzso protein expression at 1 h after partial zzso These results suggested that zzso induced zzso accompanied by the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression at an early stage of liver zzso
