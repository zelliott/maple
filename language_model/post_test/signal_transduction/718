zzso control of the timing and magnitude of zzso signaling is essential for the normal development of many zzso but the feedback zzso that regulate zzso are poorly zzso zzso T cells provide an excellent context to address this zzso zzso signals initiate zzso development and increase in intensity during maturation of early zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso As zzso cells undergo zzso during which cells expressing functionally rearranged zzso zzso and differentiate into zzso zzso zzso signaling is abruptly zzso In this report, we investigate the mechanisms that control zzso expression during zzso We show that zzso and zzso directly regulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Following successful zzso zzso signaling rapidly zzso zzso zzso via signals that zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso with a regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maintain zzso transcription, whereas enforced zzso expression decreases zzso expression and abrogates zzso zzso zzso These data provide new insights into zzso regulation in zzso zzso and reveal a direct link between zzso signaling and zzso expression during zzso zzso Our findings also suggest new strategies for zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso
