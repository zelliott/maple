A novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso was characterized in the zzso cells of barley zzso In this investigation, the zzso zzso of zzso and the relative rates of zzso and zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in the plasma membrane and zzso membrane pools were zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso were present in plasma membrane and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso was greater than into zzso in both the plasma zzso and zzso zzso at all time points investigated, thus suggesting a higher rate of zzso however, the data do not zzso reduced breakdown of labeled zzso as a contributing zzso In zzso studies were conducted to investigate the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso zzso 58 and zzso zzso zzso significant enhancement in the zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso had little or no zzso This is the first evidence for zzso zzso zzso
