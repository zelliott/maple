The insect upper zzso zzso a zzso structure anterior to the mouth zzso Whether the zzso represents a fused pair of zzso zzso or evolved independently is heavily zzso Here, we identify additional similarities of the regulatory gene network active in zzso and trunk zzso However, we do not find a zzso zzso boundary and we show that zzso zzso expression is independent of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression in all trunk zzso does require these zzso Finally, we identify crucial differences between the location of the zzso and trunk zzso the zzso develops in median rather than lateral zzso and is part of an anterior zzso tissue marked by and dependent on zzso zzso To reconcile these seeming contradictory results, we propose that the genetic network evolved in either zzso or trunk zzso and became redeployed at a novel location to form the other zzso
