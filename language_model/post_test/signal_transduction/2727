Recent studies have shown that zzso are capable of generating and releasing zzso illustrating a novel zzso aspect of zzso in regulating allergic inflammation by either zzso or zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso generation was examined by determination of zzso zzso as a main zzso Both complement zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to release zzso but zzso zzso factor zzso did not exert any significant zzso The generation of zzso by zzso was absolutely dependent on the presence of zzso zzso zzso toxin completely attenuated zzso and zzso zzso production, indicating the involvement of zzso zzso G proteins in the signal zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso promoted zzso zzso production via zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso but not zzso induced significant zzso of zzso zzso factor from zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso stimulate zzso to elaborate zzso which could be an important mechanism in the regulation of allergic zzso
