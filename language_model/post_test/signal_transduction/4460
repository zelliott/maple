zzso triggers a zzso alarm reaction to zzso It remains unknown, however, whether zzso signaling activated by zzso is relevant for zzso cells zzso release from bone zzso To this end, we investigated the role of the zzso substance P zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso in PC zzso and zzso during zzso in mice and in human zzso 

The mouse bone zzso contains sensory fibers and PC that express zzso Moreover, zzso migration provides enrichment for PC that express zzso and promote zzso zzso after transplantation in a mouse model of limb zzso Acute zzso zzso and limb zzso increase SP levels in peripheral blood, decrease SP levels in bone zzso and stimulate the zzso of zzso PC, with these effects being zzso by systemic administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, bone zzso zzso with zzso cells results in depressed PC zzso delayed blood flow recovery, and reduced zzso after zzso We next asked whether SP is instrumental to PC zzso and zzso in patients with zzso Human PC express zzso and zzso migration provides enrichment for zzso zzso Patients with acute zzso zzso show high circulating levels of SP and zzso cells that zzso PC zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso PC are abundant in zzso hearts but not in hearts that developed an zzso after zzso 

Our data highlight the role of SP in zzso zzso zzso signaling may represent a novel target of zzso zzso
