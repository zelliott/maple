zzso receptors zzso recognize specific microbial products and elicit innate immune signals to activate specific zzso factors that induce protective zzso such as zzso zzso is localized to zzso and recognizes zzso zzso zzso which is generated by zzso infected or zzso zzso zzso has been genetically linked to several human diseases, including some without viral zzso Unlike other zzso zzso requires zzso of two specific zzso zzso in its zzso domain to recruit the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein inducing zzso and initiate the zzso zzso We showed that two protein zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso to zzso zzso and zzso the two zzso zzso In cells lacking zzso or treated with an inhibitor of zzso viral replication was enhanced and induction of zzso genes was zzso Thus, these results reveal a connection between zzso innate immunity and cell growth zzso
