zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 158 zzso (1997) zzso zzso Cell zzso 112 zzso zzso (1999) zzso To zzso functional consequences of this interaction, we studied zzso cells from zzso knockout animals and compared them to zzso expressing zzso cells zzso zzso Cell 11 zzso zzso zzso We noted an increase in the expression of zzso protein in zzso expressing zzso zzso Further, by zzso zzso localized to the cell membrane as well as to the nucleus in zzso positive zzso cells, whereas cells not expressing zzso stained for zzso only at the zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that zzso lacking the majority of the zzso domain promotes significantly less zzso of zzso active zzso than full-length zzso Finally, we note an increased zzso rate in the zzso zzso cells compared to the zzso cells lacking zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso an zzso zzso affects cell proliferation via zzso of zzso active zzso
