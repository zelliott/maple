zzso promotes differentiation and zzso of zzso cells by suppressing zzso signaling and a range of zzso gene zzso However, zzso a common target of zzso and zzso zzso is distinctly zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating potential effects of zzso in zzso expression and zzso efficiency of zzso To clarify this point, the status of zzso signaling and the consequence of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells without and with zzso treatment were evaluated by several experimental zzso The results revealed that zzso activated zzso signaling in both cell lines at the zzso treatment point, and the treated cells zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and, eventually, zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso zzso and zzso expression and committed zzso cells to zzso at the zzso time point without the step of zzso zzso On the other hand, a single 50 zzso zzso zzso treatment activated zzso signaling accompanied with sustained proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso between the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso production was found in zzso of zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our zzso and zzso results thus demonstrate the dual effects of zzso signaling on zzso cells by delaying zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression or by involvement in zzso differentiation in the absence of zzso zzso appropriate zzso of zzso zzso may enhance the zzso efficacy of zzso
