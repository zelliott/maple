zzso diseases impart a vast burden on affected individuals and the overall health care zzso Progressive loss of zzso zzso cells and functional decline following injury are often zzso zzso and zzso receptors are zzso involved in zzso development and contribute to inflammatory kidney zzso We specifically determined the participation of zzso zzso following zzso injury and in inflammatory zzso Here we show by heat map analyses that zzso transcripts are zzso in human kidney zzso A similar response was zzso with kidney cells following zzso exposure in zzso The zzso unilateral zzso obstruction zzso model mirrors hallmarks of zzso injury and zzso A subset of zzso and zzso cells demonstrated zzso zzso zzso expression in diseased zzso We hypothesized a relevance of zzso receptors for the zzso zzso To address this question, animals with genetic zzso of zzso zzso were zzso following zzso As a result, we found that zzso animals are protected from zzso injury and cell loss with significantly reduced zzso collagen zzso zzso cell zzso was significantly reduced and zzso likely due to zzso zzso zzso A cell model was set up that mimics enhanced zzso zzso expression and zzso Here a zzso response was seen with activated zzso in zzso cells and zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso roles in the inflamed kidney that may not be replaced by other zzso zzso family zzso Thus, specific blockade of this zzso may be suitable as therapeutic option to delay progression of kidney zzso
