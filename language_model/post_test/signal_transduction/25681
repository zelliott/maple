A zzso shows zzso zzso such as zzso invasion, and zzso transition zzso Previous reports suggest that tissue factor zzso expression is closely related to the zzso of tumor cells, and subsequent tumor zzso In this study, we analyzed the expression and zzso of zzso in zzso and normal zzso zzso of zzso 

Eight zzso and three normal zzso zzso surgically removed, were used in this zzso zzso zzso zzso were submitted for zzso analysis with zzso zzso Double zzso zzso was performed to assess zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression in the zzso 

zzso for zzso was detected in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso of zzso zzso and superficial zzso zzso The number of zzso cells in zzso zzso cells was significantly higher than in normal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso which was zzso with zzso 

These results suggest that zzso plays a potential role in the zzso and development of a zzso and that zzso expression might be involved through zzso and zzso zzso
