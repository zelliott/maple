In mixed zzso infections with zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, which are zzso in areas of endemic zzso interaction between the pathogens could be an important factor in the occurrence of invasive zzso It has been reported that exposure of human zzso cells to zzso bacteria increased zzso adherence to the cells and their subsequent zzso We report here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso receptors zzso and zzso in human zzso cells, zzso the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso as well as an increase in the corresponding zzso zzso correlation was observed between the increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso the enhanced zzso of zzso to the cells and the inflicted cell zzso When cells were exposed to zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso elements of an innate immune response were zzso zzso by itself zzso a similar cell response, while exposure to a zzso zzso coli had a zzso zzso zzso of the cells to zzso bacteria and then to zzso rendered an zzso zzso that after addition of zzso facilitated greater cell zzso Our results suggest that zzso is zzso by human zzso cells as a zzso zzso and as such can induce the expression of elements of an innate immune zzso In the human host, an exacerbated inflammatory environment, derived from pathogen zzso may be an important factor for development of invasive zzso
