The zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was studied to determine its role in zzso plasticity related to the development of nicotine zzso zzso and zzso state of zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and levels of zzso zzso zzso were determined using western zzso zzso mice received acute or chronic nicotine zzso zzso in their drinking water or were withdrawn from nicotine for 24 h following chronic zzso zzso zzso was reduced in the nucleus zzso following chronic zzso consistent with previous reports that decreased zzso zzso activity increases drug zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was increased in the prefrontal zzso following chronic nicotine exposure and in the zzso zzso area during nicotine zzso In addition, total and zzso zzso decreased in the zzso following chronic nicotine exposure, but zzso zzso increased in the prefrontal zzso zzso levels increased in both the zzso and prefrontal cortex, supporting the hypothesis that increased zzso tone contributes to nicotine zzso Overall, these results support a role for zzso and zzso activity in neural plasticity associated with nicotine zzso
