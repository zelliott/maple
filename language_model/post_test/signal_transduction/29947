zzso are zzso signaling molecules that transmit signals zzso by members of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso To decipher the mechanism of zzso signaling during the zzso cycle and zzso we performed in zzso zzso to investigate the expression patterns of zzso for zzso and zzso in rat zzso during the zzso cycle and on Days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso was reduced at zzso and zzso while zzso maintained its zzso expression during the zzso zzso During zzso both zzso were accumulated in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to the dramatic zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso on Day zzso and was increased on Day zzso During zzso both zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the primary zzso zzso zzso was zzso on Day zzso These results suggest that zzso both zzso are involved in the tissue zzso of cycling and pregnant rat zzso zzso zzso signaling functions mainly in the zzso during zzso and zzso is involved in the zzso switch from the neutral phase to the receptive zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso at the time when zzso invasion begins and both zzso are involved in the formation of the primary zzso zzso
