Growth factor signals are zzso from the cell surface, through the action of zzso zzso to zzso zzso that control critical functions in human cancer cells, such as zzso growth, zzso and zzso of cell death and zzso Several zzso are involved in zzso pathways via sequential zzso zzso These zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In cancer cells, these zzso pathways are often altered and results in a zzso characterized by uncontrolled growth and increased capability to invade surrounding zzso zzso these crucial zzso molecules represent attractive targets for cancer zzso This review will zzso current knowledge of key signal zzso zzso that are altered in cancer cells, as therapeutic targets for novel selective zzso The most advanced targeted agents currently under development interfere with function and expression of several zzso zzso including the zzso family; the vascular zzso growth factor and its zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso
