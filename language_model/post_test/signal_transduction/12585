Following a zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso from a zzso to an activated cell type associated with increased zzso collagen and smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso Ten zzso a tumor zzso zzso has been shown to play a role in several zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso during zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 2 days after isolation were zzso with zzso expressing either the zzso zzso or a dominant negative form of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso including zzso changes, expression of zzso and zzso zzso and cell zzso were zzso zzso of zzso was detected by measuring activity of zzso zzso zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso was detected by Western zzso 

zzso of zzso inhibited zzso changes were associated with zzso zzso including zzso changes, expression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso D1 zzso zzso expression also induced zzso in zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also caused decreased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

Taken together, these findings show that zzso represents an important negative regulator for zzso of zzso This may have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression of liver zzso
