The Human Natural zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso and synaptic zzso zzso zzso structures called zzso zzso condensed around zzso of zzso and zzso zzso during brain zzso regulate synaptic transmission and zzso 

Ten genes of importance for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or for the formation of zzso nets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated for potential involvement in schizophrenia zzso zzso by zzso 104 zzso in the zzso zzso on Psychiatric zzso sample zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso association study zzso data from the European zzso sample zzso zzso zzso control subjects) were used for zzso The effect of zzso risk zzso on brain structure was investigated in a Norwegian subset zzso zzso 177 control subjects) with structural magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

Five single zzso zzso zzso located in two adjacent estimated linkage zzso blocks in the first zzso of zzso 2 zzso were zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was significantly associated in the comparison sample and in the zzso after correction for all 121 zzso tests zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased dosage of the zzso zzso risk zzso was associated with decreased cortical area zzso zzso zzso but not thickness or zzso zzso A second zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso which zzso the highest zzso risk effect in the Norwegian zzso was also associated with cortical zzso 

The present results suggest that effects on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso through common zzso variation, could increase the risk of zzso possibly by decreasing cortical zzso
