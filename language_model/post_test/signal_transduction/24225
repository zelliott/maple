zzso zzso increases zzso activity in lung zzso zzso zzso This effect is associated with an increase in zzso molecules within the plasma membrane zzso Analysis of zzso motion was performed in real-time in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso molecules carrying a fluorescent tag zzso fluorescent zzso in the zzso The data demonstrate a distinct zzso zzso pattern of zzso movement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased the directional movement (by zzso zzso of the zzso and an increase in their zzso (by zzso that consequently promoted the incorporation of zzso into the plasma zzso The movement of zzso zzso and incorporation into the plasma membrane were zzso dependent, and disruption of this network zzso zzso motion toward the plasma membrane and prevented the increase in the zzso activity induced by zzso Thus, recruitment of new zzso molecules into the plasma membrane appears to be a major mechanism by which zzso increases total cell zzso zzso
