Loss of DNA mismatch repair has been observed in a variety of human zzso Recent studies have shown that loss of DNA mismatch repair results in resistance to zzso but not zzso suggesting that the mismatch repair proteins serve as a detector for zzso but not zzso zzso To identify the signal zzso pathways with which the detector zzso we investigated the effect of loss of DNA mismatch repair on zzso of known zzso zzso and recently reported that zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we directly compared differential zzso of these pathways by zzso zzso zzso The results confirm that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more efficiently in DNA mismatch zzso than zzso cells, and that the zzso response to zzso is completely absent in DNA mismatch zzso zzso In contrast, there was no zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso in DNA mismatch zzso or zzso cells exposed to zzso The present study demonstrates that, despite the similarity of the zzso produced by zzso and zzso they appear to be recognized by different zzso The DNA mismatch repair system plays an important part in the recognition of zzso zzso and zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso damage is dependent on the detector function of the DNA mismatch repair zzso In contrast, this detector does not respond to zzso zzso
