This review lays out the emerging evidence for the fundamental role of zzso stores and zzso channels in the zzso zzso of rods and zzso zzso calcium release zzso is a major contributor to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the darkness whereas zzso zzso channels play a more significant role under sustained zzso zzso The zzso response includes dynamic interactions between the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or outer segment disk zzso which zzso zzso accumulate and release zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso channels zzso zzso zzso signals but also provides a memory trace of previous zzso to zzso zzso channels, activated by the zzso zzso prevent pathological decrease in zzso zzso by excessive zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso may also zzso the transmission of zzso and zzso signals in the outer zzso Thus, zzso stores provide additional complexity, zzso zzso and speed to zzso zzso
