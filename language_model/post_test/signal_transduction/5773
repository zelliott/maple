zzso pancreatic zzso zzso is thought to originate from zzso zzso called pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso progress from low grade zzso to high grade zzso as the cells attain molecular zzso to key regulatory zzso including zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Despite a well-documented progression model, our knowledge of the zzso cells of zzso and the zzso networks and signaling pathways that impact zzso formation remains zzso 

In this study, we examined the importance of the zzso zzso factor zzso to zzso mouse zzso zzso formation in 3 different mouse models of pancreatic zzso 

In the absence of zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited severe zzso pancreatic defects that were rescued by zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso development was greatly accelerated in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells were predisposed to convert to a zzso zzso and activate zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We propose that convergence of zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso cells lacking zzso leads to enhanced zzso zzso
