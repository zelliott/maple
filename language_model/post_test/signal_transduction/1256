zzso specificity is the culmination of several zzso beginning with the establishment of zzso zzso identity, followed by navigation of the zzso to the correct subdivision of zzso and finally, the zzso recognition of appropriate synaptic zzso In this review we zzso the work on sensory zzso in zzso cockroaches, zzso and fruit flies that establishes some of the principles and molecular mechanisms involved in the control of synaptic zzso The identity of a sensory zzso is controlled by zzso expression of zzso factors, the products of patterning and zzso zzso In the nervous system, sensory zzso projections are zzso zzso according to zzso stimulus quality, and zzso zzso A variety of zzso and zzso signaling molecules are used to achieve zzso zzso target recognition is also controlled by zzso factors such as zzso and may be, in part, zzso by zzso zzso
