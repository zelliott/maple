The zzso zzso for the metabolism of zzso along the zzso zzso generates zzso acid, an zzso at zzso zzso as well as zzso acid which is an zzso at zzso and zzso zzso The zzso has become recognized as a key player in the mechanisms of zzso damage and neurodegenerative zzso As a result, manipulation of the pathway, so that the balance between the levels of components of the zzso can be zzso has become an attractive target for the development of pharmacological agents with the potential to treat those zzso This review summarizes some of the relevant background information on the zzso itself before identifying some of the chemical strategies for its zzso with examples of their successful application in animal models of infection, stroke, traumatic brain damage, cerebral malaria and cerebral zzso
