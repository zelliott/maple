zzso within a zzso cell respond to age-related zzso stresses and environmental factors by altering their functional states to zzso direct and process the flow of zzso information that is essential for establishing a zzso or zzso cellular zzso The scope of this review is to critically analyze recent progress in understanding how various zzso zzso zzso and zzso communications regulate cellular aging in zzso distant zzso Our analysis suggests a model for an intricate network of zzso communications that zzso cellular aging in zzso organisms across zzso This proposed model zzso that the numerous directed, coordinated and regulated zzso and zzso communications integrated into this network define the long-term viability of a zzso cell and, thus, are critical for regulating cellular zzso
