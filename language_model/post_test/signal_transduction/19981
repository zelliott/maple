zzso zzso signal zzso also known as zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso and regulates insulin zzso and zzso zzso The present study was performed to zzso the role of zzso the regulation of insulin zzso Although zzso cells from zzso zzso mice zzso less insulin than zzso zzso there was no significant difference in zzso tolerance between zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso mice did show increased insulin sensitivity compared with zzso mice in insulin tolerance zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso were higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso after insulin zzso Moreover, decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice were more prominent in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1) and zzso well-known insulin zzso zzso were decreased in zzso zzso and increased in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was recruited to the promoter region of zzso and zzso the zzso by zzso zzso zzso This zzso function of zzso was diminished by zzso of zzso sites in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso affects zzso insulin sensitivity, at least in part, through induction of the insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso
