The zzso cell lineage is an interesting model system because it is composed of a limited number of cell types that are zzso zzso zzso stem zzso cells reside within a layer called the zzso and either remain as stem cells or differentiate into zzso zzso zzso giant zzso cells or zzso cells zzso of the zzso Maintenance of the zzso zzso is dependent on stimulation by zzso whereas differentiation and/or maintenance of the differentiated derivatives are dependent on key zzso factors: zzso for zzso zzso for zzso cells and zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and retain their stem cell zzso in culture in response to zzso and an additional zzso that can be provided by zzso medium from embryonic zzso zzso cells zzso To understand the functions of zzso zzso and zzso at a cellular level, we tested the effects of their zzso and zzso on the ability of zzso cells to either continue to zzso or differentiate into their alternative zzso zzso of zzso alone had no effects on zzso cell zzso However, zzso cells continued to divide longer after withdrawal of zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso even in the continued presence of zzso zzso another zzso factor gene that is expressed in zzso cells, also induced zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid arrest of zzso proliferation but, in contrast to zzso and zzso blocked zzso cell zzso Although zzso was not sufficient to promote zzso formation, expression of an zzso zzso transcript blocked zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso functions to promote transient zzso amplification of zzso cells that are progressing towards the zzso and zzso cell zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso promote cell cycle exit and restrict cells towards the zzso fate, whereas zzso promotes cell cycle exit and restriction towards the zzso zzso
