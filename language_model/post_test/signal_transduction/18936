The probable involvement of zzso D zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso stress response of zzso zzso root cells was investigated by examining the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PA on the zzso response, the organization of the zzso zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso root zzso The effects of all the treatments were assessed by differential interference contrast zzso zzso of living cells, zzso zzso conventional transmission electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso and western zzso zzso zzso and zzso compromised the viability of zzso cells, induced a marked reduction in the zzso zzso volume, and inhibited zzso induced zzso zzso formation and the zzso of zzso zzso PA reinforced the zzso response of zzso zzso root cells and positively affected zzso zzso zzso Additionally, PA reduced the effects of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso PA synthesis occurs upstream of the zzso of zzso to regulate zzso induced zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso root zzso
