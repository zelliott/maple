zzso receptors mediate slow zzso zzso throughout the central nervous system thereby controlling the zzso of zzso They have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders making them an attractive drug zzso However, due to considerable side effects, the zzso zzso is so far the only drug on the market targeting zzso zzso primarily for the treatment of zzso Because zzso receptors are involved in a variety of brain functions it is rather unlikely to avoid unwanted effects with zzso administered drugs directly addressing zzso binding sites of the zzso To minimize side effects, it would be desirable to target only those receptors involved in a given pathological zzso This commentary discusses the idea that restoring impaired zzso zzso function in diseased zzso by interfering with zzso interactions may be an approach to specifically target only those receptors involved in the pathological zzso Two recently discovered mechanisms that zzso the level of functional zzso receptors most likely contribute to cerebral zzso and zzso pain, zzso In both mechanisms, small interfering peptides zzso zzso interactions may offer a highly specific means to restore normal zzso function selectively at the site of zzso If restored functional zzso zzso expression in these diseases has beneficial effects, this may serve as a starting point for the development of a highly specific therapeutic zzso Such an approach is expected to minimize side effects because it promises to leave those zzso receptors unaffected which are not involved in the zzso
