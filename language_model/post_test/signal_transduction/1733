Strong evidence now exists for the presence and importance of plasma membrane zzso receptors zzso in a variety of cells that are targets for steroid zzso When zzso zzso binds cell surface zzso the initiation of signal zzso triggers downstream signaling zzso that contribute to important zzso These functions include cell growth and survival, migration, and new blood vessel zzso In some instances these effects result from the initiation of gene transcription, zzso through signaling from the zzso The membrane zzso probably originates from the same gene and transcript that produces the nuclear zzso In the zzso zzso appear to zzso mainly to discrete zzso of the plasma zzso known as zzso but the mechanisms by which this small pool of zzso zzso to this site are currently zzso At the zzso a cross talk with signaling molecules zzso zzso cell zzso zzso This both includes direct stimulation of signaling via G protein zzso and a zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso This review article highlights some of the important advances in understanding the cell biology of zzso action that emanates from the zzso
