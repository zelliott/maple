The present study was to explore signaling mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels zzso 

8 week male zzso rats were divided randomly into saline group and nicotine group and received respectively injection with saline or nicotine zzso Shanghai, zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso for 21 zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cells were zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso The signal channel open zzso zzso close zzso zzso and open probability zzso were zzso 

zzso or zzso significantly prolonged zzso shorten zzso and increased zzso in saline group zzso zzso zzso But in nicotine group zzso zzso and zzso did not been zzso 

This phenomenon may serve as a zzso mechanism that nicotine zzso zzso channel activity to increase via zzso zzso
