The zzso zzso type 1 zzso and the central nucleus of the zzso zzso are both known to have crucial roles in the processing of fear and anxiety, zzso they appear to be especially involved in the control of fear zzso However, in contrast to many other brain regions including the cortical zzso of the amygdala, the existence of zzso in the zzso remains zzso In this study we show that zzso is expressed in the zzso of mice and that zzso in the zzso mediates short-term synaptic zzso namely zzso suppression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso increased both zzso and zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso Local application of zzso in the zzso in zzso resulted in an acutely increased fear response in an auditory fear conditioning zzso Upon application of zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso in an otherwise identical zzso no such acute behavioral effects were zzso but zzso blockade resulted in increased fear responses during tone zzso on the subsequent zzso Moreover, we observed that the efficacy of zzso and zzso in the zzso was increased on the day following fear zzso indicating that a single zzso pairing resulted in changes in zzso signaling in the zzso Taken together, our data show the existence of zzso proteins in the zzso and their critical role for ensuring short-term adaptation of responses to fearful events, thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic target to accompany zzso therapies of post-traumatic zzso
