zzso expressing the zzso zzso can attach, spread, and migrate on surfaces coated with zzso zzso demonstrating that engagement of zzso can trigger the zzso zzso necessary for changes in cell zzso and zzso zzso of different zzso of the zzso results in distinct forms of zzso zzso On zzso zzso the cells contain zzso zzso spikes characteristic of zzso extension, whereas on zzso zzso the cells contain cortical zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso that express zzso zzso lacking the zzso and zzso zzso are unable to spread or migrate on zzso zzso surfaces, indicating that these portions of the zzso are essential for zzso signal zzso zzso expressing an zzso zzso lacking the zzso half of the zzso domain can still spread normally on zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso segment is responsible for this zzso In contrast, this zzso zzso poorly on zzso zzso and exhibits abnormal zzso of zzso zzso filaments decorated with zzso during spreading on this zzso The zzso portion of the zzso zzso domain, therefore, may be involved in regulating molecular events that are crucial for cell zzso
