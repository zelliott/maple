We have previously proposed that transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso occurs via a relative rotation between the zzso This model suggests that in the absence of the zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso regulates the zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate this proposition, four zzso type I and II zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso and two zzso domain truncated receptors zzso and zzso were zzso In either zzso mink lung zzso zzso functional type I zzso or zzso (where the type II zzso is zzso cells, zzso of two zzso zzso which are complementary in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso as measured by the zzso zzso of a zzso reporter zzso zzso of this type of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso containing the opposite zzso domain exhibited a varied level of zzso activity depending on the particular combination of the zzso zzso In general, the type zzso I zzso domain combination gave higher zzso activity than the type zzso II or type zzso II zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso domain truncated zzso with any zzso containing the opposite zzso domain always resulted in zzso independent zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the formation of the zzso complexes paralleled the zzso independent zzso of zzso Our results support the conclusion that the zzso zzso zzso domain plays a negative regulatory role in zzso zzso in the absence of zzso
