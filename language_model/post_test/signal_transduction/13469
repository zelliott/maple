zzso regulation is tightly controlled by signaling through G zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso that regulate zzso and zzso in the heart and mediate zzso which critically influences systemic vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso (or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are increased in heart failure and data suggest that vascular levels may also be elevated in zzso zzso we generated transgenic mice with vascular smooth muscle zzso targeted zzso of zzso using a portion of the zzso promoter, to determine its impact on vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was attenuated when zzso was zzso zzso to zzso In zzso zzso in response to zzso stimulation using zzso was attenuated and conscious resting mean zzso blood pressure was elevated from 96 zzso 2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso control zzso mice zzso zzso 9) to 112 zzso 3 zzso zzso and 117 zzso 2 zzso zzso in two different lines of zzso transgenic mice zzso zzso 7 and zzso zzso 5, zzso p zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso thickness was increased zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso 6) to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso 7) zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso was sufficient to cause cardiac zzso These data indicate that we have developed a unique mouse model of hypertension, providing insight into the contribution that vascular zzso signaling makes toward resting blood pressure and overall cardiovascular zzso Moreover, they suggest that zzso plays an important role in vascular control and may represent a novel therapeutic target for zzso
