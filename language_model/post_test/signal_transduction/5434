Steel factor is an essential survival and proliferation factor for primordial germ cells zzso during their migration in the early mouse zzso zzso arise during zzso and migrate into the zzso zzso that becomes the zzso Previous reports have suggested that zzso become dependent on Steel factor when they colonize the zzso However, in the absence of a good marker for living zzso their behavior before zzso colonization has not been previously zzso We report here the normal behavior of zzso in live zzso before zzso zzso and the roles of Steel factor, using a reporter line in which zzso is driven by the promoter of the Stella zzso whose zzso accompanies the initial zzso of zzso We show first that zzso are surrounded by Steel zzso cells from their first appearance in the zzso to the time they enter the zzso zzso Second, fewer zzso are found in the zzso in zzso zzso but this is not due to a failure of zzso zzso Third, the analysis of cultured zzso early zzso shows that Steel factor is required for normal zzso zzso both in the zzso and in the zzso zzso cells migrate actively in the zzso and move zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso In the absence of Steel factor, caused by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is dramatically zzso but zzso is zzso demonstrating a primary role for Steel factor in zzso zzso This was found both before and after colonization of the zzso These data, together with previously published data, show that zzso are Steel factor dependent from their initial zzso until they colonize the zzso zzso and suggest the existence of a zzso zzso that travels with this important zzso cell population in the zzso
