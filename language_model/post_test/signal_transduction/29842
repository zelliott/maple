zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy in chronic zzso C zzso however, the underlying mechanism remains zzso Here we demonstrate that long-term zzso zzso but not short-term (up to 1 day) zzso treatment of human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso factor 1), zzso and zzso but enhances zzso and zzso 6 zzso of zzso zzso exposure to zzso also significantly zzso zzso protein expression without affecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 protein zzso To determine the role of zzso protein zzso in regulation of zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso via stable zzso enhances zzso zzso of zzso but surprisingly zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso because zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso on zzso zzso zzso also blocks zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso 2 to zzso zzso 1, a critical step in zzso zzso zzso Finally, significantly higher levels of zzso protein zzso which is probably induced by zzso are detected in the majority of zzso C zzso zzso compared with healthy zzso In conclusion, long-term zzso treatment zzso zzso signals most probably, at least in part, through the induction of zzso protein zzso which could partly contribute to zzso treatment failure in zzso C zzso
