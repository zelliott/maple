Loss of zzso in melanoma cells frees them from zzso proliferation and zzso control, which can be restored by forced zzso zzso In this study, zzso and its derivatives were introduced into zzso melanoma line zzso zzso and zzso fusion protein were functional in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso proliferation regardless of zzso expression levels and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso was not able to reverse zzso The results indicate that zzso cell zzso is required for zzso control of zzso cells, which can override zzso activity of zzso
