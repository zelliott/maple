zzso T cell therapy zzso for the treatment of established zzso is actively being pursued in clinical zzso However, poor in zzso persistence and maintenance of zzso activity of transferred T cells remain major zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso that is often expressed at high levels within the tumor zzso potentially limiting T zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a model of zzso zzso prostate cancer to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso T cells used in ACT to target the tumor in zzso We found that persistence and zzso activity of zzso transferred zzso T cells deficient in zzso signaling were significantly improved in the zzso zzso However, over time, despite persistence in peripheral zzso zzso the numbers of transferred cells in the prostate decreased and the residual zzso T cells were no longer zzso These findings reveal that zzso zzso regulates the zzso and zzso function of transferred zzso zzso T cells and highlight that, when targeting a tumor zzso that is also expressed as a zzso additional substantive obstacles are operative within the tumor zzso potentially zzso the success of ACT for solid zzso
