zzso mice spontaneously develops zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is pivotal in human inflammatory zzso zzso In our studies in zzso mice, the aim was to investigate whether zzso zzso contributes to zzso and to examine the therapeutic effects of this signal zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in zzso mice and control zzso mice was examined by western zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso zzso were determined by northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso We also examined the effects of zzso injected zzso an zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso and of soluble zzso a specific inhibitor of soluble zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and disease severity in zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed strongly during the disease course in zzso mice but only zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso cells in the diseased zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were expressed in affected zzso Administration of zzso caused disease zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso In contrast, soluble zzso administration ameliorated the disease and suppressed zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is critical in the development of zzso inflammation in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso by soluble zzso may have therapeutic effects in inflammatory zzso zzso
