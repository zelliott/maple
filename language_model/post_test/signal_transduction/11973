zzso cell interactions with the zzso especially those of zzso zzso cells, are important in various aspects of tumor zzso zzso zzso cells zzso have been suggested to constitute zzso zzso In this study, we zzso a novel mechanism by which the zzso can mediate spontaneous distant zzso of breast cancer zzso 

zzso breast cancer cells, zzso and zzso were zzso grafted into the zzso fat pads of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso liver, lung and primary tumor mass were zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in the distant zzso zzso were depleted or zzso in zzso zzso To evaluate whether zzso in the zzso tumor zzso affect breast cancer cell behavior, zzso and cancer cells were zzso To investigate the role of zzso in in zzso zzso we blocked the interactions between zzso and cancer zzso 

Using a zzso breast cancer cell model, we showed that zzso breast cancer cells with high zzso expression recruited more zzso and that the zzso capacity of cancer cells paralleled zzso recruitment in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso factors induced zzso to increase zzso production and full zzso of recruited zzso occurred in the primary tumor site and zzso organ in the vicinity of zzso cancer cells, but not in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso which facilitated shedding of zzso zzso thereby contributing to breast cancer cell zzso and distant zzso through zzso zzso The critical role of zzso zzso was confirmed in both the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso 

In this study, we showed that zzso cancer cells induced higher zzso zzso and prompted them to secret exaggerated zzso as well as soluble zzso which, in turn, triggered a persistent increase of zzso in tumor zzso This potential zzso axis involving zzso zzso directly affected breast cancer cell zzso leading to spontaneous zzso
