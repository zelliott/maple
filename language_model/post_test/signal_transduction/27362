zzso evidence strongly supports a role for zzso growth zzso zzso in central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso the type zzso zzso (the cell surface zzso zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso and some zzso binding proteins zzso zzso proteins that zzso zzso zzso are expressed in many regions of the zzso beginning in zzso The expression pattern of zzso system proteins during brain growth suggests highly regulated and zzso timed zzso actions on specific neural cell zzso zzso expression is predominantly in zzso and, in many brain regions, zzso in a fashion temporally zzso with periods in development when zzso zzso proliferation and/or zzso outgrowth zzso In contrast, zzso expression is confined mainly to cells of zzso and neural crest zzso While expression of type I zzso receptors appears zzso that of zzso is characterized by regional and zzso zzso and often occurs zzso with zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso and/or the survival of zzso and zzso and in some cultured zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso mice that zzso zzso in the brain exhibit zzso brain overgrowth without zzso zzso zzso increases in weight, depending on the magnitude of zzso In contrast, zzso mice that exhibit zzso brain expression of zzso an inhibitor of zzso action when present in zzso zzso manifest zzso brain growth zzso and mice with zzso zzso gene zzso accomplished by zzso zzso have brains that are zzso of normal size as zzso Taken together, these in zzso studies indicate that zzso can influence the development of most, if not all, brain regions, and suggest that the cerebral zzso and zzso are especially sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso actions result from its capacity to increase zzso number, at least in certain zzso and from its potent stimulation of zzso These zzso actions, taken together with its zzso effects following zzso and peripheral nerve injury, suggest that it may be of therapeutic benefit in a wide variety of disorders affecting the nervous zzso
