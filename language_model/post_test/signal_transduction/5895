zzso zzso zzso are zzso shaped membrane fragments shed into the circulation in patients with vascular diseases, and may themselves act to enhance the zzso response to zzso On the basis of the importance of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso responses to inflammatory zzso we sought to define the role of zzso in zzso generation and zzso 

zzso generation from cultures of human zzso zzso cells zzso treated with tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso via multiple zzso The response of target zzso cells was assessed by treatment of cells with zzso generated under various zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso using zzso agents, resulted in a 50% reduction of zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso was specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso induced an approximately zzso increase in soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso release from targeted zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso in the targeted cell prior to zzso treatment did not alter the zzso zzso 

Our findings zzso zzso zzso signaling as significant and selective in the formation and maturation of zzso zzso zzso a zzso response from targeted zzso that was dependent on the conditions under which zzso were zzso However, our results imply a zzso model in which zzso zzso is critical at the source of zzso formation, but not the target cell response to zzso These findings indicate a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso may offer therapeutic benefit in zzso via direct zzso of zzso zzso
