zzso of immature double positive zzso zzso zzso zzso into single positive zzso zzso and zzso T cells is referred to as positive selection and requires physical contact with zzso cortical zzso We now have identified zzso molecules on zzso zzso that, together with zzso signal zzso zzso to differentiate into SP T cells in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso A remarkable number of different molecules on zzso zzso possessed zzso activity, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, in zzso differentiation occurred in the absence of zzso signals, yet resulted in the selective generation of zzso T zzso Thus, the present study has identified surface molecules that can signal zzso zzso to differentiate into SP T cells in the absence of zzso zzso and has characterized a default zzso for zzso T cell zzso
