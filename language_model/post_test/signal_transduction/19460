zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso closure are accompanied by zzso zzso in guard zzso However, it remains to be clarified how the zzso functions in not only zzso signaling but also zzso We investigated zzso zzso in guard cells during zzso zzso and zzso zzso closure of wild type, zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in guard cells of zzso and zzso but not in zzso guard cells whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso guard cells but not in zzso Neither zzso nor zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso and zzso guard zzso zzso zzso induced zzso closure accompanied by zzso zzso in guard cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An agent to zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso guard cells to prevent zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso function in zzso and zzso signaling in zzso guard zzso
