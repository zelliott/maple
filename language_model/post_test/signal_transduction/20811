zzso The fluorescent zzso indicator zzso zzso was used to examine the spatial distribution of zzso zzso signals in giant zzso terminals of zzso zzso trains of zzso action zzso were evoked to open zzso channels within the giant zzso terminals and elevate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation produced pronounced rises in zzso zzso zzso These rises were much larger in the terminal region than in the adjacent zzso region of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso channels are most abundant in the zzso zzso zzso also produced zzso in zzso concentration across the zzso of the zzso zzso During zzso zzso concentration was highest in the compartment of the zzso terminal closest to the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso channels are localized to this region of the zzso zzso zzso Following the end of action potential trains, the rises in zzso concentration became uniform across the zzso of the zzso The zzso of zzso presumably is due to diffusion of zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso rises in zzso declined slowly over several tens of zzso zzso zzso examination of a giant zzso terminal used for imaging experiments revealed that the spatial compartments where zzso rises in zzso concentration were highest were also enriched in active zones, the zzso sites of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and active zones strongly suggests that zzso cluster zzso channels selectively at active zones and that they do so to enhance the magnitude of zzso signals in the vicinity of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso concentration also occur within zzso terminals and can be zzso accounted for by zzso in zzso ratio and density of active zones along the length of the zzso zzso
