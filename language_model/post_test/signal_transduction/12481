zzso to zzso zzso diets zzso has been associated with greater weight loss in the short-term than zzso zzso zzso However, consumption of zzso may result in decreased voluntary exercise and thus render long-term weight loss and maintenance of weight loss zzso 

zzso were maintained on either a zzso zzso zzso diet or a zzso zzso for 6 zzso Half of each dietary group was zzso whereas the other half was given access to a running zzso Running wheel activity zzso distance and meters per zzso plasma zzso and insulin, zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Y and zzso zzso were measured to assess zzso effects in animals maintained on zzso 

With access to a running wheel, rats on zzso engaged in similar levels of voluntary activity as zzso rats and both dietary groups decreased caloric zzso zzso intake increased over time such that it was significantly greater than sedentary controls after 1 month of access to the wheels, however body weight remained zzso zzso rats maintained on zzso had increased zzso and plasma zzso levels and decreased zzso zzso zzso as compared to sedentary zzso zzso zzso rats with access to a running wheel had similar levels of zzso and plasma zzso levels as zzso rats with access to running wheels, but significantly increased zzso zzso in the zzso 

We demonstrate that maintenance on zzso does not inhibit voluntary activity in a running zzso Furthermore, prevention of zzso increased zzso and plasma zzso as measured in sedentary zzso rats, significantly increases levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
