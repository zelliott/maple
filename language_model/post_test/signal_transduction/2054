zzso are a structurally elaborate family of zzso that mediate zzso zzso cell zzso in a wide range of biological zzso The inserted zzso domain binds zzso in the subset of zzso in which it is zzso Its structure has been determined in two alternative zzso termed open and zzso In striking similarity to signaling G zzso zzso of a zzso site is linked to large zzso movements in distant backbone zzso zzso have been used to stabilize either the closed or open zzso These show that the snapshots of the open zzso seen only in the presence of a zzso or a zzso zzso represent a zzso zzso zzso whereas those of the closed zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso moves 10 A down the side of the domain in the open zzso zzso in the zzso of the preceding loop is sufficient to increase affinity for zzso zzso This zzso zzso provides a mechanism for linkage to zzso movements in other zzso The transition from the closed to open zzso has been implicated in fast zzso zzso regulation of zzso affinity in response to zzso signals from inside the zzso Recent zzso structures and functional studies reveal interactions between zzso I, and zzso zzso in the zzso and a critical role for zzso zzso zzso in the stalk zzso These studies suggest that the zzso of the zzso faces down toward the membrane in the inactive zzso and extends upward in a zzso opening motion upon zzso These long-range structural zzso of the entire zzso zzso involving multiple zzso contacts appear closely linked to zzso changes in the I domain, which result in increased affinity and competence for zzso zzso
