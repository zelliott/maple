The maternal tract plays a critical role in the success of early embryonic development providing an optimal environment for establishment and maintenance of zzso zzso of this environment requires an intimate dialogue between the zzso and her zzso However, many intriguing aspects remain unknown in this unique communication zzso To advance our understanding of the process by which a zzso is accepted by the zzso and better address the clinical challenges of zzso and pregnancy failure, it is imperative to decipher this complex molecular zzso The objective of the present work is to define the local response of the maternal tract towards the zzso during the earliest stages of zzso We used a novel in zzso experimental model that eliminated genetic zzso and individual differences, followed by zzso zzso to identify the signals involved in this zzso zzso Using zzso zzso one zzso of a sow was zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso was injected with zzso This model allowed us to obtain samples from the zzso and the tip of the zzso horn containing either zzso or zzso from the same zzso zzso analysis showed that most of the transcripts zzso expressed were zzso in the zzso horn in response to zzso when compared to zzso Many of the transcripts altered in response to the zzso in the zzso horn were related to the immune zzso We used an in zzso mathematical model to demonstrate the role of the zzso as a zzso of the immune zzso This model revealed that relatively modest changes induced by the presence of the zzso could zzso the maternal immune zzso These findings suggested that the presence of the zzso might regulate the immune system in the maternal tract to allow the zzso zzso to tolerate the zzso and support its zzso
