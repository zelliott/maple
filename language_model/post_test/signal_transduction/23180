zzso zzso zzso 4 is a pattern recognition zzso and recognizes not only bacterial zzso zzso but also zzso zzso molecular patterns released from dying or injured zzso It has been reported that zzso signaling in zzso plays an important role in various neurological zzso However, details of zzso signaling in zzso are not fully zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso induced by zzso increases the expression of melanoma zzso gene 5 zzso and zzso zzso gene 56 zzso in zzso human zzso zzso We also found that nuclear zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso are involved in the expression of zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso interference experiments revealed that zzso and zzso positively regulate the zzso expression of a zzso zzso but not zzso In addition, it was suggested that zzso and zzso constitute a positive feedback zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may contribute not only to zzso inflammatory reactions but also to the zzso of various neurological diseases zzso by zzso in zzso at least in part, by regulating the expression of zzso
