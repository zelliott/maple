zzso response zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso result in abnormal zzso zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso zzso to promote zzso assembly that is critical for zzso differentiation and growth during zzso Here we show that zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso enhances zzso expression in zzso human zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was regulated mainly by the zzso regulated zzso zzso pathway, but was independent of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso family zzso Analysis of the promoter region of the zzso gene revealed that the region zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site is important for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso binding sites appeared to play some roles in regulation of zzso zzso As expected, the zzso protein accumulated in extended zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso However, zzso of zzso cells was mostly dependent on zzso family zzso activity and not zzso activity, indicating that the increased expression of zzso alone was not sufficient for zzso
