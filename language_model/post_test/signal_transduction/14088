zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein expressed predominantly in zzso ligament zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso on human zzso cell zzso under hypoxic zzso The percentage of zzso zzso cells under zzso was increased significantly when the zzso zzso gene was silenced using zzso but decreased when cells were treated with zzso human zzso zzso or when mouse zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso during zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso but increased zzso protein zzso zzso treating hypoxic cells with zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso expression but decreased zzso zzso The addition of zzso in the absence of a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso while the effects of zzso were abolished when cells were zzso with zzso zzso with this, the zzso of zzso was increased in hypoxic zzso cells by the zzso of zzso but decreased by treatment with zzso Under zzso the zzso zzso zzso level, and zzso were unaffected by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings suggest that, under hypoxic conditions, zzso regulates zzso expression and zzso levels by modulating zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso
