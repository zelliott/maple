1 zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in rat zzso zzso and zzso left anterior descending zzso coronary artery and anterior zzso artery zzso using zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2 In the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat beta zzso and human zzso caused relaxation with similar zzso Compared with zzso zzso rat zzso was about 25 fold less zzso while zzso zzso zzso and salmon zzso were at least 1000 fold zzso 3 zzso zzso (up to zzso zzso did not antagonize responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso or rat beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not increase either the effect of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso remained zzso zzso relaxation produced by zzso zzso was accompanied by increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced relaxation in an zzso zzso zzso zzso competitively antagonized zzso zzso responses zzso zzso and zzso zzso slope zzso each), in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso artery, zzso zzso relaxation was accompanied by increases in zzso zzso that were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 In conclusion, the zzso affinity for zzso zzso in zzso coronary artery is consistent with a zzso zzso while the lack of zzso zzso antagonism in rat zzso could suggest either a zzso zzso different from zzso and zzso type, or a zzso zzso
