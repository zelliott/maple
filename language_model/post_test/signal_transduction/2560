We have examined the regulation of the zzso DNA zzso complex during T cell zzso in response to zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso responsive zzso zzso T cell line, zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso effect of zzso on zzso gene expression in this cell zzso To zzso the zzso by which zzso enhances zzso gene zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the synthesis and turnover of zzso B, the member of the zzso gene family that is present in zzso complexes in zzso zzso We found that zzso + zzso cells contain significantly higher zzso B protein levels than cells treated with zzso zzso zzso promotes the prolonged zzso of zzso B, whereas the cellular content of zzso B decreases dramatically after 6 zzso in cells treated with only zzso zzso enhancement of zzso B protein levels is not the result of a change in the turnover rate of the zzso B zzso but rather results from the maintenance of sufficient zzso B zzso to support continued zzso of newly zzso zzso In addition to zzso B, we found that the T cell zzso complex contains the zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene zzso Although zzso dramatically increases zzso B zzso it does not enhance zzso zzso protein levels in zzso zzso Thus, the stimulation of zzso gene expression by zzso in zzso cells is due to the promotion of zzso B protein zzso that, in turn, zzso zzso B zzso with zzso zzso zzso thereby forming an active zzso zzso
