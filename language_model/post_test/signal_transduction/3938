Different species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been taken as model systems to study the effects of extremely zzso electromagnetic fields zzso zzso zzso zzso on the cellular zzso A zzso increase in the mean swimming zzso and a decrease in the zzso of cell tracks were observed in all zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not increase the number of directional turns of the zzso zzso pawn zzso zzso which is characterized by defective zzso The described changes indicate a direct effect of low frequency electromagnetic fields on the transport mechanisms of the cell membrane for zzso controlling the zzso activity of zzso
