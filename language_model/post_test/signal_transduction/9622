zzso zzso commonly known as the zzso or deer zzso is the main zzso of zzso disease in the United zzso Recent progress in zzso research has uncovered hundreds of different proteins expressed in the zzso zzso of hard zzso the majority of which have no known function, and include many novel protein zzso We recently identified transcripts coding for two putative zzso zzso in these ticks which recognized zzso zzso as their zzso In this current study, we characterize the genetic expression of these two zzso zzso throughout the tick life cycle as well as the zzso properties of the corresponding zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso proteins showed zzso activity against both zzso zzso and zzso 

The two zzso genes were coded as zzso zzso 1 & 2 and corresponding proteins were referred as zzso zzso 1 and zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso transcripts were detected throughout the zzso tick life cycle, including eggs, larvae, zzso adult zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso the zzso and protein levels were altered upon feeding during both the zzso and zzso life zzso zzso zzso results confirm that zzso zzso was statistically increased upon blood feeding while zzso zzso 2 was zzso This altered expression led us to further characterize the function of these proteins in the zzso zzso The zzso genes were cloned and expressed in a bacterial expression system, and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso as well as the common zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso or zzso may be involved in altering the biological signal for zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso these results suggest that a function of zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 in zzso tick zzso zzso may include zzso of the zzso signal via zzso of zzso or zzso
