We aimed to zzso whether zzso insulin resistance may contribute to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso fatty liver disease zzso and in chronic zzso C virus zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso 71 zzso and 29 patients with zzso normal liver zzso were zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and Western blots were used to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso 3, and type I collagen in liver zzso zzso zzso human zzso were used as an in zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso levels of insulin zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso protein O zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 protein zzso and zzso cell leukemia zzso zzso were significantly lower in NASH than in zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and increased active zzso 3 were only present in zzso In zzso patients, zzso insulin signaling was markedly impaired, regardless of viral zzso and the presence of zzso paralleled with enhanced zzso In cultured human zzso zzso core protein decreased zzso and increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was more pronounced in zzso zzso 

zzso insulin signaling is impaired in NASH and zzso patients, and zzso of zzso targets is associated with increased zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso might be a target for zzso insulin zzso
