zzso zzso are a novel class of drugs that alter normal cellular control of zzso As such, they are being investigated as novel therapies to alter uncontrolled cellular proliferation and treat zzso This review explores new information about how the zzso regulates zzso and how zzso zzso can be exploited as zzso zzso 

zzso zzso block the zzso of nuclear factor zzso B in a number of cell systems, as well as altering zzso regulatory proteins and zzso signals that influence the fate of the zzso These effects are true for many tumor cell zzso The US Food and Drug zzso zzso inhibitor zzso blocks erroneous cell proliferation and zzso zzso in many tumor zzso 

zzso zzso have demonstrated promise in zzso and as a result clinical trials have begun to investigate these agents as therapy for numerous human zzso Furthermore, newer agents are being designed to inhibit the zzso system and exert further zzso zzso
