zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation in zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso followed by the zzso of zzso structures is a prerequisite for increased cell zzso and tumor zzso This zzso switch is designated zzso transition zzso zzso also plays an important role in determining the dissemination of zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso tumor invasion and zzso has not been zzso To determine the functions of activated zzso in zzso zzso we established zzso zzso cell lines that zzso zzso zzso zzso or activated zzso zzso Our results indicate that expression of zzso is sufficient to induce zzso as confirmed with the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas a reduction in zzso zzso zzso and cortical zzso was zzso The zzso and zzso promoter analyses revealed that zzso and zzso an zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing activated zzso clearly acquired an invasive capacity when compared to zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed elevated levels of zzso and zzso activities in media of zzso zzso zzso cells expressing activated zzso induced tumors with short zzso in correlation with their ability to induce experimental zzso in zzso and to express factors known to promote zzso cancer cell zzso In conclusion, our results zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells is sufficient to induce an zzso associated with tumor invasion and zzso
