We investigated the effects of salicylic acid zzso and systemic acquired resistance zzso on crown zzso disease caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso plants treated with zzso showed decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso application of zzso to zzso cultures decreased its growth, zzso and attachment to plant zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we characterized the direct effects of zzso on bacterial gene expression and showed that zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso and zzso regulates the expression of many other sets of zzso Using zzso gene zzso we further demonstrate that plant genes involved in zzso zzso and signaling are important zzso for zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene 1), and zzso zzso protein 2) in zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, plants treated with zzso acid, a potent zzso of zzso showed reduced disease zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso both play a major role in zzso zzso zzso
