zzso T cells play key zzso roles in immunity to infections and zzso Thus, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso T cell zzso and expansion in zzso In striking contrast to their zzso counterparts, the zzso requirements of zzso T cells remain poorly zzso Having previously described a role for the zzso zzso member zzso we since screened for other zzso zzso receptors in zzso T cell zzso We report in this article that the zzso zzso zzso zzso (but not its related protein zzso is expressed on freshly isolated zzso zzso T cells and zzso with the zzso to induce zzso zzso production that promotes zzso cell survival and proliferation in both mice and zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated a zzso function for zzso interactions with its B7 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by zzso zzso zzso but zzso by B7 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cell expansion following zzso infection was severely impaired in mice genetically deficient for zzso This resulted in the failure to mount both zzso and zzso zzso cell responses, which contrasted with the selective effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso Our data collectively show that zzso signals are required for zzso survival and proliferation of both zzso and zzso zzso T cell subsets, thus providing new zzso insight for their zzso in disease zzso
