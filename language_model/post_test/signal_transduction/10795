zzso are natural rich sources of zzso and zzso compounds that are commonly known as potential zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effects of fresh blackberry extracts on proliferation of cancer cells and zzso transformation induced by zzso zzso as well as the underlying mechanisms of signal zzso zzso Using electron spin zzso we found that blackberry extract is an effective scavenger of free zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso extract inhibited the proliferation of a human lung cancer cell line, zzso zzso of zzso cells with blackberry extract resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso formation induced by ultraviolet B zzso zzso zzso extract decreased zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with blackberry extract resulted in the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, blackberry extract also blocked zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso Overall, these results indicated that an extract from fresh blackberry may inhibit tumor zzso zzso and associated cell zzso and suggest that the zzso effects of fresh blackberry may be through its zzso properties by blocking zzso oxygen zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso
