In various animal models pregnancy diets have been shown to affect offspring zzso Indeed, the underlying programming of development is associated with zzso in birth weight, body zzso and continual zzso modifications of offspring metabolism until adulthood, producing the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is permanently altered depending on maternal zzso 

To assess zzso of the zzso zzso due to zzso protein supply, German zzso zzso were fed zzso diets containing protein levels of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso throughout their zzso zzso muscle tissue zzso zzso zzso was collected at 94 days post conception zzso and 1, 28, and 188 days post zzso zzso for use with zzso zzso zzso Genome zzso and subsequent statistical and zzso zzso zzso Numerous transcripts were found to have altered abundance at 94 zzso and 1 zzso at 28 zzso no transcripts were altered, and at 188 zzso only a few transcripts showed a different abundance between diet zzso However, when assessing zzso changes across zzso time points, marked differences were obvious among the dietary zzso Depending on the zzso dietary exposure, zzso and long-term effects were observed for zzso expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation, energy zzso growth factor signaling zzso and zzso acid zzso In particular, the abundance of transcripts related to cell cycle remained divergent among the groups during zzso 

zzso analysis indicates that maternal protein supply induced programming of the zzso zzso early zzso compensation of the slight growth zzso obvious at birth in zzso zzso resulted, as did a permanently different zzso zzso and responsiveness to the common environment of the zzso The zzso zzso are interpreted as the molecular equivalent of zzso plasticity of the offspring that zzso adaptation and maintenance of the zzso zzso
