zzso zzso stress, the blood zzso zzso force acting on the vascular zzso cells, is essential for zzso zzso under normal zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells detect zzso stress and zzso it into zzso signals to trigger vascular zzso zzso Among the various zzso signaling zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso oxide zzso have been implicated in vascular zzso and zzso In this review, we explore the zzso zzso and vascular processes arising from zzso signaling zzso with emphasis on the roles of zzso and zzso and also discuss the mechanisms that may lead to excessive vascular zzso and thus drive zzso processes responsible for zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso zzso is one of main cellular sources of zzso generation in zzso cells under flow zzso zzso patterns and magnitude of zzso determine the amount of zzso produced by zzso cells, usually an irregular flow pattern zzso or zzso producing higher levels of zzso than a regular flow pattern zzso or zzso zzso production is closely linked to NO generation and elevated levels of zzso lead to low NO zzso as is often observed in zzso cells exposed to irregular zzso The low NO zzso is partly caused by the reaction of zzso with NO to form zzso a key zzso which may initiate many zzso zzso This differential production of zzso and zzso zzso nitrogen zzso under various flow patterns and conditions zzso zzso gene expression and thus results in differential vascular zzso Moreover, zzso are able to promote specific zzso modifications in regulatory proteins (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso which constitute chemical signals that are relevant in cardiovascular zzso Overall, the dynamic interplay between local zzso milieu and the resulting zzso and zzso modification of regulatory proteins is important for ensuing vascular zzso Based on available evidence, it is proposed that a regular flow pattern produces lower levels of zzso and higher NO zzso creating an zzso zzso On the other hand, an irregular flow pattern results in higher levels of zzso and yet lower NO zzso thus triggering zzso zzso
