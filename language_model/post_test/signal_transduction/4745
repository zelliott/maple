We are proposing that the zzso zzso of the differently tuned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on insect antennae are not a result of natural selection working to maximize absolute sensitivity to individual zzso zzso Rather, relative zzso are a result of specifically tuned zzso units having been selected to accurately zzso and report to the zzso lobe the zzso ranges of molecular flux imparted by each zzso component in every plume zzso To not reach zzso stimulus flux levels from the most concentrated plume strands of a zzso zzso the zzso surface area of the zzso type that is tuned to the most abundant component of a zzso blend is increased in zzso diameter in order to express a greater number of major zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased ability of these enlarged zzso major zzso zzso to accurately report very high flux of its component results in a larger working range of stimulus flux able to be accurately zzso by that type of zzso However, the larger zzso size and possibly other zzso adjustments in zzso of zzso proteins and degrading zzso cause a decrease in absolute sensitivity to lower flux levels of the major component in lower concentration strands of the zzso zzso In order to restore the ability of the zzso major zzso zzso channel to accurately report to its zzso the abundance of the major component in lower concentration zzso the number of major component zzso over the entire antenna is adjusted upward, creating a greater proportion of major zzso zzso than those tuned to minor zzso zzso blend balance reported by the zzso major and minor component channels in low zzso strands is now zzso and the relative zzso of the 2 components occurring in both low- and zzso strands are thereby accurately reported to the zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that the 2 phenomena, zzso size and relative numbers of zzso tuned zzso are linked, and both are related to wide disparities in molecular flux ranges occurring for the more abundant and less abundant components in the zzso blend plume zzso
