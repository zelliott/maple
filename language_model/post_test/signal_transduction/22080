Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso signaling is persistently activated in many types of cancer cells, and represents a valid target for zzso drug zzso However, few reports have described the zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso is zzso activated in human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso We also investigated the zzso effects of two newly developed small zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso via zzso and zzso was confirmed by the zzso of zzso DNA binding zzso The downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso by zzso and zzso 32 at both zzso zzso and protein zzso The potency of zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso in human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso was higher than that of the 5 previously reported zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Thus, in this study, we investigated the zzso effects of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso zzso we also demonstrated their higher potency in zzso proliferation on human zzso cells as compared to other five zzso zzso and zzso
