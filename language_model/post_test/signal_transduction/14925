The transient zzso potential channel of zzso type 8 zzso which is gated by low zzso degrees zzso temperature and chemical compounds, is regulated by protein zzso zzso zzso in a way opposite to that observed with the transient zzso potential channel of zzso type 1 zzso zzso by being zzso and not zzso As zzso is zzso also by protein zzso A zzso zzso we investigated the effect of two zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso and zzso on the activity of zzso and zzso at zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso the channel zzso zzso We also studied the effect on zzso of: zzso a series of compounds previously shown to activate or antagonize zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso the zzso zzso for the zzso effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso were attenuated by the selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of human zzso receptors zzso zzso in zzso cells also inhibited zzso response to zzso Finally, some zzso zzso and antagonists, but not zzso antagonists, antagonized zzso and much less so zzso induced zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso also antagonized zzso at zzso zzso Although these findings need to be confirmed by experiments directly measuring zzso activity in zzso zzso cells, they support the notion that the same regulatory events have opposing actions on zzso and zzso receptors and identify zzso and zzso as the first potential zzso functional zzso of zzso zzso
