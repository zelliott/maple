zzso growth factor zzso signaling is a critical regulator of zzso growth during fetal and adult development, primarily through its zzso effects on cell proliferation and zzso zzso signaling is also required for development of the zzso system, although its precise role in this regard remains zzso We have hypothesized that zzso signaling is required for embryonic zzso development, which requires the zzso and proliferation of primordial germ cells zzso in an zzso location, followed by directed migration to the zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis using zzso studies in the zzso zzso which possesses two functional copies of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso results in zzso and elimination of primordial germ cells zzso resulting in fewer zzso colonizing the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso has no effect on zzso migration or number despite inducing widespread zzso cell zzso zzso of both zzso using combined zzso injections or zzso of a zzso zzso yields zzso with a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso are eliminated by zzso zzso of an zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso but fails to rescue migration zzso Lastly, we show that suppression of zzso signaling leads to quantitative changes in the expression of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and receptors involved in zzso zzso zzso these data suggest a novel role for zzso signaling in early zzso development, potentially via zzso with zzso signaling zzso
