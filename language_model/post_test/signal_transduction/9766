Recent data suggest that transitions between the relaxed zzso and tense zzso state of zzso control the reduction of zzso to zzso oxide zzso by zzso This reaction may play a role in zzso NO zzso and be a novel consideration for the development of the next generation of zzso blood oxygen carriers zzso zzso artificial blood zzso zzso we tested the effects of chemical stabilization of bovine zzso in either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso formation and ability to stimulate zzso zzso These studies were performed over a range of fractional zzso that is expected to mimic biological zzso The initial rate for zzso decreased in the following order zzso consistent with the hypothesis that the rate constant for zzso reduction is faster with zzso zzso and slower with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso produced more zzso and inhibited zzso zzso more zzso than both zzso and zzso Interestingly, at low oxygen fractional zzso zzso produced more NO and zzso zzso zzso more zzso than zzso despite both derivatives having similar initial rates for zzso reduction and a more negative reduction potential in zzso versus zzso These data suggest that zzso of bovine zzso in the zzso zzso leads to a more effective zzso of zzso reduction to zzso Our results support the model of zzso regulation of zzso reduction by zzso and show that zzso zzso in distinct zzso states can generate products with increased NO yields from zzso reduction that could be harnessed to promote zzso in zzso
