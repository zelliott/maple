zzso I zzso I) is an zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity which is involved in various cellular processes such as regulation of cell zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso I expression and promoter activity by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not that of zzso zzso repression of zzso I induction by zzso was zzso via a newly identified zzso site in the zzso I promoter, but the zzso zzso cascade was not involved in this regulatory pathway, because zzso did not affect zzso zzso I zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso at zzso zzso which enhances the zzso activity of zzso was zzso by zzso and was reduced by simultaneous exposure to zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso revealed that zzso 276 is crucial to zzso zzso repression of zzso induction of zzso zzso Finally, repression of zzso zzso I induction by zzso was zzso via zzso zzso zzso as indicated by studies with the pharmacological inhibitor zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso I gene zzso by zzso in zzso is regulated via a zzso that involves zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso
