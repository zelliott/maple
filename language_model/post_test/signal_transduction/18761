We investigated the cause for resistance to zzso toxicity in zzso zzso zzso mice zzso as compared to its zzso zzso zzso For this purpose after 1 or 10 days zzso zzso zzso exposure, liver samples were zzso zzso investigations revealed that zzso mice showed decreased effects of zzso characterized by reduced zzso zzso and lesser declines in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that while the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice were indistinguishable from zzso mice, zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso were less pronounced in the zzso zzso To confirm that these differences are due to intrinsic cellular zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells were cultured from zzso and their responses to 10 zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso from the zzso mice was less responsive to zzso in terms of its zzso effect on zzso but not on zzso These results indicate that a possible mechanism why zzso mice are less responsive to zzso is that two genes zzso for the growth factor signaling zzso zzso and zzso are not readily affected by zzso
