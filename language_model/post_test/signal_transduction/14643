zzso acid zzso is widely used to treat zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso has been reported to exert a variety of zzso effects, the exact mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain zzso To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms of zzso action, a genetic screen for zzso zzso zzso that show hypersensitivity to zzso was zzso One of the genes that we identified was zzso which encodes a member of the zzso family that is implicated in membrane zzso zzso several zzso affecting membrane trafficking also resulted in hypersensitivity to zzso These include zzso and zzso both zzso a zzso family zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso protein complex zzso More importantly, zzso caused zzso fragmentation and inhibited the zzso and the zzso of acid zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso affects membrane zzso Interestingly, the zzso agents such as zzso or the zzso of zzso dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells enhanced their sensitivity to the zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that zzso affects membrane trafficking, which leads to the enhanced sensitivity to zzso damage in zzso zzso
