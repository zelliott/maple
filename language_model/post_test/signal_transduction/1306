The zzso E virus causes acute viral zzso endemic in much of the developing world and is a serious public health zzso However, due to the lack of an in zzso culture system or a small animal model, its biology and zzso are poorly zzso We have shown earlier that the zzso protein zzso of zzso E virus activates zzso a member of the zzso zzso Here we have explored the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated it to be independent of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso resonance energy transfer we showed that zzso binds zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso The binding regions in the two proteins were mapped to the N zzso of zzso and a central portion of zzso zzso of zzso protected zzso from the zzso effects of zzso expressed zzso This is the first example of a viral protein regulating zzso zzso by zzso of its zzso dual specificity zzso
