zzso are soluble zzso of cell communication that are critical in immune zzso They induce specific zzso programs in responsive zzso Recent findings, however, indicate that zzso receptors can regulate immune cell functions by zzso zzso Here we review the current understanding of how zzso signaling regulates the functions of other signaling pathways by first discussing the zzso zzso consequences of zzso signaling and then providing a detailed description of zzso lateral communications between zzso receptors and other cellular zzso
