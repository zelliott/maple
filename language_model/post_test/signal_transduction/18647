zzso zzso is a primary pathogen associated with dental zzso Its zzso zzso production ability is thought to play an important role in maintaining competitiveness in the zzso oral zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that the production of the zzso zzso I, is responsive to multiple input signals and that a putative zzso zzso zzso seems to be involved in the zzso zzso I gene regulation zzso In this study, we demonstrate that these multiple zzso can be divided into two zzso zzso and zzso Similar to zzso signals zzso through zzso zzso and zzso exert their effect possibly through modulating zzso transcription, whereas signals zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso exert their effect through an unknown mechanism independent of zzso
