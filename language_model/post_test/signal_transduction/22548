The zzso family of zzso zzso participate in a variety of zzso processes in which embryonic polarity is zzso To study a role for zzso zzso in zzso axis determination, we zzso with zzso signaling in the zzso using the zzso domain of zzso zzso 8 zzso which blocks zzso zzso of a target gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in formation of secondary axes containing abundant zzso and head zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling is required to maintain zzso cell fates and has to be suppressed for zzso development to zzso
