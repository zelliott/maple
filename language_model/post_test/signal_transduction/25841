Plant zzso zzso cause important yield losses in zzso A zzso approach was used to study the changes in the leaf zzso profile of the plant zzso zzso infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional gel zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso analysis was used to identify highly abundant proteins zzso expressed in response to zzso zzso From a total of 210 zzso detected and analyzed spots, the intensity of zzso spots was altered, and zzso of them were successfully identified by zzso assisted laser zzso time of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of the identified proteins belonged to energy and metabolism whereas zzso were stress and defense zzso Taken together, the results allow to assess changes at the zzso level in the host due to the defense zzso zzso show an initial defense response, not strong enough to overcome the zzso which may be similar to other susceptible zzso zzso however, zzso between various defense zzso regulatory networks and zzso conditions are other important aspects to be zzso
