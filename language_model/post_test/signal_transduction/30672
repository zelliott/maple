Tara was identified as an interacting partner of zzso zzso exchange factor Trio and zzso Tara is proposed to be involved in many important fundamental cellular zzso ranging from zzso zzso directed cell movement, to cell cycle zzso Yet, its exact roles required further zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso protein zzso a putative member of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directly binds Tara in zzso and forms a complex with Tara in zzso zzso of zzso enhances the zzso of Tara in zzso and promotes the turnover of zzso whereas depletion of zzso by small interfering zzso decreases Tara zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso All these findings suggest that zzso may facilitate cell cycle progression via regulating zzso and degradation of zzso
