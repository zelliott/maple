zzso a widely used zzso drug, has zzso and zzso effects in the vessel zzso In the present study, we report an zzso property of zzso in human retinal zzso cells zzso and describe an underlying molecular zzso Treatment with zzso protected zzso from zzso in response to serum deprivation in a zzso zzso This zzso of zzso by zzso was not altered by zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso for zzso zzso had no beneficial effects on serum zzso cell zzso zzso zzso induced a sustained zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, compound C, a specific zzso zzso almost completely blocked the zzso survival effect as well as zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso prevents zzso cell death induced by serum deprivation through zzso but zzso zzso Thus zzso may have a novel therapeutic property that can control unwanted cell death found in diabetic zzso
