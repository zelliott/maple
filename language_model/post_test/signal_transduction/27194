The zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso B zzso in zzso are zzso signal zzso pathways that mediate several different biological zzso In zzso genetic analysis of zzso patterning of the zzso has defined the series of genes that mediate the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso which requires the novel protein zzso to activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity controls the degradation of the Cactus zzso which is present in a zzso complex with the zzso zzso Once Cactus is zzso in response to zzso zzso is free to move into the nucleus where it regulates zzso of specific target zzso The zzso tube, zzso zzso and zzso genes also appear to be involved in zzso immune zzso Because the zzso B zzso plays a role in zzso innate immunity and because plant zzso of the zzso zzso are important in plant disease resistance, it is likely that this zzso arose before the divergence of plants and animals as a defense against zzso
