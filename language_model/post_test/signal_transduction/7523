NO is a zzso signaling zzso and has an important role in zzso and zzso In the brain, NO is produced by zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso by zzso coupled to the zzso zzso via zzso zzso this zzso interaction is disrupted upon binding of zzso adapter protein zzso by zzso to zzso As both zzso and zzso were associated with zzso we here investigated these genes in greater detail by zzso new samples and conducting a zzso of our own and published zzso In doing so, we confirmed association of both genes with schizophrenia and found evidence for their interaction in increasing risk towards zzso Our strongest finding was the zzso promoter zzso zzso yielding an odds ratio of zzso in the zzso As findings from zzso cell systems have suggested that the risk zzso decreases gene zzso we studied the effect of the zzso on zzso expression in human zzso brain samples and found that the risk zzso significantly decreases expression of zzso in the prefrontal zzso zzso analyses suggest that this might be due the replacement of six zzso factor binding sites by two new binding sites as a consequence of proxy zzso Taken together, our data argue that genetic zzso in zzso resulting in lower prefrontal brain expression of this gene contributes to schizophrenia liability, and that zzso interacts with zzso in doing zzso The zzso zzso interface may thus well constitute a novel target for small molecules in at least some forms of zzso
