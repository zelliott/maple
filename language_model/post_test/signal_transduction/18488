zzso signaling has been demonstrated to mediate zzso suppression of zzso at climbing fiber zzso and parallel fiber zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso release of cannabinoids zzso additionally suppresses a zzso form of long-term zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso can be induced by 8 zzso zzso zzso but is blocked when the zzso zzso is paired with 4 or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso activity can be zzso for by bath application of the CB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity no longer suppresses zzso zzso zzso can also be obtained by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked this zzso enhancement, showing that zzso zzso zzso interferes with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso which zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity has been described to promote the induction of zzso zzso depression zzso and to impair zzso zzso Our observation that zzso activity blocks the induction of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso input controls all forms of zzso and zzso zzso plasticity and that zzso activity provides a zzso zzso to prevent an enhancement of zzso release while zzso zzso zzso function is zzso during zzso
