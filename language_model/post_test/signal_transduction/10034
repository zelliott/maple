Growth hormone zzso plays an important role in growth and metabolism by signaling via at least three major zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin promote growth probably by modulating liver zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso but the possible effects of insulin on zzso zzso signaling have yet to be zzso We hypothesized that short-term insulin, similar to the fluctuations that occur following zzso affects zzso zzso zzso Our present studies suggest that, in rat zzso zzso cells, insulin (4 h or less) selectively enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Although insulin zzso altered zzso formation of zzso complex, it did not significantly affect zzso zzso of other signaling zzso upstream of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that insulin zzso facilitated zzso cell membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso also increased the amount of zzso association with its scaffolding zzso zzso In zzso short-term insulin treatment of zzso zzso cells selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso and zzso but likely resulted from increased cell membrane zzso of zzso These findings suggest that insulin may be necessary for zzso of cells to zzso zzso zzso and provides a potential cellular mechanism by which insulin promotes zzso
