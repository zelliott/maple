The leaves and stems of zzso zzso zzso zzso for a long time have been known to inhibit inflammatory zzso production and allergic zzso and have been used to treat liver zzso It needs to be zzso in terms of global gene expression whether zzso has an influence as an zzso agent on the cultured human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso This study investigated the zzso changes of the genes by zzso using the zzso zzso human gene zzso ST array when the cultured human zzso zzso was treated with zzso It was observed that the zzso and immune zzso genes were activated by zzso challenge in the cultured human zzso zzso The array analysis showed that 65 of the 344 genes zzso by zzso zzso when compared to the control, were zzso by the zzso zzso A number of zzso and immune zzso genes of the 65 genes were zzso In addition, 78 of the zzso genes zzso by the zzso when compared to the control, were zzso by the zzso zzso The regulatory patterns of the representative genes were correlated with the real-time zzso zzso The zzso extract and its specific zzso zzso and zzso significantly hindered the production of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso can zzso inhibit the zzso of the zzso and immune zzso genes and the inflammatory zzso in the human zzso zzso
