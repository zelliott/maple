In addition to their well-documented zzso effects, steroid hormones may also exert actions that are: zzso zzso zzso insensitive to zzso of transcription, zzso zzso by steroids coupled to cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cells that do not express the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso Such zzso effects have been described for all the major classes of steroids zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as for zzso hormones, zzso and vitamin zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso have been studied most zzso in human zzso and in the zzso zzso However, similar zzso actions of zzso and other steroids have now been described in a wide variety of different zzso in many zzso The first putative membrane steroid zzso to be cloned was that for the pig membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso similar genes were cloned from rats and zzso and two related zzso have been described in zzso Despite accumulating evidence for zzso membrane actions of steroids, a number of uncertainties remain as to the properties and identity of such zzso and their cellular zzso Furthermore, some rapid steroid effects may be zzso through zzso zzso steroid zzso and steroid receptors may be capable of zzso other zzso pathways zzso This review focuses on some of these unresolved issues, taking as its model the actions of zzso in the zzso zzso
