zzso transmitted by zzso zzso zzso regulate the functions of multiple zzso present in the nucleus and in the zzso in similar zzso In spite of this fact, the prevailing trend of the field has been to focus on the nuclear zzso being considered the main executor of zzso biological zzso Following this fashion, scaffold proteins have been often described as zzso of zzso zzso in their route, either as zzso or as zzso to their ultimate destination at the zzso zzso recent findings demonstrate that scaffolds and zzso zzso are essential for the zzso of zzso but not nuclear zzso zzso is critical for connecting the zzso zzso complex to zzso zzso zzso while nuclear zzso are activated by zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking zzso zzso signals by preventing zzso zzso is sufficient for attenuating cellular zzso transformation and tumor zzso These new results highlight the importance of zzso zzso signals, disclose an unprecedented functional relationship between scaffold proteins and zzso zzso and identify zzso as a key zzso of the spatial specificity of zzso zzso
