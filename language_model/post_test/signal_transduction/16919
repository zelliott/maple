zzso one of the most abundant zzso in zzso zzso and tomatoes, has been used as a traditional zzso agent for zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso in zzso inflammation remains unknown so zzso The present study investigated a molecular basis for the protective effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the severity of colitis and resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the colon zzso The decline in the production of zzso zzso specifically zzso and zzso correlated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein was significantly zzso which correlated with a similar decrease in zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso results, zzso exposure blocked zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso reporter zzso performed on human zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso demonstrated a significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, for the first time, the present study indicates that targeted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso might be an important mechanism for zzso in zzso experimental zzso
