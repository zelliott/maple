zzso zzso signaling plays a central role in zzso lineage zzso and in supporting the growth and proliferation of immature zzso zzso in the zzso during zzso zzso In zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso a tumor resulting from the zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso signaling triggered by zzso zzso in the zzso gene contributes to zzso transformation and is a hallmark of this zzso Most notably, small zzso zzso zzso zzso can effectively block zzso signaling in zzso and could be exploited as a targeted therapy in this zzso In addition, a number of emerging zzso therapeutic strategies including zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso of zzso signaling and combination therapies with zzso and zzso have recently been zzso Finally, the identification of zzso zzso in solid tumors and chronic zzso zzso has increased even further the clinical relevance of zzso signaling as a therapeutic target in human zzso Here we review our current understanding of zzso zzso the mechanisms of action of zzso zzso in zzso and the therapeutic and zzso implications of zzso zzso in zzso
