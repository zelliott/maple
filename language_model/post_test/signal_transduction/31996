The zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso is comprised of complex zzso abnormalities in different cell types in the zzso To date, there are not yet effective drugs that can completely inhibit the zzso event, and efforts have been devoted to prevent or minimize the progression of this zzso Much attention has focused on studies to understand zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of calcium zzso and toxic effects of zzso zzso beta peptides zzso which results in production of zzso oxygen and nitrogen species and signaling zzso leading to zzso dysfunction and synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has been implicated to play a role in the zzso of many neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso However, mechanisms for their modes of action and their roles in the zzso and zzso signaling pathways have not been firmly zzso In this article, we review recent studies providing a zzso link between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso due to stimulation of zzso zzso receptors and toxic zzso zzso The requirements for zzso binding together with its zzso modifications by protein zzso and possible by the zzso zzso provide strong support for a dynamic role of zzso in serving multiple functions to zzso and zzso cells under abnormal zzso and pathological zzso zzso understanding mechanisms for zzso in the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso will allow the development of novel therapeutic targets to mitigate the zzso effects of zzso
