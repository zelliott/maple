zzso expression of zzso has been shown to induce or enhance zzso in various different cell zzso zzso requires zzso for zzso in some but not all the cell types, indicating zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso In B zzso line zzso stable expression of zzso has been demonstrated to protect cells from zzso zzso However, stable expression of zzso carrying zzso functions may generate zzso cells resistant to zzso By utilizing an zzso system for zzso we demonstrated here that zzso expression of zzso induced zzso of zzso by itself, indicating that zzso zzso zzso in zzso as is the case for other cell zzso When zzso of zzso was zzso zzso cells zzso zzso no longer underwent zzso in the absence of other zzso but showed markedly enhanced zzso in the presence of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso expression enhances zzso by a zzso zzso in the presence of zzso signaling but requires zzso for zzso in the absence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso may thus activate a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
