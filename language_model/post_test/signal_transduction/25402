The zzso hormone, zzso zzso has many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lowered blood zzso in zzso mice, a model of type 2 zzso Here, we have explored this finding and its possible mechanisms zzso 

zzso and lean mice were treated with zzso the zzso 3- zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso or zzso Blood zzso insulin sensitivity, levels and synthesis were zzso zzso of zzso on zzso insulin signaling were analyzed in zzso zzso with Western zzso zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was achieved with an appropriate zzso zzso zzso 

Single injections of zzso (7 zzso zzso rapidly and markedly attenuated zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso attenuated blood zzso and increased insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso Higher doses of zzso zzso zzso reversed insulin resistance in zzso zzso zzso also increased insulin levels in plasma and the zzso differentiation factor (an insulin synthesis zzso zzso and insulin storage in pancreatic zzso in zzso zzso These zzso effects of zzso were abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso In zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso effects blocked by zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso insulin zzso improved insulin sensitivity, and increased insulin zzso which may contribute to its zzso zzso These findings may provide new approaches to the treatment of type 2 zzso
