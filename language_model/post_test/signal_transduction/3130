zzso zzso zzso the most common sustained cardiac zzso in clinical practice, is often associated with progressive zzso and zzso of the zzso which constitute the zzso of the zzso This zzso zzso is characterized by complex structural and functional zzso of the zzso zzso short action zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which act together to favor local zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso of the electrical zzso However, the underlying mechanisms of the zzso zzso are not yet fully zzso The possibility of studying human zzso zzso has led to the identification of zzso currents that contribute to the zzso of the action potential and zzso periods during zzso The zzso of the zzso calcium current plays a central role in this electrical zzso It results mainly from the zzso of calcium channels as the consequence of an excessive stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking and targeting of zzso channels at the plasma membrane has emerged as mechanisms that can contribute to the abnormal electrical properties of the zzso during zzso Fibrosis is the other feature of the zzso zzso and it is favored by the zzso zzso zzso Local zzso of the zzso system is involved in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that accumulates in zzso and zzso zzso could be another important zzso of the zzso structural zzso during zzso This zzso by binding on its zzso zzso can zzso several signaling pathways regulating growth and survival of zzso zzso Better understanding of zzso factors involved in the formation of the zzso zzso is crucial for the identification of novel zzso and therapeutic targets that could be used to improve the diagnostic and treatment of zzso
