zzso adaptation pathways operate within wide-ranging environmental conditions without stimulus zzso Despite numerous differences in the adaptation mechanisms employed by bacteria and zzso all require energy zzso Here, we present two minimal models showing that expenditure of energy by the cell is not essential for zzso Both models share important features with large zzso zzso they employ small zzso molecules and involve zzso zzso resembling highly zzso zzso zzso zzso the drawbacks of these models helps us understand the benefits of energy consumption, in terms of zzso of response and adaptation times as well as separation of zzso sensing and zzso zzso Our work thus sheds new light on the evolution of adaptation mechanisms in complex zzso
