This study investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso in locally applied, zzso oral bone zzso The possibility of enhancing long-term bone zzso with an zzso carrier was zzso zzso of 44 mature female rats were treated zzso with the following zzso 2 zzso of zzso in ethanol zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Bone wash technology zzso of PBS and zzso by zzso was used to sample injection sites at baseline zzso zzso and 3, 7, 14, and 21 days zzso After zzso or 48 days, zzso analysis was zzso The amount of zzso in bone wash fluid was measured by zzso zzso by total zzso and compared between high and low bone growth groups zzso and correlated with subsequent bone zzso at 21 days zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were evaluated with real-time zzso Single injections of 2 zzso of zzso induced significantly more new bone than control side after 21 zzso zzso ratios peaked at day 7 and were correlated with the subsequent zzso new bone zzso The correlations at day 14 between zzso and new bone zzso changed to a negative relationship in the test zzso zzso zzso expressed increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso while SIM activated zzso synthesis in zzso zzso tended to preserve bone zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso and higher levels of zzso during the first week following zzso bone growth are desirable, and zzso zzso not only act as zzso carriers, but preserve new zzso
