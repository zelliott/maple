The zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso stability, and aging in budding zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso have been identified zzso and it has been speculated that some may have similar functions to zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso protein that promotes resistance to DNA damage and suppresses zzso instability in mouse cells, in association with a role in base zzso repair zzso zzso mice are small and at 2-3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound zzso loss of subcutaneous fat, zzso and severe zzso zzso eventually dying at about 4 zzso We conclude that one function of zzso is to promote normal DNA repair, and that zzso loss leads to abnormalities in mice that overlap with zzso degenerative zzso
