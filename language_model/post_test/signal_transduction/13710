Several recent studies have revealed that statins exert zzso effects in addition to their zzso property zzso and zzso Recently, statins were shown to alleviate pain associated trauma in a zzso pain zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of analgesia caused by the zzso zzso zzso in an animal model of zzso pain in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso significantly attenuated the second phase of the acute zzso response to zzso injection, and daily administration of zzso for zzso inhibited the long-term mechanical zzso caused by zzso zzso Spinal zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and Western zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso and Western zzso were significantly inhibited by zzso treatment at day 7 after zzso zzso In addition, peripheral zzso injection induced a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso by membrane zzso zzso ratio using Western zzso in the spinal zzso The spinal zzso zzso in zzso was reversed by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso behaviors, at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 

Our novel findings indicated that zzso attenuated zzso zzso responses by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso may be a zzso target for treating zzso central nervous system inflammation and chronic pain zzso
