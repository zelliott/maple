The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are involved in the inflammatory processes of zzso zzso have shown zzso zzso effects on zzso and zzso responses in zzso We zzso that this effect may be associated with the zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso knockout mice were zzso into control group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso and zzso group zzso diet and zzso Sixteen weeks later, zzso roots were stained with zzso and zzso Total cholesterol and zzso zzso cholesterol were measured by the zzso zzso The gene and protein expressions of zzso and zzso were detected separately through real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso zzso The serum levels of zzso B4 and zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso All mice have zzso zzso mice in the control group have only tiny zzso zzso but mice in the zzso group and zzso group have typical zzso zzso The corrected plaque areas zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of mice in the zzso group were significantly decreased compared with those of the zzso zzso The serum cholesterol levels of the zzso group were not of significant difference compared with those of the zzso zzso The gene and protein expressions of zzso and zzso in the zzso as well as the serum levels of zzso B4 and zzso zzso in zzso group, were markedly reduced compared with those of the zzso zzso 

These data suggested that zzso significantly alleviated zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and down regulating the expression of zzso in zzso zzso
