The zzso profile in leaves and roots of the transgenic cotton line zzso expressing zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a customized zzso cotton zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso transcripts involved in 34 pathways were zzso expressed in the transgenic line zzso in which 123 zzso expressed genes were related to the cotton zzso responses including the hypersensitive reaction, zzso responses associated with the recognition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways zzso by salicylic acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso Furthermore, transcripts zzso various zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso were zzso in the transgenic line zzso and expression of transcripts related to the energy producing and consuming zzso was also increased, which suggested that the enhanced metabolism related to the host zzso response in the transgenic line zzso imposed an increased energy demand on the transgenic zzso
