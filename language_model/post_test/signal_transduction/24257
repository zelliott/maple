Renal zzso zzso zzso can be recruited from zzso compartments to the plasma membrane by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study examines the role of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso The studies were performed in zzso cells that have the capacity to form zzso from zzso In approximately 50% of the cells treated with L-dopa the zzso was found to be zzso from zzso compartments towards the plasma zzso zzso of the zzso network by zzso significantly prevented zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso had no zzso In control cells zzso zzso with zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso This zzso was disrupted in zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso of protein zzso C zzso To test the functional effect of zzso zzso the capacity of zzso zzso to activate zzso was zzso zzso of zzso significantly zzso zzso from zzso compartments to the plasma zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso - but not zzso - zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso recruitment requires an intact zzso network and occurs via zzso zzso These newly recruited receptors couple to the zzso signaling zzso
