zzso in zzso protein genes can cause zzso zzso zzso a disorder characterized by zzso enlargement, fibrosis, and impaired zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso protein gene zzso activate zzso and zzso signals in zzso cells to produce zzso zzso in zzso Gene expression analyses of zzso cells isolated from zzso mouse hearts showed increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso regions of zzso hearts confirmed the zzso profiling zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice reduced but did not zzso zzso proliferation and zzso In contrast, administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso administration of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso mice prevented the emergence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment did not reverse zzso zzso of established zzso but did reduce zzso zzso These data define zzso zzso of zzso signaling as a pivotal mechanism for increased zzso in zzso and a potentially important factor contributing to zzso dysfunction and heart zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signals warrants study in human patients with zzso gene zzso
