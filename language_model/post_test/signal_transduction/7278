A population of zzso cardiac zzso cells zzso has been identified in the heart and shown to contribute to zzso zzso after zzso Previously, we have shown the zzso zzso cell derived factor zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso response to zzso where chronic infusion of the zzso zzso zzso exacerbated zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso proliferation was further investigated in primary cultures of zzso sorted zzso zzso zzso facilitated zzso zzso by blocking cell cycle progression at the zzso to zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso consequently attenuating zzso zzso zzso and zzso Increased levels of zzso with zzso were effective, increasing zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso degradation and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso verified zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso responsible for increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increase in zzso activity affected cell cycle through zzso zzso increased zzso D1 zzso and decreased zzso D1 zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts a zzso effect on resident zzso zzso by decreasing zzso levels, increasing zzso activity, stabilizing zzso and affecting regulation of the cell cycle through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important factor in stem and zzso cell preservation under zzso conditions, however, with stress or injury in which zzso is zzso zzso may limit expansion and contribution to zzso zzso
