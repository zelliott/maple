Our objective is to present a comprehensive view of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the discussion of the zzso and the zzso zzso screening strategy to zzso of the knowledge gained through the studies of zzso generated using the zzso The zzso is a component of the zzso zzso potential that is generated when a substantial fraction of zzso is zzso to its active form, zzso The zzso zzso screening strategy was adopted to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of zzso zzso screening for identifying zzso zzso Using this strategy, two classes of zzso zzso were identified and isolated, zzso and zzso each zzso multiple zzso zzso The zzso zzso are characterized by zzso reduction in the major zzso zzso whereas the ina zzso display defects in some aspects of functions related to the zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso zzso The signaling proteins that have been identified and zzso through the studies of zzso zzso include the zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso protein for nascent zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso required in multiple steps of the zzso zzso zzso Also identified by the zzso zzso are some of the key zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso As for the ina zzso they led to the discovery of the scaffold zzso zzso responsible for the nucleation of the zzso signaling zzso Also identified by the ina zzso is one of the key members of the signaling complex, zzso zzso and two other proteins that are likely to be important, though their roles in the signaling cascade have not yet been fully zzso In most of these cases, the protein identified is the first member of its class to be so zzso
