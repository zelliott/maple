Active zzso zzso are zzso factors that regulate plant growth and development in a zzso zzso zzso plants that are zzso zzso or exhibit reduced zzso responses, display a characteristic dwarf zzso zzso zzso analysis has resulted in the isolation of zzso zzso which partially suppress the dwarf zzso zzso by zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso Here we describe detailed studies of the effects of two of these zzso zzso and zzso on several different zzso growth processes zzso zzso zzso growth, stem zzso zzso zzso and zzso and on the in zzso amounts of active and inactive zzso zzso The results of these experiments show that zzso and zzso affect the zzso zzso relationship for a wide range of zzso responses and suggest that all zzso processes are controlled through a zzso acting zzso zzso
