zzso of zzso zzso receptors was investigated by zzso of zzso fragments against their zzso peptides zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso domain of 46 zzso and 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For each zzso masking the zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso fragments resulted in complete depletion of the zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to accumulate at the plasma membrane and to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also observed for redistributed 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that for both redistributed receptors the amount of zzso accumulated zzso zzso was zzso In addition, downstream transport along the zzso zzso was slowed zzso These data suggest that sorting information for early steps in the zzso zzso is contained within the zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso
