The immune system consists of two zzso different but closely related responses, innate immunity and zzso zzso Each of these responses has characteristic zzso receptors zzso for innate immunity and zzso receptors for zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso recruitment domain zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals from receptors of both immune zzso zzso was recruited to zzso zzso complexes after zzso zzso Moreover, zzso production in zzso cells was reduced on stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with bacterial DNA, indicating that zzso is downstream of zzso but not zzso zzso cells were also zzso to zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso and deficient for zzso through zzso zzso also implicated in the innate immune zzso Furthermore, zzso T cells showed severely reduced zzso zzso zzso production and proliferation on zzso zzso engagement, and impaired differentiation to zzso zzso 1 zzso cells, indicating that zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is therefore a signal zzso and zzso of signals for both the innate and zzso immune zzso
