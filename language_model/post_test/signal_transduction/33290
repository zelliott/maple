Human zzso virus type 1 zzso acquires several host cell membrane proteins when it buds from infected zzso To study the effect of zzso incorporated zzso zzso zzso on the biology of zzso we have developed a transient expression system that has enabled us to produce virus particles differing only in the absence or the presence of zzso zzso By using a zzso infection zzso based on an zzso target zzso line zzso zzso with an zzso long terminal repeat driven zzso gene zzso we have been able to demonstrate that the acquisition of zzso zzso by zzso has functional significance, since it leads to a pronounced increase in viral zzso zzso to zzso in an zzso fashion, as shown by blocking with zzso and zzso zzso The same zzso effect on viral zzso was also observed with zzso zzso Studies of the zzso of infection revealed that the positive effect zzso by zzso embedded host cell membrane zzso is due to an increase in the efficiency of early steps in the viral life zzso These results provide new insights into how incorporation of host proteins can zzso the biological properties of zzso Our findings have direct clinical zzso considering that zzso is expressed on the surface of zzso cells and, more importantly, that zzso zzso has been shown to be acquired by clinical zzso zzso grown on primary zzso zzso These data justify a more complete analysis of the other putative zzso that zzso incorporated zzso may play in the life cycle of zzso for example, at the level of zzso zzso
