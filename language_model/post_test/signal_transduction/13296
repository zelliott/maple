Signal zzso proteins that can integrate multiple upstream signals play a critical role in the complex regulatory circuits that control cellular zzso The two signaling zzso proteins zzso zzso 2 and the zzso regulator zzso zzso syndrome protein have zzso similar signaling zzso Recent studies, however, reveal that these proteins zzso distinct mechanisms of signal integration, leading to subtle but important quantitative differences in zzso
