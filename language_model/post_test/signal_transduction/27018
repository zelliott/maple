zzso of protein zzso has been suggested as an alternative mechanism of tumor promotion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now used early zzso passages dependent on zzso zzso and serum for growth and later passages with partial zzso zzso independence, to investigate the role of protein zzso on zzso DNA zzso Neither zzso acid, an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso nor zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso can stimulate zzso or zzso zzso in contrast to zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso are able to suppress serum and zzso zzso zzso if added within 4 hours of growth zzso zzso of zzso by either inhibitor correlated with an early increase in a common set of zzso zzso which included a major 33 zzso zzso Our data suggest that protein zzso zzso are growth zzso and antagonize zzso zzso effects in cells of zzso origin, zzso an early requirement for protein zzso activity during zzso zzso in these zzso
