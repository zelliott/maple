This review summarizes our current understanding of zzso events in the initiation of kidney stone formation, focusing on results from studies using zzso zzso cells in zzso Such studies have shown that zzso - either in zzso or in soluble form - triggers a spectrum of responses in zzso cells that favor stone formation, including zzso in membrane surface properties that promote crystal attachment and zzso in cell viability that provide debris for crystal zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to play an important role in zzso actions, triggering a signaling cascade that generates several zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso that act on key zzso targets zzso zzso The net effect is increased production of zzso oxygen molecules zzso in turn affect other cellular zzso an increase in cell death and an induction of a number of genes in surviving cells, some of which may promote proliferation for replacement of damaged cells, or may promote zzso of urinary zzso that serve to zzso crystal zzso A scheme is provided that explains how such zzso zzso could initiate stone formation in zzso
