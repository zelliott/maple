It is well known that many of the actions of zzso in the central nervous system are zzso via zzso zzso factors that interact with steroid response elements on target zzso However, there now exists compelling evidence for membrane steroid receptors for zzso in zzso and other brain zzso It is not well understood how zzso signals via membrane zzso and how these signals influence not only membrane zzso but also gene zzso in zzso Indeed, it has been known for some time that zzso can rapidly alter zzso activity within seconds, indicating that some cellular effects can occur via zzso zzso In addition, zzso can affect second zzso systems including calcium zzso and a plethora of zzso to alter cell zzso zzso this review considers our current knowledge of rapid zzso and zzso signaling by zzso in the brain, and the nature of receptors involved and how they contribute to zzso zzso
