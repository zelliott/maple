The zzso protein is involved in loading zzso zzso zzso to the root zzso Ten genes zzso to zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From this gene family, transcript levels of only zzso zzso and zzso were increased by zzso While the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso followed the same rapid zzso and was dependent on the zzso zzso factor, zzso only strongly suppressed the expression of zzso and had a minor effect on zzso zzso of zzso was found to increase transcript levels of both zzso and zzso in zzso or zzso plants, but to suppress zzso under the same zzso zzso of plants with zzso or zzso had contrasting effect depending on the gene and on the zzso status of the zzso Thus, while both hormones zzso expression of zzso independently of the plant zzso status, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso plants and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid inhibited zzso and zzso expression in both zzso and zzso plants, but increased zzso expression under the same zzso The zzso of expression by zzso acid of zzso and zzso and of the zzso responsive genes zzso and zzso was zzso on the zzso type zzso protein zzso These results reveal that various levels of cross talk between the signal zzso pathways to zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of expression of the three zzso zzso
