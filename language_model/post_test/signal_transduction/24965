The interaction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is likely to be important in regulating the zzso growth factor zzso zzso The zzso zzso activated by zzso and zzso appear to be very similar, as demonstrated by studies using zzso of the zzso and other components of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the human embryonic kidney cell line zzso zzso expresses zzso and zzso receptors zzso To determine which specific pathways might be activated by the two zzso at zzso levels of all zzso we studied zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso both under zzso conditions and in the presence of zzso receptors and zzso zzso Our results suggest a zzso specificity of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso was determined by reporter gene zzso Both zzso and zzso were able to induce the reporter gene containing the zzso responsive element zzso but the zzso response appeared to be zzso mainly through zzso zzso In contrast, the reporter gene containing the zzso responsive element zzso was zzso zzso The levels of gene induction by zzso and zzso were not altered by the zzso with zzso and zzso suggesting that there is little zzso at the zzso zzso level between the two zzso Neither zzso nor zzso activated the zzso responsive serum response element zzso unless zzso receptors or zzso were zzso zzso of zzso or zzso expression zzso enhanced the response to zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso reporter gene but had no effect on the zzso zzso of the same reporter or on the zzso reporter zzso Thus, our studies suggest that while each zzso zzso and zzso may activate various members of the zzso zzso in zzso studies, specific zzso of zzso by zzso and of zzso and zzso by zzso can be observed in zzso cells and that in this system the synergistic effect of zzso appears specific for zzso
