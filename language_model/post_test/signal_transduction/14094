The gender difference in tumor necrosis zzso zzso production in human zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was explored by using peripheral blood zzso from young men and zzso As compared with female zzso male zzso released greater amounts of zzso and exhibited stronger zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso production was markedly enhanced by zzso of cells with zzso and zzso zzso in male zzso was significantly greater than that in female zzso Male zzso showed higher expression of zzso but not zzso zzso than female zzso and its expression was increased by stimulation with zzso or zzso plus zzso These findings indicate that male zzso show higher responsiveness to stimulation with zzso and zzso than female zzso and suggest that the gender difference in zzso responsiveness to zzso and zzso is partly responsible for that in the outcome of zzso in which zzso women show a favorable prognosis as compared with zzso
