zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso in zzso cells, the dominant zzso cells in the zzso are supposed to be responsible for the spatial zzso action of zzso zzso The molecular properties and zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso channels in rat and rabbit zzso were examined by using zzso molecular zzso and zzso zzso Only a single population of zzso channel activity, the properties of which were identical to those of zzso expressed in zzso cells, could be recorded from zzso to the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated expression of zzso 1 in zzso cells per zzso The zzso zzso was distributed in clusters throughout zzso cell zzso The zzso expression in zzso cells disappeared promptly after zzso When the zzso zzso cells were cultured on zzso dishes in the presence of insulin, zzso zzso was detected in a clustered manner on the cell zzso Because insulin and zzso exist in the surrounding of zzso cells in the zzso these substances possibly may be zzso regulators of expression and distribution of zzso in zzso cells in zzso
