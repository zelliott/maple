Although zzso studies have found an association between zzso zzso infection and severe zzso the causality and underlying mechanism are largely zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso infection increases the proliferation and enhances the survival of immune and inflammatory cells, resulting in reduced responsiveness to zzso and suggesting that the underlying mechanism is related to a zzso zzso 

Human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were cultured in zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso by adding zzso and the underlying mechanism was investigated by treating cells with zzso that is a zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular proliferation and zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and counting zzso cells using flow zzso 

Cellular proliferation was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso which is more prominent in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso effect of zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso infection and the reduced response to zzso were effectively reversed by blocking the zzso zzso at least zzso 

zzso zzso infection enhanced the proliferation and survival of immune and inflammatory cells, resulting in steroid zzso The reversal of these phenomena by the zzso inhibitor suggests that zzso may play an important role in the induction of steroid dependence or zzso A zzso inhibitor may therefore be a candidate agent for managing zzso or zzso severe zzso
