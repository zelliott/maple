The zzso zzso zzso is susceptible to various stresses that provoke the zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso or zzso stresses in the zzso result in zzso cell death involving zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso cells can adapt for survival to deal with an zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso by increasing zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso such as zzso to facilitate protein zzso The induction system is termed the unfolded protein response zzso It has been reported that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso factor, are zzso of the zzso through sensing zzso of unfolded zzso Cell fates after zzso stress are regulated by the balance of both zzso and the zzso zzso In the nervous systems, zzso are well known to be resistant to zzso stresses induced by zzso and zzso These findings raise the possibility that zzso possess a novel zzso signaling different from that of zzso zzso Recently, we identified a novel zzso stress zzso zzso which is specifically expressed in zzso This protein is a zzso protein containing the zzso zzso The functional analyses of zzso showed that 1) it was zzso within the zzso membrane in response to the zzso stress, 2) zzso of zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso responsive element zzso and zzso stress responsive element zzso and 3) its stable cell lines were resistant to zzso stress compared with the control zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso factor zzso may be a candidate for leading zzso to protect against zzso zzso
