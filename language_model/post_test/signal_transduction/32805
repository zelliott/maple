zzso receptors play a critical role in various aspects of zzso zzso zzso it is important to identify mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that insulin rapidly zzso zzso zzso activity in both native and zzso expression zzso Here we report that insulin causes a transient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso slices were exposed to 1 zzso insulin for 20 and 60 zzso and then zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso incubation of zzso slices for 20 zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso to 176 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of control zzso In contrast, 60 zzso of insulin incubation did not alter zzso zzso zzso levels zzso 85 zzso zzso of zzso zzso 93 zzso zzso of zzso Although the consequence of zzso zzso zzso is unknown, it is possible that this zzso is responsible for insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso This possibility is consistent with our earlier finding that insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso activity after 20 zzso but not after 60 zzso of insulin zzso
