During the development of zzso nervous system, distinct classes of motor zzso and zzso are generated at distinct zzso positions in the zzso neural zzso The differentiation of these zzso zzso is directed by the zzso protein Sonic zzso zzso zzso acts in a graded manner to establish different neural zzso cell zzso defined by the expression of zzso zzso zzso These factors are critical for the interpretation of graded zzso zzso and act initially both to refine zzso domain boundaries and to maintain their zzso zzso these factors direct the expression of genes that zzso zzso zzso identity to zzso zzso
