We have examined whether the development of embryonic muscle fiber type is regulated by competing influences between zzso and zzso signals, as previously shown for development of zzso cell identity in the neural zzso We found that zzso expression of zzso or zzso of protein zzso A in zzso zzso zzso slow muscle precursors throughout the zzso but muscle pioneer cells only in the middle of the zzso zzso expression in the zzso of zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso the formation of muscle pioneer cells, demonstrating that zzso signals can antagonize the induction of muscle pioneer cells by zzso We propose that a zzso signal first zzso the formation of slow muscle precursor cells, and subsequent zzso and zzso signals exert competing positive and negative influences on the development of muscle pioneer zzso
