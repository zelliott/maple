Unlike during development, blood vessels in the adult are generally thought not to require zzso for normal zzso However, zzso is a survival factor for many tumor vessels, and there are clues that some normal blood vessels may also depend on zzso In this study, we sought to identify which, if any, vascular beds in adult mice depend on zzso for zzso Mice were treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or soluble zzso for 1-3 zzso Blood vessels were assessed using zzso or scanning or transmission electron zzso In a study of 17 normal zzso after zzso zzso we found significant zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso adrenal cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso was dose dependent and varied from organ to organ, with a maximum of zzso in zzso but was less in normal zzso than in tumors in zzso mice or in Lewis lung zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed high levels of both zzso and zzso and had normal zzso zzso Surviving zzso in affected zzso had fewer zzso and less zzso zzso All mice appeared healthy, but distinct zzso changes, including more efficient blood zzso zzso accompanied some regimens of zzso zzso zzso most zzso in the zzso grew back within 2 zzso after zzso of treatment for 1 zzso Our findings of zzso dependency of normal zzso zzso and rapid regrowth after zzso demonstrate the plasticity of the adult zzso
