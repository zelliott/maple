The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed by immature precursor cells in a variety of developing zzso In tightly adherent cell lines with a flattened zzso zzso is organized on the cell surface in linear zzso that are highly zzso with zzso and zzso stress fibers in the zzso In contrast, zzso and intermediate filaments in the zzso exhibit completely different patterns of organization, suggesting that zzso may use zzso stress fibers as a means of zzso zzso zzso with this is the observation that zzso D zzso the organization of both stress fibers in the zzso and zzso on the cell zzso Very similar linear cell surface zzso are also seen with three other cell surface molecules thought to interact with the zzso zzso the alpha 5 beta 1 zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso of these four molecules are zzso it seems possible that zzso zzso in each case may occur via different zzso One indication of such differences can be seen in zzso cells which have lost their flattened zzso but still retain long zzso zzso as remnants of the zzso zzso zzso and alpha 5 beta 1 are associated with these zzso while zzso and zzso are not, suggesting that at least two zzso of cell surface molecules exist which can interact with different zzso of the zzso zzso
