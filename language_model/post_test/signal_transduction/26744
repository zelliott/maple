zzso response factor zzso plays vital roles in numerous cellular zzso however, the zzso function of zzso in skeletal tissue remains zzso In several organ systems, zzso regulates the expression of zzso growth zzso zzso which is crucial for normal development of zzso skeleton and bone zzso throughout zzso Here, we show that conditional deletion of zzso in zzso by zzso generated viable mice with normal body size and body zzso Compared with normal siblings, zzso zzso adult mice exhibited a marked decrease in bone mineral density and bone formation zzso zzso of zzso in primary mouse zzso zzso reduced cell differentiation and zzso in zzso This was accompanied by a decrease in IGF-1 expression and zzso zzso of IGF-1 in the culture media enhanced zzso differentiation in control cells and partially restored the zzso zzso of zzso cells, supporting an important role of zzso in regulating IGF-1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso cells and enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso decreased the zzso activity of zzso the key zzso factor for zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso in control cells and restored zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso is important for zzso zzso differentiation and zzso via regulating IGF-1 expression and zzso zzso
