zzso has previously been shown to exert zzso effects on human zzso by opening plasma membrane zzso channels and by stimulating protein zzso zzso Here we examined how these two activities are influenced by zzso substitution of the steroid zzso either in the zzso or in the zzso Both the zzso and the zzso derivatives of zzso were more effective than zzso in stimulating zzso zzso although zzso was a markedly weaker zzso inducing zzso than the other two zzso In zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was weaker than that of the zzso zzso and it was completely abolished by zzso whereas that of zzso and its zzso zzso was inhibited only partly by this zzso In contrast, when applied in zzso zzso the zzso zzso was the strongest of the three zzso tested, and the effects of all the three steroids were completely abolished by zzso These data show that the structural motifs of steroid molecules that are responsible for the stimulation of zzso zzso are different from those zzso the steroid action on zzso influx through plasma membrane zzso The synthesis of selective zzso of both activities may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents to be used in the treatment of zzso zzso
