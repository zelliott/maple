zzso and robust expansion of zzso T cells often require T cell zzso signals and T cell growth zzso However, the precise growth and zzso requirements for zzso and expansion of zzso and zzso T cells in zzso in zzso response are still not clearly zzso In the present study, we critically examined the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the common zzso zzso signals, a shared signaling component by receptors for all known T cell growth factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and expansion of zzso and zzso T cells in the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and the zzso signals are zzso involved in proliferation and zzso expansion of zzso and zzso T cells in response to zzso zzso zzso T cells are highly dependent on the zzso signals for survival, expansion, and functional zzso whereas in zzso expansion of zzso zzso T cells is largely zzso zzso T cell zzso via zzso and zzso however, is necessary and sufficient for zzso and expansion of zzso T cells in zzso In a skin transplant model, blocking both zzso and the zzso pathways induced prolonged skin zzso zzso Our study provides critical insights that the zzso and zzso compartments are most likely governed by distinct mechanisms in zzso and targeting both zzso and zzso signals may be highly effective in certain zzso conditions involving zzso of both zzso and zzso T zzso
