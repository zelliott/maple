zzso is highly zzso to zzso and mediates cellular cholesterol and zzso release by zzso when zzso in zzso However, expression of zzso was zzso by increased cellular cholesterol while zzso was zzso and the results were consistent by forced expression or zzso of zzso element zzso binding proteins zzso We analyzed the promoter of the zzso gene and identified the new zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso and 95 zzso zzso of the zzso untranslated region and the zzso start site at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso zzso At zzso upstream of this zzso is the zzso zzso promoter containing multiple binding sites of zzso factors for zzso and zzso of 9 zzso at 212 zzso zzso and 179 zzso zzso upstream of the new zzso The zzso zzso zzso release was not influenced by suppression of the zzso zzso with small interfering zzso in mouse zzso or by its increase in zzso mouse zzso In contrast, zzso activity was altered in parallel to the zzso expression in these zzso When zzso was zzso the messages increased for zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso message decreased in this zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is regulated by zzso in the opposite direction to zzso through zzso and that expression of zzso by this regulation is associated with zzso zzso
