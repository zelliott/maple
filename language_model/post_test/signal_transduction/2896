zzso is a useful model zzso in which the zzso of human diseases, including recent advances in identification of the zzso of heart development and disease in the fly, can be zzso To identify novel genes that cause zzso we performed a zzso screen in adult zzso Using optical zzso zzso to zzso cardiac function in awake adult zzso we identified zzso as having zzso Using a number of strategies including customized smaller zzso screening of zzso zzso and transgenic rescue, we identified zzso as the zzso gene for this zzso zzso is an zzso gene in zzso possessing zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso protein involved in one of the zzso degradation zzso To investigate the effects of altering zzso signaling in the adult fly, we measured heart function in flies expressing either zzso active zzso or transgenic zzso that block zzso zzso specifically in the zzso zzso increasing zzso signaling in the heart did not have an effect on adult heart function, decreasing zzso signaling in the fly heart caused the significant reduction in heart chamber zzso In zzso we show that deletion of zzso which has zzso to zzso zzso causes zzso in adult zzso zzso in zzso signaling during development lead to important changes in the size and function of the adult zzso
