The role of the upstream region in controlling the zzso efficiency of a gene is well zzso However, the question of predicting the extent of gene expressed given the upstream region has so far remained zzso Using an artificial neural network zzso to capture the internal representation associated with the zzso control zzso the present work predicts the rate of zzso synthesis based on the pattern contained in the upstream zzso Further, the model has been used to predict the zzso efficiency for all possible single base zzso associated with the zzso zzso The simulation results reveal that apart from the experimental observation that zzso and zzso zzso increases the efficiency of transcription, zzso in these regions by C or T also causes an increase in zzso zzso the simulation results verify that zzso in the zzso region, in general, decrease the zzso zzso However, the results also show that certain sequence zzso when zzso either cause a marginal increase in the level of zzso or have no effect on zzso zzso The simulation results can be used as a guide in designing zzso experiments since an a zzso estimate of the possible outcome of a zzso can be zzso
