Recent advances in cellular and molecular biology have resulted in the identification of two novel, zzso completely unexpected targets of zzso actions, discoveries that may have a major impact on the future use of this unique zzso in biology and zzso zzso zzso treatment has been demonstrated to markedly increase the levels of the major zzso zzso zzso in rat frontal cortex, zzso and zzso Similar zzso increases in zzso are also observed in cells of human zzso origin, and are observed in rat frontal zzso at zzso levels as low as approximately zzso zzso zzso is widely regarded as a major zzso zzso and genetic strategies that increase zzso levels have demonstrated not only robust protection of zzso against diverse zzso but have also demonstrated an increase the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been demonstrated to inhibit zzso zzso zzso 3 beta zzso zzso an zzso known to regulate the levels of zzso zzso and zzso (both of which may play a role in the zzso observed in Alzheimer's zzso zzso with the increases in zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to exert robust protective effects against diverse insults both in zzso and in zzso These findings suggest that zzso may exert some of its long term beneficial effects in the treatment of mood disorders via underappreciated zzso zzso To date, zzso remains the only medication demonstrated to markedly increase zzso levels in several brain zzso in the absence of other adequate treatments, the potential efficacy of zzso in the long term treatment of certain neurodegenerative disorders may be zzso
