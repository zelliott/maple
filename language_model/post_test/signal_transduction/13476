zzso zzso such as zzso mediate systemic inflammatory responses through multiple cellular signaling zzso zzso is also responsible for the synthesis of acute phase zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso can inhibit signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured cells, suggesting that this effect may limit the synthesis of acute phase zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in rat liver in zzso 

Controlled laboratory zzso

zzso zzso male Sprague zzso zzso 

Under zzso zzso was injected into the portal vein of rats 4 zzso after the zzso intravenous administration of zzso (1 zzso or zzso The effects of zzso on key zzso in early steps of the zzso signaling pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined in both saline and zzso zzso 

In zzso rats, there was significant zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These signaling changes were associated with decreased tissue abundance of zzso receptors and zzso In contrast to its effects on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was unaffected by zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso signaling responses in the liver may be an important zzso of the zzso consequences of zzso zzso
