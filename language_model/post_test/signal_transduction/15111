The brown zzso zzso zzso is frequently consumed in Korea, Japan and China, and has been used for more than a thousand years as a drug in traditional Chinese zzso In this study, we isolated a novel zzso from zzso zzso that stimulates the growth of the zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso We also identified the mechanism by which this zzso referred to as zzso stimulates cell zzso After 24 h of exposure to zzso cell proliferation increased in a zzso zzso To further explore the mechanism associated with zzso cell zzso we treated cells for various times with zzso We focused on the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and zzso during zzso cell zzso The results showed that zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso but inhibited zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso stimulates gastrointestinal cell growth by zzso the zzso signaling zzso
