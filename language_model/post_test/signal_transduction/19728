zzso is a zzso factor that has emerged as the cell's main defense mechanism against many harmful environmental zzso and zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso a zzso zzso protein for the zzso zzso zzso complex, which targets zzso for zzso and degradation by the zzso zzso system zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso of zzso due to zzso in zzso or zzso is prominent in many cancer types and contributes to zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso provides strong evidence that tight regulation of zzso zzso zzso is imperative to maintain cellular zzso There are seven known zzso proteins that form various zzso zzso They are regulated by zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss the regulation of each zzso using the zzso zzso complex as the primary zzso The zzso of zzso are involved in many signaling zzso zzso deregulation of zzso affects several cellular zzso including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cell zzso zzso and death, which may lead to many human diseases, including zzso This makes zzso a promising target for novel cancer drug zzso
