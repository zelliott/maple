zzso is a controlled zzso process zzso zzso zzso by proteins of the zzso zzso Some proteins previously shown to promote the zzso process were found to have zzso functions as zzso zzso the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, respond to brain zzso by becoming activated to contend with the brain zzso zzso zzso can also undergo zzso cell zzso Previous studies have addressed the role of core zzso proteins in the death process, but whether these proteins also play a role or not in the zzso process is not been zzso Here we explore the effect of the zzso protein Bid on the zzso features of zzso and zzso Our results showed that Bid regulates both the zzso activities and the inflammatory profiles of these zzso zzso of Bid attenuated the zzso activity of primary zzso and zzso zzso It also changed the expression profile of distinct zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso similar changes followed zzso of Bid in the zzso zzso cell zzso Cell death could not be detected in any of the systems zzso Our findings demonstrate that Bid can regulate the zzso profiles of activated zzso and zzso via a novel zzso zzso In view of the critical role of these cells in various zzso including acute and chronic brain zzso our findings suggest that zzso in Bid expression may contribute to these zzso also via a zzso zzso
