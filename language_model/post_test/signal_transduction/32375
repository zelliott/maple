We previously found that the enhanced activity to invade zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso was one of the major properties of a highly zzso zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso cell line zzso To clarify the mechanism of this enhancement, we examined the effect of zzso on 2 major biological factors involved in tumor cell zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso The enhanced zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced both zzso response to zzso collagen and zzso on zzso glass zzso of zzso cells in a zzso manner quite similar to that of zzso invasion of zzso On the other hand, zzso showed little enhancement of zzso production, which was assessed by zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso invasion of zzso by only up to zzso Thus, zzso treatment of zzso cells enhanced invasion of zzso in association with zzso of cell zzso but did not enhance zzso zzso
