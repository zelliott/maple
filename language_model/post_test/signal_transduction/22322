Although zzso zzso cells zzso are continually exposed to zzso zzso under healthy conditions they contribute to zzso zzso while keeping inflammatory responses in zzso In response to invading zzso however, zzso respond vigorously by producing inflammatory zzso To better understand the signals that regulate the inflammatory responses of zzso we investigated whether the danger signal zzso (which is released from injured zzso could alter responses to bacterial zzso 

We measured zzso production from zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso via distinct signaling zzso 

zzso zzso production was only partly blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and required zzso of zzso while zzso reduction of zzso was completely blocked by zzso and required zzso of zzso The effects of zzso on both zzso required zzso calcium but not zzso C, implicating zzso X zzso zzso To investigate how zzso alters zzso responses to bacterial products in zzso mice receiving zzso sodium zzso were given zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso of zzso to zzso caused greater weight loss and increased zzso zzso zzso as well as decreased zzso zzso gamma zzso and higher zzso zzso ratios, which indicate decreased zzso zzso 

Together, these data indicate that stress, in the form of zzso zzso zzso both the inflammatory response of zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso representing a possible strategy by which these cells differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso
