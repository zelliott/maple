Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment with zzso A and zzso members of the zzso family, zzso maturation of mouse bone zzso cultured mast cells zzso which was characterized by zzso and gene expression of mouse mast cell zzso zzso In order to gain a better understanding of zzso A- and zzso maturation in mast cells, we investigated the genes that were zzso in response to treatment with these two members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso analyses indicated that in zzso five genes were induced by treatment with 4 zzso zzso A for 2 zzso zzso protein zzso was one of the induced zzso and the Tap induction in response to zzso A treatment was confirmed by real-time zzso zzso Treatment with zzso at 200 zzso but not zzso at 4 zzso also increased Tap gene transcript in zzso zzso zzso Tap expression was detected in zzso but not in zzso zzso cells, zzso melanoma cells or zzso embryonic zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso and zzso type I receptors zzso reduced responsiveness of Tap expression to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso effectively reduced zzso expression of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso effects of zzso are different between zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that Tap expression enhances zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Thus, the present results suggest that Tap induction in response to zzso occurs predominantly in mast cells and serves as a positive regulator in zzso zzso
