The process of light adaptation in rod zzso enables these sensory cells of the zzso to remain responsive to zzso stimuli over a broad range of light zzso Recent studies have employed the technique of zzso zzso to determine properties of zzso and of light and dark adaptation, in rod zzso in the living zzso Building on these studies, we have developed a theoretical model aimed at explaining the rod electrical response to a step of light based on known zzso The central feature of the model is its description of the zzso zzso zzso response in terms of a zzso weighted sum of zzso responses determined under zzso and near fully zzso zzso The model yields a zzso function that describes the course of zzso and zzso represents the cumulative dynamics of underlying zzso processes involved in light adaptation of the zzso
