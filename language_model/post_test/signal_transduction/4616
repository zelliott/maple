zzso release of the zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso which limits the extension of zzso and mediates seizure zzso For this reason several zzso therapies for zzso are currently under zzso However, it is not known how zzso zzso zzso transmission in the context of seizure zzso This may be particularly relevant as strong zzso of zzso zzso during zzso activity can switch zzso zzso zzso signaling from zzso to zzso which is a process that plays a significant role in intractable zzso We used zzso zzso recordings to investigate the role of zzso zzso release in the zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso with previous reports, zzso responses during seizure activity zzso switched from zzso to zzso and zzso We found that zzso released during the seizure significantly attenuated the zzso zzso responses and also reduced the extent of the zzso phase of the zzso These effects were zzso by zzso zzso administration and could not be explained by a change in zzso zzso mechanisms that set the reversal potential for zzso or by a change in the zzso of zzso Rather, zzso zzso of zzso channels increased the cell's membrane zzso and thus had a zzso effect on zzso zzso As zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in seizure initiation and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling may represent an important mechanism by which zzso can limit seizure zzso
