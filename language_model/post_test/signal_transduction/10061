zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso whose zzso the zzso zzso zzso are liver tumor promoters in zzso zzso cloning was performed using zzso expressed zzso to identify proteins involved in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso a component of the large zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso Since zzso is a regulator of zzso and the cell cycle, the association between this protein and zzso was examined in zzso zzso interaction was confirmed using zzso and zzso zzso systems as well as in zzso pull-down zzso The association with zzso occurs within the zzso zzso of zzso Unlike zzso the two closely related zzso zzso and gamma do not interact with zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso activity of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of gene expression is associated with decreased binding to the zzso element zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso by serum deprivation or zzso zzso D did not dramatically affect zzso zzso activity when zzso was zzso by zzso However, when zzso levels of zzso are examined and zzso concentration is manipulated by expression by small interference zzso the ability of zzso zzso to induce zzso reporter activity and target gene zzso is zzso These studies show that zzso zzso zzso activity and adds further evidence that zzso proteins play roles in the control of zzso zzso
