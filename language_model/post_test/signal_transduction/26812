This work reports on the identification and molecular characterization of the zzso regulatory system zzso zzso which controls the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The response regulator zzso was shown to bind to the promoter region of zzso specifying a predicted zzso zzso system, as well as that of zzso which encodes a putative zzso regulatory zzso This interaction is assumed to cause zzso zzso under conditions of zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso genes are subject to positive zzso and, together with zzso and presumably zzso represent the complete zzso controlled by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the minimal zzso binding region combined with zzso analysis revealed the probable recognition sequence of zzso designated here as the zzso box, which together with zzso is zzso among many zzso zzso zzso The importance of the zzso zzso in the response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso conditions was confirmed by analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which exhibited decreased growth under zzso conditions compared to its parent strain zzso
