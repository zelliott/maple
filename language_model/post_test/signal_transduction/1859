Adult bone zzso is a rich zzso of zzso zzso stem and zzso zzso zzso evidence suggest that these cells have the potential of contributing to tissue zzso and cardiac zzso zzso stress results in the release of specific zzso and zzso that promote zzso of stem cells to the peripheral zzso zzso of these mobilized cells contributes to formation of functional zzso and sets up stage for tissue zzso zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso through interaction with its receptors zzso and zzso expressed on zzso and zzso stem cells promote recruitment of these cells into the sites of tissue injury accelerating vascular zzso Similarly, subset of zzso + zzso derived cells are mobilized and recruited to the zzso zzso zzso into cardiac and vascular cells, restoring cardiac zzso Identification of cellular zzso and tissue specific zzso that facilitate selective recruitment of zzso stem and zzso cells to specific zzso will open up new avenues to accelerate cardiovascular zzso and tissue zzso
