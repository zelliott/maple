zzso zzso in zzso have been used as model systems to study zzso zzso Here we describe zzso preparations in which it has been possible to investigate the zzso consequences of zzso zzso release in zzso In the first preparation, the release of zzso zzso from identified motor zzso zzso has been shown to be sensitive to the pattern of zzso High zzso and long burst zzso evoke zzso release that zzso muscle zzso in a manner similar to that produced by zzso zzso By contrast, the release of the same zzso zzso from motor zzso B1 show little dependence on zzso We conclude that there are no stimulation patterns that are zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso release from motor zzso zzso has also been zzso zzso depending on the stimulation pattern, uses either zzso which acts as a conventional zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso which act as zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso have the capability to greatly increase synaptic plasticity at zzso zzso
