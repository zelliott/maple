Four series zzso M, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were obtained based on consecutive induction with zzso zzso and ultraviolet zzso These zzso were then characterized according to their tolerance to zzso sensitivity to zzso stress, and zzso zzso All the induced zzso zzso showed a higher zzso than the parental zzso and the last generation was more resistant than the first generation in the M, zzso and W zzso In addition, the changes in the zzso resistance and zzso sensitivity were not found to be directly zzso and no distinct zzso characteristics were found among the resistant and sensitive zzso with the exception of the resistant isolate zzso Thus, to investigate the molecular basis of the zzso resistance, a group III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be comprised of a six zzso zzso repeat domain zzso zzso domain, and response regulator domain, similar to the zzso from zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of the zzso gene from the zzso and zzso zzso revealed that all the resistant zzso contained a zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso with the exception of isolate zzso where the zzso contained a deletion of 107 zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso in the zzso of each respective series involved the same zzso acid substitution at the same site, although the resistance levels differed significantly in each zzso zzso these findings suggested that a zzso in the zzso of zzso was not the sole factor responsible for zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso
