zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso are the most frequent skin zzso in zzso An intact immune system is critical for protection against SCC since organ transplant recipients zzso have a zzso to zzso higher risk for developing these zzso The role of the innate immune system in tumor zzso is zzso Our aim was to determine the expression of selected innate immune genes in zzso and SCC arising in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso skin from 28 SCC and 19 zzso were evaluated for zzso expression of zzso receptors zzso zzso downstream zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso 11 SCC occurring in zzso patients were included in the zzso We found that SCC but not zzso showed significantly elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was increased in SCC compared to normal zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression were significantly higher in SCC than in normal skin and higher than in zzso SCC from zzso showed only an increase in zzso but no increase in zzso or zzso We conclude that innate immune gene expression in SCC is distinct from normal skin and zzso zzso shows lesser induction of innate immune zzso SCC from zzso patients have depressed expression of zzso and zzso compared to SCC from zzso zzso
