The availability of the complete sequence of the zzso zzso and the assignment of putative reading zzso provides an opportunity to search for new members in families of proteins generating signaling zzso The six major pathways that dictate patterning were zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several new components were identified for the first four zzso including zzso zzso zzso components and zzso zzso Most notable is the identification of a vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso growth factor I zzso I) receptors without zzso protein zzso zzso and a family of proteins similar to zzso (a protein involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso A new zzso beta family zzso two new zzso and a zzso zzso were also zzso Finally, for the Toll pathway, two new potential zzso zzso and two new receptors were zzso
