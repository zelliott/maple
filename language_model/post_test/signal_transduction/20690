zzso mast cells, zzso with zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso group, were exposed to zzso and the pH and zzso calcium signals were recorded by using the fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced cell zzso was fully inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) similar to that required to inhibit zzso release zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso were required to inhibit zzso cell calcium zzso zzso approximately 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to inhibit the zzso induced pH zzso In zzso mast cells, zzso zzso inhibited zzso exchange activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso was unable to inhibit the zzso pH signal induced by zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso of zzso release by zzso is not due to an interference with the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonized the zzso zzso exchange zzso suggesting an action on the protein zzso C signaling zzso
