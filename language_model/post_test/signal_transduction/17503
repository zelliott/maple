Growth and differentiation of cells derived from the embryonic zzso are critically dependent on the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Human embryonic zzso zzso zzso cells have been widely used to examine the effect of zzso on zzso tissue growth and zzso as well as a zzso for environmental zzso This study examined responsiveness of zzso cells to agents known to stimulate zzso zzso characterized zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated to what extent zzso cells reveal zzso responses to zzso at the level of zzso protein zzso zzso cells exhibited a total cell cycle transit time of approximately 22 h and responded zzso when zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso increases in zzso levels of zzso The order of sensitivity to hormonal zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso transferred from zzso to zzso per zzso protein per minute under conditions where zzso zzso did not significantly affect protein zzso Regulatory zzso of zzso in zzso cells were characterized by the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso binding was zzso at approximately 50 zzso indicating the presence of binding sites that are finite in zzso zzso of zzso binding yielded an estimated zzso of 25 zzso indicating the presence of high affinity binding zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso were also zzso labeled with zzso subjected to sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso bands zzso by zzso zzso incorporation of zzso was detected into two proteins of molecular weight zzso 45,000 and zzso zzso zzso respectively, the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to proteins of zzso 45,000 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in response to zzso of zzso zzso via zzso of its breakdown with the zzso inhibitor zzso or by direct zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells thus revealed zzso responses to zzso at the level of zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso cells, derived from embryonic zzso tissue which is critically dependent on this zzso for normal development, may provide information fundamental to a clear understanding of cellular events involved in zzso zzso These results highlight several important differences between zzso cells and zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
