zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso causes an economically important bacterial speck disease on tomato and produces symptoms with zzso zzso surrounded by zzso The zzso is mainly attributed to a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso However, the molecular processes underlying zzso development and zzso zzso are poorly zzso zzso In this study, we took advantage of a zzso zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso leaves and zzso gene zzso zzso as a rapid reverse genetic screening tool and identified a role for zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in tomato resulted in reduction of zzso symptoms zzso death and zzso suggesting a molecular connection between zzso zzso and cell zzso In zzso zzso but not zzso was required for zzso responses, including root growth zzso and zzso zzso symptom zzso soaked zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter zzso zzso symptoms or sensitivity to zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso zzso and subsequent zzso disease development in tomato and zzso zzso is therefore a component of the zzso signal zzso zzso
