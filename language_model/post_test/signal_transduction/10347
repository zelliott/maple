Recent research on the origin of brain cancer has implicated a zzso of zzso brain cancer stem cells for zzso zzso zzso Various genes that regulate zzso in normal stem cells are also found in cancer stem zzso This implies that zzso can occur because of zzso in normal stem cells and early zzso zzso A zzso mathematical model based on the cell compartment method is presented here to pose and validate zzso scenarios proposed through the neural cancer stem cell zzso The zzso of abnormal zzso and early zzso cells from their normal counterparts are ascribed with separate zzso zzso Stem cell zzso are found to be more significant for the development of cancer than a similar zzso in the early zzso zzso The model also predicts that, as previously hypothesized, repeated insult to mature cells increases the formation of abnormal zzso and hence the risk of zzso
