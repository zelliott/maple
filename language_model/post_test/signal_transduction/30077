The role of the bone zzso protein zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso is zzso This study aimed to characterize aspects of the zzso zzso in PC by assessing zzso zzso and zzso expression in normal, zzso and zzso prostate zzso and to correlate findings with progression to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso specimens from 74 patients with clinically localized PC zzso follow-up 51 months, range zzso 44 benign zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 normal zzso zzso were assessed for zzso zzso and zzso expression using zzso 

Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso expression were significantly decreased in PC compared to benign prostate zzso Nuclear zzso was present in zzso prostate tissue but absent in PC and adjacent zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso expression correlated with increasing zzso zzso 

These data suggest that decreased zzso nuclear zzso and nuclear zzso expression are associated with the progression to PC, and in particular loss of zzso and zzso are related to progression to a more aggressive zzso
