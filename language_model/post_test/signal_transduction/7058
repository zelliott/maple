zzso of pancreatic zzso cells into cells resembling beta cells may provide a strategy for treating zzso Here we show that transient administration of zzso growth factor and zzso zzso factor to adult mice with chronic zzso efficiently stimulates the conversion of terminally differentiated zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso generated zzso cells are zzso zzso functional and zzso responsive, and they reinstate normal zzso control for up to 248 zzso The zzso process depends on zzso signaling and requires a threshold number of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previous work demonstrating in zzso conversion of zzso cells to zzso cells by viral delivery of zzso zzso factors, our approach achieves zzso zzso through transient zzso exposure rather than genetic zzso
