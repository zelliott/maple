Here, we show that a subset of breast zzso express high levels of the type 2 zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and provide evidence that these zzso are essential for growth in the absence of zzso zzso down zzso and zzso in a breast cancer cell line bearing an amplification of the gene zzso zzso zzso and deficient for zzso impaired growth on plastic and in zzso This growth zzso was accompanied by enhanced levels of zzso oxygen species zzso leading to zzso Mice with zzso deletion of both zzso and zzso were not viable, indicating a synthetic zzso for loss of these two zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso mice were viable and had a dramatic reduction in tumor formation compared to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso could be effective in preventing or treating zzso with zzso in zzso
