Cell division zzso 1 zzso enhances zzso signaling in zzso and vascular cells, and zzso expression of zzso is elevated in animal models of zzso In this study, we investigated the genetic deletion of zzso the gene zzso zzso in zzso and zzso knockout zzso The increased zzso expression of zzso zzso type I and II zzso and zzso zzso associated with diabetes in zzso mice was attenuated in diabetic zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso deletion significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso III and IV and attenuated zzso and zzso injury zzso despite the presence of persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso deletion reduced gene expression of zzso receptors in the zzso resulting in a functionally attenuated response to zzso zzso including reduced levels of zzso zzso and zzso in primary kidney cells from zzso knockout zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso deletion reduces but does not block zzso zzso zzso Because direct antagonism of zzso or its receptors has unwanted effects, zzso may be a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso and perhaps, other kidney diseases associated with zzso zzso
