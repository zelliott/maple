Cancer cells couple heightened zzso with zzso to produce fatty acid networks that support zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a principal role in this process by converting zzso including the zzso zzso zzso to free fatty zzso Here, we show that zzso is elevated in zzso versus zzso human prostate cancer cell lines, and that pharmacological or zzso disruption of this zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso These effects were partially reversed by treatment with fatty acids or a zzso zzso zzso zzso and fully reversed by zzso with both zzso We further show that zzso is part of a gene signature correlated with zzso transition and the zzso properties of cancer cells, supporting a role for this zzso in zzso metabolism that, for prostate cancer, involves the dual control of zzso and fatty acid zzso
