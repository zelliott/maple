Most studies on the origin of zzso lineage have been performed in the spinal zzso By contrast, molecular mechanisms that regulate the appearance of the zzso lineage in the brain have not yet attracted much zzso We provide evidence for three distinct sources of zzso in the mouse zzso In addition to two zzso zzso zzso the anterior zzso area and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso also gives rise to zzso We show that zzso in the zzso bulb are generated within the zzso zzso from zzso zzso characterized by the expression of zzso We provide evidence that these zzso zzso zzso do not depend on signal zzso zzso by zzso growth factor receptors zzso and therefore propose that they belong to a different lineage than the zzso zzso Moreover, induction of zzso in the zzso is dependent on sonic zzso zzso as in the spinal zzso In all these zzso zzso territories, zzso zzso were detected at about the same zzso stage as in the spinal zzso However, both in zzso and in zzso the differentiation into zzso zzso was postponed by 4-5 days in the zzso in comparison with the spinal zzso This delay between determination and differentiation appears to be intrinsic to zzso zzso as it was not shortened by zzso or zzso contact factors present in the spinal zzso
