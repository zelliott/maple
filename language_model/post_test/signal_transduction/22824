In zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been identified as dominant zzso zzso zzso At restrictive temperature, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso I investigate here the role of zzso activity in regulating cell fate decisions in the sense organ lineage at the early zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso occasionally resulted in external sense zzso with two zzso and no zzso This zzso zzso was strongly enhanced in conditions in which zzso signaling was zzso Furthermore, conditional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso and to zzso cell fate zzso which are both usually associated with increased zzso signaling zzso Finally, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the stabilization of an zzso expressed nuclear form of zzso in zzso wing zzso This study demonstrates that zzso affecting two distinct zzso zzso zzso affect two alternative cell fate decisions and enhance zzso signaling activity in the sense organ zzso These findings raise the possibility that the zzso targets an active form of the zzso zzso for degradation in zzso
