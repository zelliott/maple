The three-dimensional zzso structures of many zzso have been solved to reveal the functions of these zzso However, these zzso structures have rarely been applied to constructing efficient molecular devices that function in living zzso Here, we demonstrate a zzso zzso molecular design principle for constructing short hairpin zzso zzso genetic information zzso these zzso respond to specific proteins and trigger the desired gene expression by modulating the function of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso against the zzso designed to specifically bind to zzso zzso protein was correlated with the degree of zzso hindrance between zzso and the zzso complex in zzso The level of the hindrance was predicted based on the zzso Moreover, the regulation of gene expression was achieved by using the zzso zzso designed to bind to the target zzso or nuclear zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in human zzso The zzso molecular design approach is widely zzso for developing new devices in synthetic zzso
