We previously reported that treatment of human peripheral blood zzso or zzso cells zzso with calcium zzso zzso led to the rapid (18 zzso acquisition of many characteristics of mature DC, including zzso zzso We therefore investigated whether zzso zzso cells were similarly susceptible to rapid zzso zzso Although the zzso leukemia line zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso overnight expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as additional characteristics of mature zzso Several zzso that alone had restricted impact on zzso could enhance zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso In parallel studies, zzso cells cultured from normal donor bone zzso developed marked zzso zzso after overnight treatment with either zzso or zzso but only zzso simultaneously induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso This contrasted to peripheral blood zzso in which such zzso could be induced with either zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that normal and transformed zzso cells at many stages of zzso possess the capacity to rapidly acquire many properties of mature DC in response to zzso zzso This apparent ability to respond to calcium zzso even when putative zzso agents are zzso suggests strategies for implementing host zzso immune zzso
