zzso zzso zzso stimulation produces smooth muscle contraction, zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a potential therapeutic role for zzso zzso to reduce cardiac workload and zzso zzso zzso reports suggest that vascular zzso are zzso in heart failure zzso in a manner similar to zzso zzso We examined zzso signal zzso by repeat zzso zzso infusions in patients with zzso receiving chronic zzso zzso 

Twelve subjects with zzso not currently receiving zzso were zzso to maximum tolerable doses of zzso zzso underwent zzso stimulation testing at study zzso 2 weeks after each dose zzso and 6 months after maintenance of maximum zzso zzso zzso infusions began at zzso zzso zzso zzso with dose zzso every 10 minutes, to a maximum of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso dose response was evaluated by the zzso rate required to elicit a 20 zzso zzso increase in zzso blood pressure zzso designated zzso 

All doses of zzso significantly reduced zzso measures of heart rate, zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso However, zzso also produced a paradoxical trend toward zzso reduction zzso increased zzso zzso that reached significance at the completion of zzso dose zzso zzso ratio vs baseline zzso zzso P zzso zzso All effects were maintained over a zzso treatment period with no evidence of zzso 

zzso zzso response to zzso infusion suggests improvement in vascular zzso signal zzso with chronic zzso zzso This effect is evident despite no zzso tolerance to zzso zzso zzso The varying affinities of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso may have contributed to this zzso
