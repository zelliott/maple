zzso zzso the zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from the ubiquitous zzso A zzso is an zzso inhibitor of zzso release, a potent zzso in zzso and an zzso agent in zzso including zzso Recently, we discovered that zzso also functions as an important negative zzso of heart performance in zzso and zzso To gain an evolutionary perspective on zzso zzso in fish, we zzso the influence of bovine zzso zzso on the zzso heart, as well as the eventual zzso mechanisms of its zzso zzso zzso were carried out on zzso eels zzso zzso zzso using an zzso paced isolated working heart zzso Stroke volume and stroke work were used as measures of zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso (from 11 zzso zzso to 165 zzso zzso caused a zzso negative zzso which was abolished by zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso protein zzso or zzso oxide zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests a zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso unspecific zzso zzso thus excluding zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso positive zzso Under increased zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions, zzso induced a significant increase of the zzso response, which was blocked by zzso and zzso but independent from zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first report in fish that zzso zzso zzso performance under zzso as well as under increased zzso conditions and zzso the zzso positive zzso which zzso supports the evolutionary significance and establishes the zzso role of this zzso
