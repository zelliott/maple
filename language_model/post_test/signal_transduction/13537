A recently developed sensitive zzso based on the binding reaction of zzso to bovine adrenal preparations has been zzso for determining the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso roots and zzso The amount of zzso found in these zzso ranges from zzso to zzso zzso zzso fresh zzso zzso results were obtained with extracts of zzso from a same harvest, while they showed a 2-3 fold variation when different batches of zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso known to affect several zzso processes in higher plants, increases the level of zzso in zzso This observation suggests that zzso might be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso signal from its receptors at the zzso level to the cell zzso
