zzso dioxide zzso is increasingly being appreciated as an zzso signaling zzso that affects inflammatory and immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is encountered in a range of clinical conditions, including chronic zzso pulmonary disease, and as a consequence of therapeutic ventilation in acute respiratory distress zzso In patients suffering from this syndrome, therapeutic zzso strategy designed to reduce mechanical damage to the lungs is accompanied by systemic zzso and associated zzso which are associated with improved patient zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of zzso and the relative contribution of elevated zzso or associated zzso to this response remain poorly zzso Recently, a role for the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to be important in signaling the cellular zzso response to zzso In this study, we demonstrate that in cells exposed to elevated zzso the zzso family member zzso was zzso to a lower molecular weight form and zzso to the nucleus in both mouse embryonic zzso and human pulmonary zzso cells zzso Furthermore, elevated nuclear zzso was observed in zzso and correlated with zzso protection against zzso lung zzso zzso zzso processing was sensitive to zzso zzso by zzso but was independent of the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso both of which have been previously shown to mediate zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso family member that may contribute to the beneficial effects of zzso in inflammatory diseases of the zzso
