zzso is a disease characterized by abnormal deposition of serum A zzso zzso zzso along with other components in various zzso The disease is a complication of inflammatory conditions that cause persistent high levels of the acute phase zzso zzso in zzso In experimental animal models, the deposited zzso is resolved when the inflammation is stopped, suggesting that there is an efficient clearance mechanism for the zzso As zzso zzso zzso is one of the major components in the zzso its metabolism is expected to affect the pathology of AA zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso a HS degradation zzso in resolution of the AA zzso The transgenic mice deficient in zzso zzso produced a similar level of zzso in plasma as the zzso control zzso mice upon induction by injection of zzso zzso enhancing zzso and inflammatory zzso The induction resulted in formation of zzso zzso zzso post treatment in the zzso that displayed a comparable degree of zzso load in both zzso The zzso became significantly less in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso post treatment, and was completely resolved in the zzso zzso on day 21 post zzso while a substantial amount was still detected in the zzso zzso The rapid clearance of the zzso in the zzso mice can be ascribed to zzso zzso zzso zzso that are believed to contribute to degradation of the protein components in the AA zzso The results indicate that both zzso and zzso play important parts in the pathological process of AA zzso
