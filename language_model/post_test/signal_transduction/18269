The zzso gene encodes a number of zzso zzso that function as adapter molecules in zzso zzso in part by zzso with the zzso tails of zzso or other zzso zzso family zzso To identify downstream molecules in zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was screened with a full-length zzso zzso Nine independent zzso interacting clones zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso a 522 zzso acid zzso component of the nuclear pore central zzso that is known to bind zzso import factor zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was specific, since zzso failed to interact with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso analysis in zzso revealed that the zzso interaction is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso fifth zinc zzso finger and zzso zzso In human zzso T cells, zzso zzso or zzso specifically zzso the other zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional effects of zzso a zzso binding fragment, zzso zzso were studied on zzso or control zzso reporter activity in zzso T cells, either resting or after stimulation by zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in resting cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso but has no effect on control zzso reporter activity, either at baseline or after zzso zzso The finding that zzso binds zzso suggests that zzso may serve as an adapter zzso at the nuclear zzso in addition to its known adapter function at the plasma zzso
