zzso melanoma is a leading cause of death from skin diseases, and is often associated with zzso of zzso signaling zzso We have examined the zzso effect of zzso a plant zzso from zzso zzso on cell migration of zzso human melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso and assessed whether zzso signaling is the target of zzso Using an in zzso invasion zzso we found that treatment of human melanoma cell lines with zzso resulted in zzso zzso of cell migration, which was associated with zzso of zzso zzso while reducing the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reducing the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are the zzso targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on critical zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the binding of zzso zzso proteins zzso with zzso forms of zzso in melanoma zzso These events play important roles in degradation or zzso of zzso To verify whether zzso is a potent molecular target of zzso the effect of zzso was determined on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso Treatment of Mel zzso cells with zzso or zzso an inhibitor of zzso pathway, significantly inhibited cell migration of Mel zzso cells, which was associated with the elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, this effect of zzso and zzso was not found in Mel 1011 melanoma zzso These results indicate for the first time that zzso zzso melanoma cell migration by targeting zzso signaling zzso
