The zzso tissue distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that it functions as a novel regulatory zzso for zzso in zzso zzso We examined the role of the zzso in zzso zzso responses in human zzso cancer cells because zzso surface zzso expresses transcripts for the zzso and the majority of zzso zzso arise from these zzso Several human zzso and cervical cancer cell lines spontaneously express the zzso zzso cells did not have altered growth characteristics or altered short term responses to zzso compared with zzso zzso While a zzso exposure to zzso beta resulted in increased steady state zzso zzso levels in all cells, zzso cells were incapable of maintaining zzso expression of zzso zzso This did not result from decreased zzso activity of the zzso zzso but reflected differences in zzso stability and/or zzso To determine whether the zzso altered zzso stability, we used a zzso expression zzso to express the zzso in an zzso cell zzso The resulting cells displayed a profile of zzso zzso genes analogous to that found in cells spontaneously expressing zzso These data show for the first time an intrinsic zzso activity for the zzso The capacity to selectively alter zzso gene expression suggests that this version of the zzso is a unique zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso responses at a point downstream of the initial zzso zzso zzso
