The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which plays an important role in kidney and enteric nervous system zzso zzso zzso in zzso are responsible for the zzso inherited cancer zzso multiple zzso zzso types 2A and zzso and familial zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso disorder zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso we have studied cellular consequences and zzso events following zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells of zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso led to cell zzso growth zzso and loss of zzso zzso Basic zzso but not zzso evoked similar responses in those zzso Nevertheless, zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso led to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso and downstream events revealed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso led to sustained zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso treatment led to transient zzso zzso and failed to induce zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso but not transient zzso zzso may be involved in cell zzso
