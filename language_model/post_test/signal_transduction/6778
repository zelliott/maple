Mouse zzso cells zzso can rapidly extend their Class II zzso late zzso compartments into zzso structures, induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso T cells, which are considered beneficial for their zzso Here we describe that also in human zzso zzso triggering zzso zzso late zzso labeled by fluorescent zzso zzso triggering was insufficient for induced zzso of zzso zzso recycling compartments zzso in human zzso zzso We studied zzso zzso in human zzso in zzso of zzso with zzso T zzso zzso of zzso within human zzso requires zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs within 30 zzso of T cell contact and involves zzso of zzso and zzso by T zzso T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso recycling abolished zzso zzso which coincided with reduced zzso zzso T cell zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso involves both innate and T zzso zzso
