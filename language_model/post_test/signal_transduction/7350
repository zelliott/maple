As zzso organisms grow, zzso information is continually needed to regulate the pattern in which cells are zzso In the zzso zzso most cell types are organized in a zzso zzso zzso however, a zzso event generates zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso zzso between the stele and the surrounding zzso involving a mobile zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso and mobile zzso species also determines vascular pattern, but it is currently unclear how these signals zzso We use a zzso model to determine a minimal set of components necessary for maintaining a stable vascular zzso zzso zzso the signaling network show that, in addition to the mutually zzso interaction between zzso and zzso signaling through zzso zzso and zzso is required to maintain a stable zzso zzso We have verified this prediction by observing loss of zzso in zzso zzso The model reveals the importance of several features of the network, namely the mutual degradation of zzso and zzso and the existence of an additional negative regulator of zzso zzso These components form a plausible mechanism capable of patterning vascular zzso in the absence of zzso zzso provided by the transport of hormones from the zzso
