zzso zzso zzso cell death is complex, probably involving elements of necrosis and zzso The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood but have been suggested to involve zzso oxygen species such as zzso oxide and zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso to investigate the role of zzso and the potential downstream signaling molecules in cell death induced by zzso of the zzso zzso Application of zzso to a mixed zzso zzso culture resulted in an early increase in the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso which peaked at 4 zzso This was followed by a reduction in zzso metabolism of the dye zzso zzso zzso that continued to decrease throughout the zzso zzso A substantial increase in DNA fragmentation as measured by an zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso proteins zzso was observed at 7 and 20 zzso zzso and zzso blocked zzso changes in zzso release at 2, 4, and 20 zzso zzso metabolism at 4 and 20 zzso and DNA fragmentation at 20 h as measured by the zzso and by an increase in terminal zzso end zzso zzso also prevented zzso nuclear transport of zzso and increased expression of zzso relative to zzso zzso was also able to block zzso cell death as well as the increased zzso zzso Time course studies and experiments with zzso and zzso suggest that zzso production and zzso zzso may be involved in necrosis and zzso but the latter also requires an increased expression of zzso The ability of zzso to prevent zzso cell death relatively early in this cascade suggests its potential therapeutic utility in central nervous systems diseases such as stroke that are associated with increased zzso zzso production of zzso
