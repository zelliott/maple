The use of transgenic animals lacking one or multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso has provided significant information on the roles of zzso signaling in the central nervous zzso A recent study provides evidence that zzso type 1 zzso might be important in zzso zzso zzso However, the absolute zzso specificity revealed in this study contrasts earlier work examining other forms of zzso Nonetheless, these observations suggest that specific zzso zzso may represent novel targets for the treatment of central nervous system zzso It is anticipated that such findings will help catalyze new drug discovery efforts to identify zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso
