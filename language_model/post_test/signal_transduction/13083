Cell zzso is essential for a plethora of zzso interactions during zzso Surprisingly, only a few different classes of zzso molecules mediate many zzso zzso and these molecules are used zzso during zzso This raises the question of how generic signals can trigger zzso zzso Recent studies in zzso zzso indicate that zzso molecules cooperate with zzso genes to specify particular body parts and organ zzso zzso and zzso zzso are integrated at the level of zzso zzso where direct binding of both zzso proteins and signal zzso is required to activate zzso zzso elements of target zzso Such enhancers include zzso enhancers of the zzso genes themselves, which drive the refinement of expression patterns of zzso zzso
