Over 1 billion zzso are produced daily, with a small percentage zzso into zzso suggesting that excess zzso are deleted through a tightly regulated zzso Although the in zzso mechanism governing zzso zzso is unknown, deletion of zzso in culture is zzso by the zzso death zzso and is blocked by zzso To determine the in zzso significance of zzso in zzso development, mice lacking zzso zzso and mice deficient in zzso and zzso were zzso Compared with zzso control zzso zzso mice, zzso mice displayed increased numbers of circulating zzso The lack of zzso in zzso mice resulted in an enhanced percentage, but not total numbers, of zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in zzso bone zzso zzso potential only in zzso zzso Although zzso and B6 mice had similar numbers of tissue zzso the loss of zzso in zzso mice was sufficient to increase the number of zzso in a subset of zzso Additionally, after stimulation with zzso zzso and B6 mice showed equivalent numbers of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso displayed a marked increase in spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice showed enhanced systemic inflammatory arthritis associated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso elevated numbers of inflammatory zzso and increased numbers of tissue zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso may be required for maintaining circulating zzso and for suppressing zzso zzso and recruitment that are stimulus zzso
