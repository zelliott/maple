Experimental and clinical evidence has zzso a critical role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso heart zzso Prior studies have demonstrated that transgenic expression of the zzso 68 zzso zzso form of zzso zzso severe zzso zzso These mice also had unexpected and severe zzso structural abnormalities and zzso We hypothesized that an additional zzso zzso of zzso which affects zzso function is induced under conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Western blots of cardiac zzso from the full length zzso zzso zzso mice and a model of accelerated zzso revealed a smaller 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjected to transient zzso stress generated the 65 zzso zzso zzso The 65 zzso zzso zzso was also induced by hypoxic culture of zzso zzso database analysis of the zzso gene mapped zzso start sites and zzso transcripts induced by zzso or zzso zzso within the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of these transcripts yields a 65 zzso zzso truncated zzso beginning at zzso thereby deleting the signal sequence and zzso zzso Cellular trafficking studies demonstrated that the 65 zzso zzso zzso is not zzso and is present in zzso and zzso zzso while the full length 68 zzso zzso was found only in the zzso zzso zzso of the 65 zzso zzso zzso induced zzso stress signaling with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By zzso the 65 zzso zzso zzso an innate immunity zzso including viral stress response zzso innate immunity zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A novel zzso truncated zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso zzso This zzso zzso a primary innate immune response that may contribute to progressive cardiac dysfunction in the setting of zzso and zzso zzso
