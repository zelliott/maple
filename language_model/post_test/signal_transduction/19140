zzso zzso growth factor zzso inflammatory effects require acute zzso factor zzso synthesis by zzso cells zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso synthesis involves the zzso of zzso zzso complex, which is leading to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and group V zzso zzso zzso zzso As the mechanisms regulating zzso remain unknown, we addressed the role of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso which can be rapidly and zzso activated by zzso or zzso zzso In native bovine zzso zzso cells zzso we observed a zzso protein interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso These protein interactions were maintained in zzso zzso either with the empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso dead zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso expressing zzso dead zzso zzso zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso under zzso and zzso conditions as compared to native zzso Treatment with zzso for 15 zzso increased zzso zzso synthesis in native zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso synthesis was prevented in cells expressing zzso zzso These results demonstrate the essential role of the zzso domain of zzso for its zzso interaction with zzso which appears essential to support zzso zzso zzso
