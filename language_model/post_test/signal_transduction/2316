zzso is a novel zzso protein localized to the inner membrane of zzso coli through the single zzso domain zzso found at the zzso The overproduction of zzso activates expression of the zzso zzso controlling synthesis and export of the zzso zzso zzso acid via the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso We now show that both the zzso and the zzso are essential for the induction of zzso expression observed with the overproduction of zzso Furthermore, we describe the isolation and characterization of different point zzso in the zzso that completely or partially block the induction of zzso expression associated with overproduction of zzso These zzso were shown not to affect the zzso stability or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We propose that these zzso are affecting specific interactions between the zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso for example zzso the membrane sensor zzso partner of the zzso signal zzso zzso
