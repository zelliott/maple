This review focuses on recent developments in understanding the roles and regulation of the zzso in the function of zzso 

New studies have shed light on the regulation and dynamics of zzso and zzso in zzso relevant both to cell zzso generally and to immune function zzso The roles of zzso dynamics in processes such as cell zzso cell migration, and zzso are being zzso zzso progress has been made recently in understanding the mechanisms of zzso directional zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso need to be zzso zzso change shape, move, or zzso in response to their zzso zzso accomplish these processes by zzso their zzso the active musculoskeletal system of the cell that is not just the ultimate zzso of zzso responses but is also a dynamic framework for zzso organization and regional zzso Active areas of research include the direct and indirect zzso interactions between the zzso and the membrane and among zzso zzso The pervasive and zzso roles played by small zzso of the zzso family and zzso in zzso function are also becoming zzso
