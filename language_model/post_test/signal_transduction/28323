Merkel cells originate from the neural zzso They are located in zzso and zzso skin and have neuroendocrine zzso Together with A beta zzso Merkel cells form a slowly adapting zzso the Merkel nerve ending, which zzso steady skin zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in neural crest cell zzso We thus sought to determine whether zzso signaling is essential for Merkel cell development in the zzso pad of the zzso Our data indicate that at embryonic day zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are not expressed at zzso levels in Merkel zzso After a zzso switch, however, Merkel cells in whiskers of newborn mice are zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of all three markers persists into zzso By contrast, zzso fibers are intensely zzso in zzso zzso but no zzso zzso is zzso At birth, and at 6 weeks of age, zzso fibers are intensely zzso for both zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso numerous Merkel cells are present at zzso and they are zzso We draw three major conclusions from these zzso zzso zzso signaling through zzso or zzso is not required for the development and prenatal survival of either a major subset or of all Merkel cells, zzso the zzso survival of Merkel cells is supported by zzso or zzso zzso rather than by zzso zzso and zzso Merkel zzso zzso is not a zzso for zzso A beta zzso but is likely to be involved in maintaining Merkel cell zzso zzso
