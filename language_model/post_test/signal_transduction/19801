Although zzso tumor zzso 1 zzso contributes to the responsiveness of zzso to zzso the underlying mechanism remains zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of expression and function of zzso a zzso component of zzso zzso We discovered that zzso targets zzso and that zzso is a zzso gene in zzso zzso We found that zzso is required for zzso stimulation of zzso signaling and expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso as zzso depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of zzso target zzso In addition, zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso complex to the zzso consensus sites in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the recruitment of both zzso and zzso expression is effectively blocked by zzso inhibitor zzso Selective zzso of zzso by a dominant negative zzso of zzso or selective zzso also zzso the ability of zzso to stimulate the zzso target zzso These findings reveal an inherent zzso role of zzso upon the expression of zzso and suggest that zzso regulation of zzso may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which zzso stimulates zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso
