While the role of the zzso system zzso in regulating cellular processes continues to expand, the zzso of its role in cardiac disease is just zzso The UPS regulates pivotal processes at all levels of cardiac zzso from zzso zzso channels and receptors to downstream signaling zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the role of the UPS in maintaining cardiac protein quality control is emerging, as exemplified by its multiple interactions with the cardiac zzso and role in familial zzso The diversity of UPS regulation lies in zzso zzso which specifically recognize targets and direct the zzso zzso In the context of disease, zzso zzso expression affects the severity of disease in both zzso zzso injury and cardiac zzso in zzso by modulating signaling zzso In zzso injury, the activities of zzso and zzso (both with zzso zzso zzso profoundly affect zzso regulation and severity of zzso In cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso cardiac zzso by interacting with zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso interact with zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso which may prove to be mechanisms by which zzso is attenuated or protein quality zzso All of these exciting new findings, however, must be taken in the context of disease regulation of the UPS components zzso Key UPS components zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are themselves zzso regulated in cardiac zzso Our understanding of the precise nature by which the UPS regulates key biological functions in cardiac disease has just zzso
