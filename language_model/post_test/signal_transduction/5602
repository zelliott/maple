B zzso zzso is initiated by the binding of zzso to the zzso expressed B cell receptors zzso triggering signaling zzso that lead to the zzso of a variety of genes associated with B cell zzso zzso with the appropriate T cell help and the zzso of zzso centers zzso drives B cells to zzso and differentiate into zzso plasma cells and memory B cells that together constitute zzso zzso Here I describe efforts in my laboratory to gain an understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that zzso three processes central to B cell biology zzso the initiation of zzso zzso the interactions of the zzso with the innate immune system zzso zzso and the generation and maintenance of B cell zzso Such knowledge is likely to aid research efforts in two areas of high public health priority, zzso the development of new zzso to control B cell responses in zzso disease and the design of effective vaccines to control infectious zzso
