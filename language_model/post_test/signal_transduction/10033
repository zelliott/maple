zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier, has zzso binding zzso facing the zzso space and functions in the zzso zzso shuttle zzso Here we showed that zzso activity in brain zzso is zzso by zzso zzso with an zzso of 324 zzso By employing primary zzso cultures from control and zzso mice and zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso involves a substantial transfer of zzso to zzso in control but not zzso zzso in agreement with the lack of zzso activity associated with zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was greatly zzso by large zzso signals both in control and zzso zzso showing that these large signals activate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso On the other hand, small zzso signals zzso the increase in zzso zzso only in control but not in zzso zzso We concluded that zzso zzso activity is selectively activated by small zzso signals that fall below the zzso range of the zzso zzso and plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso
