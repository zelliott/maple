Tomato zzso zzso crops can be severely damaged due to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but are protected when zzso with crown zzso zzso zzso zzso Root zzso may be the determining factor for this zzso An experiment using pots linked by a tube and zzso dish experiments were undertaken to confirm that zzso zzso zzso root zzso decreased the number of zzso and alleviated zzso damage, and to determine crown zzso root zzso zzso zzso Following a gas zzso zzso zzso it was found that the zzso protection was derived from the potent zzso of a specific root zzso component of crown zzso namely zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso and infection by zzso zzso Moreover, it was shown that zzso acid acts as both a lethal trap and a repellent for zzso zzso by specifically regulating zzso expression in a zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso acid zzso attract zzso zzso and consequently cause death, while high zzso zzso repel zzso zzso This study zzso how zzso acid in crown zzso root zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression to alleviate zzso damage, and presents a general methodology for studying zzso systems affected by plant root zzso in the zzso This could lead to the development of economical and feasible strategies for controlling zzso zzso and provide an alternative to the use of pesticides in farming zzso
