zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is expressed by activated zzso cells at sites of zzso In addition to supporting rolling and stable arrest of zzso there is increasing evidence that zzso functions in zzso signaling into zzso cells during these adhesive zzso We have previously shown that zzso of zzso cells (which express zzso for zzso or zzso zzso of zzso results in formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of these downstream signaling events appear to require an intact zzso domain of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso is required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the association of zzso with zzso and the zzso domain of zzso is, in turn, critical for zzso zzso zzso An adapter protein complex consisting of zzso bridges between zzso and the zzso zzso These molecular events thus outline a mechanism by which zzso of zzso by engagement of zzso on adherent zzso can initiate a zzso signaling zzso in the activated zzso cell at sites of zzso
