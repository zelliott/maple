The zzso zzso protein zzso initiation factor zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso its activity is implicated in cell growth and zzso In experimental models, zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso The activity of zzso is regulated by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While investigating the participation of the zzso signaling zzso in primary central nervous system zzso zzso we noted the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in specimens from zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso cell lines showed that zzso zzso was zzso and was selectively inhibited by the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibitor led to reduced zzso D1 expression and caused zzso of cell proliferation and cell death in human brain zzso zzso cell line zzso Also, the growth of the subcutaneous zzso zzso in mice was inhibited by zzso administration of zzso inhibitor compared with mice treated with vehicle zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that in zzso cells zzso zzso plays an important role in proliferation and our results identify zzso of the zzso zzso as a potential therapeutic target in patients with zzso
