zzso 2 has been isolated independently by two laboratories as a protein interacting with protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso Gene analysis and zzso approaches have contributed to define a number of distinct modular zzso in zzso that govern zzso interactions such as two zzso three potential zzso zzso 3 zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and three zzso zzso and a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso More than 30 partner proteins of zzso have been discovered, including zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and regulator of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso channels and others proteins like the zzso zzso zzso The zzso relevance of some of these interactions remains to be zzso However, zzso structure suggests that the protein is a zzso protein scaffold that regulates both membrane and zzso zzso zzso plays important functions in the nervous system where it is implicated in spine zzso and density regulation, synaptic plasticity and zzso zzso zzso regulates also zzso zzso zzso and may provide a link between some of these receptors and zzso zzso zzso events dependent on zzso zzso and zzso G zzso zzso a role for zzso in cell growth was demonstrated and this effect was enhanced by its interaction with zzso Here we review the current knowledge of the protein partners of zzso and present the available data that are contributing to the appreciation of zzso zzso
