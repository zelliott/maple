zzso We have prepared zzso specific for the chicken zzso determination genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and have investigated the expression of these genes in response to zzso and acute electrical stimulation in zzso chick muscle, using zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso remains essentially zzso zzso transcript levels approximately zzso and zzso message is zzso by two- to zzso In contrast, the message coding for zzso barely zzso in zzso muscle, rises dramatically zzso zzso on the second day after nerve zzso in this respect it resembles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments reveal that the increase in zzso zzso slightly precedes the rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso muscle leads to an immediate decline in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso of less than an hour and approximately 4 zzso zzso message stability zzso suggest that this is zzso through a rapid shutdown of zzso Messages coding for zzso zzso and zzso zzso much more slowly, as a result of slower zzso zzso Previous experiments have indicated the involvement of a de zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schmidt, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso and Schmidt, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso and electrical stimulation experiments reported here are compatible with the notion that zzso is that zzso
