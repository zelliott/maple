zzso signaling plays key roles in several zzso and pathological zzso zzso of zzso expression have been extensively investigated in the zzso but the zzso receiving the signal remain largely zzso To define which cells respond to activated zzso during zzso development, we generated the zzso zzso driving expression of nuclear zzso reporter zzso transgenic mice, expressing the zzso gene under the control of zzso cell factor responsive zzso zzso gene activity is found in known organizing centers, such as the zzso border and the limb zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression identifies novel sites of zzso zzso like zzso zzso and areas of the adult brain, revealing an zzso dynamic pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso In zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mice, which lack a zzso zzso zzso zzso is absent in zzso zzso indicating that zzso mice are bona fide in zzso indicators of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in the zzso zzso coli (multiple zzso zzso background revealed zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso but surprisingly not in normal zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice unveil the entire complexity of zzso signaling in zzso and have broad application zzso for the identification of zzso cell populations in development and zzso
