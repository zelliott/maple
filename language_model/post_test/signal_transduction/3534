Bone development is a complex process, involving multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso The study of skeletal development has largely focused on zzso bones while zzso bones, such as the zzso zzso within the avian eye, have received less zzso Our previous research directly demonstrated the involvement of sonic zzso and suggested the involvement of zzso and 4 during the development of zzso zzso The bones of the sclerotic ring are induced by zzso zzso zzso at zzso 35 and zzso Here, we examine the spatial and zzso expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We show that the cells of zzso zzso express zzso zzso and zzso at these zzso zzso with zzso expression previously zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso are also expressed in the zzso underlying the zzso unlike zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are not expressed in these regions at any stages zzso Furthermore, using zzso soaked beads implanted adjacent to zzso we provide direct evidence that the zzso family of genes are important factors in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in this way causes a reduced expression of zzso in the surrounding tissue demonstrating that the zzso and zzso pathways zzso Our data also demonstrates that the sclerotic ring has an intrinsic ability to compensate for missing zzso The zzso zzso system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the zzso induction of zzso bones of the zzso zzso
