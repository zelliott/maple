zzso zzso fluorescent calcium indicator proteins zzso are promising tools to study calcium dynamics in many zzso molecular and cellular zzso Great zzso the measurement of population activity, in zzso therefore been placed on calcium indicators derived from the green fluorescent protein and their expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can rise within zzso making them suitable as reporters of fast zzso zzso We here report the production of stable transgenic mouse lines with two different functional calcium zzso inverse zzso and zzso under the control of the zzso zzso Using a variety of in zzso and in zzso zzso we find that stimuli known to increase zzso calcium concentration zzso triggered action zzso zzso and synaptic and sensory zzso can cause substantial and rapid changes in zzso zzso of inverse zzso and zzso
