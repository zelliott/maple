zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in steroid metabolism in which zzso and zzso zzso are produced from their zzso However, little is known about the zzso regulation of the zzso gene in zzso Since zzso are thought to be a primary target of zzso gamma zzso in inflammatory and immune responses, we assessed the effects of this zzso upon zzso gene expression in the human zzso cell line zzso and in normal human zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso of zzso for zzso induced an approximately zzso increase in zzso activity and in its zzso levels compared to zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced an approximately zzso increase in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso This induction was completely inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso and by the nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso mediates induction of zzso gene expression by zzso through zzso of zzso The zzso agent zzso inhibited zzso induction of zzso gene zzso suggesting involvement of a zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in skin as a novel target of drugs for therapy of psoriasis in the skin is zzso
