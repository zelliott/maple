In the accompanying paper, we found, using molecular dynamics calculations, four zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that differ markedly in zzso when zzso is zzso with either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Three of these zzso contain three zzso undefined zzso that we modeled in these calculations, and one is a newly identified zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso We have now zzso peptides corresponding to these four zzso and find that all of them block Val zzso zzso zzso All of them also block zzso zzso zzso but two of these zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso block zzso zzso to a significantly greater zzso These results suggest that zzso contains zzso including the three loop zzso that are important for zzso signaling and that several of these zzso can activate different pathways specific to zzso or zzso zzso
