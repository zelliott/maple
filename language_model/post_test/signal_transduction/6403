The zzso zzso assists protein folding through zzso cooperative movements that alternately create folding chambers in its two zzso The substitution zzso at the interface between these two rings causes zzso defective protein folding in zzso zzso To understand the molecular zzso we have examined the zzso zzso by zzso The normal zzso alignment of contacts between zzso of opposing zzso rings is changed in zzso to an zzso zzso This is associated with loss of zzso in zzso binding and zzso zzso with the loss of negative zzso between rings, the zzso zzso binds simultaneously to both zzso zzso These zzso structures were unstable at higher temperature, zzso into complexes of single zzso rings associated with zzso zzso the zzso signal from the opposite ring, these complexes cannot release their zzso and become zzso dead-end zzso
