zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso regulate diverse cellular responses, including cell growth and zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and form a complex with the common zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso protein 4 zzso complex with zzso but not with others zzso and zzso to the nucleus in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso possesses strong intrinsic zzso zzso activity, which is dependent on zzso in zzso cells and requires zzso A point zzso in zzso abolished binding to zzso and impaired its activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhanced expression of zzso regulated zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is able to block zzso growth zzso In a zzso approach with zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso severe but distinct zzso defects were observed in zzso zzso Thus, we propose that zzso is a crucial zzso of zzso zzso
