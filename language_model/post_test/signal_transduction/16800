zzso is an zzso zzso family composite zzso with multiple functions such as regulation of zzso zzso and regulatory T cell zzso B cell zzso and zzso class zzso The zzso complex is formed by the association of the zzso zzso with the soluble zzso zzso zzso gene 3 zzso The zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been shown to have zzso biological zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso can form an alternative composite zzso with the zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell activity and zzso T cell zzso production in zzso In this study we used zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso T cells from zzso mice to demonstrate that zzso activates zzso cells, indicating that zzso and zzso signal through different zzso The observation that zzso unlike zzso sustains zzso zzso cell proliferation prompted us to investigate the effects of zzso on mouse B zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production and plasma cell zzso zzso therefore has the potential to contribute to B and plasma cell function, zzso and proliferation in normal and pathological conditions such as zzso disease and multiple zzso
