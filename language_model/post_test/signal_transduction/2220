Our previous study showed that the zzso of very late zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or interactions with zzso zzso zzso proteins through zzso failed to induce zzso zzso via the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso for over 1 year after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso although normal zzso and zzso expression was observed after 3 months following zzso zzso analysis revealed altered zzso zzso of cellular proteins by the zzso zzso of zzso molecules in T cells from patients after zzso In T cells from early zzso patients zzso zzso various sizes of highly zzso zzso proteins were observed as high background even without the stimulation through zzso zzso The high zzso zzso pattern gradually disappeared and it was finally returned to normal zzso zzso patterns by 2 years after zzso Interestingly, poor expression of focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso signaling zzso was observed within 1 year after zzso These results suggest that these molecular defects appear to be implicated in the impaired zzso signaling in T cells from patients after zzso and it could explain, in part, the persistent zzso state after zzso at least 1 zzso
