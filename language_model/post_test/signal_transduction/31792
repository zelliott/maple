zzso S is a vitamin zzso plasma protein that functions in the feedback regulation of zzso zzso Our goal was to determine how protein S regulates the intrinsic zzso of blood zzso 

We used zzso including zzso zzso and in zzso methods to determine how the intrinsic zzso of blood zzso is regulated by protein zzso We obtained the following zzso zzso activated partial zzso time zzso with protein zzso plasma confirmed that protein S zzso zzso time; zzso a modified activated partial zzso time zzso with factor IX zzso plasma confirmed that protein S affects zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso generation zzso with either zzso plasma or zzso zzso initiated with a limiting amount of tissue factor, was regulated by protein zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso protein S inhibited zzso in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso protein S altered only the zzso for factor X zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso and both zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso 

From our findings, it can be concluded that protein S zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso in an activated protein zzso zzso
