zzso regulates various cell functions, including cell zzso and zzso However, the functional role of zzso on the signaling zzso in zzso cells zzso is zzso In the present study, we attempted to explore the mode of zzso action for zzso gene expression in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso linked to the zzso reporter gene zzso zzso was zzso by the wild type of zzso and the zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso but not the biologically inactive zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor inhibited the action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso The deletion analysis revealed that the zzso serum response element zzso and the zzso response element zzso mainly account for zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which contains an intact binding site for the serum response factor but lacks the zzso complex factor binding site, was activated by zzso zzso The action of zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression was not inhibited by zzso of protein zzso C, protein zzso C zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that activated zzso stimulates zzso gene expression through the zzso zzso and zzso and that the signaling zzso from activated zzso to the zzso zzso is independent of these zzso pathways in zzso
