We review current advances in experimental as well as zzso modeling and simulation approaches to structural systems biology, whose overall aim is to build quantitative models of signaling networks while retaining the crucial elements of molecular zzso We briefly discuss the current and emerging experimental and zzso methods, particularly focusing on hybrid and zzso methods, and highlight several applications in cell signaling with quantitative and zzso zzso The scope of such models range from zzso zzso interactions to describing clinical zzso
