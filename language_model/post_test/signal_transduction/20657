Surgery induced inflammation is a potent promoter of zzso recurrence and zzso in zzso zzso The recently discovered family of zzso zzso represent a major source of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and are now heavily implicated in zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso can be zzso activated by inflammatory zzso and growth factors which are present in abundance in the zzso zzso As colon cancer cells express zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso we zzso that zzso may zzso the ability of colon cancer cells to zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In support of this hypothesis, this paper demonstrates that zzso zzso a zzso transient increase of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer zzso This increase in zzso zzso activity is completely zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso and zzso protein expression occurs following zzso zzso zzso of zzso also zzso the increase of zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso location of zzso zzso generation lies mainly in the zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso via zzso generated zzso and this signal is inhibited by zzso This zzso activated zzso mechanism zzso a significant increase in zzso colon cancer cell zzso to collagen I, which is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso axis plays a crucial role in zzso of colon cancer cell zzso thus increasing the zzso potential of colon cancer zzso zzso may represent a valuable target in which to prevent colon cancer zzso
