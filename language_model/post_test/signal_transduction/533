Recent advances in stem cell biology have demonstrated that terminally differentiated adult cells can be induced to zzso into zzso cells zzso stem zzso upon proper zzso This has been achieved by the induced expression of key regulatory genes by zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, synthetic zzso zzso can also induce zzso and may represent a potentially safer approach as compared with genetic zzso Along this line, a synthetic zzso called zzso has been shown to induce the zzso of zzso into zzso zzso zzso which can be successively induced to differentiate into skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and bone zzso The mechanism zzso zzso is able to achieve zzso has yet to be zzso In this context, we defined the protein changes induced by zzso treatment in zzso zzso by zzso difference gel zzso coupled with zzso zzso involved in zzso and cell shape zzso zzso export, degradation, zzso stress control and zzso production were found to be remarkably changed after zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso predicted that these protein pattern changes enabled to propose that about 40 proteins might be associated to several biological functional networks, including cellular zzso cell signaling and cell zzso zzso our data confirm the intrinsic complexity of the zzso process induced by zzso and suggest more selected approaches to investigate the action mechanism of this small zzso
