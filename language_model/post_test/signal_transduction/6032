Numerous zzso bacterial pathogens regulate zzso factor expression by using a cell density mechanism termed zzso sensing zzso An in zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that it encodes at least two zzso and four zzso zzso Using mass zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso produces the signaling molecules zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine if zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso we generated zzso in each putative zzso zzso and tested the zzso of the zzso strains in zzso zzso mouse and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso as indicated by the survival of mice who were zzso with zzso zzso (10 50% lethal doses zzso For the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in the most pronounced decrease in zzso with zzso of the challenged animals surviving a dose of 10 zzso Using a Syrian zzso zzso model of infection, we determined the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and each zzso zzso An increase in the relative zzso was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso carries multiple zzso zzso that either directly or indirectly regulate the zzso of an essential zzso zzso that contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
