zzso stem zzso cells have a unique regulatory circuitry, largely controlled by the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso which generates a gene expression program necessary for zzso and zzso How external signals connect to this regulatory zzso to influence zzso cell fate is not zzso We report here that a terminal component of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters throughout the zzso in association with the zzso regulators zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is an integral component of the core regulatory zzso of zzso cells, which includes an zzso loop involving the zzso zzso Both zzso depletion and zzso zzso zzso cause increased expression of zzso zzso and other zzso factors and produce zzso cells that are zzso to zzso Our results suggest that the zzso pathway, through zzso brings zzso signals directly to the core regulatory zzso of zzso cells to influence the balance between zzso and zzso
