The zzso antipsychotic drug zzso is effective in zzso zzso The zzso signaling pathways that mediate zzso action remain zzso A potential candidate is the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade that links zzso zzso and zzso growth factor signaling systems, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity and zzso processes impaired in zzso Here, we examined how zzso zzso modulated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso prefrontal cortical zzso compared to the typical antipsychotic drug zzso While zzso and zzso acutely decreased cortical zzso zzso only zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso with continued drug zzso This delayed zzso increase however, did not occur via the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling zzso Rather, zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso given zzso reduction of zzso and zzso stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso mouse treatment studies supported the in zzso findings with initial zzso subsequent zzso and zzso of the cortical zzso response over 24 zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso This is the first report that zzso action on prefrontal cortical zzso involves the zzso signaling zzso Since zzso zzso signaling has not been previously linked to antipsychotic drug action, our findings may zzso the zzso system as a molecular zzso in zzso zzso
