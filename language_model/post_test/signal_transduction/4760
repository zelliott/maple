Recently, we discovered that the loss of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso factor family and a key player in the processes of cell proliferation and tumor development and also found in elevated levels in zzso zzso the zzso level of zzso was not affected, suggesting that zzso is regulated at zzso zzso Here, we present data that suggest that the dynamic zzso network, linked to zzso is involved in the regulation of the zzso protein and zzso zzso In a signaling zzso the loss of zzso activates the zzso regulator zzso and consequently leads to the induction of zzso expression that zzso zzso in zzso The link between zzso and zzso seems to be indirect via the zzso We conclude that the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression in a zzso process, offering several possibilities for therapeutic zzso
