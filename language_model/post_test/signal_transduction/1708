zzso traffic of proteins through the zzso zzso has an intrinsic toxicity that results in zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso It has been previously shown that in zzso zzso zzso cells high zzso of zzso activated zzso which is responsible for the enhanced synthesis of the inflammatory zzso zzso This study investigates whether zzso oxygen species zzso served as second zzso in protein zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells zzso were incubated (5 to 60 zzso with human zzso and zzso (1 to 30 zzso Both proteins induced a rapid or significant increase in hydrogen zzso zzso production at 5 zzso and zzso at 60 zzso This effect was zzso The contribution of zzso in regulating zzso zzso was evaluated by using the antioxidants zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both agents, by preventing zzso generation, induced human zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of a zzso zzso pattern similar to that obtained after protein zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso activity significantly prevented zzso production and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso generation in zzso cells occurs downstream of zzso zzso Either antioxidants or zzso inhibitor almost completely abolished the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene induced by excess zzso as evaluated by real-time zzso thus supporting a role for zzso and zzso as critical signals for the expression of zzso inflammatory zzso To identify the zzso sources responsible for the increased zzso production, the effect of zzso an inhibitor of the membrane zzso zzso was zzso as was the effect of zzso which blocks complex I of the zzso respiratory zzso It was found that both agents significantly reduced the exaggerated zzso induced by protein zzso These data indicate that exposure to excess proteins in zzso zzso cells zzso the formation of zzso which are responsible for zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso inflammatory zzso
