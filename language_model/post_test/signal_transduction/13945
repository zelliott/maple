The regulation of gene expression in zzso pathways contributes to the induction and maintenance of pain zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso mechanism controlling zzso structure and gene zzso zzso zzso motif zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in zzso and inflammatory pain and is known to be regulated by zzso zzso in some zzso The authors sought to investigate the role of zzso zzso on spinal zzso signaling after zzso 

Groups of 5-8 mice underwent hind paw zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid were used to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso measures of zzso and mechanical zzso as well as zzso zzso were zzso Both message zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis were used to study the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the selective zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso to reveal the function of spinal zzso receptors after hind paw zzso 

zzso zzso acid significantly exacerbated mechanical zzso after zzso zzso zzso acid reduced zzso zzso and also attenuated zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso zzso at zzso 9 was increased in spinal zzso zzso after zzso and enhanced association of zzso zzso zzso at zzso 9 with the promoter regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed as zzso zzso zzso reversed mechanical hypersensitivity after hind paw zzso 

zzso modification is an important zzso mechanism regulating zzso zzso zzso The spinal zzso signaling zzso is one zzso regulated zzso controlling early and zzso zzso after zzso
