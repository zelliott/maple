As tumors continue to grow and exceed their blood supply, nutrients become limited leading to deficiencies in zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and oxygen zzso These zzso result in significant changes in gene zzso While tumors have been shown to overcome the stress associated with zzso or zzso by stimulating vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso the role of zzso in tumor zzso remains to be zzso We found that in human tumors, the expression of the general control zzso 2 zzso an zzso zzso zzso is elevated at both protein and zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso expression is universally induced by zzso treatment in all five cell lines tested (five of zzso This is in contrast to two other zzso zzso zzso zzso of five) and zzso growth factor 2 zzso of five) that have a more restricted zzso zzso zzso expression significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso a downstream zzso factor of the zzso signaling pathway, is also associated with strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the key player in zzso unfolded protein response is not involved in this zzso In zzso zzso tumor studies in zzso zzso combined zzso mice confirmed that zzso of zzso in tumor cells zzso tumor growth and decreases tumor blood vessel zzso Our results reveal that the zzso zzso promotes tumor growth and zzso through zzso zzso expression and, thus, is a potential target in cancer zzso
