zzso zzso are not easily integrated into current zzso concepts, since their zzso messages can be distributed via zzso zzso signaling or volume zzso Moreover, the polarity of zzso zzso in terms of zzso and zzso sites can be hard to predict and is very little zzso We describe in detail the zzso and the zzso distribution of fluorescent zzso markers in zzso zzso zzso a well defined set of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso can be divided into five zzso distinct zzso In contrast to other subsets, serial zzso zzso in the zzso zzso show a mixed zzso of zzso and output markers along zzso zzso that defy a zzso as zzso or zzso zzso zzso these zzso contain both zzso and zzso sites preferably at zzso A significant portion of the synaptic events are due to zzso zzso zzso are mostly zzso or zzso released, and zzso zzso and synaptic zzso pools are typically well zzso The responsiveness of the zzso to zzso hormone may be at least partly dependent on a zzso synaptic zzso and is independent of zzso Our results reveal a remarkable variety and complexity of local synaptic zzso within a chemically defined set of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling as well as zzso zzso signaling and volume transmission from zzso can be main signaling modes of zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso The possibility of zzso variable signaling modes should be taken into account in zzso studies that aim to dissect the zzso underlying insect behavior and zzso in which zzso zzso act as important zzso
