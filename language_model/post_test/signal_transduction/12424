In response to zzso and zzso zzso plants induce a complex array of pathways and protein zzso zzso which generally lead to a response aimed at zzso the particular zzso In many cases, zzso has been implicated as the zzso zzso but, although progress has been made in assembling the downstream components of these zzso zzso far less is known about the mechanism by which the signal is zzso In this issue of the zzso Journal, zzso et zzso provide evidence for a plausible mechanism by which plants perceive zzso Evidence is presented for chemical zzso of zzso zzso by zzso at critical zzso positions within the zzso motifs that define the zzso sites of a number of zzso thus zzso binding of protein zzso This process is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Using synthetic peptides for a number of zzso which are zzso by families of protein zzso including the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso families, coupled with in zzso studies of zzso plant nitrate zzso the authors demonstrate that this mechanism regulates the ability of zzso to bind the target zzso directly linking zzso signals to changes in protein zzso These results may have widespread implications for the perception of zzso zzso in plants and zzso
