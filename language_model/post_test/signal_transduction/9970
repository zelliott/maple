The zzso of the zzso requires vascular zzso growth factor zzso during development, but most adult blood vessels lose zzso zzso However, some zzso in the respiratory tract and selected other zzso of adult mice zzso after zzso zzso The present study sought to identify the sequence of events and the fate of zzso cells, zzso and vascular basement membrane during zzso zzso in mouse zzso after zzso signaling was blocked with a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or soluble zzso construct zzso zzso or soluble zzso zzso Within 1 day, zzso was lost and zzso accumulated in some zzso zzso zzso zzso cells marked by activated zzso were present in zzso without blood zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a zzso decrease in zzso zzso over 7 days and zzso over 21 zzso During this period, zzso zzso moved away from zzso zzso onto surviving zzso zzso sleeves of basement zzso left behind by zzso zzso cells, persisted for about 2 zzso and served as a scaffold for vascular regrowth after treatment zzso The amount of regrowth was limited by the number of surviving basement membrane zzso These findings demonstrate that, after zzso of zzso zzso some normal zzso zzso in a systematic sequence of events initiated by a zzso of blood flow and followed by zzso of zzso cells, migration of zzso away from zzso vessels, and formation of empty basement membrane sleeves that can facilitate zzso zzso
