Aging research has advanced greatly in the zzso zzso zzso over the past 20 years, and we are now beginning to piece together distinct pathways that impinge on the aging zzso The knowledge base that has been obtained through genetic analysis strongly suggests that zzso zzso has a key role in most, if not all, of the pathways that alter the aging process of zzso organisms such as the zzso In this review, we provide an overview of two well-studied aging pathways in zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso is clearly zzso We also incorporate recent data to create a model of how zzso zzso in these pathways might zzso
