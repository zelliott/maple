We examined the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso cells in zzso zzso is zzso specific, zzso and rapidly zzso Two binding sites are recognized with zzso zzso and binding site zzso at equilibrium of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso binding sites per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso competitively inhibit zzso binding in the following rank order of zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso zzso also zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso at 5 zzso followed by a zzso increase in zzso zzso generation, and inhibited by zzso excess concentration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells is associated with an increase in zzso pH and zzso stimulation of zzso incorporation and zzso Thus rat zzso cells possess specific binding sites for zzso the zzso of which stimulates zzso formation and zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso These studies provide insight into the cellular basis for zzso cell zzso which are of potential zzso relevance during acute zzso inflammatory zzso
