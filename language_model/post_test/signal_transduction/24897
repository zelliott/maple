zzso gene expression in barley zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves has been correlated with temporally changing levels of zzso and zzso zzso by means of gas zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso stress led to a low and transient rise of zzso acid zzso its precursor zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, followed by a large increase in their zzso zzso and zzso peaked between 12 and 16 zzso about 4 h before zzso and zzso However, zzso accumulated up to a zzso higher level than the other zzso zzso and 9, zzso were identified as minor zzso zzso analyses revealed that a transient threshold of zzso or zzso is necessary and sufficient to initiate zzso gene zzso Although zzso and zzso applied zzso were zzso to zzso in considerable zzso both of them can induce gene zzso as evidenced by those genes that did not respond to zzso formed zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso genes independently from zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso showed that zzso synthesis of zzso is not induced by zzso zzso The data are discussed in terms of distinct signaling zzso
