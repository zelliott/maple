zzso inflammatory responses in the immature gut may play a role in the zzso of many zzso inflammatory syndromes that present in newborns or children, such as zzso zzso zzso idiopathic inflammatory zzso diseases zzso or infectious zzso zzso with previous reports that zzso zzso function matures over the first 3 weeks of life, we show that inflammatory signaling in the zzso mouse gut increases during zzso zzso with peak responses occurring at 2-3 zzso zzso bacteria can block inflammatory responses in cultured zzso by inducing the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso which inhibit zzso zzso through zzso zzso of the key regulatory zzso zzso We now report for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso generation in zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso from immature mice zzso fed zzso exhibited increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso reflecting local zzso generation and its zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies indicate that zzso can reduce inflammatory signaling in immature zzso by inducing local zzso generation and may be a mechanism by which zzso bacteria can prevent NEC in premature infants or reduce the severity of zzso in zzso
