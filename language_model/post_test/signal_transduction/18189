zzso zzso involves the zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso leading to increasing zzso zzso zzso dysfunction and heart zzso To better understand the possible role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso responses using cell culture zzso Cell size in zzso cultured on zzso dishes was three times larger than that grown on zzso zzso However, the number of cells on zzso dishes was not changed throughout the zzso zzso synthesis was significantly increased by zzso as were synthesis of zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso of beta 1 zzso and zzso formation of focal zzso and zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso in zzso These zzso effects were inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso a competitive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cell number or zzso zzso zzso for beta 1 and beta 3 zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso that reflects more closely the zzso environment in zzso zzso may also suppress the zzso zzso response in the zzso These findings demonstrate that the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso is involved in the zzso responses of zzso in zzso and suggest that zzso zzso proteins such as zzso are not merely passive adhesive molecules but are active participants in processes leading to zzso zzso
