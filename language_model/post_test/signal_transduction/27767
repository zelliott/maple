Although the precise mechanisms by which steroids mediate their therapeutic effects remain unknown, steroids have been reported to abrogate zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso In some cell types, zzso B zzso is necessary to regulate zzso cellular zzso However, compelling evidence suggests that the steroid zzso of zzso B is complex and cell zzso Using zzso we show that stimulation with zzso or zzso beta zzso zzso B zzso activity in human airway smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso beta also increased zzso activity in airway smooth muscle cells zzso with a reporter zzso containing zzso B zzso zzso zzso activated zzso B by rapidly degrading its zzso inhibitor I zzso B zzso which was then zzso after 60 zzso zzso I zzso B alpha reappearance was completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso I zzso B alpha zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso early expression of zzso Although zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at 4 zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso expression at zzso zzso In addition, neither zzso degradation or zzso of I zzso B alpha nor zzso B zzso activity were affected by zzso In cells zzso with the zzso reporter, zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression of zzso was completely zzso by zzso at 6 zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso zzso B zzso and zzso expression involve zzso of a zzso zzso
