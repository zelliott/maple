We have previously shown that addition of zzso zzso zzso maturation of zzso cells zzso in primary zzso In this work, we examined the effect of zzso on two zzso immortalized cell zzso zzso and zzso These cells zzso at 34 degrees C and differentiate into mature zzso at 39 degrees zzso In zzso addition of zzso to both cell lines at the differentiation temperature for 7 days showed increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso basic protein zzso and a drop in the percentage of zzso zzso The effect on zzso expression was particularly interesting in the less mature zzso zzso These cells do not express either zzso zzso or zzso so zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso expression in this cell zzso In addition, even though zzso zzso for all four zzso were zzso only the 17 and zzso zzso appeared to be zzso zzso differentiation has been shown to be zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso cells, following a pulse of zzso there was a zzso increase in zzso levels accompanied by elevated levels of zzso In the more mature zzso cells, there were no changes in zzso zzso We conclude that addition of zzso to immature zzso lines can enhance their expression of differentiated zzso such as zzso The action of zzso on zzso gene expression in the least mature line is likely to be zzso by the zzso zzso In the zzso cells, it appears that different signals and/or mechanisms are involved in modulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso can influence zzso gene expression and differentiation through multiple mechanisms depending on the maturation of the zzso
