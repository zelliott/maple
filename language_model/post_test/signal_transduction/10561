zzso acid zzso is known to cause zzso signaling which propels zzso arrest and zzso differentiation of zzso human zzso leukemia zzso The present studies show that zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso which became a prominent zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso is a known zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso To characterize functional effects of zzso expression in zzso differentiation and zzso arrest, zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso subsequent functional zzso or the rate of zzso zzso zzso To determine the effects of zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso cells already zzso the colony stimulating zzso zzso zzso zzso from a previous stable zzso zzso now enhanced zzso zzso zzso compared to parental zzso zzso It also enhanced zzso zzso evidenced by enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso RB tumor zzso protein zzso was also zzso as was zzso zzso cell cycle zzso A triple Y to F zzso zzso known to be a dominant negative in zzso zzso signaling failed to enhance zzso zzso zzso but enhanced zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso arrest essentially as well as zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso in the presence of zzso a zzso zzso had the effect of enhancing zzso cell zzso This is the first indication to our knowledge that zzso zzso the expression of an adapter zzso to facilitate induced differentiation via zzso between zzso and zzso
