Tea zzso are known to inhibit a wide variety of zzso activities associated with cell proliferation and tumor zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso are remained to be zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of the major tea zzso zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso zzso cell line, zzso Using a zzso incorporation zzso zzso could significantly inhibit the DNA synthesis of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the protein zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso and exhibited an zzso value of zzso zzso But zzso scarcely inhibited the protein zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso could reduce the zzso level of zzso by zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso revealed that zzso inhibited the zzso increase in zzso level in zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso blocked zzso binding to its zzso The results of further studies suggested that the zzso of proliferation and suppression of the zzso signaling by zzso might mainly mediate zzso blocking of zzso binding to its zzso and subsequently through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
