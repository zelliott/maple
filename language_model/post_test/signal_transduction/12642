The zzso factor zzso zzso 4 zzso discovered nearly 10 years ago, plays a central role in a variety of functions in plants, including sugar zzso However, not until very recently has its mechanism of action begun to be zzso zzso gene expression is one of the primary mechanisms of sugar regulation in zzso Nevertheless, the zzso factors involved in regulating sugar responses and their zzso during the signal zzso cascade remain poorly zzso In this paper we analyzed the participation of zzso as it is one of the main zzso factors implicated in zzso signaling during early zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso is an essential zzso of its own expression during development, in zzso signaling and in sugar zzso It is also important for the zzso expression of the genes zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds directly to the promoter region of all three genes and activates their expression in zzso through at zzso zzso Previous studies found that zzso also functions as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso therefore this zzso factor is a versatile protein with dual functions for modulating gene zzso
