zzso fatty liver disease zzso is a common liver disease whose prevalence has increased zzso We reported previously that fatty acid synthesis was enhanced in zzso with the zzso of fatty zzso To clarify the disorder, we evaluated the expression of genes regulating fatty acid synthesis by real-time zzso using samples from zzso zzso and normal liver zzso zzso A major regulator of fatty acids synthesis is zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso Its expression was significantly higher in zzso nearly zzso greater than the zzso zzso is positively regulated by insulin signaling zzso including insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso expression was enhanced and correlated positively with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression decreased by 50% and was not correlated with zzso zzso box protein zzso zzso is a positive regulator of fatty acid zzso and is itself zzso regulated by zzso zzso expression increased in zzso and showed a negative correlation with zzso but not with zzso zzso It is known that zzso is zzso regulated by zzso protein zzso zzso but expression levels of zzso in zzso were almost equal to those of the zzso These data indicate that, in zzso insulin signaling via zzso causes the zzso of zzso leading to the increased synthesis of fatty acids by the zzso negative feedback regulation via zzso does not occur and the zzso of zzso following a decrease of zzso zzso fatty acid zzso
