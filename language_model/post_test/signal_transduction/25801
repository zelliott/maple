The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have more than 400 described protein interaction partners and are implicated in numerous zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso and zzso double knockout zzso in mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso result in mixed effects on zzso gene zzso with many zzso target genes requiring zzso for full zzso while others are unaffected or expressed better in their zzso Here we used zzso and zzso zzso zzso to examine gene expression in response to four other zzso DNA damage (via zzso zzso zzso serum, and zzso zzso We found that while zzso zzso gene expression tends to be zzso dependent on zzso zzso and zzso genes displayed zzso requirements for zzso with the zzso expression of zzso zzso being particularly dependent on zzso Surprisingly, the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso did not require zzso for their zzso As with zzso zzso targets, we propose that the zzso recruitment of zzso and zzso does not necessarily indicate a requirement for these zzso at a zzso Rather, target gene context zzso DNA zzso influences the extent to which zzso requires zzso versus other zzso which may not be zzso
