The roles of the zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways and the zzso zzso in zzso and their importance in the regulation of cell cycle progression and zzso are discussed in this zzso These pathways have evolved regulatory zzso which serve to limit their zzso and zzso zzso Small molecular weight cell zzso drugs that target these pathways have been developed for leukemia zzso One such example is zzso zzso which targets the zzso zzso as well as a few structurally related zzso This drug has proven to be effective in the treatment of zzso zzso However, zzso cells have evolved mechanisms to become resistant to this zzso A means to combat drug resistance is to target other prominent signaling components involved in the zzso or to inhibit zzso by other zzso Treatment of zzso leukemia cells with drugs that target Ras zzso zzso zzso or with the protein zzso zzso has proven to be a means to inhibit the growth of resistant zzso This review will tie together three important signal zzso pathways involved in the regulation of zzso cell growth and indicate how their expression is zzso by the zzso zzso
