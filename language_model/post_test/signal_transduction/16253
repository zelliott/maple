zzso receptors zzso have been identified as primary innate immune receptors for the recognition of zzso molecular patterns by immune cells, initiating a primary response toward invading pathogens and recruitment of the zzso immune zzso zzso especially zzso zzso 4 zzso can also be zzso by zzso molecules and are expressed in the cardiovascular system, thus acting as a possible key link between cardiovascular diseases and the immune zzso zzso is involved in the acute zzso dysfunction caused by septic shock and zzso zzso We used zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso mice, and zzso that underwent zzso bone zzso transplantation to zzso between zzso expression in the heart zzso and the zzso system zzso Following zzso zzso challenge zzso shock zzso or coronary artery zzso zzso zzso zzso model, we found zzso mice challenged with zzso or zzso displayed reduced cardiac function, increased zzso levels of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso The cardiac function of zzso or zzso mice was less affected by zzso and demonstrated reduced suppression by zzso compared with zzso These results suggest that zzso expressed in the zzso plays a key role in this acute zzso
