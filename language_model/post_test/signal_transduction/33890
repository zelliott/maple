zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso has been investigated, with the main focus on the balance between zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso Recent reports disclose the presence of a novel zzso cell zzso zzso designated zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso Our main aim in this study was to zzso the role of zzso in cell invasion of zzso zzso and its contribution to signal zzso The function of zzso in cell invasion was investigated by comparing data obtained from full-length zzso clone zzso and gene zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed using real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were measured by zzso and reverse zzso zzso Cell invasion was examined with a 3-D invasion zzso The signal cascade was investigated by zzso zzso zzso As expected, expression of zzso was elevated upon zzso zzso and diminished using zzso We observed zzso of zzso and -9 expression and zzso 3-D cell invasion in cells zzso zzso However, zzso expression was not affected by zzso Analysis with zzso zzso revealed that zzso additionally zzso growth zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso 2 at the zzso zzso Our findings collectively suggest that zzso regulates the cell zzso pathway, playing a critical zzso role in the zzso zzso cell zzso
