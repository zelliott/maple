zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates cell migration, zzso and zzso zzso protein is reduced at the edge of zzso gut zzso sheets in zzso but it has not been characterized in zzso gut zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso was lower in zzso cells immediately adjacent to human gastric and zzso zzso in zzso but dramatically increased in zzso near the ulcers, possibly reflecting stimulation by growth factors absent in zzso zzso growth factor zzso but not zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, or vascular zzso growth factor, increased zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was also higher near the ulcers, varying in parallel with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduction of zzso and zzso prevented zzso stimulation of both zzso zzso and translation (as measured via a zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were directly related to total zzso protein zzso Although gut zzso zzso is associated with direct zzso of zzso protein adjacent to zzso wounds, zzso may increase zzso protein near but not bordering zzso zzso via zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that regulation of zzso expression may be as important as zzso zzso in critically influencing gut zzso cell migration after zzso zzso
