The zzso family of zzso factors and regulators has so far only been described in zzso and zzso where they mediate responses to many zzso zzso No counterparts of genes coding for such proteins have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso and no zzso activity was found in zzso zzso We describe here the presence of an zzso zzso zzso in the lower zzso zzso zzso Using zzso raised against components of the zzso zzso pathway, we demonstrate in zzso cells extracts the presence of proteins zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso experiments in nuclear extracts of developing zzso cells, we demonstrate the presence of proteins binding to zzso consensus zzso and to a zzso zzso zzso lying in the promoter of zzso a zzso regulated zzso gene zzso the zzso protein zzso Using zzso we show specific nuclear zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factors as zzso growing cells develop to the zzso zzso Taken together, our results strongly indicate the presence of a complete zzso signal zzso system in zzso zzso that could be involved in the zzso zzso
