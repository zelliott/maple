We present a zzso approach based on a local search strategy that discovers sets of proteins that zzso interact with each zzso Such sets are referred to as protein communities and are likely to represent functional zzso zzso interaction between module members is zzso via an zzso framework based on a network zzso model known as the random graph with given expected zzso Based on this zzso the concept of local protein community is generalized to that of community of zzso zzso communities and zzso structures are extracted from two zzso protein interaction data sets and a network of published interactions between human zzso The high level structures obtained with the human network zzso to broad biological concepts such as signal zzso regulation of gene zzso and zzso zzso Many of the obtained human communities are zzso in a statistically significant way, for proteins having no clear zzso in lower zzso This indicates that the extracted zzso are quite coherent in terms of zzso
