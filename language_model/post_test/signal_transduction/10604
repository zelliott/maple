zzso of zzso element zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso 1 contributes to melanoma progression and zzso at least in part by promoting tumor cell survival and stimulating zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso However, little is known about the regulation of zzso and zzso activities and their zzso within the tumor zzso We analyzed the effect of zzso factor zzso a potent zzso zzso of zzso for its ability to activate zzso and zzso in eight cultured human melanoma cell lines, and we found that zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all eight zzso In zzso melanoma cell lines, zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso via a zzso signal zzso mechanism that required zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso activity and was antagonized by a zzso protein zzso A and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso transcription, as observed in a zzso reporter zzso without increasing the zzso DNA binding capacity of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso increase in the expression of an zzso zzso membrane type 1 zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso it was prevented by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso A and was zzso upon zzso of zzso and zzso activities by forced zzso of a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso inhibited the development of zzso lung zzso in nude zzso This result indicated that zzso acts as a promoter of melanoma zzso in zzso We proposed that zzso melanoma cells zzso zzso are better equipped than zzso cells to respond to zzso within the tumor zzso
