The zzso zzso regulates a broad spectrum of cell fate decisions and differentiation processes during fetal and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso plays an important role in controlling zzso However, the role of zzso a zzso factor in the zzso pathway, in the development of tumors is largely zzso In this study, we focused on the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso zzso genes were zzso and activated in human zzso cell lines and patient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by a zzso inhibitor zzso decreased the in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso inhibited the zzso growth of zzso cells and the growth of zzso in zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso promoted the zzso growth of zzso zzso Further, we revealed that zzso regulated the cell cycle in zzso zzso tumors and decreased zzso Our findings suggest that zzso regulates the zzso growth, and that the zzso of zzso may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with zzso
