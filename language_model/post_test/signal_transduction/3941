During zzso brain development, immature zzso migrate zzso from the zzso to defined locations, giving rise to characteristic cell zzso Here we show that targeted disruption of the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso zzso layering in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso The gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed and zzso in the developing nervous zzso It is likely to be an zzso zzso zzso to others through its zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is very similar to that of the zzso zzso The product of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that has been proposed to act as an zzso signpost for zzso zzso Because zzso is expressed in zzso cortical zzso and zzso expression is normal in zzso zzso zzso may be part of a zzso or parallel zzso that controls the final positioning of zzso
