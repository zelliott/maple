Mechanical loading significantly influences the physiology and pathology of zzso cartilage, although the mechanisms of mechanical signal zzso are not fully zzso zzso zzso potential zzso 4 zzso is a zzso zzso channel that is highly expressed by zzso zzso and can be gated by zzso and mechanical zzso The goal of this study was to determine the role of zzso in the structure of the mouse knee joint and to determine whether zzso mice exhibit altered zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso mice were examined zzso and by zzso zzso zzso for zzso changes and bone structure at ages 4, 6, 9, and 12 zzso Fluorescence imaging was used to zzso zzso zzso signaling within intact zzso cartilage in response to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in severe zzso changes, including cartilage zzso zzso and loss of zzso that were dependent on age and male zzso zzso bone volume and zzso zzso volume were greatly increased, again in male zzso zzso from zzso mice demonstrated significant zzso responses to zzso stress but not to zzso zzso The response to zzso stress or to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was eliminated in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso leads to a lack of zzso induced zzso signaling in zzso zzso accompanied by progressive, zzso increases in bone density and zzso joint zzso These findings suggest a critical role for zzso zzso signaling in the maintenance of joint health and normal skeletal zzso
