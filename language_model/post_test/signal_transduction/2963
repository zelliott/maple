zzso and zzso zzso 

To investigate the zzso changes and expression of bone zzso protein zzso signaling component in zzso zzso zzso zzso and to clarify the effect of mechanical stress on zzso 

zzso changes of the zzso are a major factor in degenerative zzso canal zzso zzso but their mechanism remains zzso zzso are growth factors that regulate many cellular processes including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, a few studies have investigated the expressions of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso 

A total of 133 zzso specimens from patients with zzso and 17 control zzso specimens from patients with zzso disc zzso were analyzed zzso using zzso and zzso zzso van zzso and zzso blue zzso To analyze the influence of mechanical stress, the zzso specimens were divided into 2 groups: zzso with and zzso without zzso zzso The zzso thickness was measured by magnetic resonance image, and the correlations between the thickness and the zzso data were zzso zzso analyses were carried out to confirm the expressions and zzso of zzso signaling zzso 

The cell number and cartilage zzso area were significantly increased in the zzso zzso and those changes were more obvious in zzso with zzso than in zzso without zzso The zzso and percentage of cartilage zzso area had positive linear correlations with the zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso were both expressed by many cells of the zzso zzso and some of these cells were positive for zzso zzso and zzso The percentage of zzso cells for each zzso zzso type was significantly higher in zzso with zzso than in zzso without zzso 

Higher zzso and increased cartilage zzso area are important changes in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling and mechanical stress may play a role in the zzso zzso
