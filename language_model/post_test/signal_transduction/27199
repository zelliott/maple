zzso and zzso are two highly related zzso genes which are expressed during mouse development in the inner zzso Here, we present the detailed expression of both genes within the developing ear and a comparison to the expression of other potential control genes in this zzso Both genes are active between zzso and birth in zzso zzso of the semicircular canals, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are also expressed in the zzso where the expression is restricted to the zzso zzso The zzso duct is devoid of any zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells of the zzso part of the zzso labyrinth where it zzso with the zzso expression zzso zzso shows a complementary pattern to zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is expressed throughout the zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso is limited to the zzso part whereas zzso genes are active zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso play different roles in the patterning of inner ear zzso
