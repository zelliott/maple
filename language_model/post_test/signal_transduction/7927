zzso delivery and expression of plasmids zzso is a major concern in gene therapy and DNA vaccination using zzso zzso Besides the use of zzso the zzso zzso itself can be designed to maximize survival in zzso zzso zzso tracts in zzso sequences have been previously shown to be especially important in zzso zzso 

The effect of modifications in the zzso A sequence of a model zzso zzso zzso on zzso resistance and zzso expression was zzso Four zzso A sequences were zzso bovine growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso was assessed through in zzso zzso with zzso zzso The impact in zzso expression was studied by zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso and cell culture studies indicate that plasmids containing the zzso and the synthetic zzso A sequences present significant improvements in zzso resistance (up to zzso increase in zzso However, zzso analysis demonstrated that significant reduction in zzso zzso levels were responsible for a decrease in zzso expression and detected zzso level of zzso and zzso cells when using the more resistant zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso cells demonstrated that both zzso A efficiency and zzso resistance interfere significantly in zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that the choice of the zzso A is important, not only for zzso zzso but also for zzso resistance, and should thus be taken into consideration in the design and evaluation of zzso zzso
