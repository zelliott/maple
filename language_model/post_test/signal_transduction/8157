This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the zzso zzso biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The published literature was zzso with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso within minutes of zzso zzso and facilitate the rapid disposal of zzso zzso Both peptides share common actions on zzso zzso acting through structurally distinct yet related zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso insulin zzso induction of zzso zzso and enhanced resistance to zzso zzso also promotes energy storage via direct actions on zzso zzso and enhances bone formation via stimulation of zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso exerts zzso actions via slowing of gastric zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also promotes zzso and sustained zzso zzso is associated with weight loss in both zzso and clinical zzso The rapid degradation of both zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has led to the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of type 2 zzso These agents decrease zzso zzso zzso safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 zzso zzso and zzso integrate zzso signals to control food zzso energy zzso and zzso Recently approved therapeutic agents based on zzso of zzso action provide new zzso based approaches for the treatment of type 2 zzso
