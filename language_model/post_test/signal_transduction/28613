Although little is known as yet about the processes that coordinate zzso zzso zzso proteins are probably major players in this type of global zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are an important family of zzso regulatory factors involved in internal and external cell zzso This family zzso in zzso zzso and zzso and they are probably involved in the control of cell proliferation and zzso 

zzso zzso and David zzso zzso Res zzso 27: zzso recently showed that zzso zzso zzso tissue growth zzso is a zzso factor for zzso zzso zzso On exposure to transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso cells produce distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso assign to zzso module 3 the capacity to mediate binding to zzso zzso protein zzso which was previously reported to interact with zzso and to be involved in various types of zzso They also establish that zzso binding to zzso is zzso dependent and that module 4 of zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The differential binding of zzso zzso to zzso highlights the importance of functional interactions between individual zzso and reinforces the concept that different module combinations might zzso zzso or zzso zzso WHERE zzso It is essential to understand how the distinct zzso of the various zzso zzso affects their biological activities and zzso and to explore the mechanisms and the regulatory processes involved in the production of truncated zzso zzso A better understanding of the structural basis for their zzso is a prerequisite to wider use of zzso proteins in molecular zzso
