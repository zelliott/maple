To investigate how cell type proportions are regulated during zzso development, we have attempted to find out which cell type produces zzso a zzso signal zzso inducing the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso from a zzso zzso precursor by zzso and zzso with the final step zzso by the zzso zzso All our evidence points to the zzso cells as the major source of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity are greatly enriched in zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso activity is also somewhat zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso and this induction is inhibited by zzso This regulatory zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, using the zzso zzso show that zzso zzso cells produce zzso at more than 20 times the rate of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso has little effect on its own synthesis in short-term zzso experiments, in long-term experiments, using zzso as label, it is strongly zzso zzso about 5 zzso presumably because it zzso expression of zzso this is again consistent with zzso production by zzso zzso zzso takes about 1 hour to become zzso We propose that zzso cells zzso the differentiation of zzso cells by making zzso and that this is one of the regulatory zzso that sets the proportion of zzso cells in the zzso
