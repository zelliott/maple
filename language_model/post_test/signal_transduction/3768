The zzso human zzso zzso cell line expresses receptors for zzso colony stimulating factor zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso We have found that this cell line produces zzso in amounts up to 113 zzso in culture zzso zzso of zzso zzso by addition of zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso proliferation of the cells, suggesting a zzso zzso growth zzso To examine whether zzso produced zzso activates zzso zzso signal zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso of cell zzso of zzso cells before and after deprivation of zzso zzso We found zzso zzso of a number of proteins in zzso that could not be zzso increased by the addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso cells demonstrated a marked increase in zzso of proteins of identical molecular mass following addition of zzso and zzso but not zzso consistent with the zzso expression of the cells and the known use of the same signaling pathways by the three zzso This suggests that zzso cells use zzso produced zzso to activate signal zzso zzso interfering with zzso by zzso zzso until the zzso stimulation is zzso We then assessed the zzso of the zzso common to the zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known to be involved in the common signaling pathways of the three zzso We found that zzso of beta c and zzso in response to zzso and zzso could be markedly enhanced by zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso cells, and no further zzso of zzso in response to zzso was zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is activated in this cell line by a mechanism other than zzso These studies represent the first demonstration of zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathways by zzso zzso zzso Because the addition of zzso to cell cultures improved responsiveness of zzso signal zzso molecules to zzso zzso and zzso it can be zzso that zzso produced zzso exerts its effects by zzso and binding to surface zzso zzso although an zzso component to signaling cannot be zzso These observations provide further information regarding an zzso contribution to zzso cell growth, and establish a new model for study of these zzso
