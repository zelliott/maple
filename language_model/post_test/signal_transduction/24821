The zzso acute regulatory protein zzso regulates acute zzso in the adrenal zzso and zzso by promoting the zzso of cholesterol to the zzso inner membrane where the first step in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso occur in proteins involved in zzso transport and zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso The zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso domain of human zzso reported here reveals an zzso fold built around a zzso incomplete zzso The interior of the protein encompasses a 26 zzso 12 zzso 11 A zzso tunnel that is large enough to bind a single cholesterol zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind 1 mole of zzso cholesterol per mole of protein in zzso Based on the zzso domain structure and cholesterol binding zzso it is proposed that zzso acts by shuttling cholesterol molecules one at a time through the zzso space of the zzso
