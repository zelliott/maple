zzso zzso influx via zzso receptors zzso is essential for the development and plasticity of zzso but also triggers zzso cell death when critical zzso levels are zzso zzso finely zzso mechanisms are necessary to ensure that zzso function is maintained within a zzso zzso Here we describe a pronounced difference in the zzso of zzso currents in two closely related zzso cell types, the zzso and the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso that increase zzso zzso levels strongly depressed zzso currents in zzso with only minor effects in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso currents in zzso PCs but depressed them in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso type zzso of zzso could be converted into zzso behavior, and vice versa, by increasing zzso zzso in zzso cells or decreasing zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso Our data suggest that a differential zzso sensitivity of the regulatory zzso targeting zzso plays a key role in determining the direction and magnitude of zzso responses in various types of zzso These findings may have important implications for zzso zzso synaptic plasticity and the differential sensitivity of zzso and zzso PCs to zzso zzso cell zzso
