Nuclear factor zzso zzso has a central role in zzso the expression of a wide variety of genes that control immune responses and is also recognized as an zzso zzso zzso Here, we focused on the role of the zzso signaling zzso in the interaction between inflammatory cells and zzso in liver zzso We found that zzso of mice with zzso expressing a zzso form of the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso reduced the migration of inflammatory cells and zzso and zzso expression in the liver 12 hours after a single intravenous injection of an zzso zzso zzso compared with mice infected with control zzso zzso We also confirmed reductions in zzso production by zzso T cells, and natural killer zzso cells in the liver of zzso mice by zzso zzso However, zzso treatment in zzso mice induced zzso of serum zzso zzso at 24 hours, and the liver injury was associated with massive zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gamma zzso production by zzso cells and T cells was increased and zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso production by zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, the liver injury was completely suppressed by the administration of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso activity suppressed zzso liver inflammation at an early phase, resulting in a reduction in zzso and zzso production, whereas it zzso zzso to zzso zzso and exacerbated liver injury at the late zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts pivotal activities at inflammatory sites, and caution should be exercised in zzso therapy of liver zzso
