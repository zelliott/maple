Both zzso and biological systems have to make decisions about switching from one state to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso provides the zzso fastest way to reach a common decision by all members of a population between two possible zzso where the decision approximately matches the initial relative zzso The network that regulates the zzso entry of the zzso in zzso also makes a decision before it zzso early zzso zzso Here we show that the switch from inactive to active forms of the zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso is driven by a system that is related to both the structure and the dynamics of the Approximate Majority zzso We investigate the behavior of these two switches by zzso zzso and zzso methods and show that the steady states and zzso dynamics of the two systems are similar and they are zzso as components of zzso zzso
