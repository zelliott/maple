zzso influx and the resulting increase in zzso calcium concentration zzso can induce enhanced sensitivity to temperature increases in zzso zzso Using the zzso technique and simultaneous calcium zzso we show that experimental zzso of zzso using the calcium zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso This was not the case when rises in zzso were zzso by zzso of the cell membrane by current injection via the patch zzso Our data provide first, however, indirect evidence that in sensory zzso calcium zzso may be guided into different zzso zzso depending on the type of zzso channel or pore through which they enter the zzso We conclude that the zzso of sensory zzso for calcium zzso may be decisive on further zzso zzso accounting, for example, for zzso zzso
