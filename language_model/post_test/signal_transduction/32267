zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are active against zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso We interrogated zzso zzso cancer cell lines for growth response to the zzso inhibitor zzso and for expressed zzso zzso species in a linked genetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso that respectively zzso zzso inhibitor response or resistance were zzso Previous studies revealed zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso zzso findings were validated using lung cancer cell lines, transgenic and zzso zzso lung cancer models, and human zzso lung tissue zzso in addition to testing other zzso zzso zzso sensitivity most significantly correlated with high zzso E zzso and low zzso growth factor binding protein 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso family members were associated with zzso zzso resistance occurred with high zzso zzso zzso Newer zzso zzso exhibited a pattern of sensitivity similar to zzso zzso of zzso E or loss of zzso in lung cancer cells significantly increased zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso transgenic lung zzso expressed a gene profile implicating zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced proliferation of zzso and human lung zzso zzso zzso reduced lung cancer formation in a zzso mouse zzso In human zzso lung tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso should be considered in zzso beyond those with zzso zzso zzso zzso This includes tumors that express genes indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso
