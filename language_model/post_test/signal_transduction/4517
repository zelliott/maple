zzso zzso cells zzso are the producers of type I zzso in response to zzso zzso However, we have found that when bone zzso is depleted of zzso the zzso produced in response to zzso zzso is not fully zzso We assign the source of this zzso zzso as a newly described DC zzso It displays the high zzso producing activity of zzso but to a more limited range of zzso Unlike zzso the novel DC display high T cell stimulation zzso Moreover, unlike mouse zzso they are matured with zzso and are less prone to zzso upon zzso zzso including zzso We propose that these DC constitute a novel bone zzso inflammatory DC type, zzso geared to linking innate and zzso immune responses in bone zzso via their potent zzso production and high T cell zzso zzso
