Although zzso has remained in clinical use since zzso the mechanism by which it zzso blood vessels to lower blood pressure remains incompletely zzso zzso zzso metabolism that generates several reaction products, including zzso and this zzso process is essential for zzso zzso zzso G zzso mediates classic zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso is also independently activated by zzso that involves zzso zzso formation within this zzso protein zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso 

Treating smooth muscle cells or isolated blood vessels with zzso caused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was increased in zzso mouse zzso by in zzso zzso treatment, but this zzso was lost as tolerance zzso To establish whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso mouse that cannot zzso zzso signals because it does not contain the vital zzso zzso This zzso zzso mouse was zzso deficient in zzso response to zzso compared with zzso zzso as measured in zzso by zzso Resistance blood vessels from zzso were markedly less sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, after zzso hours of treatment, zzso controls stopped zzso to zzso and the vascular sensitivity to zzso was zzso whereas this tolerance phenomenon, which routinely zzso the management of zzso patients, was absent in zzso 

zzso zzso formation is a significant zzso of zzso zzso and tolerance to zzso is associated with loss of zzso zzso
