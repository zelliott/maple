zzso are capable of exerting both zzso and zzso actions in target cells of multiple zzso including the brain, which trigger an array of zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory regulatory zzso Here, we have attempted to show how zzso may generate a rapid zzso response by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso According to our hypothesized model, zzso action of zzso results in the global shift of membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways toward the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and away from zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso synthesis by zzso assists this mechanism by suppressing the synthesis of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In the central nervous system zzso this may represent a major zzso system, which may zzso with zzso signaling in the zzso allowing for the coordination between energy zzso and the inflammatory zzso
