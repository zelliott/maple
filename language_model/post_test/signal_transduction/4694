The zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are well known as key regulators of the zzso zzso in various cell types, but they comprise a distinct zzso of the zzso family in that they are zzso bound and zzso zzso zzso differences of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso signaling have been reported in various cell zzso zzso and zzso antagonize zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso does zzso However, all the members of the zzso family have been reported to bind directly to zzso zzso and equally induce zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and there is no evidence that accounts for the functional difference of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso Here we report the role of the zzso region in zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso have a zzso zzso sequence of zzso acids in their zzso which functions as the zzso zzso zzso The sequence mediates the zzso raft targeting of zzso zzso correlated with its zzso Overall, our results demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism by which differential membrane targeting zzso activities of zzso proteins to function as zzso zzso
