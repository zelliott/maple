The zzso gene has an important role in zzso zzso decision and zzso zzso control mechanisms for zzso of this gene are still poorly zzso In a chemical zzso screen for small zzso zzso of zzso zzso we identified zzso growth factor zzso zzso as a key negative regulator of zzso gene expression in primary human zzso intact zzso and skin zzso cell zzso zzso The underlying mechanism for negative control of the zzso gene in human cells, as well as in a mouse model of zzso skin zzso involves zzso suppression of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cancer cells zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso while, at the same time, zzso with these compounds in induction of zzso Thus, our data reveal a key role of zzso zzso in the negative regulation of zzso gene transcription, of potential relevance for zzso approaches for cancer zzso
