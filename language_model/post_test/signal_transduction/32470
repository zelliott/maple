Several zzso that act through G zzso receptors have been shown to affect the growth rate of dividing zzso An analysis of the early signaling events that mediate this response revealed some novel activities for G zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso cells also stimulates the synthesis of DNA, which results in increased zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicates the need for a G zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso analog and, in Chinese zzso zzso cells with a zzso protein zzso A, which is resistant to the growth effects of zzso zzso zzso the zzso response is independent of changes in zzso zzso It was determined that a number of other signaling pathways commonly used by zzso receptors are not involved in the zzso zzso zzso These include zzso acid release, stimulation of protein zzso C, stimulation of zzso zzso opening of zzso channels and zzso of zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso at the same zzso that block zzso zzso In fact, zzso and zzso stimulate a rapid increase in zzso zzso of a number of zzso in the zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso These results reveal a novel signaling event for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso They suggest the importance of these events for zzso zzso zzso zzso
