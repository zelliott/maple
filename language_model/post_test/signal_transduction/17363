The zzso zzso nucleus zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Y zzso and growth hormone releasing hormone zzso zzso regulates zzso energy balance and body zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso diseases ranging from growth failure to zzso Despite considerable investigation regarding the function of Arc zzso mechanisms governing their development remain zzso zzso signaling factors such as zzso and zzso are present in zzso zzso that give rise to Arc zzso However, how zzso signaling controls these zzso populations is zzso To zzso the role of zzso signaling in Arc development, we analyzed conditional zzso mice lacking a necessary zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso as well as mice with expression of the zzso active zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso We found that loss of zzso results in absence of zzso but not of zzso within the primordial Arc at zzso Additionally, zzso expression is increased, zzso with increased proliferation and zzso of Arc zzso at zzso At zzso zzso zzso mice have few zzso and show increased numbers of differentiated zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso mice have increased zzso zzso show an absence of differentiated Arc zzso and zzso zzso differentiation at zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice have changes in growth and body size during zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso signaling regulates the generation and differentiation of Arc zzso which contribute to zzso regulation of body zzso
