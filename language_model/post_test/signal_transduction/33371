zzso releasing hormone zzso plays a primary role in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso axis and is an important zzso target of negative feedback regulation by zzso We sought to define zzso regions of the zzso promoter responsible for zzso zzso and zzso repression of zzso promoter zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso was zzso largely through a classical, consensus, zzso element zzso at - 224 zzso zzso zzso produced a specific zzso repression of zzso but not zzso zzso promoter zzso Using a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso promoter activity was localized to promoter sequences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain to this promoter region was observed using an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso dependent zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso primarily by the zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso repression is specific for the zzso promoter, and not a generalized effect of zzso signaling or interference with the protein zzso A zzso signaling pathway, zzso a highly zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso is critical for zzso dependent repression, and zzso zzso is capable of interacting directly with this functionally defined negative zzso response element of the zzso zzso
