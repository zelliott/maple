We have previously demonstrated that zzso hormone zzso zzso a rapid and transient expression of zzso in the zzso In this report, we investigated the signaling zzso for zzso and zzso zzso expression in cultured rat zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression was suppressed by high dose of protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso (10 zzso but not by low doses zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso implicating the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in a rapid stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, like zzso zzso was also able to activate zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the essential role of zzso zzso with this promise, in zzso cells depleted of zzso sensitive zzso by prolonged treatment with zzso zzso or zzso could still induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso in primary zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso resulted in the suppression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso which is activated by zzso or zzso contributes to the induction of zzso in zzso cells of zzso zzso
