Although zzso zzso are primarily caused by zzso stem cells, the molecular basis of their transformation remains largely zzso Here, by analyzing mice with a zzso in the zzso finger domain of zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso is required to restrict zzso leukemia zzso These mice develop a zzso disease which zzso to leukemia and involves zzso zzso that exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso this signaling through zzso with zzso zzso knockout mice prevents leukemia zzso We also observe enhanced zzso zzso and zzso activity, and zzso expression of zzso zzso factors in zzso zzso The characterization of these zzso provides direction for zzso that may aid the treatment of patients with zzso zzso
