Within the short span of the cell cycle, zzso zzso can be rapidly produced by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Here we show that changes in association between zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso regulate zzso stem cell zzso maintenance and egg chamber polarity during zzso in zzso The association of zzso and zzso an zzso of human zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso thereby diminishing zzso translation in zzso zzso Following the reduction of zzso level, zzso leave the stem cell niche and zzso zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso function cause a decrease in zzso translation, leading to a loss of zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso and its association with zzso control zzso zzso and zzso zzso by regulating zzso zzso
