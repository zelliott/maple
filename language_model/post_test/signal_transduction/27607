In this report we present the first in-depth description of the zzso and pharmacological properties of rabbit cardiac zzso zzso The apparent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complexes were zzso zzso 90, 62, 52 and 38 zzso as demonstrated by an zzso of zzso cardiac zzso receptors separated under zzso conditions by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso complexes were zzso since the zzso of the complexes diminished to zzso zzso 97, 71, 45 and 38 zzso under reducing conditions, indicating the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso in various zzso The pharmacology of cardiac zzso receptors is not typical of zzso receptors present in other zzso In radio zzso zzso both bovine zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso less zzso respectively, than zzso zzso in blocking the binding of zzso to cardiac binding sites and were, therefore, extremely weak zzso Similarly, neither bovine zzso nor zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso of cardiac zzso receptors compared to equivalent doses of zzso zzso zzso which characterize the zzso for the association, zzso and equilibrium binding of zzso to cardiac zzso receptors were zzso Association zzso for the binding of zzso to heart zzso receptors exhibited a maximum specific binding at 17 h and 25 degrees zzso The association of zzso to heart zzso receptors was zzso with approximately 15 h required for half of the specifically bound zzso to zzso The zzso of zzso to heart zzso receptors was optimum at pH 6 and the strength of the equilibrium zzso as measured by the zzso was approximately 2 zzso These data indicate that the cardiac zzso receptors are zzso distinct and that there is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
