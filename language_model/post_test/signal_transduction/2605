zzso between zzso on T cells and zzso zzso and zzso zzso counter receptors provide crucial zzso signals for zzso zzso zzso To test the role of zzso in zzso development and zzso of zzso zzso T cells, we introduced the zzso V gamma zzso alpha zzso zzso into zzso mice zzso We show that positive and negative selection of gamma delta zzso zzso proceeded normally in the absence of zzso Although mature zzso gamma zzso zzso required a second zzso signal for zzso gamma zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso responded equally well to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso could not be blocked with zzso against zzso and zzso zzso Thus gamma delta zzso zzso a zzso system during development and zzso that is independent of zzso and zzso zzso By contrast to V gamma zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso of V gamma zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso T cells depended on zzso zzso and was severely impaired in zzso zzso These data provide functional evidence that maturation and selection of gamma delta cells is independent of zzso These results also indicate that distinct zzso pathways are operational in mature zzso and peripheral T zzso
