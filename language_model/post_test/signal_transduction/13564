Mouse zzso axis polarization is preceded by formation of the zzso visceral zzso zzso by unknown zzso Here, we show by in zzso zzso of zzso immediately after zzso in zzso cavities that the external mechanical cues exerted on the zzso are crucial for zzso formation, as well as the zzso egg cylinder shape, without affecting zzso zzso programs except those involving zzso zzso This implies that these zzso events immediately after zzso are not simply zzso processes but require zzso factors from maternal zzso Moreover, the mechanical forces induce a breach of the basement membrane barrier at the zzso portion locally, and thereby the zzso zzso cells emerge as the zzso zzso Thus, we propose that external mechanical forces exerted by the interaction between zzso and maternal zzso zzso directly control the location of zzso formation at the zzso tip and consequently establish the zzso primary body zzso
