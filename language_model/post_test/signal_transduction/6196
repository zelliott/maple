We have generated a series of zzso zzso zzso animals to explore the role of signaling pathways coupled to zzso during zzso Although this zzso zzso was zzso expressing tenfold less zzso protein than wild type, the zzso animals were zzso However, a further twofold reduction in zzso levels in zzso zzso animals resulted in zzso zzso with defects in the zzso of the zzso zzso rescue of this zzso was accomplished by expression of the zzso zzso in a comparable zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso animals were viable with normal zzso of the zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso expressed higher levels of zzso and that zzso promoted the turnover of the zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso site in zzso zzso resulted in subtle defects in the sensory nerves not observed in the other zzso zzso zzso Thus, we have established how zzso levels may be modulated through development and that a minimum threshold level of zzso is zzso
