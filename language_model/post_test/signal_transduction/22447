zzso signaling zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and increase cell zzso and invasion, a process termed zzso transition zzso zzso plays a major role in cancer zzso allowing individual cells to zzso from the primary zzso invade local zzso and colonize distant zzso with new zzso While invasion of vascular and zzso networks is the zzso route of zzso nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed zzso invasion zzso Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly zzso as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of zzso Here we examine how zzso signaling contributes to zzso using zzso culture model zzso We find that zzso produced by zzso cells, enhances scattering in response to zzso zzso increasing both zzso junction zzso and cell zzso Further, zzso of zzso induce migratory zzso cells to undergo zzso towards the source of zzso Interestingly, zzso suppresses zzso enhancement of zzso These results have broad implications for how zzso growth factor signaling contributes to cancer zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso might zzso zzso signaling to influence route selection during cancer zzso
