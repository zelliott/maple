zzso of zzso oxide and its zzso zzso nitrogen species during zzso has been implicated in the zzso of the associated cardiovascular zzso This stress can promote zzso zzso modifications of proteins that may alter their activity and contribute to zzso We zzso the zzso zzso method to zzso protein zzso and zzso for zzso zzso to monitor changes in zzso protein zzso during zzso Hearts from zzso zzso rats showed no apparent variation in global protein zzso but this may be due to the poor sensitivity of the zzso zzso To sensitize our monitoring of protein zzso we exposed isolated hearts to the efficient zzso agent zzso (which generated a robust zzso zzso and then identified a number of target proteins using mass zzso We were then able to probe for these target proteins in zzso preparations of zzso proteins prepared from zzso or zzso zzso Unexpectedly this showed a zzso loss in zzso during zzso which we hypothesized, may be due to zzso zzso formation that may lower zzso oxide but simultaneously generate the zzso agent zzso Indeed, this was confirmed by zzso for global zzso zzso which increased zzso and temporally correlated with a decrease in mean zzso zzso We assessed if zzso zzso was zzso in lowering blood pressure using the putative zzso scavenger zzso However, zzso was ineffective in reducing global protein zzso and actually exacerbated zzso zzso
