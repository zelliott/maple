The zzso muscle wasting disease zzso muscular zzso is caused by the lack of zzso in zzso zzso structure predictions, patient zzso in zzso binding studies and transgenic and knockout mice suggest that zzso plays a mechanical role in skeletal muscle, linking the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso through its direct interaction with the zzso protein complex zzso Although a signaling role for zzso has been zzso definitive data have been zzso To identify potential zzso roles of zzso we tested the ability of various truncated zzso zzso to prevent any of the skeletal muscle abnormalities associated with the double knockout mouse deficient for both zzso and the zzso protein zzso We show that restoration of the zzso with zzso does not prevent the structural abnormalities of the zzso membrane or the abnormal zzso properties of zzso zzso In marked contrast, a zzso protein lacking the zzso domain, which is unable to prevent zzso in the zzso zzso is able to zzso these abnormalities in zzso zzso These experiments provide the first direct evidence that in addition to a mechanical role and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are able to alter both structural and zzso properties of skeletal zzso In addition, these mice provide unique insights into skeletal muscle fiber type zzso
