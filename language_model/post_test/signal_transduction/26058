zzso cells of the inner ear sensory zzso originate from zzso cells located at specific zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for sensory development and loss of function of the zzso zzso jagged 1 zzso also known as zzso 1) results in impaired sensory zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso function is zzso Our results show that in the chicken zzso zzso the zzso expression domain initially contains the nascent patches of zzso expression but, later on, zzso is only maintained in the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso is able to induce zzso expression and enlarged sensory zzso The competence to respond to zzso however, is confined to the regions that expressed zzso early in development, suggesting that zzso maintains zzso expression rather than inducing it de zzso The effect is zzso and requires zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso in a zzso manner, which is consistent with lateral zzso The effects of zzso are zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso is sufficient to activate the zzso zzso and to zzso induce sensory cell fate outside zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso function of zzso resides in its ability to generate discrete zzso of zzso activity that maintain zzso expression within restricted areas of an extended zzso zzso This provides a mechanism to couple patterning and cell fate zzso during the development of sensory zzso
