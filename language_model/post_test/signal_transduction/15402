Most zzso processes are subjected to molecular regulation by growth factors, which are zzso proteins that activate chemical signal zzso pathways through binding of specific zzso zzso One particular growth factor system involved in the in zzso regulation of blood vessel growth is called the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques are well suited to handle the molecular complexity (the number of binding partners involved, including zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso and zzso nature zzso zzso zzso transport and local zzso systemic effects within an zzso involved in modeling growth factor system interactions and zzso This chapter introduces a variety of in zzso models that seek to zzso different aspects of zzso system biology at various spatial and zzso zzso zzso kinetic models focus on zzso zzso interactions at and near the zzso cell surface; zzso zzso zzso models can simulate the effects of zzso tissue architecture on the spatial variation in zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso modeling allows efficient prediction of average zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso across multiple large tissue volumes, permitting the investigation of zzso zzso transport zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso The given examples will demonstrate the utility of zzso models in aiding both basic science and clinical research on zzso systems zzso
