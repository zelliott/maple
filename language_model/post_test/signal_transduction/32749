The ability of zzso to induce an zzso state in a wide variety of cell types as well as to inhibit cellular growth has long been zzso It is less clear, however, whether both these effects lie downstream of a common signaling zzso In this study we have taken advantage of an zzso human myeloma cell line zzso displaying a dramatic zzso response to zzso in an effort to resolve the signaling requirements for zzso zzso and growth regulatory zzso Thus, we have analyzed the ability of zzso to induce a number of known zzso events in this cell line and have compared these responses with those exhibited by a cell zzso and maturation zzso myeloma cell line zzso that displays typical zzso zzso Despite the widely contrasting effects of zzso on cellular zzso zzso was shown to be comparable in its ability to induce the expression of early response genes as well as induce resistance to viral infection in both cell zzso By contrast, the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso were zzso zzso Finally, although zzso of zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on the induction of the zzso response, it completely blocked zzso proliferation of the zzso zzso In zzso our analysis of the role of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways using these two cell lines suggests that the zzso and growth regulatory effects of zzso display a differential requirement for zzso of the zzso zzso
