While the role of the class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in insulin signaling is well established, little is known about the role of the class II zzso zzso We show that insulin stimulation of intact rat zzso and zzso muscles causes a 3- to zzso increase in the activity of the zzso alpha zzso of the class II zzso zzso zzso This zzso is rapid and parallels the zzso zzso of the class zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso in these zzso However, while contraction activated zzso zzso zzso it did not stimulate the activity of the class II zzso zzso zzso zzso of class II zzso zzso is unlikely to provide a mechanism that explains the fact that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not blocked by zzso However, the results suggest that zzso of class II zzso zzso is likely to play a role in insulin signaling pathways in skeletal zzso
