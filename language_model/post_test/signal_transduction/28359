zzso zzso zzso is one of the signaling zzso that interact with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signals cooperate with vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso to promote zzso changes, cell proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso vessel zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso was inhibited by the zzso of a dominant negative, zzso zzso zzso as well as by treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso induced zzso of protein zzso B zzso a regulator of cell survival and zzso on zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocked the survival effect of zzso in zzso binding zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso activity was reversed by both zzso and zzso as measured by a homogeneous zzso zzso We also demonstrate that both zzso migration and cell proliferation of zzso induced by zzso were suppressed by the zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso plays an important role in vascular zzso zzso by zzso
