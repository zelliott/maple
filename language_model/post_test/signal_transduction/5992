Growth of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is generally associated with an inflammatory zzso It is hypothesized that these tumor cells develop mechanisms to evade the growth zzso effects of zzso that are present in the tumor zzso This study determined the changes in responsiveness to inflammatory zzso that accompany the transition of normal to transformed zzso zzso zzso primary cultures of normal zzso cells zzso and SCC cells were established from 16 zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways in response to zzso treatments was identified by zzso zzso zzso incorporation determined the impact of the zzso on DNA zzso zzso and zzso displayed a prominent signaling in response to zzso M, zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso showed an elevated level of zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso suggesting zzso activated zzso Moreover, zzso cells zzso significantly more signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 in response to zzso M zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis of SCC cells was less inhibited by zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso M slightly enhanced proliferation of zzso whereas that of NEC was suppressed zzso zzso zzso This study identified significant zzso in signal zzso pathways engaged by zzso and which are associated with loss of growth zzso of zzso Increased signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggest that these pathways as molecular markers are important in the zzso transformation process and are potential targets for zzso
