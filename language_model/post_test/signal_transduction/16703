zzso are a paramount example of how nature zzso from one single gene to release zzso regulated zzso at the desired sites and zzso To achieve this, peptides are zzso generated by a complex network of more than 500 zzso acting at zzso sites, upon zzso in zzso zzso and, finally, serving zzso zzso This cycle of zzso zzso and degradation points out that the zzso is mechanistically linked to the zzso the distribution between both is regulated by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Given the high diversity of peptides in living systems and their involvement in key regulatory zzso a need for improved zzso discovery, zzso combining zzso sequence identification with zzso zzso has zzso Standard zzso approaches are not suitable for a systematic zzso analysis, since they do not cover the low molecular mass zzso The new direction in zzso research to zzso this zzso zzso is zzso This novel concept aims at the comprehensive zzso and analysis of small zzso thus covering the mass range between zzso and zzso The zzso for the development of zzso technologies are modern mass zzso and zzso They are zzso suited for sensitive and comprehensive zzso analysis, especially in combination with the massive information content of today's zzso and zzso zzso Given the high diversity of native peptides in living systems, clinical chemistry and modern medicine are the prime application zzso The discovery of relevant zzso zzso and drug targets will strongly benefit from zzso
