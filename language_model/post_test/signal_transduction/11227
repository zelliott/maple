zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is frequently found in skin zzso However, the nature of downstream signaling pathways from Ras involved in skin zzso remains poorly zzso Recently, we and others identified zzso C zzso zzso as an zzso of zzso Here we have examined the role of zzso in de zzso skin chemical zzso by using mice whose zzso is genetically zzso zzso mice exhibit delayed onset and markedly reduced zzso of skin zzso tumors induced by initiation with zzso followed by promotion with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso formed in zzso mice fail to undergo zzso progression into zzso in contrast to a zzso conversion rate of approximately zzso observed with zzso in zzso zzso In all of the tumors zzso the zzso gene is zzso activated irrespective of the zzso zzso The skin of zzso mice fails to exhibit zzso layer cell proliferation and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso These results indicate a crucial role of zzso in zzso zzso de zzso zzso and downstream signaling from zzso introducing zzso as a candidate molecular target for the development of zzso zzso
