zzso zzso proteins are organized into ordered zzso In zzso organisms, such as zzso coli, zzso assembly processes are thought to account for the placement of zzso zzso which are zzso zzso In contrast, we previously found that zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso are zzso polar and that array zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso However, the processes that enable zzso to facilitate array zzso have not been zzso Here, we show that a previously zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and that zzso is integral to array zzso in zzso zzso zzso principal contribution to zzso appears to be via positioning of zzso Once recruited to the pole by zzso zzso sequesters zzso at this site by capturing and preventing the zzso of zzso signaling protein zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso protein complexes in the absence of zzso indicating that some of its activity is independent of this interaction zzso zzso recruits zzso via zzso zzso and inheritance domain, a region found only in zzso zzso organisms that zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, a zzso zzso interaction network enables the polar zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso clusters adjacent to the zzso which the zzso signal is zzso proper zzso as well as accurate inheritance of these zzso zzso
