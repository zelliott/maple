To investigate the stimulation of zzso acid formation in bovine zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso we zzso zzso cells with zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso Under these conditions zzso D generated zzso whereas the zzso acid from zzso C and zzso zzso was zzso The action of various zzso zzso on both zzso acid and zzso was consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso D was dependent on zzso zzso and was mostly transient zzso within 3 zzso whereas the initial stimulation of zzso C was independent of zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso The zzso stimulation of zzso D was dependent on protein zzso C, as judged by its sensitivity to the relatively selective protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso These results show that zzso stimulation of zzso acid has three zzso an initial zzso stimulation of zzso C, an early but transient zzso and protein zzso zzso stimulation of zzso D, and a sustained zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Using zzso to inhibit zzso zzso we provide evidence that zzso acid derived from zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso route can itself be converted back into zzso
