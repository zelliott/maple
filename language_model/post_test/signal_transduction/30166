Although best known for its role in T zzso zzso the zzso factor of activated T cells zzso signaling zzso is also known to be involved in a wide range of other biological responses in a variety of different cell zzso Here we have investigated the role of the zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso cells that are derived from the zzso cell lineage after stimulation with a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of zzso known as zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso We now report that zzso of zzso with either the zzso drugs zzso A and zzso or the zzso zzso zzso expression of a specific zzso zzso zzso all zzso inhibit the zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso cell line into mature zzso zzso In addition, we find that zzso family members are expressed in zzso cells and that their expression is zzso in response to zzso zzso Most importantly, we find that zzso expression of a zzso active, zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is sufficient to induce these cells to express an zzso pattern of gene expression and differentiate into zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of inducing the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data define zzso as an essential downstream zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso leading toward the induction of zzso differentiation and zzso indicate that the zzso of the zzso zzso factor is sufficient to initiate a genetic program that results in the zzso of the mature functional zzso cell zzso
