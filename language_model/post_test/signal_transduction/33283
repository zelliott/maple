Light regulation of seeding zzso is zzso by zzso that perceive red, zzso blue and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso have identified several of the primary zzso as well as a set of negative regulators of zzso zzso including zzso that appear to act downstream of the zzso To study the regulatory context in which zzso acts to repress zzso we used a simple zzso screen to isolate zzso zzso in six zzso designated zzso (for reversal of the zzso zzso that partially or fully suppress the seeding zzso zzso of zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso identify new zzso of the previously described zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso partially suppress the zzso gene expression zzso of zzso and that the mechanism of suppression does not involve direct zzso of the zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also partially suppress the zzso zzso zzso of mature zzso plants, and zzso and zzso suppress a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are newly described zzso whose function appears closely associated with that of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso are associated with a moderate zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in the pathways that regulate both zzso zzso and the initiation of zzso
