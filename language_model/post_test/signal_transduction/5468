zzso zzso zzso is known to play a major role in regulating cardiac zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential mechanism by which the zzso zzso a common second zzso zzso can be regulated in a zzso zzso However, the zzso significance of expressing multiple zzso zzso in a tissue and how each specific zzso regulates the zzso signal remains poorly zzso In a genetically engineered mouse model in which the expression of the type 5 zzso is knocked out zzso we identified the zzso of zzso regulation and zzso zzso of cardiac zzso We also identified that disruption of type 5 zzso preserves cardiac function in response to chronic zzso and zzso stress, at least in part, through the zzso of cardiac zzso which plays a major role in the development of heart zzso The protection against both zzso and development of cardiac dysfunction induced by left zzso pressure overload in zzso makes this zzso potentially important for developing future zzso where suppressing the activity of type 5 zzso and not the entire zzso signaling zzso signaling pathway, may have an advantage over the current zzso therapy in the treatment of heart zzso
