In the genetic zzso mouse models zzso or zzso zzso zzso or resistance, respectively, results in severe obesity and the development of a syndrome resembling zzso One of the earliest manifestations in these zzso mice is zzso suggesting that zzso may normally directly suppress the zzso of zzso Here, we show that pancreatic zzso express a long zzso form of zzso zzso and that zzso bind a fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso The expression of zzso receptors on zzso zzso was also zzso utilizing zzso generated against an zzso zzso of the zzso A functional role for the zzso zzso zzso is indicated by our observation that zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of insulin from zzso isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso produced a marked lowering of zzso in zzso zzso which was accompanied by cellular zzso and increased membrane zzso zzso patch zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso activated zzso zzso channels zzso by increasing the open channel zzso while exerting no effect on mean open zzso These effects were reversed by the zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso Taken together, these observations indicate an important zzso role for zzso as an inhibitor of insulin zzso and lead us to propose that the failure of zzso to inhibit insulin zzso from the zzso of zzso and zzso mice may explain, in part, the development of zzso insulin resistance, and the progression to zzso
