zzso binding and signaling pathways are important fields of biomedical zzso Here we report simple optical methods for the determination of the equilibrium binding constant zzso of zzso interactions as well as quantitative studies of zzso zzso The techniques are based on zzso and zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between zzso and zzso fused to proteins of the zzso zzso Using zzso has several advantages over conventional zzso techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are determined accurately by zzso highly sensitive binding signals enable the analysis of small zzso and zzso are compatible with zzso plate zzso Most importantly, our zzso techniques enable us to measure the effect of other molecules on the binding of two proteins of interest, which is not straightforward with other zzso These zzso provide powerful tools for the study of competitive zzso zzso and the extent to which drug candidates modify protein zzso
