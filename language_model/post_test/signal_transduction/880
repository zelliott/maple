Various hormones and growth factors have been implicated in progression of prostate cancer, but their role and the underlying molecular zzso involved remain poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the role of human growth hormone zzso and its zzso zzso in human prostate zzso We first demonstrated zzso expression of zzso and of its zzso zzso zzso zzso in benign prostate zzso zzso and prostate zzso patient zzso as well as in zzso zzso and zzso human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso higher and zzso only zzso higher, in the zzso zzso than in zzso Both zzso were also expressed in zzso and zzso cell lines and somewhat less so in zzso zzso The zzso cell zzso protein was further zzso on the basis of its zzso of zzso its binding to two different zzso zzso zzso its high affinity and purely zzso binding to zzso and its ability to zzso zzso binding zzso all characteristic of a functional zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso signaling events in zzso cells, including zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso itself and of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso No effect of zzso zzso could be shown on zzso or zzso zzso cell proliferation nor on zzso zzso Interestingly, however, zzso caused a rapid zzso though transient striking increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso or zzso followed by a slower zzso reduction zzso or zzso zzso with only modest parallel changes in zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso of signaling zzso its effects on zzso protein in zzso cells and the zzso regulation of zzso in prostate cancer patient zzso suggest that zzso most likely in concert with other hormones and growth factors, may play an important role in progression of human prostate zzso
