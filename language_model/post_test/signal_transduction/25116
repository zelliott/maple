zzso changes of protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso nucleus have been studied using rats maintained under zzso zzso zzso dark cycles as well as constant dark zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was higher in the light period than in the dark period and was increased after light exposure in the dark zzso Similar changes in zzso zzso were observed under constant dark conditions, but its zzso was weaker than that in zzso zzso dark zzso As the zzso form of zzso is able to bind to the zzso zzso 2 domain of a protein zzso zzso zzso we examined association of these proteins in zzso nucleus extracts and found that zzso was zzso with zzso in parallel with its zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso might be involved in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
