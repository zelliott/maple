The zzso zzso of nerve growth factor zzso is susceptible to zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso of highly zzso full-length zzso human zzso and zzso truncated zzso revealed lower potency of zzso with regard to early zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 times higher zzso of zzso than zzso were required to elicit the same extent of zzso zzso of key zzso in different second zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar reduced potency for induction of the zzso factor zzso was observed with zzso compared to zzso The lower potency of zzso in triggering early responses correlated with its zzso lower affinity for zzso zzso Whereas zzso had a more than zzso lower affinity for the high affinity zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso of zzso changed its affinity for the low affinity zzso zzso only slightly zzso These observations suggest that zzso acids zzso of zzso are important for binding to the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso therefore, reduces its potency in starting several second zzso pathways leading to zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
