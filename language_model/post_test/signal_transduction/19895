zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso acid zzso and a head group, and is involved in the response to various environmental zzso including zzso Here, we determined the roles of zzso and PA in the mediation of salt zzso signaling through the regulation of zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the content and composition of PA were zzso zzso by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso A specific PA species (a zzso zzso zzso which was increased in abundance by exposure to zzso bound to a zzso according to filter binding and zzso The effect of PA on zzso activity was tested using zzso zzso zzso zzso PA zzso the activity of zzso zzso from zzso leaf zzso Treatment with zzso induced a transient zzso of zzso in zzso plant, but the zzso was abolished in the zzso plant zzso A plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso was identified as a downstream target of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by treatment with zzso as well as directly by zzso zzso These results suggest that PA plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso in response to salt zzso
