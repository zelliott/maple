zzso growth factor B zzso is a growth factor promoting and regulating cell migration, zzso and zzso involved in both zzso processes and in maintaining tissue zzso under strict zzso What are the implications of prolonged or uncontrolled growth factor signaling in zzso and when does a growth factor such as zzso become an zzso Under experimental conditions, zzso zzso proliferation and causes tumor zzso It is not known whether these tumors are strictly a zzso proliferation of cells or associated with secondary genetic events such as acquired zzso or zzso gene zzso promoting zzso If zzso zzso was only cellular zzso associated changes in gene expression would thus be correlated with proliferation and not associated with secondary events involved in zzso and zzso transformation such as cycle zzso DNA damage response, and cell zzso Changes in gene expression might be expected to be zzso as is zzso proliferation under normal zzso Since zzso signaling is involved in zzso zzso cell differentiation and zzso it is likely that zzso stimulates proliferation of a pool of cells with that zzso and zzso of zzso signaling would result in reduced expression of zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso signaling would be expected to result in zzso of genes induced by zzso accompanied by a decrease in zzso However, if zzso zzso is more than simply a proliferation of cells, zzso of zzso signaling may not reverse gene expression or halt zzso These fundamental questions concerning zzso as a potential zzso have not been zzso
