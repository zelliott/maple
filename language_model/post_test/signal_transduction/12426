The unfolded protein response zzso is an zzso zzso mechanism by which all zzso cells preserve the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the face of zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso Plants possess at least two signaling pathways specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso and zzso are basic zzso zzso zzso factors that are activated by regulated zzso zzso systems and regulate zzso of the zzso zzso These signaling pathways play important roles not only in the zzso but also in other biological processes such as the response to pathogens and heat zzso
