Cellular zzso state is regulated by numerous zzso The zzso compound, zzso is considered to be one of the most zzso zzso to its zzso power and potential influence over protein structure and zzso While signaling roles for zzso in plants have been suggested for several years, hard proof is zzso Recently, through an approach based on genetic manipulation of zzso in an zzso stress background, we reported evidence that zzso status is important to allow zzso zzso to activate zzso zzso signaling zzso This effect does not seem to be caused by changes in zzso zzso capacity, and appears to be distinct to regulation through known players in zzso responses, such as zzso Our data therefore suggest that new zzso components that link zzso stress to response zzso await zzso
