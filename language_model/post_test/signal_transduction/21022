zzso or zzso IV zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso via zzso was shown to be dependent on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso associated zzso with at least one functional immune zzso zzso based zzso motif zzso Here we tested zzso lines expressing zzso proteins zzso consisting of human zzso zzso chain derived zzso sequences zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso for their capacity to transfer zzso zzso zzso Although these zzso zzso expressing zzso lines were capable of zzso signals from other zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not induce zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso however, resulted in the stimulation of the zzso Thus, although the zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso signaling events, the sole expression of zzso as a signaling zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso triggering but permits zzso induced zzso in zzso negative zzso
