zzso zzso and zzso zzso invasion depends on the zzso zzso protein zzso domain zzso or zzso engaging the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso on red blood zzso zzso of this key interaction provides an excellent opportunity for zzso zzso There are competing models for whether zzso zzso engage receptors as zzso or zzso a question whose resolution has profound implications for zzso biology and zzso We report zzso solution and functional studies of zzso showing that zzso is required for and driven by zzso zzso This work provides a unifying framework for prior studies and accounts for the action of naturally acquired blocking zzso and the mechanism of immune zzso We show that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso engagement and propose that zzso zzso zzso drives zzso affinity and zzso Because zzso is prevalent in zzso our studies raise the possibility that induced zzso may activate pathways for zzso
