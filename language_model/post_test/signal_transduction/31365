zzso sensing zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso occurs in response to zzso or host zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso acid zzso shunt zzso links stress response to zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid results in early expression of the signal degrading zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso or its precursor zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts by binding to the zzso zzso that regulates the zzso zzso zzso encodes another zzso The stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso separately the expression of the two zzso zzso which might control the zzso zzso level and hence to switch zzso the zzso signal zzso system in response to environmental zzso These findings document for the first time a sophisticated zzso mechanism of the widely zzso zzso degradation zzso in zzso
