zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways have parallel functions in preventing zzso In cancer patients, tumor zzso zzso is frequently zzso through zzso whereas zzso is silenced through promoter zzso However, the interaction between these two pathways is less well zzso Here, we report that zzso controls zzso expression in a unique zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso in primary mouse embryonic zzso zzso and various mouse zzso and an increase in the zzso promoter activity, without affecting the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso restored the proper expression of zzso These results indicate that zzso is necessary in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in response to zzso stress or zzso treatment did not zzso zzso zzso did not repress the zzso promoter activity zzso These findings suggest that zzso has a necessary but not sufficient role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is, at least zzso zzso by zzso a known positive regulator of zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso through protein stabilization and zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso mouse embryonic zzso These studies uncover a zzso mechanism for the loss of zzso and provide a basis for targeting both zzso and zzso in cancer zzso
