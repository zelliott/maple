The zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso is selectively expressed on memory T cells, B cells, and zzso cells and appears to be involved in the initiation of a memory immune zzso The only zzso zzso for zzso is zzso In the present study, we attempted to define the zzso zzso zzso of zzso responsible for zzso binding using a zzso approach in which the zzso of zzso were zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso to generate various zzso zzso These zzso were tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional activity as evaluated by calcium flux and zzso All zzso showed respectable surface zzso however only one, zzso with zzso loop 1 from zzso showed reduced functional zzso The general failure of functionality of the zzso zzso may imply that characteristics of each zzso are critical for coordination among all the zzso of zzso Additionally, of interest, a zzso containing all of the zzso from zzso in the context of zzso neither responded to zzso zzso nor served as a zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that not only zzso but also zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are involved in both zzso binding and zzso zzso
