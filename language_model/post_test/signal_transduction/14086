Acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critical zzso zzso analysis of plasma from individuals with zzso could zzso new zzso for diagnosis and zzso and identify potential zzso treatment zzso In this study, we recruited 26 patients (15 controls, 11 zzso The zzso group was subdivided into two groups depending on the type of zzso zzso direct lung injury zzso and zzso indirect lung injury zzso Using zzso zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso analysis, we identified zzso peptides representing 132 plasma zzso Among these, 16 were zzso expressed in zzso patients, including 11 overlapping proteins between the zzso and zzso group and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso transport and complement zzso were significantly enriched in the biological process category, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were significantly enriched in the molecular function zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways revealed that the overlapping proteins were involved in a variety of signaling zzso including those underlying acute phase zzso liver X zzso X zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complement system; and zzso zzso oxide, and zzso oxygen species production in zzso We present the first zzso analysis of zzso plasma using the zzso zzso Our data provide new zzso candidates and shed light on potential pathological mechanisms underlying zzso
