zzso is a critical regulator of cellular signaling downstream of multiple growth zzso The zzso zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso and is thus an important zzso zzso zzso we report the evolution of our program to discover zzso zzso zzso that demonstrate improved zzso properties and selectivity compared to our previous zzso Through targeted zzso and zzso design, new zzso and zzso scaffolds were identified that demonstrated superior zzso of zzso in cellular zzso selectivity over the closely related zzso family and improved in zzso clearance over our previously reported zzso zzso
