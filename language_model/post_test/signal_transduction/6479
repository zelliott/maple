zzso zzso are functionally coupled to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the coronary vascular dysfunction extends to zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso signal zzso from zzso heart is impaired in the coronary zzso wall of zzso 

zzso were fed with normal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso diet zzso zzso for 8 zzso zzso zzso isolated from rabbit hearts were zzso and gently placed on a beating canine zzso zzso zzso was produced in the beating heart and the diameter of the isolated zzso was observed using an zzso microscope with a floating zzso In control group, the isolated zzso significantly zzso 2 minutes after the onset of zzso and a plateau was observed at 10 zzso In contrast, the zzso from zzso group did not zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an elevated zzso level in the zzso of zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso radical zzso significantly zzso the isolated zzso only from zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso of zzso signals derived from zzso zzso is impaired in the coronary zzso wall of zzso zzso zzso stress in zzso may alter the zzso zzso
