The cellular response to environmental stimuli requires zzso information processing through which sensory zzso and cellular status are integrated and translated into appropriate responses by way of interacting networks of zzso One such network, the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade is a highly zzso signal zzso module that zzso signals from cell surface receptors to various zzso and nuclear targets by way of a zzso zzso We have investigated the potential for signal processing within a network of interacting zzso zzso zzso typified by the zzso zzso zzso A genetic zzso was used to search for sets of kinetic parameters demonstrating representative key zzso patterns of zzso We discuss two of the networks identified in our study, one implementing the zzso function zzso and another implementing what we refer to as an zzso detector zzso or zzso zzso These examples confirm the potential for logic and zzso signal processing in interacting zzso zzso zzso demonstrating limited zzso Specifically, the zzso function allows the network to respond to either one, but not both signals zzso while the zzso permits the network to respond exclusively to signals within a given range of strength, and to suppress signals below as well as above this zzso The solution to the zzso problem is interesting in that it requires only two interacting zzso zzso at only one layer, and no feedback or explicit zzso These types of responses are not only biologically relevant but constitute signal processing zzso that can be combined to create other logical functions and that, in contrast to amplification, cannot be achieved with a single cascade or with two zzso zzso Our zzso results revealed surprising similarities between experimental data describing the zzso zzso and the solution for the zzso that evolved from the genetic zzso The evolved zzso not only exhibited the required zzso signal zzso but also demonstrated transient and sustained responses that properly reflected the input signal strength, dependence on both of the zzso for zzso zzso site preferences by each of the zzso and both zzso and zzso resulting from the zzso of one of the zzso
