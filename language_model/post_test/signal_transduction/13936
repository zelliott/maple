Type II zzso zzso are a highly aggressive group of tumor zzso that are frequently associated with zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso We show that mice with zzso deletion of the zzso gene initially exhibited zzso changes that are identical to known precursor zzso of type II zzso zzso in humans and later developed zzso representing all type II zzso The zzso zzso zzso was frequently activated in these precursor zzso and tumors, suggesting a genetic cooperation between this zzso and zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso with this idea, analyses of 521 human zzso zzso identified frequent zzso zzso zzso in type I as well as type II zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression or zzso status each independently predicted poor patient zzso We suggest that molecular zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso play different roles in the initiation of the different zzso cancer zzso but combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are unifying zzso features among zzso diverse zzso of late stage aggressive zzso zzso
