zzso zzso of zzso the zzso regulator of zzso zzso promotes zzso of alpha s from G beta zzso zzso removal of zzso attached zzso from the G alpha zzso and triggers release of a fraction of alpha s from the plasma membrane into the zzso To zzso relations among these three events, we assessed zzso effects in zzso of attached zzso on zzso alpha s prepared from zzso zzso In comparison to the zzso protein zzso from zzso of zzso cells, treated with a zzso zzso or expressed as a zzso protein lacking the site for zzso zzso alpha s (from zzso zzso 50% zzso was more zzso as indicated by zzso into zzso and bound beta gamma with zzso higher zzso beta gamma protected zzso alpha zzso but not alpha zzso zzso from zzso by a zzso zzso We conclude that beta gamma binding and zzso zzso zzso each other in promoting membrane attachment of alpha s and that zzso of alpha zzso from beta gamma is likely to mediate zzso alpha s zzso and zzso of the protein to zzso in intact zzso
