Short term exposure of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso to zzso causes a rapid zzso of the activated zzso followed by a profound loss in the ability of the zzso zzso to activate its signaling zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify two clusters of zzso zzso in the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso that can serve as redundant targets for zzso zzso zzso of both clusters of zzso zzso to zzso abolished zzso zzso while zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso receptors with only one or the other cluster zzso However, the functional effects of zzso of these two zzso clusters were not zzso No zzso zzso was observed in an zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso produced a zzso that continued to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was promoted by zzso of either zzso suggesting that distinct mechanisms with unique structural requirements act downstream of zzso zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso and zzso zzso
