The lack of effective conventional therapies for the treatment of advanced stage melanoma has zzso interest in the application of novel strategies for the treatment of patients with zzso zzso Because of its expression in a large percentage of melanoma zzso and its restricted distribution in normal zzso the high molecular zzso zzso zzso also known as the melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to implement zzso of zzso The potential clinical relevance of zzso has zzso investigations to characterize its structural properties and biological function in melanoma zzso Over the last 10 years, the field of zzso research has seen tremendous zzso Specifically, a significant amount of information has been accumulated regarding zzso the structural characteristics of the zzso zzso its role in the biology of melanoma cells, and zzso the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the association between zzso immunity and survival zzso in melanoma patients zzso with zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the characteristics of the zzso in terms of its structure, zzso profile, tissue distribution, and similarities with its counterparts in other animal zzso Additionally, we discuss the role the zzso plays in melanoma cell biology with emphasis on the recently identified signal zzso pathways triggered by the zzso Finally, we discuss the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of zzso zzso on the clinical course of the disease in patients with zzso
