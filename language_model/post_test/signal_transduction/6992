The zzso zzso has emerged as an attractive model system to study stem cell zzso zzso studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of how the signaling pathways integrate to regulate zzso stem cells zzso yet, whether the zzso are involved in zzso zzso and maintenance is zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso is expressed specifically at high levels in zzso zzso precursor cells (including zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells while at extremely low levels in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso results in increase of the division of the zzso precursor cells, whereas loss of zzso zzso decreases their zzso The mechanical studies show that zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso while it is zzso for zzso and zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso More interestingly, we find that zzso zzso is not required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealing a novel mechanism by which the zzso signaling zzso specifies its zzso targets in specific tissue to exhibit its biological zzso
