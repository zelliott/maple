The zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates diverse zzso functions including cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute one branch of the zzso zzso that has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac differentiated growth, although the downstream mechanisms zzso zzso signaling affects this process are not well zzso Here we performed a zzso zzso screen with zzso bait and a cardiac zzso library to identify novel proteins involved in regulating zzso signaling in zzso This screen identified the zzso factor zzso as an zzso interacting protein in both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso at the level of the zzso and interestingly, zzso zzso more efficiently with the activated form of zzso than with the zzso zzso zzso also zzso with zzso and zzso but not with the muscle zzso zzso Moreover, at least two zzso zzso in zzso were required to mediate efficient interaction with zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso did not influence zzso zzso nor was zzso directly zzso by zzso However, zzso inhibited the ability of activated zzso to reside within the nucleus, thus blocking zzso zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso Finally, zzso partially antagonized the cardiac zzso response induced by activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso serves a zzso function in zzso through its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso
