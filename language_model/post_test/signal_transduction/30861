This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of zzso a cholesterol-lowering agent, on the zzso signaling zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in rats after traumatic brain injury zzso Adult male zzso rats were divided into three groups: zzso sham group zzso zzso zzso zzso saline control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Controlled cortical impact zzso injury was performed over the left zzso zzso zzso was administered orally at a dose of 1 zzso starting at day 1 after zzso and then daily for 14 zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso into zzso A modified Morris Water zzso zzso task was performed between 31 and 35 days after treatment to test spatial memory zzso zzso zzso Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso was zzso to investigate the changes in the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were employed to measure vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso were performed to detect the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso treatment increases zzso of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso response zzso proteins zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso increases cell proliferation and differentiation in the zzso and enhances the recovery of spatial zzso These data suggest that the zzso effect of zzso may be zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, subsequently zzso expression of growth factors and inducing zzso in the zzso of the zzso thereby leading to restoration of cognitive function after zzso in zzso
