zzso acts on the zzso zzso zzso zzso where sympathetic zzso zzso are located, to elicit zzso effects via an zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated in the present study zzso mechanism on cardiovascular effects following zzso of zzso in the zzso and delineated the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso 

In male zzso rats maintained under zzso zzso changes in zzso pressure, heart rate and sympathetic zzso zzso tone were examined after zzso zzso into zzso of zzso zzso or a selective zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso in the induced cardiovascular effects were studied using pharmacological tools of zzso or zzso gene manipulation with zzso zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso 

Similar to zzso (1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 or 5 zzso into bilateral zzso evoked zzso zzso and reduction in sympathetic zzso zzso zzso These zzso effects of zzso (2 zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (5 zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso D (5 or zzso Gene transfer by zzso into bilateral zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso zzso reversed the zzso effects of zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso effects following zzso of zzso in zzso are zzso by zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso This study provides new insight in the zzso signaling zzso involved in central zzso functions of zzso
