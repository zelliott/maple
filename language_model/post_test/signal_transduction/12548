zzso zzso involving zzso transformation specific zzso family zzso factors were recently defined as the most common genetic zzso in human prostate zzso Despite their zzso it is unclear what quantitative role they play in either initiation or progression of the zzso Using a zzso zzso and zzso cell prostate zzso approach, we find that acutely increased expression of zzso proteins in adult zzso prostate zzso cells is sufficient to induce the formation of zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not progression to zzso However, combined expression of zzso with additional genetic zzso associated with human prostate cancer can lead to aggressive zzso Although zzso zzso does not cooperate with loss of the tumor zzso zzso it does collaborate with zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso to produce a zzso zzso Most striking is our finding that zzso of zzso zzso zzso does not give rise to any zzso zzso but when combined with high levels of zzso it promotes the development of a more poorly zzso invasive zzso These findings suggest that in human prostate cancer, the most potent function of zzso gene zzso may be to zzso with alternative genetic events and provide different pathways for zzso production and invasive zzso Our results provide direct evidence for selective cooperating events in zzso prostate zzso and offer a rational basis for combined therapeutic interventions against multiple zzso pathways in prostate zzso
