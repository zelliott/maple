The kidney plays an important role in salt and blood pressure zzso zzso In previous studies, zzso in the genes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso which all regulate zzso sodium zzso have been associated with increased zzso However, findings have been zzso We tested whether this is because of zzso interactions between the effects of zzso in these zzso We assessed the single and combined effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso response to an acute Na load zzso zzso zzso decrease after 1 month of treatment with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and ambulatory 24-hour zzso zzso zzso the zzso showed modest effects on some of the studied zzso We found the zzso zzso zzso to be zzso for the effects of zzso of the other zzso In zzso the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a consistent effect on zzso Na handling zzso and acute zzso response to a saline infusion zzso zzso lowering after zzso treatment zzso and nocturnal zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso pathways influences the effects of zzso in these genes on zzso zzso zzso Relatively common zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes when present in combination may have significant effects on zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso response to zzso
