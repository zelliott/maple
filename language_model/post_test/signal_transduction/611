zzso toxin is the most toxic zzso and both humans and animals suffer from several pathological conditions after consumption of zzso contaminated with zzso We investigated the molecular mechanism of zzso toxin induced zzso and cell death in zzso zzso zzso toxin at zzso of 10 zzso caused time dependent increase in zzso as assessed by dye zzso zzso leakage and zzso zzso The toxin caused generation of zzso oxygen species as early as 30 zzso followed by significant depletion of zzso levels and increased zzso zzso The results indicate zzso stress as underlying mechanism of zzso Single stranded DNA damage after zzso treatment was observed as early as 2 and zzso by DNA diffusion zzso The cells exhibited zzso zzso like condensed zzso and nuclear fragmentation after zzso of zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso stress and DNA damage a time dependent increase in expression level of zzso protein was zzso The increase in zzso ratio indicated shift in response, in zzso of zzso process in zzso toxin treated zzso Western zzso analysis showed increase in levels of zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso leading to DNA fragmentation and zzso In addition to zzso pathway, our results showed involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso Broad spectrum zzso inhibitor zzso could partially protect the cells from DNA damage but could not inhibit zzso induced zzso DNA fragmentation beyond 4 zzso zzso of the study clearly show that zzso stress is the underlying mechanism by which zzso toxin causes DNA damage and zzso
