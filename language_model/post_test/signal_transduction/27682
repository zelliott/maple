zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso have been suggested to have crucial roles in suppressing zzso in several classes of zzso However, few studies have conducted a long-term investigation of either zzso activity, many studies relying instead on use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When we added zzso or zzso to sympathetic zzso zzso in the presence of nerve growth factor zzso was very slow compared to that obtained by zzso zzso However, expression of a zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso induced zzso in a significant proportion of the zzso To understand this zzso we investigated more closely the regulation of zzso activity by zzso zzso stimulation induced a rapid increase in zzso activity which was sustained at approximately zzso up to 24 zzso zzso zzso was also rapidly activated by zzso However, zzso of zzso which completely blocked zzso zzso activity in the zzso inhibited no more than zzso of cellular zzso zzso Similarly, approximately 50% of zzso zzso zzso activity remained elevated at zzso of zzso which completely blocked zzso zzso a process known to be zzso zzso zzso We suggest that a proportion of the sustained zzso activity induced by zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso These results raise a cautionary note as to the usefulness of zzso or zzso as tools to dissect the role of zzso in zzso zzso
