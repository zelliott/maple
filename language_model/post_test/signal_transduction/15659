Changes in tissue zzso acquisition of invasive cell zzso and tumor formation can often be linked to the loss of zzso cell zzso In zzso the grade of zzso zzso with impaired cell zzso In zzso lethal giant larvae zzso discs large zzso and zzso which are components of the zzso zzso cell polarity machinery, act as tumor zzso and zzso of this evolutionary zzso zzso are lost in human zzso with high zzso However, a zzso link between zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso genes remains to be fully explored at the zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso shares two key cellular and molecular features of zzso zzso cell autonomous zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells including the differential expression of several regulators of zzso Further, we found that zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells is promoted by zzso zzso a zzso of high significance in human zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is facilitated specifically by zzso zzso zzso zzso and not via zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data reveal that zzso functions as a tumor zzso gene in zzso establishing zzso zzso zzso as a valuable cancer zzso
