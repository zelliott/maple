The zzso cells zzso first become identifiable in zzso zzso after the zzso cells zzso begin to zzso It remains unknown when the zzso first respond to zzso and acquire the capacity to produce zzso The signal initiating zzso differentiation is also unknown since zzso cells do not contain zzso zzso Since the first wave of zzso development in the rat occurs zzso we correlated the function of dispersed zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats with the zzso differentiation of zzso The largest zzso in zzso from 4-day-old rats were primary zzso without associated zzso These cells were unable to produce zzso or steroids in zzso in response to zzso At 5 days, the first zzso were associated with zzso containing 2-3 layers of zzso These cells were responsive to zzso producing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso increased progressively through 10 days of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were localized exclusively to the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso were expressed prior to the time the zzso become responsive to zzso or zzso zzso To determine the source of the signal regulating zzso zzso dispersed cells from 4-day-old rat zzso that were unresponsive to zzso were treated with zzso zzso medium containing zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso activity zzso zzso production and expression of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that a zzso signal from the zzso zzso can initiate zzso differentiation prior to expression of zzso zzso zzso become responsive to zzso and capable of producing zzso zzso with zzso zzso
