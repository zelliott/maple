Previous studies have shown that zzso signaling zzso plays a vital role in zzso zzso The present study attempts to evaluate whether zzso signaling zzso might be responsible for the zzso in zzso zzso Male zzso rats underwent 30 zzso of left anterior descending coronary artery zzso and 2 h of zzso One hundred zzso rats were zzso into six groups: sham, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso were zzso respectively, 10 and 5 zzso before zzso zzso zzso size; number of zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso protein were zzso It was found that Post and zzso + zzso reduced zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso and zzso index of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso abolished the zzso of zzso zzso Post and zzso + zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and nucleus, and zzso expression versus zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso could induce zzso protection via zzso signaling pathway, zzso of which results in zzso of zzso and zzso of its target genes zzso
