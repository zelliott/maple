zzso muscle cells zzso death promotes zzso zzso necrosis and plaque zzso We investigated the potential mechanisms of rat zzso death in response to excess free cholesterol zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to establish zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso network and zzso zzso zzso was observed after zzso incubation by transient zzso After treated for zzso enhanced cell death was noted as detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso death was associated with markedly decreased zzso zzso potential zzso as well as zzso of cellular zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso We also investigated possible signaling pathways involved in excess zzso cell death and found that unfolded protein response zzso was zzso with increased cellular zzso expression and release of zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggested that zzso might trigger zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso signals might be implicated in these lethal zzso
