We originally discovered the serum and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as a novel protein zzso that is under acute zzso control by serum and zzso An expanding set of cell surface zzso nuclear zzso and cellular stress pathways has been shown to target zzso which has implicated this regulated signaling zzso in a variety of biological zzso Compared to most other protein zzso a distinguishing feature of zzso is the stringent zzso regulation of its transcription, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression is regulated during discrete zzso zzso and during normal and abnormal zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso promoter reveals many potential zzso factor sites that potentially account for the zzso changes in zzso transcript expression observed in a variety of cell systems, although, the direct stimulus regulation of zzso promoter activity has been established only for zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso stimulating zzso In the systems tested to date, hormones, growth factors and environmental cues induce expression of a zzso active zzso It is now well established that the zzso activity of zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso cascade which produces a zzso active zzso A critical third level of regulation is the zzso control of zzso zzso zzso The zzso shuttling of zzso is regulated by a nuclear zzso signal zzso that binds to the zzso nuclear import zzso Modeling of the 3-D structure of the central region of zzso that includes the zzso domain predicts that the zzso is located at an external surface of the zzso Thus, multiple signal zzso pathways zzso on zzso to control its zzso function and access to its zzso and zzso zzso
