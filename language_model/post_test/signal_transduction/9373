zzso play diverse roles in plant growth and zzso Plants deficient in zzso zzso zzso or defective in signal zzso show many abnormal zzso zzso indicating the importance of both zzso zzso and the signaling zzso in regulating these biological zzso Recently, using zzso zzso zzso cell biology, and many other approaches, more components involved in the zzso signaling zzso were zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and molecular mechanisms by which zzso regulate various aspects of plant development, are being zzso These include root development, zzso and zzso development and formation, stem zzso zzso zzso and cellulose zzso suggesting that the biological functions of zzso are far beyond promoting cell zzso This review will focus on the up-to-date zzso about regulatory mechanisms of the zzso signaling zzso and the zzso and molecular mechanisms zzso zzso regulate plant growth and zzso
