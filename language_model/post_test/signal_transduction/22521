zzso dissection of the signaling pathways that zzso complex biological responses in the zzso zzso is limited by the difficulty of zzso large numbers of mouse zzso zzso cells, and by the inability of zzso acid interference zzso zzso approaches to fully zzso gene zzso Here we describe a method for the generation of zzso immortalized zzso zzso cells with defined genetic zzso and we show how such cells can be used to investigate complex signal zzso processes using the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso as an zzso 

We zzso the previously described zzso transgenic mouse zzso which expresses a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso large zzso zzso with mice of differing zzso zzso A panel of zzso immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso cultures were derived from the virgin zzso zzso of offspring of these crosses and used to assess the zzso dependency of different biological responses to zzso 

zzso could be zzso indefinitely at zzso temperatures and had a stable zzso zzso resembling primary zzso zzso cells with respect to several criteria, including responsiveness to zzso Using this panel of cells, we demonstrated that zzso but not zzso is necessary for zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso responses, whereas either zzso can support zzso invasion as long as a threshold level of total zzso is zzso 

This work demonstrates the practicality and utility of generating zzso immortalized zzso zzso cell lines from genetically modified zzso for detailed investigation of complex signaling pathways in the zzso zzso
