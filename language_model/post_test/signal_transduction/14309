zzso diet is associated with the development of zzso and other zzso diseases in zzso zzso mechanisms, functional profiles, and molecular markers are only starting to be zzso Here, we explored the zzso and molecular impact of maternal Western-style diet on the liver of male and female zzso zzso zzso were exposed to either a low zzso cholesterol diet zzso or a Western-style high zzso cholesterol diet zzso for six weeks before zzso as well as during gestation and zzso zzso and offspring were sacrificed at zzso day 14, and body, liver, and blood parameters were zzso The impact of maternal zzso on the zzso liver gene expression was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso male offspring had significantly higher body weight upon maternal zzso In offspring of both sexes of zzso zzso liver and blood zzso as well as zzso gene expression profiles were zzso In total, zzso and zzso genes were zzso expressed in liver zzso of males and zzso zzso Only zzso of these significantly changed genes overlapped in both zzso In zzso in particular zzso of gene expression with respect to zzso functions and processes were observed, such as zzso zzso In zzso mainly genes important for zzso zzso including cholesterol zzso were zzso We conclude that maternal zzso affects zzso parameters and zzso substantial changes in the molecular profile of the liver in zzso zzso zzso the observed biological responses of the offspring reveal pronounced zzso
