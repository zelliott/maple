In previous studies, we showed that zzso II zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 distinct signal zzso pathways in a mixed population of human cortical zzso zzso This suggested that different populations of zzso could be zzso with respect to their expression of zzso II receptors or the responses to which these receptors are zzso To compare the responses which are activated by zzso II and its zzso peptides in zzso from different brain regions, we measured zzso C zzso activity and zzso release in isolated zzso from 4 different areas of zzso rat zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso II activated a zzso zzso in a zzso manner with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was coupled to an zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso as demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso release by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso II and zzso also released zzso from zzso and zzso zzso measured as the release of its stable zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso II did not activate zzso or release zzso in zzso isolated from the zzso or zzso In addition, zzso did not stimulate the release of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso from any of the zzso rat brain regions zzso However, zzso (1 zzso activated zzso or released zzso in zzso isolated from all 4 brain zzso These results suggest that zzso II receptors on zzso zzso activate distinct signal zzso mechanisms in response to different zzso zzso
