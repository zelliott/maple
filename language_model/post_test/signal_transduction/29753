The zzso zzso zzso is critical to the formation of an zzso zzso after zzso injury, but the mechanisms by which it zzso a zzso zzso remain zzso Here, we show that zzso regulates the zzso of zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which zzso cellular zzso and migration via effects on zzso and its interactions with focal zzso zzso myosin, and zzso adapter proteins of the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso induced cortical reorganization of zzso and zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso light chain 2, and zzso zzso targeting zzso 1 in primary human zzso and that all of these effects were zzso by zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this effect was zzso via a zzso zzso Next, we used a zzso zzso zzso to confirm directly that zzso zzso zzso and further demonstrated that a zzso active zzso construct rescued zzso from developing an zzso zzso zzso These data zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso in the generation of a zzso zzso and we suggest that interventions targeted at this level may facilitate manipulation of the zzso zzso in inflammatory disorders of the human zzso
