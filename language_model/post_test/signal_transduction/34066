Human bone zzso zzso stem cells are zzso cells with enormous potential for cellular zzso zzso those zzso that induce human bone zzso zzso stem cell proliferation and zzso the signaling networks involved will encourage clinical efforts exploiting such zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso growth zzso and basic zzso growth factor induce human bone zzso zzso stem cell zzso zzso growth zzso induced human bone zzso zzso stem cell proliferation via complete zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso inducing signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 was required for signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso in response to zzso growth zzso Furthermore, zzso growth zzso was shown to promote nuclear zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, basic zzso growth zzso human bone zzso zzso stem cell proliferation was zzso via the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso without involvement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and basic zzso growth factor induced human bone zzso zzso stem cell proliferation without affecting their zzso differentiation zzso Together, our study highlights the role of several growth factors in human bone zzso zzso stem cell proliferation and the signaling pathways involved in the zzso This information is crucial for achieving a better control over the human bone zzso zzso stem cell expansion zzso
