Gene targeting studies indicate that sonic zzso zzso signaling plays an essential role during zzso zzso Because numerous zzso derivatives zzso teeth, zzso zzso zzso are absent in zzso zzso mice and the embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso develops from the zzso arch, we zzso that zzso signaling is important for embryonic zzso zzso To address this question, we first determined the zzso distribution of zzso two zzso zzso patched 1 zzso and zzso zzso which act as a negative or a positive regulator of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 3 zzso factor, which is downstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 suggests that zzso signaling may act within the zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso in our embryonic day zzso zzso zzso zzso mice can be characterized as zzso that is, it fails to progress to zzso stages beyond the Early zzso ( approximately zzso In a complementary set of experiments, we used organ culture to evaluate the effect of enhanced or zzso zzso signaling on embryonic zzso development in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bud zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a significant zzso increase in branching zzso compared with control zzso Furthermore, by using zzso a zzso zzso that specifically zzso the zzso pathway, to abrogate zzso zzso signaling in zzso we found a significant decrease in branching in zzso zzso compared with controls, as well as a significant decrease in zzso cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso signaling plays an essential role during embryonic zzso branching zzso zzso zzso zzso supplementation in zzso zzso the abnormal zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso of a zzso but zzso downstream signaling zzso can compensate for diminished zzso signaling and restore embryonic zzso branching zzso
