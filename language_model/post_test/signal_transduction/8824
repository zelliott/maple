Previous studies from our group investigated the zzso property of zzso zzso a synthetic compound zzso from natural precursor zzso zzso against zzso response induced by zzso acid and zzso Here, we investigated some of the mechanisms of action underlying the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso given zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso and long-lasting zzso of zzso zzso visceral zzso with mean zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso paw licking, zzso zzso caused significant and zzso zzso of both zzso responses, with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso also reduced significantly the zzso caused by zzso injection of zzso substance P and zzso with inhibitions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso caused by zzso zzso in the zzso acid test was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso of mice with zzso but seems to involve mechanisms independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso system, since it was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso zzso reduced zzso and mechanical zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in rats, without affecting similar responses caused by zzso zzso Taken together, the present results shown that zzso zzso produces zzso and zzso effects, through an interaction with zzso fibers and the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
