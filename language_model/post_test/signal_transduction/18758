This review summarizes the experimental data demonstrating the fundamental role of zzso and their G zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso with special emphasis on their function at zzso 

zzso products of the zzso zzso were originally identified as zzso zzso peptides with the ability to bind G zzso zzso zzso In late 2003, zzso zzso of the zzso gene were found in patients suffering from zzso zzso This finding kicked off the analysis of the role of the zzso system in the control of zzso zzso are very potent zzso of zzso zzso primarily through stimulation of zzso hormone zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso as well as increased zzso zzso are detected at the zzso during zzso development, and zzso of zzso by administration of zzso is sufficient to induce precocious zzso of the zzso axis in immature zzso and zzso zzso zzso also functions as an essential zzso for peripheral zzso including zzso steroids and nutritional signals, controlling zzso hormone and zzso zzso 

zzso and their putative zzso zzso have recently emerged as indispensable factors for zzso development, with a key role as zzso of zzso hormone release zzso and, zzso of zzso zzso
