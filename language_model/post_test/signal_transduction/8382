zzso factor family 3 zzso is zzso in zzso The zzso improves the mechanical and chemical resistance of zzso and it may act as a zzso signal for oral zzso during wound zzso This study aimed to identify novel functions of zzso in oral zzso To achieve this, we used zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to compare zzso and zzso oral zzso Analysis of the zzso array indicated that zzso signals through the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and through the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso stimulation induced changes in the expression of genes functionally related to cell zzso cell growth and zzso and cell zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction zzso results indicated that the zzso of some zzso genes zzso was zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso were zzso zzso by zzso zzso Together, the results of the zzso indicate that zzso is a zzso factor in pathways regulating cell survival, cell growth and zzso and cell migration of oral zzso zzso factor family 3 may therefore promote oral wound healing and it should be considered for the treatment of oral zzso diseases, or of other zzso
