Cellular zzso and zzso are two metabolically related and seemingly synergistic processes that are involved in tissue maintenance and zzso zzso protection, and age-related zzso Despite this apparent zzso zzso can inhibit zzso in certain zzso Here, we describe zzso relationships in human zzso cells by comparing zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultures and zzso skin cells at various stages of zzso Using western zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we determined the amounts of zzso zzso in aged cells compared to young ones, in parallel with zzso activity at neutral pH zzso zzso zzso zzso found to be a good indicator of cellular zzso We observed increased levels of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both in cell cultures at advanced passages and in skin cells of aged donors (above 45 zzso Furthermore, we found that while the zzso zzso increased, the zzso zzso zzso In spite of this, the extent of spontaneous zzso did not change in zzso zzso zzso The cells, however, became notably more susceptible to zzso when kept in exhausted growth zzso or upon zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our results are consistent with recent findings in zzso zzso showing that the zzso zzso is enhanced at zzso
