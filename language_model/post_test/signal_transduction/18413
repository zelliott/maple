An zzso method is introduced for evaluating the performance of neural zzso zzso The method addresses a critical question that arises during the course of the development and validation of zzso models: is a given model near optimal in terms of its accuracy in predicting the zzso responses of a neural system, or can the zzso accuracy be improved significantly by further model development? The evaluation method is based on a derivation of the minimum zzso error between actual responses and modeled zzso It is formulated as a comparison between the zzso error of the candidate model and the theoretical minimum zzso error zzso through an optimal model for the zzso However, no a zzso information about the nature of the optimal model is zzso The theoretically minimum error is determined solely from the zzso function between pairs of system responses to repeated presentations of the same dynamic zzso Thus, the performance of the candidate model is judged against the performance of an optimal model rather than against that of an arbitrarily assumed zzso Using this zzso we evaluated a linear model for neural zzso by zzso cells in the cricket zzso zzso At low stimulus zzso the zzso linear model of zzso by single cells was found to be nearly zzso even though the zzso between zzso pairs (a commonly used measure of system zzso was zzso In this zzso regime, the mean square error of the linear model was on the order of the power of the cell zzso In contrast, at higher stimulus zzso the linear model was not an accurate representation of neural zzso even though the zzso zzso was substantially higher than in the zzso zzso
