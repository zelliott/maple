Treatment of zzso melanoma with combined zzso and zzso which target zzso and the downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, improves zzso survival and response rates compared with zzso zzso zzso of clinical resistance to combined zzso zzso are zzso We performed zzso sequencing zzso and zzso sequencing zzso on zzso and drug-resistant tumors from five patients with acquired resistance to zzso In three of these patients, we identified additional zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the zzso zzso including a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to combined zzso zzso in zzso but remained sensitive to zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The continued zzso zzso resistance identified in these patients suggests that alternative dosing of current agents, more potent zzso zzso and/or zzso of the downstream zzso zzso may be needed for durable control of zzso zzso
