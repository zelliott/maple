There are several potential cellular and molecular pathways zzso cardiovascular risk factors act through very specific signal zzso pathways in the formation of zzso as seen often in the zzso zzso Many examples point to multiple zzso defects in the insulin signaling zzso in vascular zzso however, there are differences in the insulin zzso zzso in vascular tissue compared with skeletal muscle or zzso In addition to insulin zzso insulin may affect zzso changes in the vascular cells via stimulation of zzso growth zzso receptors and their signaling zzso zzso also causes zzso of the vascular zzso system in both vascular smooth muscle cells and zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso system leads to increased cell growth and contributes to the cause of zzso The fact that agents that inhibit the zzso system also block zzso zzso system expression and cell growth reinforces the potential implication of a vascular zzso system zzso Finally, novel substances such as the zzso factors produced from fat cells, reveal new risk factors in the zzso syndrome and offer further evidence for a link between insulin resistance and accelerated zzso
