zzso acids are zzso molecules zzso from cholesterol exclusively in the liver that are essential for effective zzso of dietary zzso In addition to this zzso zzso zzso acids act as zzso molecules that control their own metabolism by zzso the nuclear zzso zzso X zzso 

Recent work demonstrates that zzso X zzso exerts zzso control beyond zzso acid zzso notably effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso X zzso influences insulin sensitivity of zzso that are not part of the zzso zzso for example, zzso zzso Certain zzso effects in the liver appear to be zzso via zzso X zzso release of an zzso growth zzso In addition, novel zzso pathways independent of zzso X zzso have been identified that may contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso X zzso represents a potentially attractive target for treatment of various aspects of the zzso syndrome and for prevention of zzso Yet, in view of its zzso effects and apparent zzso it is evident that successful interference of the zzso X zzso zzso system will require the development of zzso and/or zzso zzso X zzso zzso and extensive testing in human models of zzso
