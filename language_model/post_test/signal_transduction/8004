The bone disease in multiple myeloma is caused by an zzso of bone formation from bone zzso A key difference between patients with and patients without zzso zzso is that the latter have fewer and less active zzso zzso growth factor zzso is often produced by myeloma cells and is found at high zzso in the bone zzso of patients with multiple zzso Here we show that zzso inhibited bone zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso inhibited zzso expression of alkaline zzso in human zzso stem cells zzso and the zzso zzso cell line zzso as well as zzso by zzso Furthermore, the expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso promoted proliferation of zzso and the zzso halt in proliferation was overridden by zzso keeping the cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso providing a possible explanation of how zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso data were supported by the observation of a negative correlation between zzso and a marker of zzso activity, zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso from 34 patients with zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso bone formation in multiple zzso
