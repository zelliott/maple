The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to mediate the zzso activity through zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso in retinal rod zzso cells is zzso through the zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso to zzso We also found that zzso a zzso zzso enhanced the binding of zzso to zzso We found a zzso targeting signal in zzso and our study suggests that zzso zzso to zzso could be zzso through zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso interaction in zzso zzso of zzso signaling has been associated with zzso diseases of zzso zzso diabetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2, and agents that enhance the binding interaction between zzso and zzso may have therapeutic potential against these zzso zzso
