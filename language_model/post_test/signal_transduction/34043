G protein zzso are zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and the set of the zzso modifications is indispensable for the function of the zzso G protein zzso zzso To explore zzso molecular zzso we investigated molecular targets of a zzso analogue that was engineered to have a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was further subjected to modification by zzso at the zzso zzso group, which copies a complete set of the known zzso modifications of zzso zzso labeling experiment with the zzso zzso analogue in its free form indicated that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso In the zzso zzso complex, the zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in addition to concurrent affinity labeling of zzso When zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in rod outer segment zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with not only zzso and zzso but also zzso and membrane zzso The zzso zzso species was analyzed by zzso employing a variety of zzso zzso which revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso as selective zzso for zzso interaction in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso group of zzso plays an active role in zzso and zzso interactions and suggest that the zzso interaction may support the efficient formation of the signaling zzso complex between zzso and zzso
