zzso is a member of the zzso zzso factor family that is highly enriched in zzso cells zzso To further define the role of zzso in regulating zzso function, we evaluated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso formation in zzso collagen zzso zzso of zzso using zzso completely interferes with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify potential downstream gene targets of zzso In particular, we identified zzso as the zzso zzso family member that is closely related to zzso as a target of zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso led to a zzso reduction in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso could bind to functional sites in the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso similarly resulted in a marked reduction in the ability of zzso to form zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso during zzso zzso formation was associated with a marked increase in zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso and zzso zzso and their downstream zzso Finally, in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso exhibits a highly zzso expression pattern in several different zzso including the brain, heart, zzso and zzso
