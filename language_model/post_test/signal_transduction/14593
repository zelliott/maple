zzso study has shown strong correlation between the zzso zzso zzso zzso infection and gastric zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso is not zzso In this review, we focused on the product of zzso gene A zzso one of the important zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein into the host gastric zzso cells through its zzso structure, type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso hijacks zzso signal zzso and causes pathological cellular response such as increased cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso change through different zzso zzso zzso has been shown to produce zzso oxygen species zzso in infected gastric zzso Although the main source of zzso production is possibly host zzso we propose novel source of zzso production in this zzso zzso itself can induce zzso production in gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso production in gastric zzso cells can cause DNA damage and thus might involve in gastric zzso zzso the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso is important for developing new strategies against gastric zzso
