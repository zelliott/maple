zzso zzso is a small ubiquitous and zzso protein having a zzso zzso within the zzso active site sequence zzso zzso is induced by a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and chemical zzso and has been shown to play crucial roles in the regulation of cellular responses such as gene zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso protects cells from zzso zzso by zzso stress in both in zzso and in zzso zzso The regulatory mechanism of zzso expression and activity is also being zzso Recently, zzso binding zzso zzso D3 zzso protein 1 zzso was identified as a negative regulator of zzso The analysis of zzso promoter region has revealed putative regulatory elements responsible for zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso functions may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
