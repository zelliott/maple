We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized on the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso towards the zzso during zzso of zzso zzso and is activated during this zzso zzso is also activated upon cell stimulation with the calcium zzso zzso but not with zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether the zzso zzso Lyn and zzso are activated under the same zzso Upon stimulation of human zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso only Lyn is zzso Cell stimulation with zzso zzso or zzso leads to simultaneous zzso of Lyn and zzso In cell zzso experiments with differentiated zzso cells, the zzso show a similar zzso zzso Both zzso zzso with zzso marker in two zzso that zzso at zzso g and zzso zzso Lyn is selectively activated in the zzso g zzso whereas zzso is activated in the zzso g fraction and distinct sets of zzso zzso proteins are found in these zzso The results suggest that these zzso exert their functional roles in distinct cellular compartments in human zzso zzso
