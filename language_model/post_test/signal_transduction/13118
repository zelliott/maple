Evidence is rapidly accumulating that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to that in zzso cells generate zzso oxygen species as signaling zzso in both zzso and vascular smooth zzso We therefore explored the possibility of such an zzso regulating growth of airway smooth muscle zzso zzso of human zzso cells in culture was inhibited by the antioxidants zzso and zzso and by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from human zzso cells generated zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso with a distinct preference for zzso instead of reduced zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso containing zzso generating O as a signaling zzso for cell zzso zzso of human zzso cells by reverse zzso chain reaction consistently demonstrated transcripts with sequences identical to those reported for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso reduced human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity with zzso prevented zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso form of the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced human zzso zzso These findings suggest that an zzso zzso containing zzso regulates zzso responsive human zzso zzso and that the zzso signals in part through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso
