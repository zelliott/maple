The primary zzso is a ubiquitous zzso present on most zzso zzso Malfunction of the zzso has been associated with various pathological disorders, many of which lead to zzso disorders in liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso have in kidney zzso cells been observed to generate zzso calcium in response to fluid flow, and disruption of proteins involved in this calcium signaling lead to zzso dominant zzso kidney disease, zzso a direct connection between calcium signaling and zzso zzso It has also been shown that there is a significant lag between the onset of flow and initiation of the calcium zzso The present study focuses on the mechanics of zzso zzso and the resulting calcium zzso zzso of real-time zzso movements in response to different types of applied flow showed that the zzso is fast compared with the initiation of calcium zzso zzso modeling of zzso and surrounding membrane was performed to deduce the relation between zzso and membrane zzso The results showed a delay in stress buildup that was similar to the delay in calcium zzso Our results thus indicate that the delay in calcium response upon zzso zzso is caused by mechanical properties of the cell zzso
