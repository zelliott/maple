The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in inflammation and regulation of immune responses, but the mechanisms of its signal zzso and cell zzso processes are incompletely zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso is known to function as an important second zzso zzso in the signaling zzso of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso by zzso we used an zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso cell line, which is defective in zzso accessory protein zzso zzso In this cell line zzso tumor necrosis factor induced zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso production, and the zzso of neutral zzso and acid zzso In contrast, stimulation with zzso resulted only in the zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, and zzso of zzso were not zzso zzso of this functionally defective zzso with zzso zzso restored these zzso These data suggest that zzso activity is strongly linked with the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and that zzso and zzso are activated by different zzso
