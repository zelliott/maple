Previous studies of the developing lens have shown that zzso signaling regulates differentiation of lens fiber cells by maintaining a zzso precursor pool in the anterior zzso However, whether zzso signaling is further required after the onset of fiber cell differentiation is not zzso This work investigates the role of zzso and zzso zzso in secondary fiber cell differentiation using rat lens zzso zzso undergoing zzso dependent differentiation in zzso zzso induced zzso expression and zzso signaling (as judged by the appearance of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso These changes were correlated with induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso a zzso switch characteristic of fiber cell zzso zzso of zzso was efficiently blocked by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso indicating a requirement for signaling through this zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Other growth factors that activate zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso of zzso signaling using gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso markedly decreased zzso expression of zzso demonstrating zzso lateral zzso In addition, zzso of zzso signaling reduced expression of zzso and the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso indicating a direct role for zzso signaling in secondary fiber cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso lateral induction of zzso is an essential component of zzso lens fiber cell zzso
