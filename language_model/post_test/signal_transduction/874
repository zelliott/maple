Although the long-term effects of zzso zzso acid zzso on zzso growth and differentiation have been zzso zzso nothing is known about its effect on synaptic zzso Here we show that zzso rapidly and specifically enhances the spontaneous zzso release at developing zzso zzso in zzso cell culture using zzso zzso zzso Acute addition of zzso zzso and zzso enhances the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents zzso Application of the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso or zzso zzso produced by zzso decomposition failed to provoke similar changes in zzso frequency, indicating the specificity of zzso zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso or zzso had no effect on zzso zzso frequency zzso Treating cells with pan zzso zzso zzso selective zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso the action of zzso These results suggest that zzso acts through the zzso of zzso to induce a zzso zzso increase in the frequency of spontaneous zzso release at developing zzso zzso
