zzso zzso models for aging with a wide range of zzso pathology are desirable to study molecular mechanisms of human zzso Recent studies have identified that zzso growth factor 23 zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso could generate multiple premature zzso features, including shortened zzso infertility, zzso zzso extensive soft tissue zzso skin zzso muscle zzso T cell zzso pulmonary zzso zzso abnormal mineral zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso The zzso similar in zzso zzso of two separate genetically altered mouse lines zzso that the premature zzso features may be partly regulated through a common signaling zzso involving both zzso and zzso such speculation is zzso supported by the observation that zzso requires zzso as a zzso to exert its zzso Despite about zzso higher serum levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso these mice show physical, zzso and zzso features similar to zzso zzso mice, but not as zzso transgenic zzso these observations suggest that widely encountered premature zzso features in zzso zzso mice are due to the inability of zzso to exert its zzso in absence of zzso The results of recent studies showing zzso as a zzso in zzso signaling consequently explains that the premature zzso features in zzso mice is not a primary cause, rather a consequence of lacking zzso zzso These zzso will help us to redefine the role of zzso as an aging zzso
