zzso cells are pivotal in innate immunity and play an important role in amplifying zzso zzso Nonetheless, they have long been known to be central to the initiation of allergic zzso This results from the zzso of the immune response zzso normally innocuous substances are recognized as zzso resulting in the production of zzso zzso to these zzso zzso and newly zzso inflammatory zzso zzso are released from the mast cell following zzso zzso of zzso zzso bound to the zzso receptors for zzso zzso Thus, the process by which the mast cell is able to interpret the engagement of zzso into the molecular events necessary for release of their allergic zzso is of considerable therapeutic zzso zzso these molecular events has led to the discovery of a functional class of proteins that are essential in organizing activated signaling molecules and in zzso and zzso their zzso These so-called zzso bind multiple signaling proteins and zzso them to specific cellular zzso such as the plasma zzso This organization is essential for normal mast cell zzso Here, we zzso the role of adapter proteins in mast cells focusing on the most recent advances toward understanding how these molecules work upon zzso zzso
