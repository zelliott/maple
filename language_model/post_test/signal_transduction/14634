zzso growth factor beta zzso can zzso the activity of various zzso zzso However, how this zzso may mediate zzso zzso zzso remains zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso in the regulation of cell survival in breast zzso zzso cells and zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso Our results show that zzso of zzso zzso signaling with the expression of a dominant negative type II zzso zzso zzso or the treatment with a zzso type I zzso inhibitor significantly increased zzso in zzso cell, but not in zzso The expression of zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso whereas increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, there was no or little change of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso after the expression of zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso control cell induced zzso whereas restoration of zzso activity in zzso zzso cell reduced zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso activity also inhibited zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso signaling can enhance the survival of zzso cells by maintaining the level of active zzso high and the level of active zzso zzso Furthermore, the survival properties of zzso zzso appear related to transformation supporting the notion that it may be a potential target for cancer zzso
