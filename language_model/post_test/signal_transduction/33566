The zzso system plays an important role in inflammation and cancer zzso although the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly zzso As determined using comparative zzso profiling studies of cultured zzso zzso cells versus blood vascular zzso cells, growth hormone zzso was expressed at much higher levels in zzso zzso cells than in blood vascular zzso zzso These findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso Growth hormone induced in zzso zzso zzso tube formation, and migration of zzso zzso cells, and the zzso effect was independent of vascular zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso Growth hormone also inhibited serum zzso zzso zzso cell zzso No major zzso of zzso vessels were detected in the normal skin of bovine growth zzso zzso However, transgenic delivery of growth hormone accelerated zzso vessel zzso into the zzso tissue of zzso skin wounds, and zzso delivery of growth hormone resulted in enlargement and enhanced proliferation of zzso zzso vessels in zzso zzso These results identify growth hormone as a novel zzso zzso
