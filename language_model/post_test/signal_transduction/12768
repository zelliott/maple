Recently, we have described a zzso deletion zzso of the human insulin zzso zzso delta zzso that exhibits normal zzso zzso activity and zzso but is inefficient in stimulating zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Levy, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lipari, zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we report that despite this zzso in zzso zzso the truncated zzso exhibits zzso zzso activity compared to normal zzso These results were verified in three independently isolated clones of zzso 1 zzso zzso with the zzso delta CT zzso The increase in insulin sensitivity of zzso stimulation was zzso to the number of zzso delta CT receptors expressed on the zzso By contrast, only the cells with normal receptors and none of the zzso delta CT clones exhibit increased sensitivity for a zzso action of insulin, the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of cells by other zzso and zzso analysis confirm that the enhanced zzso effects seen in zzso delta CT cells are attributable only to the presence of the truncated insulin zzso These receptors mediate the zzso zzso of a number of cellular zzso and the pattern of these zzso differs zzso from that seen in cells with normal zzso We zzso 1) The zzso zzso plays a role in signaling zzso actions of insulin, perhaps through its recognition of zzso for the zzso zzso 2) By contrast, the zzso zzso is an zzso regulator of zzso and removal of the terminal 43 zzso acids converts the zzso from a moderately active growth zzso to a very active zzso 3) The changes seen in zzso activities of the zzso delta CT zzso are associated with quantitative changes in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
