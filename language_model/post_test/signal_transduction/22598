The T cell zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed either as a zzso zzso of two zzso zzso or a zzso of zzso and zzso These receptors interact with zzso such as major zzso complex zzso class I, on the outside of the cell, with proteins inside the cell, such as the zzso zzso zzso and possibly with proteins on the same zzso The molecular details describing such protein interactions can shed light on how the proteins function and the functional differences between the two forms of zzso Crystal structures, zzso analysis, affinity zzso and other approaches are providing those zzso
