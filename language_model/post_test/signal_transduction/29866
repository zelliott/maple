In the last decade, it has become recognized that zzso oxygen species zzso play important roles in the multiple biological processes involved in the zzso of chronic inflammation such as cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is maintained by balancing the production of zzso with their removal through cellular zzso defense zzso The zzso response element zzso is a zzso DNA regulatory element located in the regulatory regions of multiple genes including phase II zzso zzso as well as zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the primary zzso factor that binds to the zzso and through zzso with other zzso containing zzso factors, activates the expression of these zzso It is evident that zzso of zzso genes contributes to the regulation of cellular zzso defense zzso More importantly, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that zzso of these zzso genes has profound effects on immune and inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes can suppress inflammatory responses, whereas decreased expression of these genes results in zzso disease and enhanced inflammatory responses to zzso zzso Thus, coordinate induction of zzso genes through zzso zzso may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of immune and inflammatory zzso
