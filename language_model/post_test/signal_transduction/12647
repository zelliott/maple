zzso response to zzso varies widely between individuals but shows zzso consistency and strong zzso The genetic basis of this variation has not been properly zzso We therefore systematically measured the effect on function of sequence variation in 97 candidate genes in the collagen and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of the genes in 48 European DNA samples nearly doubled the number of known single zzso zzso zzso and informed the selection of zzso zzso for zzso in 500 healthy Northern European subjects with known zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso This identified 17 novel associations with zzso function zzso zzso zzso accounting for approximately zzso of the variation in zzso Further investigations with zzso of known zzso explored the mechanisms behind some of the zzso zzso in zzso associated with increased zzso response to zzso and increased zzso protein expression after zzso zzso The minor zzso of a 3' untranslated region zzso zzso zzso in zzso was associated with higher protein expression zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso exposure after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the minor zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso modified zzso levels after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso These data provide novel insights into key hubs within zzso signaling zzso
