Development of the zzso within zzso depends on unknown signals from the neural zzso The present study tested the ability of basic zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso to promote zzso in stage 10-14 chick zzso zzso utilizing 72 hour zzso zzso Each of these factors alone and the combination of zzso with zzso had limited to no zzso activity, but the combination of zzso with zzso demonstrated a potent zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of stage zzso zzso zzso plate zzso treated with zzso plus zzso exhibited zzso heavy chain zzso cells zzso per zzso whereas only zzso of similarly treated zzso responded with an average of 5 zzso zzso Thus at stage zzso there are zzso differences in zzso responsiveness with the zzso (more zzso zzso zzso being more zzso responsive to these factors than are zzso It was also discovered that zzso of stage zzso zzso zzso plate zzso exhibited several zzso cells even when cultured without added growth factors, further demonstrating a different zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso Stage zzso zzso zzso also exhibited a zzso response to zzso but, unlike stage zzso zzso both zzso and zzso plate exhibited a strong zzso A zzso mechanism for the zzso effect is suggested by the finding that only zzso was required during the first 12 hours of culture, whereas zzso plus a zzso factor were required for the remainder of the zzso The biological relevance of the findings with zzso is underscored by the observation that a zzso zzso to zzso inhibited zzso signaling from the zzso neural zzso However, a zzso zzso that can neutralize the three factors zzso zzso and zzso did not block zzso signals from the neural tube, raising the possibility that another zzso family member may be involved in zzso
