The function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains ambiguous largely because of the lack of selective zzso zzso zzso To investigate the function and zzso signaling of zzso zzso we established a zzso zzso which expresses the human zzso zzso zzso in a zzso producing cell zzso In this model, we find that the zzso zzso functions as an zzso controlling neurotransmitter zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, a zzso zzso preferring zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso release in zzso cells but not in the control cell zzso This effect was prevented by zzso zzso preferring zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso receptors significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso and leads to transient increases in zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 32 zzso and zzso Because we observed differences in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso after zzso zzso we zzso the ability of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to influence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In a complimentary experiment, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A also attenuated zzso zzso zzso of zzso release indicating that this phenomenon acts through zzso and zzso zzso 1, and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso In support of previous data that zzso zzso receptors reduce zzso release from nerve zzso the current results demonstrate that zzso zzso receptors function as zzso to inhibit zzso release and that a signaling zzso involving zzso is essential to this zzso
