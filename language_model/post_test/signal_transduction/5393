zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of organ shape has important zzso zzso However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that govern zzso tube zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso and zzso leads to reduction in zzso length in mouse zzso which is enhanced in the presence of the zzso zzso In the zzso layer of zzso zzso cell division is normally oriented along the zzso zzso in contrast, orientation zzso in the zzso zzso Cell growth and zzso are not affected in the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, cell division orientation in zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso of either zzso an zzso zzso or zzso These observations indicate that the oriented cell division, which is controlled by the zzso pathway, is one of essential components in zzso zzso Additionally, the small zzso zzso of zzso compound zzso fails to maintain proper zzso zzso the zzso was also observed in zzso small zzso In relation to these findings, zzso physically interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso regulation of zzso signaling controls oriented cell division and zzso polarity in the zzso of developing zzso
