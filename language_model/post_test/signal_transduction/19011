zzso zzso zzso is a complex disorder for which the zzso is still far from zzso zzso infants that develop BA may carry certain genetic zzso resulting in zzso to uncertain pathogens with characteristic zzso molecular patterns zzso The pathogens with their characteristic zzso in turn lead to zzso of the innate immune system by triggering pattern recognition receptors on the immune zzso zzso receptors zzso are the most recognized pattern recognition receptors and zzso signaling is the zzso sign of zzso of innate zzso The zzso of zzso and the innate immune system in BA is demonstrated by the zzso of zzso and by the association of promoter zzso of zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso a protein downstream of zzso zzso which is also known as a highly specific marker for type I zzso zzso are also found highly expressed in the early stage of zzso This review examines the known components of innate immunity involved in BA and outlines the potential role of the innate immune system, in cooperation with zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
