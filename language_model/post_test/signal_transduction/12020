zzso lines provide a unique tool to study zzso zzso Three zzso lines, with nuclear zzso from zzso zzso and harboring zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated by transcript and zzso profiling to identify the effects of zzso substitution on zzso signaling zzso 

In combining the wheat nuclear zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso 540 genes were significantly altered, whereas 11 and 28 genes were significantly changed in the zzso lines carrying the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso process as one of the most sensitive to a zzso of the zzso zzso Several key components of the zzso zzso retrograde zzso together with the zzso of the zzso scavenging system, showed that changes in the zzso zzso have a direct impact on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso line zzso some genes involved in the determination of zzso male zzso without expressing the male zzso zzso zzso profiling showed a comparable response of the central metabolism of the zzso and zzso lines to light, while exposing larger zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso line as compared with the zzso lines, in agreement with the zzso zzso Several stress-related zzso remarkably zzso were altered in content in the zzso zzso zzso line when exposed to high light, while zzso zzso as well as organic acids were significantly zzso zzso in the levels of transcript, related to zzso and the zzso zzso were associated with changes in the level of related zzso 

The replacement of a wheat zzso with the zzso of a related species affects the zzso zzso leading to transcript and zzso zzso The extent of these modifications was limited in the zzso lines with zzso zzso and more evident in the zzso line with zzso zzso zzso We consider that, this finding might be linked to the zzso distance of the zzso
