We aimed to investigate the effect of tumor necrosis zzso zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso in the migration ability of zzso stem cells zzso in the context of wound zzso We also explored the role of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways in the migration of zzso zzso were isolated from the bone zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction were used to observe the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso was investigated by the zzso system and the zzso effect of zzso using its zzso Western zzso analysis was used to observe the zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso signaling zzso and zzso was inhibited with zzso and zzso with zzso to observe the effect of zzso on zzso migration and zzso zzso The expression of zzso could be zzso by 50 zzso zzso zzso whereas that of zzso remained unchanged zzso Also, zzso showed a zzso effect by enhancing the migration ability of zzso zzso zzso at 50 zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso and zzso but not zzso could suppress the zzso effect and zzso of zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso could zzso the expression of zzso in zzso and enhance the zzso migration ability, and the zzso signaling zzso might be involved in the zzso migration ability for a role in wound repair and zzso
