Previous attempts to delineate the consequences of zzso zzso zzso in zzso relied largely on molecular strategies in cultures or transgenic zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso induce stable cardiac zzso whereas intense zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso The precise zzso zzso traditional targets of zzso zzso zzso that induce zzso also trigger zzso zzso is not obvious and is explored with zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso a zzso zzso zzso cultured with zzso display zzso enlargement, zzso organization, and increased zzso zzso factor expression in association with zzso of zzso C, novel protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and (to a lesser zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso cascade via zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in cardiac zzso but zzso zzso zzso plays no role in zzso zzso in zzso Surprisingly, zzso (or novel zzso zzso zzso by zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso by zzso or IGF-1 and functionally zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso These results identify a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation by survival zzso Because zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso to zzso this zzso is predicted to contribute to the transition from zzso to cardiac zzso and could be targeted for therapy in heart zzso
