zzso D zzso has been implicated in various cellular processes including membrane degradation, zzso trafficking and signal zzso Previously, we described a zzso gene family in tomato zzso zzso and showed that expression of one of these zzso zzso was induced by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the function of this zzso a zzso zzso construct was used to knock down levels of zzso transcript in zzso tomato zzso zzso cells exhibited a strong decrease in zzso zzso activity and responded to zzso treatment with a disproportionate zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cultures were found to have increased zzso zzso activity, to zzso less of the zzso zzso and to zzso and express more of the zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso Using an zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein for zzso laser scanning zzso zzso studies, zzso cells displayed a zzso zzso whereas treatment with zzso induced zzso to punctuate structures within the zzso zzso functions for zzso in zzso interactions are zzso
