zzso mast cells zzso release zzso which can induce vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso leading to plaque zzso Because the mechanism through which zzso release zzso in zzso is unknown, we studied whether zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 

Local recruitment and zzso of zzso reduced zzso content specifically in the cap region of vulnerable plaques in zzso E knockout zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented this zzso loss, suggesting an important role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso activated by the zzso zzso zzso coli zzso increased zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso blockers, indicating that zzso signaling is involved in zzso release in zzso This zzso was zzso via zzso because zzso promoted zzso zzso zzso which was inhibited by blocking zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso induced zzso production, which was reduced by zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso 

We show that zzso promote zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso signaling is important in zzso release in zzso and, therefore, in plaque zzso by regulating zzso zzso
