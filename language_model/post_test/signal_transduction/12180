zzso zzso regulators are robustly expressed in zzso beta cells, suggesting that besides the control of zzso number the zzso zzso has a role in zzso zzso We show here that zzso directly regulates expression of zzso which is a key component of the zzso channel involved in the regulation of zzso insulin zzso We zzso through zzso zzso analysis from zzso that zzso expression is regulated at the promoter level by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or genetic zzso of zzso results in decreased expression of zzso impaired insulin zzso and zzso intolerance in zzso zzso we show that rescue of zzso expression restores insulin zzso in zzso beta zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso is activated by zzso through the insulin pathway, ultimately resulting in zzso zzso and, consequently, increased expression of zzso In summary we provide evidence that the zzso regulatory zzso is involved in zzso zzso defining a new link between cell proliferation and zzso
