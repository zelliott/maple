Several different populations of zzso in the zzso cortex, including zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, are born in the zzso zzso zzso during zzso and then migrate zzso to the zzso zzso is expressed by some zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso and in zzso populations in the zzso zzso at zzso However, zzso (also known as zzso is not expressed by zzso until the second zzso week after reaching the cortex, suggesting that molecular cues in the cerebral zzso might be involved in the differentiation zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in the zzso zzso at the time when the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cortical cultures containing zzso precursors is sufficient to generate zzso zzso prematurely and inhibit zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso increases the number of zzso expressing zzso with a reduction in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso express zzso type I receptors and a zzso displays activated zzso zzso assessed by downstream molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso type I receptors in zzso precursors significantly reduces the number of cortical zzso zzso in the adult zzso Thus, zzso signaling through type I receptors regulates the differentiation of two major zzso zzso zzso zzso populations and defines their relative numbers in the zzso
