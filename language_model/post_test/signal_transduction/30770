Under specific environmental conditions, the zzso zzso zzso can undergo a zzso switch to a zzso growth zzso zzso differentiation is generally studied upon induction by nitrogen limitation in the presence of zzso It is known to be controlled by several signaling zzso including zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and especially zzso are more potent zzso of zzso than zzso zzso even zzso zzso in zzso media and in the zzso ammonium zzso zzso on zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso also zzso zzso by means of a zzso parallel to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso shifted the zzso growth pattern on zzso to that of zzso while deletion of zzso zzso zzso on both zzso indicating a negative role of zzso repression and a positive role for zzso activity in the control of zzso In all strains and in all media, zzso induction of zzso is greatly diminished by deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it has no effect on induction by zzso and zzso The competence of zzso zzso to induce zzso is reflected in the increased expression of the cell surface zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso is the only zzso sugar capable of rapidly inducing zzso expression in a zzso manner, reflecting the sensitivity of zzso for this sugar and its involvement in rapid zzso zzso Our study identifies zzso as the most potent zzso zzso of zzso growth and shows that zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling is responsible for the lower potency of zzso
