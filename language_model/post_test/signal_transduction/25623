A major challenge in transplantation is improving long-term organ transplant and patient zzso zzso protect the transplant organ from zzso zzso but sometimes also exhibit limiting side zzso The key to improving long-term outcome following transplantation is the selection of the correct zzso regimen for an individual patient for minimizing toxicity while maintaining zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso have the potential to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for monitoring early changes in cell signal zzso regulation and zzso zzso Here, we review the steps required for the development of molecular markers from discovery, zzso and clinical zzso to regulatory approval, and present a critical discussion of the current status of molecular marker development as relevant for the management and zzso of zzso drug zzso 

Although zzso and zzso studies have yielded several candidate molecular zzso most published studies are poorly zzso statistically zzso and/or often have not gone beyond the discovery zzso Most molecular marker candidates are still at an early zzso Due to the high complexity of and the resources required for diagnostic marker development, initiatives and zzso organized and supported by funding agencies and regulatory agencies will be zzso
