During the stages of the development of a potent drug candidate compounds can fail for several zzso One of them, the efficacy of a candidate, can be estimated in zzso if an appropriate ordinary differential equation model of the affected zzso is zzso With such a model at hand it is also possible to detect reactions having a large effect on a certain variable such as a substance zzso 

We show an zzso that systematically tests the influence of zzso and zzso of different type and strength acting at different positions in the zzso The effect on a quantity to be selected zzso a steady state flux or zzso is zzso Moreover, combinations of two zzso or one inhibitor and one zzso targeting different network positions are zzso Furthermore, we present zzso zzso zzso an open source, platform independent tool to investigate ordinary differential equation models in the common systems biology zzso language zzso It automatically assigns the respectively altered zzso to the inhibited or activated zzso performs the necessary calculations, and provides a zzso output of the analysis zzso For zzso zzso is used to detect optimal inhibitor positions in simple zzso networks, a zzso pathway, and a well studied model of zzso in zzso zzso 

Using zzso we show in the zzso models under which conditions inhibitions in a certain zzso can affect a zzso zzso in a zzso In the zzso zzso we illuminate which inhibitions have an effect on the zzso characteristics of the last active zzso Finally, we compare our set of best targets in the zzso model with a similar analysis showing the zzso of our zzso
