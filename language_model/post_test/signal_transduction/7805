zzso are an zzso zzso family of cell membrane proteins believed to play a significant role in innate immunity and the response to tissue injury, including that induced by zzso zzso signaling pathways activate zzso factors that regulate expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso through one of two zzso adapter zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study defines the zzso protein expression of zzso in zzso of humans and mice, and provides insight into the signaling mechanisms by which a zzso of zzso protects from zzso organ zzso Our study compared and contrasted the effects of zzso zzso in zzso mice and mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein was evident in many cell types in the zzso including zzso zzso of the outer stripe of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso The pattern of protein expression was similar in humans and zzso The absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso and zzso protection against zzso zzso at 24 zzso Interestingly, zzso mice were better protected from zzso zzso injury than those deficient for the adapter protein zzso raising the intriguing possibility that zzso pathways also contribute to kidney zzso We conclude that zzso protein is zzso expressed in the kidney and plays an important role in the zzso of acute zzso injury by signaling both zzso and zzso zzso
