In this report we demonstrate that cells expressing the human zzso type 16 zzso open reading frame zzso show a greatly enhanced zzso of the immediate early genes after zzso or zzso treatment compared to control zzso This enhancement is due to amplification of the signal zzso pathways in response to growth factors or zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso treatment of the zzso cells we observed an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso resulting in a stronger zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso We also observed that in zzso cells, treatment with zzso results in an increase in zzso zzso activity, and a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso since zzso of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and early gene zzso almost zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso strongly reduces the zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso effects zzso of zzso zzso over at least two different zzso a zzso and another, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
