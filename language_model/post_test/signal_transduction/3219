In zzso zzso information is often zzso in zzso zzso However, the advantages of such a coding strategy over an zzso scheme of constant signals remain zzso Here we study the dynamics of a simple model gene promoter in response to zzso and constant zzso factor zzso We find that in biologically relevant zzso regimes an zzso input can produce a more constant protein level than a constant zzso Our results suggest that zzso signals may be used to minimize noise in gene zzso
