Cell fusion is the key event of zzso that gives rise to the zzso zzso and is a nearly universal aspect of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso several zzso have been identified that are defective for cell fusion, and yet the molecular mechanism of this process remains zzso One obstacle has been that genetic screens have mainly focused on zzso factors, whereas the process likely involves zzso proteins as zzso Here we zzso zzso an essential protein with roles in multiple aspects of zzso as a core component of the zzso cell fusion zzso We identify a point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso called zzso which is specifically defective in cell zzso The cell fusion zzso is not a secondary consequence of ineffective signaling or zzso zzso and zzso data show that zzso acts at a late stage in cell fusion in concert with a key cell fusion regulator, zzso which contains a zzso zzso We find that zzso binds specifically with activated zzso and binding is blocked by the zzso zzso Thus, in addition to signaling and zzso roles in zzso zzso plays a role late in cell fusion via zzso of zzso
