zzso zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso factor that is expressed in zzso precursors during development of the nervous zzso zzso In the present work, we investigated a zzso potential of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acid zzso induced expression of zzso as well as zzso in zzso cells in early period of zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso zzso a zzso partner of zzso zzso factors, and zzso of zzso alone was sufficient to induce the maximum zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the absence of zzso was sufficient to induce substantial expression of zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso is able to commit zzso zzso cells to adopt a neural cell zzso in the absence of zzso which may finally lead to enhanced zzso zzso The results also suggest that zzso may induce zzso differentiation of zzso cells by promoting a zzso cascade including zzso
