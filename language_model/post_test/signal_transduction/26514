zzso zzso involves a massive fusion between the outer zzso and the plasma zzso of the zzso triggered by stimuli that open calcium channels at the plasma zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of these calcium zzso Here we report that this zzso promotes the zzso of zzso calcium and triggers zzso in zzso human zzso zzso that zzso activates events downstream of the opening of plasma membrane zzso Furthermore, we show that calcium and zzso zzso in a signaling zzso leading to the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso experiments adding zzso acid or zzso and direct measurement of zzso production suggest that both zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso zzso of different steps of the zzso was reverted by zzso an zzso of zzso calcium channels, indicating that zzso is necessary to keep these channels zzso However, zzso acid, zzso or zzso could not trigger zzso by themselves, indicating that zzso must also activate another zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso stimulate the zzso of the zzso form of zzso Together our results indicate that zzso promotes zzso zzso by zzso maintaining high levels of zzso - an effect that depends on a positive feedback loop leading to the production of zzso - and zzso stimulating the zzso of zzso which in turn zzso a cascade of protein interactions leading to the assembly of zzso complexes and membrane zzso
