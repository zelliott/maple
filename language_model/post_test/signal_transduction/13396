zzso in zzso beta signaling have been implicated in various human zzso including zzso zzso Our goal was to determine whether zzso cancer cells isolated from patient zzso fluid were growth inhibited by zzso beta 1 treatment and further characterize the expression and activity profile of zzso zzso signaling components in human zzso cancer zzso We found that 9 of 10 primary cultures of zzso cancer cells zzso were growth inhibited by 16 zzso zzso beta zzso One primary zzso cancer sample zzso and the established zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso continued to grow in the presence of zzso beta zzso All cells expressed components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso including zzso beta 1, T beta zzso T beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anchor for zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso are not growth inhibited by zzso beta 1, they can transmit the zzso beta 1 signal to turn on a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso In addition, all cells zzso the zzso zzso beta target genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also zzso with zzso beta 1 treatment in zzso whereas the zzso gene has been deleted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso may account for zzso beta resistance in some populations of zzso cancer zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso signaling zzso remains functional in human zzso cancer cells and suggest that if abnormalities exist in the cellular response of zzso beta signals, they must lie downstream of the zzso zzso
