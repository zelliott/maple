zzso is a well characterized zzso zzso One of our synthetic compounds, zzso induced zzso in human leukemia zzso cells similar to zzso zzso activated zzso an important zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso that is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and cell zzso Moreover, zzso treatment resulted in the zzso of a 36 zzso zzso which uses zzso basic protein zzso as a zzso However, zzso and zzso were not activated by treatment with zzso The 36 zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso product derived from the zzso protein with a molecular weight of 60 zzso The zzso protein is a zzso protein zzso whose activity is enhanced by zzso of its zzso regulatory domain by zzso When a zzso zzso form of zzso protein was zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso induction by zzso were zzso Furthermore, zzso of dominant negative zzso also suppressed zzso induction by zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso via the zzso zzso which is activated by zzso zzso
