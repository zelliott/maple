We compared zzso pathways such as calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions and zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso zzso 8 and 14 in human and rat zzso zzso zzso human embryonic kidney zzso and Kirsten transformed rat kidney zzso zzso Further, we zzso processing by zzso zzso zzso of synthetic human and rat zzso sequences representing the zzso domain of zzso Our data show that like zzso zzso can zzso a zzso zzso sequence from a zzso zzso However, whilst zzso like zzso can signal in zzso zzso cells, this zzso cannot signal via human zzso in zzso or zzso cells, but rather, zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso can signal zzso via the zzso to affect tissue zzso
