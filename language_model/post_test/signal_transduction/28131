zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most potent zzso zzso known, has been implicated in vascular adaptations and zzso functions during zzso The present study was designed to examine the existence of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso in the human zzso and the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso in term labor using zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that labeling specifically concentrated in the vascular zzso and the underlying smooth muscle cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and stem zzso vessels as well as in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso force measurement showed that zzso dose zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and stem zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso relaxation of zzso vessels are inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel blocker zzso and zzso protein zzso A inhibitor zzso and partially inhibited by a zzso oxide inhibitor zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso may play a role in the control of human zzso vascular tone, and the vascular zzso in response to zzso may involve zzso of zzso channels, zzso and a zzso oxide zzso
