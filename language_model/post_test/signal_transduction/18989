zzso and zzso are routinely used for treatment of zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso The present study aimed to compare the expression of signaling molecules and zzso production by T cells of zzso patients in long-term zzso zzso phase following zzso or zzso treatment with that of zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso The frequency and intensity of zzso chain, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso T cells was examined by flow zzso zzso function was assessed by stimulation with zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite a reduction in number, the expression of zzso in zzso in patients was significantly higher than in healthy zzso The intensity of most signaling molecules in treated patients was relatively unaffected zzso healthy donors but lower than zzso zzso However, the total number of T cells which expressed each of the signaling molecules was decreased in patients, with no difference between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso but not zzso was reduced in treated zzso The results suggest that, despite some zzso in signaling molecules and a reduction in zzso number, overall zzso functions may be relatively well preserved long-term after treatment with zzso and zzso
