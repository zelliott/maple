The key events in regulating cardiac muscle contraction involve zzso binding to and release from zzso zzso zzso and structural changes in zzso and other thin filament proteins triggered by zzso zzso Single zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso have been reported to associate with familial zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have examined the effects of these individual zzso on structural transitions in the regulatory zzso of zzso triggered by zzso binding and zzso This study was carried out with a double zzso or triple zzso of zzso zzso into zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The double zzso zzso labeled with zzso at zzso served as a control to monitor zzso opening and closing of the zzso by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso The triple zzso contained both zzso and zzso labeled with zzso and either zzso or zzso Both zzso had minimal effects on the equilibrium distance between zzso and zzso in the absence or presence of bound zzso zzso had no effect on the closing rate of the zzso triggered by release of zzso but reduced the zzso opening zzso zzso reduced both the closing and opening zzso Previous results showed that the closing rate of zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso was substantially enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso This rate enhancement was abolished by zzso or zzso These zzso alter the zzso of structural transitions in the regulatory zzso of zzso that are involved in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso appear to be zzso toward zzso signaling between zzso and zzso
