zzso zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso gene are responsible for familial zzso zzso zzso an zzso dominant zzso predisposition to the development of multiple zzso zzso and of a broad spectrum of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso play a zzso and initiating role in the majority of sporadic zzso zzso Notwithstanding its zzso nature, the main tumor suppressing activity of the zzso gene resides in its ability to regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations have been established at the zzso gene between the length and stability of the truncated proteins zzso by different zzso zzso the corresponding levels of zzso signaling activity they zzso for, and the zzso and distribution of zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report a novel mouse model, zzso obtained by targeting a truncated zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso results in intermediate levels of zzso signaling zzso when compared with other zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso Notwithstanding the zzso nature of the zzso zzso mice have no predisposition to zzso cancer but develop zzso zzso zzso and subsequent pulmonary zzso in both zzso The zzso of the zzso primary zzso zzso is highly zzso with zzso zzso and zzso lineages and is reminiscent of zzso zzso of the breast in zzso The striking zzso of zzso mice suggests that specific zzso of zzso signaling activity zzso affect tissue zzso and initiate zzso in an zzso zzso
