Studies of zzso mice have disclosed that the stem cell hierarchy in the small zzso zzso is established during formation of its zzso units zzso of zzso This process involves a selection among several zzso zzso so that ultimately only one survives to supply descendants to the fully formed zzso In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the level of zzso zzso signaling is an important factor regulating this stem cell zzso In the zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso can partner with zzso high mobility group zzso box zzso factors to control gene zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are produced in the fetal mouse small zzso zzso expression is zzso whereas zzso levels fall as zzso formation is completed during the first two zzso zzso A zzso gene knockout is known to block zzso zzso proliferation in late fetal zzso zzso to test the hypothesis, we enhanced zzso signaling in a zzso mouse model in which the stem cell selection could be zzso A fusion protein containing the zzso box domain of zzso linked to the zzso domain of zzso zzso was constructed to promote direct stimulation of signaling without being retained in the zzso through interactions with zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in zzso embryonic stem zzso small zzso zzso zzso present in developing zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a known zzso target zzso suppressed expression of zzso and zzso and induced zzso in zzso but not in neighboring zzso zzso zzso This zzso response was not associated with any zzso changes in cell division within the zzso zzso By the time zzso development was completed, all zzso zzso cells were zzso These results indicate that zzso changes in zzso signaling can play an important role in establishing a stem cell hierarchy during zzso zzso
