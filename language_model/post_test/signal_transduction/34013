zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso have each been shown to play an important role in zzso However, whether these signaling molecules interact to coordinate zzso processes and zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso application of zzso (10 zzso recruited zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso zzso in primary zzso cultures within minutes, through a zzso involving zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery of the zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso induction of several inflammatory zzso and/or markers of zzso zzso including tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso factor, and zzso zzso of an activated form of zzso in one set of zzso cultures also triggered the release of factors that, in turn, zzso zzso activity in a second set of zzso zzso This effect was prevented when zzso cultures zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso coordinates positive feedback signaling between zzso In the presence of zzso and zzso zzso delivery of zzso was associated with several zzso effects, including zzso zzso zzso death, elevated zzso zzso and zzso synaptic zzso Each of these effects were reversed or ameliorated by targeted delivery of zzso to zzso zzso also caused an zzso reduction in zzso zzso acid zzso levels, indicating a possible mechanism for zzso zzso Taken together, the results have potentially important implications for the propagation and maintenance of zzso signaling processes associated with many neurodegenerative conditions and zzso
