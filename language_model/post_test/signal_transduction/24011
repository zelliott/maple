zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso expressed on the surfaces of zzso zzso Their interactions with zzso receptors expressed on T cell surfaces are crucial for the proper regulation of T cell zzso zzso and zzso display distinct roles in immune regulation, although they are usually considered to have redundant zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain of human zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso suggest a zzso basis for the observed functional similarities and differences between these two zzso zzso Of particular note, whereas the majority of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso the zzso zzso observed in the zzso complex displays a very zzso zzso zzso These differences provide a mechanism for preventing the formation of zzso zzso The divergence at the putative zzso interface is also consistent with the lower tendency of zzso to zzso as shown by the zzso state of zzso zzso both in solution and zzso form, and may result in detailed differences in signaling mechanisms associated with zzso and zzso
