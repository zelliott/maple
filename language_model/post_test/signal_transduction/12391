The formation of a complex nervous system requires the intricate interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells generally migrate over long distances before they initiate their zzso which leads to wrapping and insulation of zzso zzso The molecular pathways zzso the switch from zzso migration to zzso differentiation are largely zzso Here we demonstrate that, within the zzso eye zzso disc, zzso growth factor zzso zzso coordinates zzso zzso migration and subsequent zzso zzso zzso differentiation in the zzso eye disc requires a succession from zzso interaction to zzso zzso The zzso component of the fly eye develops in the peripheral nervous system within the zzso zzso disc, whereas zzso cells originate from a pool of zzso zzso and migrate onto the eye zzso zzso Initially, zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso cell number and zzso A switch to zzso expressed zzso a second zzso zzso then zzso zzso zzso This switch is accompanied by an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso through which the zzso zzso channels information into the zzso Our findings reveal how a switch from zzso interactions to zzso interactions can trigger formation of zzso membrane around zzso zzso These results disclose an zzso zzso control mechanism of zzso zzso indicating that zzso might serve as a model to understand zzso disorders in zzso
