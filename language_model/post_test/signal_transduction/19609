The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in the expression of zzso binding cassette zzso A1 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso induced by zzso and to discuss the mechanism of foam cell formation induced by zzso zzso zzso were induced into zzso by 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso and then the zzso were exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein were determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso The contents of total cholesterol zzso and free cholesterol zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso The content of cholesterol zzso zzso was calculated by the difference between zzso and zzso The results showed that zzso decreased the zzso and protein expressions of zzso and zzso increased the zzso and protein expressions of zzso and increased the contents of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso These above effects of zzso were inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may zzso the zzso expression and zzso the zzso expression via zzso signal zzso pathway, which decreases the zzso of zzso increases the content of zzso and then zzso foam cell zzso
