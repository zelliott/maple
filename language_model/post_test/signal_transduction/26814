zzso are zzso proteins that integrate zzso signals and transmit this information to a large number of zzso In zzso zzso are modified by zzso zzso zzso in response to the nitrogen zzso The zzso cycle of zzso is also regulated by carbon and energy signals such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These molecules bind to zzso proteins and alter their zzso zzso and zzso In this work, we determined the effects of zzso zzso and zzso levels on the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both proteins were zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso although the zzso levels were higher in the presence of zzso and under high zzso zzso Under excess of zzso the zzso zzso level was higher in the presence of zzso than with zzso while zzso zzso was similar with zzso or zzso Moreover, in the presence of zzso zzso ratios varying from zzso to zzso zzso zzso level decreased as zzso concentration increased, whereas zzso zzso remained zzso The results suggest that zzso of both zzso and zzso responds to zzso levels, but only zzso responds effectively to variation on zzso zzso
