In zzso zzso zzso signaling initiated in primary zzso activates the membrane protein zzso zzso and leads to zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso In the absence of zzso zzso proteins are inhibited by the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso It is unclear how zzso activates zzso and whether it directly regulates zzso We find that zzso stimulation quickly recruits zzso zzso complexes to zzso suggesting a model in which zzso activates zzso by zzso zzso by zzso In support of this model, we find that zzso causes rapid zzso of the zzso complex, thus allowing zzso to enter the nucleus and activate zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso of zzso complexes, which in turn prevents their zzso by zzso Our results support a simple mechanism in which zzso signals at zzso zzso cause zzso of inactive zzso complexes, a process inhibited by zzso
