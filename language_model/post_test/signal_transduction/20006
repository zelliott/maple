zzso oxide zzso is an important signaling zzso having varied zzso and regulatory roles in biological zzso The fact that zzso oxide zzso zzso is responsible for NO generation in animals, prompted major search for a similar zzso in zzso zzso dependent zzso like activity zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by calcium zzso but the activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso approach using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso and zzso zzso supporting that the zzso operates via the zzso zzso Most of the zzso activity zzso was confined to shoot while root showed only zzso zzso zzso studies by zzso and zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso in guard zzso zzso analysis showed positive zzso with calcium as reflected by a decreased zzso zzso and almost two fold increase in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso activated zzso zzso fold while its inactive analog zzso was zzso zzso and zzso activated the zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with calcium activated the zzso activity to zzso zzso A significant zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso further supports involvement of zzso zzso The activity was also enhanced by zzso stress conditions zzso All these findings suggest that zzso generates NO via zzso zzso and is probably regulated by zzso
