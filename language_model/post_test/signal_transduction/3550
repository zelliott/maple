Living cells continuously probe their environment and respond to a multitude of external zzso The information about the environment is carried by signaling zzso that act as zzso zzso and computing zzso coupled into complex and interconnected zzso A comprehensive understanding of how cells make decisions therefore zzso a sound theoretical zzso which can be achieved through mathematical modeling of the signaling zzso In this chapter, we zzso describe the typical zzso involved in building mathematical models that are motivated by and are developed in a tight integration with experimental zzso In particular, we delineate the steps involved in a zzso zzso zzso zzso process, both through informal discussion and using a recently published study as an zzso zzso guide the initial development of mathematical models, including choice of appropriate template model and zzso zzso The model can then be used to generate and test hypotheses quickly and zzso aiding in judicious design of future zzso These experiments, in turn, are used to update the zzso The model developed at the end of this exercise not only predicts functional behavior of the system under study but also provides insight into the zzso zzso of signaling zzso
