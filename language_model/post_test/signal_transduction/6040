zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso factor zzso both zzso and vascular zzso mainly through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso as well, but the importance of zzso signaling in vascular zzso has been largely zzso Here, we report the zzso and characterization of a novel zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso snake zzso The zzso snake has a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso snake zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso has almost zzso less zzso activity than zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso but a similar effect on vascular zzso zzso bound zzso and induced its zzso to almost the same extent as zzso but bound zzso zzso and induced its zzso almost zzso less effectively than zzso This unique binding affinity for zzso and zzso leads to the vascular zzso activity of zzso These results suggest that zzso snakes have acquired a highly zzso zzso for a zzso which enhances the toxicity in zzso without inducing effective zzso and the following zzso of damaged zzso taking advantage of the difference in signaling properties involving zzso and zzso between vascular zzso and zzso zzso is thus a potent inducing factor selective for vascular zzso through preferential signaling via zzso These data strongly indicate the importance of zzso signaling in vascular zzso
