In zzso beta cells are zzso in the form of pancreatic zzso Within these zzso communication between beta cells zzso zzso insulin zzso and enhances zzso insulin zzso thus contributing to zzso zzso during zzso and zzso In the search for the underlying molecular zzso we have discovered that beta cells communicate via zzso and zzso We provide evidence that zzso is required for zzso insulin zzso We further show that zzso beta cell communication is zzso zzso forward signaling zzso insulin zzso whereas zzso reverse signaling stimulates insulin zzso zzso forward signaling is zzso in response to zzso which indicates that, under zzso conditions, beta cells use zzso forward signaling to suppress insulin zzso and that, under zzso conditions, they shift to zzso reverse signaling to enhance insulin zzso Thus, we explain how beta cell communication in pancreatic zzso zzso affects zzso and zzso insulin zzso to improve zzso zzso
