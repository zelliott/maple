Gene expression signatures generated from DNA zzso analyses have shown promise as zzso zzso of clinical zzso In this study, we determined a high-risk signature for disease recurrence using zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso tumors and compared the results with an independent data set obtained from fresh frozen zzso We also showed that genes involved in zzso transition zzso and nuclear zzso zzso signaling deregulation are the most prominent molecular characteristics of the high-risk zzso Gene expression was determined in 40 samples, including 34 zzso zzso and 6 matched frozen zzso from 29 zzso zzso A zzso list zzso of disease recurrence was determined by training on the zzso tumor data set and tested on data from the independent frozen tumor set from 60 zzso zzso The difference in recurrence-free survival zzso between the high-risk versus low-risk groups in the training and test sets was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso In addition, the gene expression data was interrogated using Gene Set zzso Analysis to determine biological zzso The most significant sets of genes enriched in the high-risk tumors were genes involving zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In conclusion, global gene expression analysis is feasible using zzso zzso The zzso list can be used as a zzso zzso of zzso and our data suggest that the molecular zzso of zzso and zzso zzso can be targeted as the novel therapy in the identified high-risk zzso
