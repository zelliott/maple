The zzso C zzso of the zzso zzso and many other G zzso receptors contains a zzso sequence that has been implicated in zzso targeting of diverse zzso In the present study, we provide evidence for an essential role of this motif in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso to Ala caused little changes in surface zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso and signaling to zzso zzso when these receptors were zzso or zzso expressed in zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was markedly impaired in the zzso double zzso and reduced in the two single zzso This impairment in zzso zzso was seen by using various approaches to determine zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The selective effects of these zzso suggest that the zzso zzso motif is involved in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
