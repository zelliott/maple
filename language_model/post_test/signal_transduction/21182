The zzso zzso peptides substance P and zzso zzso A are expressed in distinct neural pathways of the zzso zzso When released from intrinsic enteric or zzso primary zzso zzso zzso have the potential to influence both nerve and muscle by way of interaction with three different types of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most prominent among the effects of zzso is their zzso action on gastrointestinal motor activity, which is seen in virtually all regions and layers of the zzso zzso This action depends not only on a direct zzso of the muscle through zzso and/or zzso zzso but also on stimulation of zzso enteric motor pathways through zzso and/or zzso zzso In addition, zzso can inhibit motor activity by stimulating either zzso zzso pathways or interrupting zzso zzso A synopsis of the available data indicates that zzso substance P and zzso interact with other enteric zzso in the zzso control of gastrointestinal motor zzso zzso of the regulatory roles of zzso may be a factor in the gastrointestinal zzso associated with infection, zzso stress and zzso In a therapeutic perspective, it would seem zzso therefore, that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to the treatment of motor disorders that involve pathological disturbances of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso
