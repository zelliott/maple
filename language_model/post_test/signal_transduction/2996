Fibrosis is a key feature of systemic sclerosis zzso and arises from excessive release of zzso by zzso activated zzso zzso the skin and many internal zzso zzso represents a major cause for the high morbidity and mortality in zzso So far, effective therapies to treat zzso in zzso and other zzso diseases are not available in clinical zzso Nevertheless, promising zzso agents are emerging from zzso studies with some having already entered clinical zzso 

In this review, we focus on recent advances in the development of zzso treatment strategies in zzso We have selected for targeted therapeutic approaches that have proven high efficacy and zzso in zzso zzso models of zzso and/or are already in clinical zzso zzso these criteria, we discuss a large repertory of candidate zzso therapies that block inflammatory zzso inhibit zzso growth factors, zzso zzso zzso and interfere with zzso zzso 

Many zzso candidate therapies have proven efficacy and zzso in zzso models of zzso So far, early clinical studies have tested only few of these zzso Besides discovering novel molecular treatment strategies, zzso research will now have to translate its findings into clinical zzso
