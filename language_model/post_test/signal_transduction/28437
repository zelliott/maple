In the zzso zzso sensory lineages selected by the basic zzso zzso factor zzso are zzso while those specified by the related protein Amos are zzso What are the mechanisms that cause the two lineages to act zzso We found that zzso expression of the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cells from the zzso zzso suggesting that precursors are removed by programmed cell zzso In the zzso zzso precursors express the zzso regulated zzso zzso and antagonism of zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso signaling compromises their zzso We suggest that all sensory lineages on the antenna are competent to produce zzso but only those specified by zzso respond to zzso signaling and zzso These results underscore the importance of zzso context of cell lineages in their responses to zzso signaling in the choice between survival and zzso
