zzso activity of human zzso involves the generation of zzso oxide zzso zzso However, zzso transformation may involve mechanisms that rescue cells from zzso zzso In the present work, we analyzed the effects of zzso NO on the proliferation of zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso As normal zzso the proliferation of leukemia cells was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso had no effect on leukemia cell zzso zzso induced higher zzso activity in zzso cells, compared to normal zzso zzso zzso of leukemia cell proliferation correlated with increased zzso and zzso zzso The simultaneous addition of zzso iron reversed zzso zzso of cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso in all zzso cells zzso The zzso of zzso iron levels in leukemia cells indicated that NO induced an early, zzso decrease in zzso iron zzso zzso zzso of zzso iron protected leukemia cells from zzso zzso Together, the present work reveals the presence of an zzso mechanism for leukemia cell rescue from zzso growth zzso and zzso
