Mouse zzso studies have documented a central role of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso development and zzso A zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is key to this zzso zzso Here we further characterize this signaling zzso and report that a zzso small zzso inhibitor mirrors the effect of genetic zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity is indispensable for zzso DNA synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso box zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with modest effects on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso component of zzso calcium zzso also completely relies on zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells with inactive zzso fail to enter the cell cycle, zzso with an zzso to zzso the expression of zzso zzso A, and zzso and to zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso is also critical for zzso 4 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and protection from zzso Taken together, these data show that defects observed in zzso zzso mice are not merely a consequence of altered zzso zzso and emphasize the potential utility of zzso as a drug target in zzso diseases in which B cells play a crucial zzso
