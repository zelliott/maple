We examined the signaling pathways regulating zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of rat zzso The zzso of zzso by insulin and zzso was completely reversed by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso consistent with a role for the zzso zzso axis in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso completely inhibited the significantly greater level of zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso there was only minimal accompanying zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be necessary but are not sufficient to induce zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso partially inhibited the zzso zzso induced by zzso but not that zzso by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso was reversed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso by insulin, but substantially reversed zzso zzso by zzso The combination of this inhibitor with zzso produced an additive zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the signaling components zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso as well as other yet to be defined zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso in rat zzso
