Signaling by zzso zzso plays fundamental roles during animal development and is zzso in a variety of human zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso zzso characteristic of G zzso zzso Despite such zzso the mechanisms regulating zzso signaling are not fully zzso We show that zzso a zzso member of the G zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the wing disc reduces the expression of zzso targets and causes a zzso reminiscent of loss of zzso zzso We found that zzso function is required for zzso the zzso signal and that when zzso levels are zzso zzso still accumulates at the cell zzso but its zzso is zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso in the wing disc is regulated in part by zzso generating a positive feedback loop that maintains high zzso activity close to the zzso compartment zzso
