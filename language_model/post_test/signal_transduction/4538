The zzso guidance cues zzso zzso and their receptors zzso have been shown to regulate both zzso and pathological zzso zzso plays an important role in the immune system by inducing T cell zzso but to date, the role of zzso in regulating the function of zzso during the zzso and inflammatory processes remains zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid induced a zzso increase of zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso Moreover, in a zzso zzso mouse model, zzso was detected in circulating zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso Acting via zzso zzso zzso strongly increased zzso zzso Of note, zzso zzso enhanced the expression of vascular zzso growth zzso but not of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso were able to activate vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and to sustain their migration and in zzso zzso zzso in an in zzso cardiac zzso mouse model, zzso was highly expressed in zzso recruited at the injured zzso We conclude that zzso activates a specialized and restricted genetic program in zzso able to sustain zzso and zzso in their recruitment and zzso in inflammatory zzso
