zzso zzso zzso in zzso and skeletal muscle impair zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso insulin zzso to key hormonal end zzso An important feature of this zzso involves the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which associates with and zzso regulates zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that this zzso is critically dependent on the targeting and subsequent retention of zzso within zzso zzso zzso which is facilitated by zzso interactions with zzso zzso also recruits zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected on zzso 10), a zzso zzso thereby creating a repressive membrane zzso from which zzso cannot zzso zzso the structural integrity of zzso by cholesterol depletion prevented zzso targeting of zzso and zzso and suppressed zzso association, but, importantly, also ameliorated zzso zzso of zzso zzso with this, zzso from zzso mice, which lack functional zzso exhibit greater resistance to zzso compared with zzso zzso We conclude that the recruitment and retention of zzso within zzso contribute significantly to zzso zzso of zzso zzso
