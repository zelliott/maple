Despite conflicting results, there is evidence to suggest an inverse link between total body cholesterol levels and the risk of certain zzso Based on previous reports, this phenomenon appears to vary with cancer site, and, in particular, more consistent data on inverse relations was reported in the risk of gastric zzso In the current study, the effect of cholesterol on gastric cancer cell viability was examined using an zzso cell culture zzso zzso of cholesterol in culture medium resulted in reduced viability and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso gastric cancer cells by induction of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was linked to reduction of zzso cell zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also involved in cell death zzso In conclusion, these results imply that cholesterol can act as a signal regulator to zzso cell viability and that proper cellular cholesterol levels may be advantageous to suppress growth of gastric zzso
