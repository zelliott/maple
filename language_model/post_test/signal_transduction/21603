Identification of zzso targets remains an important challenge for chemical zzso We report an approach for target identification and protein discovery based on functional suppression of chemical zzso in zzso We discovered zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso in a screen conducted with zzso zzso zzso was used to partially inhibit zzso assembly in the same zzso and concentrated zzso zzso of zzso extracts were added to find activities that suppressed zzso zzso Two activities were zzso separately zzso and identified as zzso complex and zzso complex, both known regulators of zzso zzso We show that zzso directly zzso zzso of zzso but that zzso complex represents a downstream zzso This work introduces a general method for using zzso chemical zzso to identify both inhibitor targets and other components of a signaling zzso
