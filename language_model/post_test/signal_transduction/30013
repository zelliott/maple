As a part of studies on the structural characterization of the components of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of an intermediate signal zzso zzso has been zzso at zzso A zzso The calcium complex and the zzso structures have been analyzed zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso cavity is only partially formed and it only becomes completed upon metal zzso The zzso of zzso is coordinated to the metal and interestingly the side chain of zzso exists in a variety of zzso in the three crystal structures of zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso is in fact zzso however, it binds zzso when it is in complex with zzso It is proposed that the existence of a deep pocket which extends from the surface to the metal site could attract and direct the metal, thereby zzso the metal binding of the zzso
