In zzso organisms, zzso cells form layers separating compartments responsible for different zzso zzso At the early stage of zzso layer formation, each cell of an zzso defines an inner and an outer side by breaking the symmetry of its initial state, in a process known as zzso zzso By zzso recent zzso and zzso data with zzso simulations of the relevant zzso system, we provide evidence that zzso cell polarization is a chemical zzso process induced by a local zzso in the signaling network at the level of the cell zzso The early symmetry breaking event triggering phase separation is induced by zzso mechanical forces localized in the point of convergence of cell surfaces when a threshold number of zzso cells is zzso The zzso of the emerging zzso scenario is likely common to many processes of cell polarity zzso
