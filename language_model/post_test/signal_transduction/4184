zzso shared zzso zzso is a zzso zzso differentiation zzso expressed on zzso zzso and is identical to stem cell zzso zzso Using newly established zzso against zzso we have previously shown that surface zzso expression is induced upon zzso in T cells, and that zzso zzso zzso production induced by zzso stimulation in T cell zzso In the present study, we have analyzed the functional role of zzso during T cell zzso using normal T cells, T cell zzso and zzso zzso cell lines that expressed either zzso or zzso form of zzso zzso inhibited zzso production from normal T cells zzso with soluble zzso plus accessory zzso zzso exhibited the zzso effect on T cells, but not on accessory cells, because zzso inhibited zzso production in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso but not in control zzso A zzso form of zzso was expressed in zzso cells by fusing the zzso portion of zzso to the zzso and zzso regions of the class 1 zzso The analysis using this zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso production did not require the zzso anchor of zzso Finally, in addition to the zzso of zzso production, zzso zzso of zzso zzso observed following zzso zzso one of the important early zzso events, was markedly reduced by zzso These results imply that zzso plays an important regulatory role in the zzso signaling zzso of activated T cells in addition to its role in T cell zzso
