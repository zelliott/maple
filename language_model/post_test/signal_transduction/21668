Several recently revealed features of zzso zzso were not predicted by earlier evolutionary zzso including the relatively small number of zzso the very large amounts of zzso code and its zzso in zzso the remarkable conservation of many functionally important genes across relatively enormous zzso zzso and the prevalence of zzso information associated with zzso structure and zzso zzso All of these emphasize a paramount role for regulatory evolution, which is further reinforced by recent perspectives highlighting even zzso regulation governing zzso and development zzso Modern zzso with its emphasis on regulatory mechanisms and regulatory evolution provides new vision for understanding radiation biology, particularly because free zzso and zzso states are central to many regulatory mechanisms and free zzso generated by radiation mimic and amplify zzso zzso This paper explores some of these aspects and their implications for zzso radiation zzso
