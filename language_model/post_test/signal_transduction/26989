zzso extracts from actively dividing zzso cells have been shown to induce DNA synthesis in isolated, zzso zzso An initiating factor in such extracts zzso of DNA zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein whose activity is zzso not only by zzso but also by several other zzso zzso as zzso Although zzso from zzso zzso is devoid of zzso activity, we have shown that these preparations can be induced to express zzso activity by brief exposure to a zzso fraction of spontaneously zzso zzso cells via a zzso zzso In the present study, we examine the role of zzso zzso in this zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can inhibit the in zzso generation of zzso zzso In zzso generation of zzso activity is associated with the de zzso zzso of several zzso many of which are zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso itself may be zzso zzso in active form as zzso using such zzso zzso leads to the depletion of its zzso Moreover, zzso results in the removal of several de zzso zzso zzso including species at approximately zzso 105, 93, 86, 79, and 65 zzso A subset of de zzso zzso zzso at approximately 105, 93, and 70 zzso also bound to zzso suggesting that at least one of these proteins may represent zzso zzso
