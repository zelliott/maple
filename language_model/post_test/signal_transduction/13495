The breakdown of zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso system that is composed of two kinds of zzso the zzso zzso C zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso the effects of these chemicals on the zzso zzso zzso system were zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso responses were markedly decreased by treatment with zzso The effects of zzso were inhibited by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso (as well as the calcium zzso zzso showed that the action of zzso was mostly unaffected by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that among the signals triggered by the breakdown of zzso zzso only zzso zzso C signal is involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
