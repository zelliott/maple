In the failing human heart, due to idiopathic zzso zzso it has been suggested that the zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso of rats with a synthetic zzso corresponding to the second zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso was able to induce the early stage of zzso and also to investigate zzso and zzso functional parameters at a zzso level to permit insights into the zzso mechanism in zzso Eleven zzso zzso rats were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso once a month during 12 months and seven control rats were injected with vehicle according to the same procedure used for the zzso zzso zzso function, zzso zzso and their functional effects on zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stretch markers were determined on zzso zzso In zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso were shown to be present and functionally active, cardiac functions in terms of fractional zzso were decreased and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased compared with the control zzso These data have shown that zzso of rats with a putative zzso zzso was able to induce an early stage zzso of zzso in the form of cardiac dysfunction and zzso of zzso as the first step in the zzso process of the zzso zzso the pathological importance of the zzso zzso
