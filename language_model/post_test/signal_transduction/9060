zzso using stem cells including bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso is emerging as a potential zzso therapy after zzso attacks in the heart and zzso The migration capability of transplanted cells is a critical cellular function for tissue zzso Based on our recent observations that hypoxic zzso zzso has multiple benefits in improving stem cell therapy and that the zzso zzso channel acts as a promoter for focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso the present investigation tested the hypothesis that zzso treatment can increase zzso migration via the mechanism of increased zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso derived from green fluorescent zzso mice were treated under either zzso zzso or hypoxic zzso zzso zzso conditions for 24 zzso Western zzso analysis showed zzso selectively zzso zzso expression while leaving other zzso channels, such as zzso and zzso zzso Compared with zzso controls, significantly larger outward delayed zzso zzso currents were recorded in zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activities in zzso and after intravenous transplantation into rats subjected to permanent zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso migration was inhibited by either blocking zzso channels or knocking down zzso Supporting a relationship among zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso and this effect was antagonized by blocking zzso zzso These findings provide novel evidence that zzso enhances the ability of zzso to migrate and home to the injured zzso this effect is zzso through a regulatory role of zzso on zzso zzso
