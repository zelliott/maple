The faithful maintenance of zzso continuity in human cells during DNA replication and repair is critical for preventing the conversion of normal zzso cells to an zzso zzso The evolution of higher zzso cells endowed them with a large genetic investment in the molecular machinery that ensures zzso zzso In zzso and other zzso cells, the elimination of zzso breaks with minimal zzso sequence change involves the zzso orchestration of a seemingly endless number of proteins ranging in their action from the zzso level to zzso organization and zzso zzso DNA zzso trigger a myriad of zzso modifications that alter zzso activities and the specificity of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by the reversal of these changes as repair is zzso zzso protein recruitment to damage sites, functional zzso and alternative pathways ensure that zzso repair is extremely efficient, both zzso and zzso This review strives to integrate the information about the molecular mechanisms of zzso repair that has emerged over the last two decades with a focus on zzso produced by the zzso agent zzso radiation zzso The exponential growth of molecular studies, heavily driven by zzso zzso technology, now reveals an outline of how many key protein players in zzso stability and cancer biology perform their interwoven tasks, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Thus, the nature of the intricate coordination of repair processes with cell cycle progression is becoming zzso This review also links molecular abnormalities to cellular pathology as much a possible and provides a framework of zzso zzso
