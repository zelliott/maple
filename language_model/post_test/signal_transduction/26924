The objective of the study was to test the hypotheses that humans with zzso zzso associated with low zzso zzso signaling capacity, including the zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or longer zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and with a greater number of these zzso per a zzso zzso show less zzso of reward regions that primarily rely on zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso were used to investigate zzso in response to zzso and anticipated zzso of palatable food and monetary zzso DNA was extracted from saliva using standard zzso Participants were 160 adolescents zzso age zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso years; mean body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The main outcome was blood zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Data confirmed that these zzso zzso activated zzso attention, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with, versus without, these five zzso did not show less zzso of zzso reward regions, but those with the zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso showed less middle zzso zzso zzso and those with the zzso versus the zzso zzso showed less middle zzso zzso zzso in response to monetary zzso zzso the zzso composite score revealed that those with a greater number of these zzso showed less zzso in reward regions, including the zzso zzso and zzso in response to monetary zzso The results suggest that the zzso genetic composite is a more sensitive index of vulnerability for low reward region zzso than individual zzso
