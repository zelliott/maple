zzso and zzso become zzso in many neurological disorders resulting in zzso and functional zzso Both cell types might also display functional changes during normal zzso To identify gene signatures and changes in zzso cellular functions of zzso and zzso in relation to aging, we isolated viable zzso and zzso from young adult and aged mouse zzso and determined their gene expression zzso Aged zzso compared with young zzso showed an increased inflammatory zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso Young zzso showed higher expression of genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of genes involved in zzso signaling remains high throughout zzso Aged zzso had higher expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and genes within the tumor necrosis zzso family and young zzso had increased transcript levels of zzso motif zzso These data provide a zzso database of zzso enriched genes of zzso and zzso from adult mice and give insight into the differential gene signature of zzso and zzso in relation to normal zzso
