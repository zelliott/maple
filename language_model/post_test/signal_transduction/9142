zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that plays a major role in zzso zzso transport in muscle and zzso For zzso transport to occur, the zzso protein needs to be zzso from the zzso pool to the plasma zzso and certain compounds may enhance this zzso The present study investigated the promotion of zzso zzso in differentiated zzso zzso by zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane in zzso cells, but did not activate protein zzso C zzso zzso or zzso zzso all of which are known to regulate zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was not lowered by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a promising active compound for maintaining zzso zzso and that it acts via an unknown mechanism that does not involve zzso of the downstream insulin signal and zzso protein zzso
