A central question in the area of signal zzso is why pathways zzso common zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso pathways require overlapping components but are thought to be induced by different stimuli and specify distinct zzso To better understand the regulation of the zzso pathway, we examined zzso in one of zzso native zzso the zzso plant zzso zzso In this setting, different aspects of zzso were induced in a zzso manner coupled to the zzso cycle, which uncovered a zzso feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was modulated by the zzso pathway, which led to the finding that the signaling zzso zzso and zzso which operate at the head of the zzso pathway, zzso regulate the zzso zzso The two zzso exhibited different expression and zzso patterns, and their overproduction induced zzso sets of target zzso Moreover, zzso had a function in cell polarization through the zzso protein zzso that zzso did zzso zzso zzso zzso by signaling zzso brings to light a new point of discrimination between zzso zzso
