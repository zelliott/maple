zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a 90 zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso and is critical for the firm arrest and zzso of zzso out of blood vessels and into zzso zzso is zzso present on zzso cells, but its expression is increased by zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso is increased in zzso and zzso zzso tissue and in animal models of zzso Additionally, zzso has been implicated in the progression of zzso zzso We and others have shown that the zzso of zzso on the surface of zzso or smooth muscle cells with zzso zzso via its main zzso zzso zzso function associated zzso zzso or with zzso derived from patient serum, leads to the zzso of several zzso signaling zzso and to the zzso of the zzso zzso A circulating or soluble form of zzso zzso has been measured in various body zzso with elevated levels being observed in patients with zzso heart failure, coronary artery disease and transplant zzso zzso has signaling properties in several cell types, including zzso and zzso a range of zzso zzso Thus, we propose that in addition to acting as a zzso zzso zzso zzso directly contributes to inflammatory responses within the blood vessel wall by increasing zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso plaque zzso
