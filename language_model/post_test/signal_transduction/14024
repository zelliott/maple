In addition to the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso cells are often polarized within the plane of the zzso phenomenon known as zzso cell polarity zzso In zzso manifestations of zzso are visible in the eye, wing, and zzso Several components of the zzso signaling have been characterized in flies and zzso including the zzso Go zzso However, Go signaling partners in zzso remain largely zzso Using a genetic screen we uncover zzso previously implicated in G protein and zzso zzso as a novel binding partner of zzso Through pull-down and genetic interaction studies, we find that Kermit interacts with Go and another zzso component zzso known to undergo zzso zzso during zzso zzso We further demonstrate that the activity of Kermit in zzso zzso relies on the motor zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our results place Kermit as a potential zzso of zzso linking zzso with motor proteins for its delivery to dedicated cellular compartments during zzso zzso
