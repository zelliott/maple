We have previously reported that the zzso light chain zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso Here we describe another member of the zzso family of zzso termed zzso which is also involved in zzso zzso We show not only that zzso stimulates the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso II zzso but also that zzso regulates the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso treatment causes zzso zzso whereas a zzso form of zzso prevents zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso blockade of zzso expression using small interfering zzso zzso decreased key zzso responses, including the induction of both zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso expression had no effect on these two major zzso responses under similar zzso Further, zzso was required for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso element zzso zzso activity, but not for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso responsive element zzso zzso zzso In order to assess the mechanisms underlying the preferential stimulation of zzso versus zzso zzso responses, zzso zzso analyses were performed, which demonstrate that zzso zzso preferential complex formation of zzso with zzso relative to zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso More importantly, we demonstrate that zzso has functions in zzso signaling that are distinct from those for zzso This is the first report to describe a differential requirement for unique zzso of a specific zzso family in zzso zzso zzso
