The zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions and factors that influence zzso signaling in TM cells are thought to play a pivotal role in the regulation of zzso zzso The current study was designed to evaluate the role of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in TM cell zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso human TM cells were zzso for zzso expression by zzso and Western zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso in TM cell zzso and zzso zzso the cell zzso and spreading zzso were performed on zzso culture plates in the presence and the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso zzso interactions on TM cell zzso arrangement and zzso light chain 2 zzso zzso was zzso 

We demonstrate here that zzso is expressed in the TM and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and spreading of TM cells to zzso zzso Cell spreading on zzso zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso light chain and the formation of stress fibers that was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by the zzso zzso zzso 

The above findings present a novel function for zzso in zzso zzso signaling in TM zzso This function may allow zzso to participate in the regulation of zzso zzso
