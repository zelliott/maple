zzso like zzso zzso and its analogue zzso zzso enhance zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso and activate various signaling pathways in pancreatic zzso in particular zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso In many cells these signals activate zzso zzso However, it is not clear whether the acute amplification of zzso by zzso involves in part zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso at high zzso caused release zzso zzso of the total rat zzso insulin content over 1 zzso While both zzso and zzso markedly zzso zzso in isolated rat and mouse zzso neither had an effect on zzso fuel and energy metabolism over a 5 zzso to 3 h time zzso zzso activated zzso without changing zzso usage and zzso fatty acid zzso zzso or zzso into various lipids in rat zzso zzso caused a rise in zzso and zzso but did not enhance energy zzso as neither oxygen consumption nor zzso zzso levels were zzso 

The results indicate that zzso barely affects zzso zzso metabolism and that zzso signaling does not significantly contribute to zzso zzso of zzso The data also indicate that insulin zzso is a minor energy consuming process in the zzso and that the zzso is different from most cell types in that its zzso zzso appears to be primarily governed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso process, rather than a zzso mechanism secondary to enhanced insulin release as well as to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
