The zzso zzso links nutritional status to immune zzso zzso signaling protects from zzso but the molecular mechanism is not zzso We developed an in zzso model of zzso cell interaction to test the hypothesis that zzso prevents zzso zzso in host zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso signaling increased cellular resistance to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso resistance in susceptible cells, and zzso stimulation enhanced zzso A series of zzso zzso signaling zzso showed that resistance to zzso zzso was dependent on zzso of zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso A common zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that increases zzso to zzso in humans and mice was found to increase zzso to zzso zzso in single zzso The zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso zzso by zzso relative to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with a central role of zzso signaling in zzso A subset of genes uniquely regulated by zzso in response to zzso was zzso Most notable were the zzso and zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso zzso which have opposing roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso genes were highly enriched in this gene set zzso zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso regulation of host zzso genes via zzso is responsible for zzso This is the first demonstration of a zzso signaling zzso that restricts zzso zzso and represents an important advance in our zzso understanding of how zzso links nutrition and zzso to zzso
