Well over 80 years ago Philip Smith described the beneficial clinical effects of zzso extracts in animal models of adrenal zzso In the ensuing years, scientists across the globe have sought to understand the mechanisms by which adrenal hormones and their synthetic zzso produce their complex and varied zzso zzso attention has focused on the zzso partly because they have a vital place in the treatment of inflammatory and zzso disorders but also because zzso of the zzso and/or activity of zzso zzso is increasingly implicated in a number of common disorders that pose a growing clinical burden, such as zzso type II diabetes, the zzso syndrome, hypertension and zzso This review considers some of the key advances that have been made in our understanding of the zzso pathology and pharmacology of the zzso zzso is placed on the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and the complex mechanisms that regulate the access of steroids in the systemic circulation to their receptors in their various target cells and zzso In addition, consideration is given to the irreversible zzso actions of zzso in zzso life and to the potential role of the steroids in the zzso of zzso
