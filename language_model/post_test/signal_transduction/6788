zzso are large zzso zzso complexes that activate zzso in response to diverse zzso danger zzso zzso components termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins act as sensors for zzso molecular patterns, stress, or danger zzso We discovered that zzso including zzso zzso and sodium zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by their respective zzso signals, anthrax lethal zzso zzso and zzso These compounds prevented the zzso zzso of zzso and the processing and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso was independent of protein synthesis zzso zzso protein breakdown, or zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso did not directly modify or inhibit the activity of zzso zzso zzso Rather, they induced a cellular state zzso to both the zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso which was reversed by the zzso oxygen species scavenger zzso but not by reducing agents or NO zzso zzso zzso provided protection against zzso anthrax lethal zzso cell death and prevented zzso zzso recruitment in a zzso zzso crystal inflammatory zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel role in zzso of the innate immune response for zzso compounds that have been used as zzso for a few hundred zzso
