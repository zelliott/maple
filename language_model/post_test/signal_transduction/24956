zzso in zzso zzso results in marked changes in gene expression that contribute to tissue defense and zzso Using a zzso zzso technique, we analyzed the timing, zzso and regulation of the expression of 150 genes in mechanically wounded leaves of zzso zzso zzso of a group of transcripts was correlated with the appearance of zzso signals of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is also insensitive to zzso allowed us to identify a large number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Water stress was found to contribute to the regulation of an unexpectedly large fraction of these zzso Comparing the results of mechanical wounding with damage by feeding larvae of the cabbage butterfly zzso zzso resulted in very different transcript zzso One gene was specifically induced by insect feeding but not by zzso moreover, there was a relative lack of water zzso gene expression during insect zzso These results help reveal a feeding strategy of zzso zzso that may minimize the zzso of a subset of water zzso zzso zzso
