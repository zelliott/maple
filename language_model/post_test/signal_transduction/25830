zzso disease zzso is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded zzso repeats in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may damage and kill zzso zzso by a mechanism involving reduced production of zzso zzso factor zzso and increased zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso shock zzso can stimulate the production of zzso and protect zzso against stress, we determined whether zzso treatment would modify the disease process and provide a therapeutic benefit in a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso or sham treatment was administered once weekly to male zzso zzso zzso mice beginning at 2 months of zzso zzso measured included motor function, zzso and cortical pathology, and levels of protein zzso and zzso zzso treatment delayed the onset of motor symptoms and body weight loss and extended the survival of HD zzso zzso zzso was attenuated and levels of protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were elevated in zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso HD zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso can increase the resistance of zzso to zzso zzso resulting in improved functional outcome and extended zzso The potential of zzso as an intervention in subjects that inherit the zzso zzso gene merits further zzso
