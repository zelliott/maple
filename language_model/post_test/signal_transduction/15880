zzso located in the zzso horn of the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso of skeletal zzso These zzso appear to be zzso affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso lateral zzso The dysfunction of zzso is typically accompanied by zzso of zzso metabolism and zzso as demonstrated by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso is generally accepted as zzso factor in the brain under acute toxic and neurodegenerative conditions and also appears to exert a protective role for zzso In the present study, we attempted to zzso the role of zzso zzso on zzso expression in the zzso cell line zzso and in zzso In a first step, we demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, as well as in the cervical and zzso parts, of the male mouse spinal zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso treatment on zzso zzso The application of zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso in zzso cells and in the cervical but not zzso part of the spinal zzso Our results indicate that zzso can influence the zzso system by increasing zzso expression in the mouse spinal zzso This mechanism might support zzso in addition to zzso mechanisms, in the zzso balance toxic or neurodegenerative zzso
