zzso zzso zzso approximately half the human zzso The outcomes of the infection range from zzso to gastric cancer and appear to be associated with the immunity to zzso zzso Patients developing zzso zzso present a zzso response without developing protective zzso suggesting that this zzso may have mechanisms to evade the immune response of the zzso Several zzso zzso proteins can impair zzso and T cell function in zzso through mechanisms that are poorly zzso We tested the effect of zzso zzso extracts and live zzso zzso on zzso cells and freshly isolated human normal T zzso to identify possible mechanisms by which the bacteria might impair T cell zzso zzso cells or activated T zzso cultured with an zzso zzso zzso had a reduced proliferation that was not caused by T cell zzso or impairment in the early T cell signaling zzso Instead, both the zzso zzso zzso and live zzso zzso induced a decreased expression of the zzso of the zzso zzso of live zzso zzso with T cells demonstrated that the zzso strain, but not the zzso zzso zzso depleted zzso and caused a decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reversed these zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is not only important for zzso production, but may also impair T cell function during zzso
