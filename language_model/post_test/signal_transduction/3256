Bone loss is caused by the zzso activity of zzso which degrade the zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso and mice lacking zzso exhibit an increase in bone mass, in part due to impairment of zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso at zzso following zzso zzso but the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso are poorly zzso In the current study, we examined the mechanism of action of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso Our studies reveal a novel mechanism for the interaction of zzso with zzso which involves the binding of zzso zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso activity and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso may be critical for terminating zzso zzso zzso and for stabilizing zzso reorganization during zzso bone zzso
