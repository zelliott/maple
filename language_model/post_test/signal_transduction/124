zzso oxide zzso zzso synaptic transmission, and its level is elevated during zzso activity in animal models of zzso However, the role of NO for development and maintenance of zzso activity is zzso We studied this aspect in rat zzso zzso slice cultures and acute zzso zzso slices from zzso and zzso NO zzso zzso zzso mice combining zzso and zzso imaging zzso Slice cultures contained zzso zzso and an elaborated network of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso concentration led to development of zzso activity and increased NO formation as revealed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso NO deprivation by zzso zzso and NO zzso caused depression of both zzso and zzso and prevented initiation of zzso events zzso in zzso of slice cultures and zzso of zzso zzso zzso This effect was independent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso initiation in acute slices from mice was achieved by both the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso suggesting that zzso activity was crucial for zzso zzso Additional evidence was obtained from zzso animals because zzso developed in a significantly lower percentage of slices from zzso mice and showed different zzso such as zzso of onset zzso and higher zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that enhancement of synaptic transmission by NO under zzso conditions represents a positive feedback mechanism for the initiation of zzso zzso
