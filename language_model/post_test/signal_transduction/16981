Vitamin D zzso has been associated with an increased risk of developing a number of zzso Here we investigated samples from 71 zzso individuals of the zzso study, a zzso high dose vitamin D3 intervention trial during Finnish winter, for their changes in serum zzso D3 zzso zzso and the expression of primary vitamin D target genes in peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso zzso A negative correlation between serum zzso of zzso hormone and zzso suggested an overall normal zzso vitamin D response among the zzso The genes zzso and zzso zzso are zzso primary vitamin D targets and showed to be suitable gene expression markers for vitamin D signaling in both primary zzso However, in a ranking of the samples concerning their expected response to vitamin D only the top half showed a positive correlation between the changes of zzso or zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso Interestingly, this categorization allows zzso a negative correlation between changes in serum zzso of zzso and the inflammation marker zzso zzso We propose the genes zzso and zzso as zzso zzso from which the effects of a vitamin D3 supplementation can be zzso These zzso allow the zzso of subjects into those, who might benefit from a vitamin D3 zzso and others who do zzso
