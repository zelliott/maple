The human zzso gene product zzso one member of the zzso family, is zzso by zzso stress, which causes zzso To investigate the zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein was screened using the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso factor, is released from the zzso into the zzso as the mature form showing zzso zzso activity during zzso in response to zzso zzso We found that zzso was able to interact with the mature form of zzso not with the precursor form of zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was shown to involve the zzso domain in zzso Also, the zzso domain of zzso was shown to be critical for the protein zzso Using the zzso zzso system and in zzso binding zzso the reduced form of zzso was able to interact with zzso Interestingly, the zzso activity given by the mature form of zzso was significantly activated by the binding to zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the specific protein interaction may participate as a molecular switch in modulating cell death in response to zzso zzso
