zzso zzso cells are susceptible to fatty zzso zzso The zzso zzso protects pancreatic zzso cells from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso level and promoter activity of zzso protein zzso 16 were significantly increased by zzso in zzso and zzso was a zzso of zzso The aim of the study was to assess the effects of zzso on fatty zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso content and zzso insulin zzso zzso were examined by zzso Western zzso was applied to detect protein zzso zzso was detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and flow zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso 

zzso cells with zzso of zzso were successfully established, and protein expression of zzso was zzso of that of control cells zzso P zzso zzso zzso content and zzso in zzso were substantially increased compared with those in control zzso When cells were zzso with zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso When cells were under zzso pressure, the zzso rate in zzso was zzso zzso zzso while it in zzso was zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, attenuated zzso zzso was observed, but the zzso in zzso activity was partially restored in zzso zzso Meanwhile, nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso was apparently reduced compared with that in control zzso 

zzso regulated insulin content and zzso in zzso cells by zzso and zzso activated zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso protected zzso cells from fatty zzso zzso by partially restoring zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso played important roles not only in insulin content and zzso but also in the zzso effect zzso by zzso zzso
