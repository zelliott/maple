The changes of zzso zzso zzso intensity and the activities of calcium channel of primary zzso root tip cells induced by zzso or zzso acid zzso were studied by both zzso techniques and the zzso patch clamping in this zzso The zzso zzso intensity increased while treated with zzso or zzso within 10 zzso illuminating that zzso participated in the process of zzso signal zzso For further proving the mechanism and origin of zzso zzso increase induced by zzso treatments, zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were added to the zzso solution in the experiments zzso The results showed that zzso zzso intensity induced by zzso was suppressed by both zzso and VP obviously in the root tip zzso The zzso zzso intensity of plants changed after the addition of zzso inhibitor zzso while subjected to zzso stress, which seemed to show that zzso participated in the process of signal zzso of zzso stress zzso The mechanism about it is unknown zzso Further, a zzso calcium permeable channel was recorded in plasma membrane of zzso root tip zzso The zzso current zzso intensity increased remarkably after zzso treatment, and the open zzso of the calcium zzso zzso Similar changes could be observed after zzso treatment, but the channel opened earlier and the current intensity was stronger than that of zzso zzso The zzso of calcium channel initiated by zzso strongly was inhibited by zzso VP or zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso participated in the signals zzso process of zzso stress, and the zzso free zzso increase by zzso stress mainly came from the zzso and some came from the release of zzso calcium zzso
