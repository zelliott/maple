zzso invasion is often observed in daily zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso although neither actual information about its occurrence nor molecular mechanisms leading to their invasive activities have been zzso In this study, our aim was to zzso the mode and the frequency of zzso invasion in this tumor and to characterize the tumor cell arrangement at the site of zzso zzso 

The mode and frequency of zzso invasion of zzso zzso zzso were zzso examined in 104 surgical specimens of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and tumor cell arrangements at the sites of zzso invasion were zzso zzso 

A total of 353 areas with zzso invasive changes were collected from 104 zzso The mode of zzso invasion was classified into two zzso type I: zzso invasion zzso areas, zzso and type II: zzso penetration (106 areas, zzso zzso zzso which was zzso zzso was shared by both type I and type II sites, while tumor cell zzso containing zzso structures were zzso in type II zzso These zzso were composed of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, apparent vascular involvement was recognized in 31 tumors zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso cells are able to invade into the capsule and involve blood vessels when they are situated in zzso zzso which accelerate zzso zzso
