In zzso zzso the cell wall is a barrier to zzso of proteins in the growth zzso Although small proteins are more easily released than bigger ones, other factors besides molecular zzso may play a role in zzso of zzso zzso By using several complementary approaches including zzso zzso quantitative zzso on zzso zzso and growth media, as well as a novel approach involving the use of flow zzso and specific zzso we show that zzso zzso of mature zzso greatly enhance zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso and facilitate extraction of zzso proteins in zzso zzso data obtained by flow zzso on whole cells indicate that this zzso acid sequence increases the fraction of zzso reaching the outer zzso zzso This zzso acid sequence may define a novel type of zzso zzso zzso the crossing of the zzso cell wall in zzso and zzso extraction of zzso proteins by zzso means in zzso
