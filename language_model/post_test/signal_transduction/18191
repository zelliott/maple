The objectives of the present study were zzso to determine whether oxidized LDL and zzso zzso a major zzso component of oxidized LDL, stimulate the migration of cultured human zzso cells and zzso to investigate the possible effects on zzso cell migration of the cardiac zzso peptides zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso LDL (10 and 100 zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso migration in a zzso zzso In contrast, the effects of native LDL and zzso were modest or zzso zzso zzso C zzso inhibitor and zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso inhibited oxidized zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso and human zzso significantly inhibited oxidized zzso and zzso migration in a zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso for zzso clearance zzso could not inhibit oxidized zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso migration was paralleled by an increase in the cellular level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso The results suggest that oxidized LDL and zzso stimulate the migration of human zzso cells, at least in part, through a zzso process and that zzso and zzso inhibit this zzso migration, probably through a zzso zzso
