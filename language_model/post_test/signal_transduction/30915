Fast synaptic current at most zzso zzso in the brain is carried by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso During development there is an increase in the ratio of zzso to zzso current at these zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso signaling early in development zzso regulates zzso expression and function at multiple levels, which likely accounts for the small zzso current at developing zzso This contrasts with the positive role of zzso signaling in recruiting zzso to zzso during long-term zzso in the adult zzso Thus, zzso exert differential effects on the recruitment of zzso receptors to zzso depending on the zzso state of the neural zzso
