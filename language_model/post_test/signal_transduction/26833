To investigate the effects of zzso acid zzso on the expression of type I and III collagen in human and rat zzso zzso cells zzso and to explore the role of zzso signaling zzso zzso 

Following zzso treatment, the cell viability and cell growth were detected to determine the optimal concentration of zzso The expressions of zzso zzso genes including type I and III collagen in human and rat zzso before and after zzso treatment were measured by real time zzso The expression of related proteins was verified by western zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso and zzso was detected by zzso The DNA binding activities of zzso zzso and zzso were measured by both zzso and zzso zzso factor activity zzso 

zzso could decrease the zzso and protein expression of zzso type I and III zzso increase the zzso expression in human and rat zzso zzso and reduce zzso level of zzso at 24 h and 48 h after zzso The DNA binding activities of zzso factors were suppressed by zzso in human and rat zzso at 24 zzso and the activities reduced in a time dependent manner with the lowest activities at 48 zzso especially for zzso 

zzso could inhibit the zzso and protein expression of type I and III collagen in human and rat zzso which may be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of DNA binding activities of zzso zzso and zzso
