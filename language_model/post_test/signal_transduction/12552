Although zzso zzso zzso and its binding to zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso signaling for zzso zzso in T cells, little is known regarding its role in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso binding are coupled to zzso zzso of zzso production, zzso zzso cell zzso and T cell zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso production was completely dependent on zzso zzso Further, zzso was found to require zzso zzso by zzso or zzso to cause T cell zzso zzso zzso this polarization induced by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso zzso alone was sufficient to zzso T cells directly and to increase T cell zzso whereas the loss of zzso in zzso primary T cells reduced zzso A zzso lacking zzso sites zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso production, zzso and zzso zzso polarization was also dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso Our findings provide evidence of an obligatory role for the zzso module in zzso zzso in T zzso
