There is emerging evidence that the zzso neural guidance factor zzso can also direct the growth of blood zzso We deleted the gene zzso zzso a zzso for the zzso family of guidance zzso specifically within the embryonic zzso of zzso The result is a profound structural and functional zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso which leads first to flow reversal in the zzso artery and ultimately to embryonic zzso As this is the only zzso site of vascular zzso in the zzso zzso and because the zzso cannot be rescued by a zzso zzso we propose that zzso signaling is a specific and autonomous component of zzso zzso zzso of zzso represents a unique example of a zzso that acts solely within the zzso zzso and one that faithfully zzso the structural and zzso characteristics of clinical zzso zzso This zzso but zzso restricted requirement for zzso is not unique to zzso development, as the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso similarly results in the specific and highly zzso absence of the zzso vessel, the precursor to the zzso zzso
