The role of bone zzso proteins zzso in the regulation of zzso function has been extensively investigated but the mechanism of regulation is not well zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso sheep on the number of primordial zzso and rate of zzso recruitment in comparison with that in normal zzso sheep in zzso Whole sheep zzso at the time of birth, zzso and 5 years old were collected and processed for the zzso zzso using zzso zzso methods and statistical zzso At birth, the total number of primordial zzso in zzso sheep was significantly lower than in zzso zzso At zzso and 5 years, a reversed pattern in zzso of zzso zzso was seen with significantly more primordial zzso than zzso In zzso the rate of primordial zzso recruitment to developing cohort was substantially lower in zzso zzso with only 51 and zzso of primordial zzso consumption at zzso and 5 years respectively compared to 92 and zzso in zzso zzso On other hand, the mean numbers of developing primary zzso were smaller in zzso sheep at the time of birth, yet, zzso zzso possess more primary zzso than zzso at zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso may in fact be a successful means of zzso zzso consumption, preventing unnecessary loss of zzso from the initial primordial zzso pool, hence increasing zzso longevity and zzso
