The zzso of upper respiratory zzso such as human zzso zzso forms a continuous barrier via tight zzso which is thought to be regulated in part through a protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso To investigate the mechanisms of the regulation of zzso tight junction barrier function of human zzso zzso in detail, primary human zzso zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In primary human zzso zzso cells, treatment with zzso led not only to zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso but also expression of novel zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso increased zzso electrical resistance, with tight junction barrier function more than zzso that of the control, together with zzso of tight junction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso Furthermore, it affected the zzso zzso of the tight junction proteins and the numbers of tight junction zzso The zzso of barrier function and tight junction proteins was prevented by a zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso In primary human zzso zzso cells, zzso factors zzso and zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain zzso The zzso of zzso using zzso interference resulted in zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso by treatment with zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso signaling enhances the barrier function of human zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso of tight junction zzso and the mechanisms may contribute to a drug delivery zzso
