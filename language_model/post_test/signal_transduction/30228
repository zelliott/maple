zzso base zzso such as zzso zzso accumulate in nuclear and zzso zzso under zzso stress, resulting in cell zzso However, it is not known which form of DNA is involved, whether nuclear or zzso nor is it known how the death order is zzso We established cells which selectively accumulate zzso in either type of DNA by expression of a nuclear or zzso form of human zzso DNA zzso in zzso mouse zzso The zzso of zzso in nuclear DNA caused zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso factor, whereas that in zzso DNA caused zzso dysfunction and zzso release, thereby zzso zzso Both cell deaths were triggered by zzso breaks zzso that had accumulated in the respective zzso and were suppressed by zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso by zzso zzso thus indicating that zzso of zzso opposite zzso lead to the zzso of zzso in each type of zzso zzso in nuclear DNA activated zzso whereas those in zzso DNA caused their zzso thereby initiating the two distinct pathways of cell zzso
