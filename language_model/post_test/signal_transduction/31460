The present study was aimed at zzso the use of the zzso zzso zzso as a marker of zzso function in cultured rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response and zzso characteristics of isolated zzso cells cultured in a zzso medium supplemented with an zzso zzso extract were monitored over time as part of zzso of our zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was analyzed and compared with that of another zzso zzso zzso B, as well as protein zzso into the media, w or zzso the presence of zzso or protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso fluid was obtained from zzso zzso zzso and the activities of zzso and zzso B were zzso A membrane fraction and a soluble fraction were obtained from isolated zzso cells and used for kinetic studies of zzso in comparison with that released from cultured cells, in the zzso zzso fluid and in zzso zzso zzso response was obtained when the cells had been in culture for 2-3 days, coinciding with the formation of zzso zzso zzso of the cultured cells by zzso or zzso zzso resulted in a more than zzso increase of zzso release over zzso whereas no effect on zzso B release could be zzso Treatment with the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso B could not be detected in rabbit zzso fluid, but zzso was easily measured in quantities corresponding to as low as zzso zzso of tear zzso Using zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso the zzso in zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of the zzso zzso the soluble zzso rabbit serum or activity zzso from cultured zzso zzso is zzso by rabbit zzso zzso in zzso and by zzso cells in primary culture, whereas zzso B is not zzso under the conditions zzso zzso therefore provides a versatile marker for zzso in studies of tear production utilizing the rabbit as a zzso Our results also indicate that zzso is an important regulator of rabbit zzso zzso zzso
