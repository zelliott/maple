zzso an zzso acid signaling zzso isolated from tomato leaves, has been found to be an integral component of the zzso acid signaling pathway, leading to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso The discovery of zzso has led to a search for other zzso signals involved in defense in the zzso and in other plant zzso A new class of peptides having similar signaling properties but little sequence zzso to zzso have been found and termed zzso zzso zzso zzso These small zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso are derived from larger precursor proteins zzso and until recently were thought to function only in protection from zzso zzso However, zzso peptides isolated from zzso induced the zzso zzso known for its involvement in pathogen zzso More recently, a zzso zzso was isolated from sweet zzso a member of the zzso family and found to induce the zzso gene which codes for the major storage protein in zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso These recent discoveries expand the function and range of the zzso family of zzso and establish these unique zzso signaling molecules as potential components of defense pathways throughout the zzso zzso we review the signaling and structural properties of zzso and the zzso zzso and their roles in the induction of zzso
