The mechanism of action of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and then incubated with zzso zzso beta for varying zzso zzso caused a rapid increase in zzso production zzso 2 fold at 30 zzso This zzso enhancement of zzso zzso was abolished by zzso of the cells with zzso zzso Interestingly, a similar zzso induced increase in zzso was observed when the cells were zzso with zzso zzso These results appear to suggest a novel mode of action of zzso which involves a zzso zzso breakdown of a membrane zzso resulting in the production of zzso It is suggested that one possible candidate for this parent zzso may be a zzso zzso
