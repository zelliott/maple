zzso receptors are core components of the zzso signaling zzso and play a central role in cell fate decisions during development as well as tissue zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso at the zzso site by an zzso zzso and at the zzso site by the zzso zzso Recent X-ray structures of the negative regulatory region zzso of the zzso zzso reveal an zzso fold where three protective zzso repeats zzso of the zzso shield the zzso zzso site housed in the zzso zzso zzso One of the models explaining how zzso binding drives the zzso zzso from a zzso state to a zzso one zzso a mechanical force exerted on the zzso upon zzso zzso Here, we combined zzso zzso simulations and zzso zzso modeling to investigate the intrinsic and zzso folding and unfolding mechanisms of the human zzso zzso The simulations support that external force applied to the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso domain in a zzso largely sequential zzso zzso the mechanical force can further drive local unfolding of the HD domain in a functionally relevant fashion that would provide full zzso access to the zzso site prior to zzso zzso We further analyzed local structural features, intrinsic folding free energy surfaces, and correlated motions of the HD zzso The results are consistent with a model in which the HD domain possesses inherent zzso characteristics that could be zzso during zzso zzso This potential role of the HD domain in zzso zzso zzso may have implications for understanding normal and zzso zzso zzso
