Because of the increasing diversity of data sets and measurement techniques in biology, a growing spectrum of modeling methods is being zzso It is generally recognized that it is critical to pick the appropriate method to exploit the amount and type of biological data available for a given zzso Here, we describe a method for use in situations where zzso data from a network is collected over multiple time points, and in which little prior information is available about the zzso mathematical structure, and statistical distribution of the zzso Our method results in models that we term zzso exterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We illustrate the zzso utility using zzso gene expression data from zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso use of the zzso characteristics of the network leads to quantifiable improvements in its zzso ability over zzso models that only rely on the spatial characteristics of the zzso The zzso model provides exploratory zzso of network behavior and structure, which can identify features that suggest additional zzso A new extension is also presented that uses the zzso model to generate a comb zzso a figure that presents a list of possible network structures ranked by zzso By being able to zzso a zzso of interaction zzso this helps to direct future zzso
