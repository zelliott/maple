There have been several attempts to prevent the tumor growth and the resulting zzso However, almost none of the developed methods designed to inhibit tumor growth gives a zzso result without deleterious side zzso Some of the existing methods employed on prevention of tumor growth and invasion target the zzso differences between normal and tumor zzso The most pronounced zzso differences between normal and tumor cells appear to be in the energy generating zzso The energy generating pathways in normal cells are zzso and the most developed zzso controls the activity of the least developed zzso Cancer cells do not respond to these regulations and as a result energy generating pathways start to operate zzso Among the energy generating zzso the least developed or the most primitive zzso is the zzso zzso The increased activity of this zzso has been suggested to provide the cells with sufficient zzso zzso It has been suggested that in zzso zzso zzso is broken down to zzso in a manner that requires zzso Here, I zzso that manipulation of zzso zzso zzso as protecting the cells form zzso stress may efficiently inhibit tumor zzso zzso is a soluble zzso and its concentration is high in prenatal tissue and in cancer zzso Though its primary function seems to combat against zzso injury and toxic zzso zzso is implicated in many other different cellular processes including cell proliferation and DNA and zzso zzso Another function of zzso relevant to the subject is its involvement in zzso of zzso a compound that is generated at high zzso in rapidly zzso cells possessing an zzso activity on cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso concentration may zzso impact the tumor cell growth by at least three zzso The first is through zzso of zzso zzso that provides zzso energy for zzso The second is through the zzso of zzso metabolism and the third is through the zzso regulation of DNA and zzso zzso
