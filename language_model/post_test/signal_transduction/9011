zzso tight junctions recruit different types of zzso proteins that regulate cell proliferation and zzso Little is known about how such proteins interact functionally and zzso with each zzso Here, we focus on the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso first cousin, which are two zzso zzso proteins that regulate zzso Our data show that the two proteins interact and that zzso activity is zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the nucleus and activates zzso zzso regulating zzso another type of zzso zzso zzso remains in the zzso and partially zzso with the exchange zzso zzso and zzso are required for expression of zzso zzso zzso a crucial zzso zzso target zzso and zzso zzso D1 promoter activity requires zzso Our data thus indicate that zzso and zzso form a zzso module that mediates zzso zzso D1 promoter zzso and zzso
