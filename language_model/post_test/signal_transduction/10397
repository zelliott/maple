zzso views of zzso action hold that the zzso factor zzso is zzso bound to target genes with zzso zzso occurring via zzso zzso However, we report that within several zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso Upon exposure of zzso to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso becomes rapidly bound to DNA zzso with zzso at its zzso regulatory site, zzso This zzso zzso binding is independent of zzso zzso zzso and is not affected by zzso of the zzso or zzso signaling zzso Instead, zzso regulates zzso binding by initiating a zzso zzso signaling zzso that leads to zzso of nuclear proteins that associate with zzso target zzso zzso manipulation of zzso in zzso and analysis of mice lacking zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso suggest that NO mediates zzso and zzso expression of zzso target zzso Thus, in conjunction with zzso zzso the NO zzso controls zzso binding and zzso gene zzso
