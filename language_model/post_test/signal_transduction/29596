The human zzso zzso zzso gene has a complex promoter that produces alternate zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso zzso in the breast, zzso tract and many cell lines despite the lack of a classical zzso responsive element zzso in the promoter zzso We employed zzso zzso zzso to analyze the sites of zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso occupancy of the zzso promoters in zzso We also assessed the functional relevance of zzso zzso levels on the accessibility of zzso factors to the promoter and subsequent zzso zzso We zzso zzso human breast cancer cells that express zzso in response to zzso and the zzso derived C4 cell strain that has lost zzso expression as a model zzso We found that zzso levels of zzso zzso were not decreased in C4 cells, but that access was partially blocked for zzso and completely blocked for zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso at six localized regions of the promoter did show some differences between cell lines, but it did not correlate with zzso factor zzso Furthermore, we found only a modest and highly localized change in zzso zzso levels in response to zzso at only one of three sites of zzso binding in zzso zzso This was at the B1 site at the zzso zzso end of the zzso This site also showed a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso in C4 compared to zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso level at this site may be a marker for zzso structure that affects the access of zzso factors to the whole zzso
