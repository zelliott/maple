The majority of breast tumors at primary diagnosis are zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso mediates its effects by binding to the zzso zzso targeting the zzso stimulation of tumor growth reduce mortality from zzso breast zzso However, resistance remains a major clinical zzso 

To identify molecular mechanisms associated with resistance to zzso we assessed the zzso changes in global gene expression during adaptation to long-term culture of zzso human breast cancer cells in the absence of zzso zzso long term zzso deprived zzso that leads to recovery of zzso status and models resistance to an zzso inhibitor zzso The expression levels of proteins were determined by western zzso zzso zzso were carried out using the dual zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso reporter zzso were used to determine effects on zzso zzso Changes in recruitment of zzso to the gene regulated by zzso in breast cancer 1 zzso promoter were determined by zzso zzso zzso Gene expression data were derived from 81 zzso women with zzso BC zzso and at zzso zzso with single agent zzso in a zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was significantly elevated as early as one week post zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this became the top zzso zzso at the point of zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso protein levels were elevated in the zzso cells compared to wild type zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed proliferation in zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso by zzso the zzso and reducing recruitment of amplified in breast zzso zzso and the zzso binding protein zzso to the promoter of the zzso gene zzso High zzso in primary zzso breast cancer of 81 patients prior to zzso treatment with an zzso was associated with poorer zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased after two weeks of zzso therapy zzso fold, P zzso zzso 

These zzso and clinical data indicate that the zzso signaling zzso merits clinical evaluation as a therapeutic target with zzso therapy in zzso breast zzso
