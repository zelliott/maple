In plants, hydrogen zzso zzso plays a major signaling role in triggering both a defense response and cell zzso Increased cellular zzso levels and subsequent zzso imbalances are managed at the production and scavenging zzso Because zzso are the major zzso zzso that remove the bulk of cellular zzso altering their levels allows in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased sensitivity toward both ozone and zzso zzso cell death in transgenic zzso zzso zzso These plants were used as a model system to build a comprehensive inventory of zzso variations, which were triggered by zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso In addition to an zzso and zzso type of zzso response during light stress, zzso analysis on both control and transgenic zzso plants, exposed to 0, 3, 8, and 23 h of zzso revealed several specific regulatory patterns of gene zzso Thus, zzso zzso has a direct impact on zzso programs in zzso
