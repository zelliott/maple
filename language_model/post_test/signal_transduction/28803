In whole zzso zzso studies major gene expression changes are easily identified, but it is a challenge to capture small, but biologically important, zzso zzso programs can capture small effects but may have the disadvantage of being restricted to functionally zzso zzso A structured approach toward the identification of major and small changes for interpretation of biological effects is zzso We present a structured approach, a zzso that addresses different considerations in 1) the identification of zzso genes in zzso data sets and 2) the interpretation of their biological zzso The steps of this framework include gene ranking, gene selection, gene zzso and biological zzso Random forests zzso which takes zzso interactions into account, is examined to rank and select zzso For human, zzso and rat whole zzso zzso less than half of the zzso on the array are zzso zzso zzso analysis tools ignore half of the information present in the zzso data zzso The framework described takes all genes into zzso zzso is a useful tool to rank genes by taking interactions into zzso zzso a zzso approach, we were able to define an objective threshold for gene zzso zzso combined with zzso maps identified genes with coordinated but small gene expression responses that were not fully zzso but corresponded to the same biological zzso The presented approach provides a flexible framework for biological interpretation of zzso data zzso It includes all genes in the data set, takes zzso interactions into account, and provides an objective threshold for gene zzso
