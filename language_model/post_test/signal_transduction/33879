zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays important roles in regulating lung zzso However, the specific regulatory functions of zzso zzso in developing lung zzso versus zzso cells are still zzso By zzso the expression pattern of the zzso type II zzso zzso was first determined in the developing mouse zzso The functions of zzso in developing lung were then determined by zzso knocking out zzso in the lung zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso mice versus zzso of zzso zzso zzso was expressed only in zzso airway zzso at early gestation zzso day zzso but in both airway zzso and zzso from zzso zzso to zzso day zzso zzso of zzso in mouse lung zzso resulted in zzso of zzso lung zzso with markedly decreased type I zzso zzso cells, while no zzso in prenatal lung development was zzso In contrast, blockade of zzso in zzso zzso including lung zzso resulted in mildly abnormal lung branching and reduced cell proliferation after zzso accompanied by multiple defects in other zzso including zzso zzso The primary lung branching zzso was verified in embryonic lung zzso zzso The novel findings of the present study suggest that transforming growth zzso type II zzso transforming growth zzso zzso plays distinct roles in lung zzso versus zzso to zzso control specific stages of lung zzso
