zzso zzso has two zzso islands zzso separate type three zzso systems zzso zzso zzso through these systems facilitate invasion and zzso After entry, zzso reside within a membrane bound zzso the zzso containing zzso zzso where zzso of a second set of zzso by the zzso zzso island 2 zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be induced by conditions that mimic the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso mass zzso we mapped the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso under zzso conditions and identified 108 zzso using zzso signal prediction software, zzso of proteins identified contained a signal zzso Of these zzso 13 were known zzso zzso proteins including zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although surprisingly five were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while 2 proteins zzso and zzso are zzso by both zzso This is the first in zzso study to demonstrate dual zzso of zzso and zzso proteins by zzso zzso and demonstrates the potential of zzso zzso sequencing for the identification of novel zzso providing a platform for subsequent comparative zzso analysis, which should greatly assist understanding of the zzso and inherent variation between zzso of zzso and ultimately help towards development of novel control zzso
