In contrast to the zzso role of zzso signals during zzso the contribution of zzso signaling to zzso progression is controversial, despite several decades of investigating the role of zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that during zzso zzso zzso zzso signals are zzso for entry into zzso and for zzso zzso zzso However, normal zzso zzso is essential for completion of zzso I and zzso of the first polar zzso In this study, we test the contribution of several downstream zzso in zzso the zzso effects during zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso are not critical downstream zzso zzso during zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of Aurora zzso A zzso protein is disrupted in cells deprived of zzso zzso Since zzso is required for bipolar zzso formation, failure to accumulate zzso may contribute to the defective zzso zzso following zzso zzso These findings argue that zzso zzso is important in establishing the zzso competence to undergo maturation in preparation for zzso and embryonic zzso
