zzso stress is implicated in zzso yet most clinical trials with zzso particularly vitamin zzso have failed to protect against zzso zzso A striking exception is zzso which zzso zzso in carotid arteries and zzso of coronary arteries after zzso Because zzso has in zzso zzso effects independent of zzso zzso zzso we investigated the mode of action of zzso in zzso We used three models of vascular disease: zzso zzso mice, a model of zzso rabbit zzso balloon injury, a model of zzso and carotid injury in obese zzso rats, a model of type 2 zzso zzso we observed that the zzso zzso of zzso were insufficient, whereas its zzso atoms were required for zzso zzso and its zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso protected via zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso stimulating zzso and zzso vascular smooth muscle cell zzso These processes were zzso via induction of zzso zzso zzso an activity not shared by vitamin zzso Our findings identify zzso as the molecular target of zzso They indicate zzso rather than radical zzso zzso as important contributors to zzso and point to novel lead compounds for therapeutic intervention against zzso zzso
