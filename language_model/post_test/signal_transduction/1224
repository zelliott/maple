zzso exposure in zzso is required for normal zzso and is also a hallmark of zzso It results from zzso of a zzso zzso which has been shown to be differently zzso by zzso and during zzso thus suggesting that zzso may be involved in zzso exposure in zzso It is also well known that local zzso can expose zzso in zzso and affect the zzso metabolism in other zzso Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the specific involvement of zzso in zzso exposure in zzso For this purpose, we zzso zzso exposure by local zzso and avoided any external zzso by performing all experiments in the absence of added zzso We report that zzso exposure, induced by the zzso local zzso zzso and zzso was accompanied by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso c release, zzso of zzso 9 and 3 to active zzso as well as a prolonged increase in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in the absence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso induced a smaller transient increase in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso but did not induce any other phenomena, nor zzso zzso However, zzso exposure and zzso induced by zzso still occurred in spite of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus we conclude that zzso exposure in zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso engagement in an zzso zzso in zzso could lead to zzso exposure without the participation of zzso
