zzso fetal growth depends on zzso transfer of nutrients and gases from the zzso thus, as pregnancy progresses, the zzso must grow to meet the increasing demands of the developing zzso zzso control zzso zzso and survival of zzso in zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso the zzso of which is also regulated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain containing protein zzso zzso zzso is crucial for mouse zzso development and is known to mediate zzso actions in other zzso In this study we examined the role of zzso in regulating zzso proliferation in human zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is expressed strongly in zzso and only zzso in zzso After small interfering zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examined using zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso to mediate these zzso zzso of zzso differentiation were elevated after zzso zzso This study demonstrates a role for zzso zzso in human zzso and establishes zzso as a component of the zzso signaling zzso that is required for normal zzso zzso
