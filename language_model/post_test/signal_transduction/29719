The response of tumor cells to the unusual form of DNA damage caused by zzso poisons such as zzso zzso is poorly zzso and knowledge regarding which drugs can be effectively combined with zzso is zzso To better understand the response of tumor cells to zzso and to identify potential targets for zzso therapy, we examined global changes in zzso abundance in zzso cells after zzso treatment using zzso zzso zzso which include all zzso human genes zzso probe zzso zzso analysis of the data using a zzso zzso test and a modified zzso and zzso correction for multiple hypotheses testing identified 188 probe sets that are induced and zzso that are zzso 8 h after zzso treatment at a False Discovery Rate of zzso and a minimum zzso zzso This zzso approach led us to identify two pathways that are zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells in our lab and prior animal model studies performed elsewhere confirm that zzso of these respective pathways zzso enhance zzso zzso suggesting their potential as targets for zzso therapy with zzso
