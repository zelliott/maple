The zzso cells zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso belong to a zzso hormone signaling hierarchy that directs an episodic and stereotyped behavior pattern, zzso The zzso cells respond to declining zzso zzso at the end of the final zzso zzso with a zzso decrease in spike threshold and the abrupt release of the previously stockpiled zzso zzso hormone zzso This report describes zzso zzso recordings of acutely isolated zzso cell zzso made to identify membrane currents that may zzso the increase in zzso cell zzso during zzso release and that may contribute to abrupt zzso zzso There were at least three zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The inward current was carried exclusively by a zzso inward zzso current zzso and the outward currents were a combination of a zzso outward zzso current zzso and a zzso zzso outward zzso zzso the A current zzso In zzso recordings, the currents present in the acutely isolated zzso were sufficient to generate membrane properties similar to those observed in the zzso cells in zzso This study represents the first step toward characterization of the mechanisms underlying the abrupt release of zzso stores from the zzso cells preceding zzso
