The present study investigates the potential role of zzso in maintaining stem zzso properties and therapeutic resistance in zzso zzso zzso 

Western zzso flow zzso and cell viability zzso were used to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso drug resistance and expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor 4 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cassette zzso G member 2 zzso as well as zzso zzso in the drug resistant cell line zzso and its parental cell zzso 

zzso induced growth zzso and significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in the wild type zzso cells zzso The zzso of zzso was also enhanced about zzso in zzso In contrast, the zzso cells, which showed significantly higher zzso expression and zzso for various drugs, no significant difference in cell proliferation was observed between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was significantly lower than in the wild type cells zzso Moreover, zzso induced the zzso of zzso and additional treatment with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso I zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso plays an important role in enhancing the stem zzso properties and to induce zzso resistance of leukemia zzso The zzso of the zzso signaling zzso may be involved in the regulation of this zzso zzso
