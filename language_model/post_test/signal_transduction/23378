zzso zzso syndrome must be recognized as a serious issue due to its implication on long term health regardless of an zzso zzso zzso and insulin resistance are zzso as approximately zzso of women with zzso are insulin zzso However, the detailed molecular basis for insulin resistance that is coupled with zzso remains poorly zzso 

To review the published evidence that zzso in genes that are involved in insulin zzso and action are associated with an increased risk of zzso 

We reviewed articles published through November 2012 which concerned zzso of genes related to insulin signaling and zzso zzso as well as their associations with zzso The articles were identified via zzso zzso 

No consistent evidence emerged of a strong association between the risk of zzso and any known gene that is related to insulin signaling and zzso zzso Moreover, recent zzso association studies are inconsistent in identifying the associations between zzso and insulin metabolism zzso Many of the studies reviewed were limited by zzso in the zzso diagnosis and by not have having a sufficient number of study zzso Further studies are warranted to determine zzso risk factors which could modify environmental factors and thus reduce the risk of zzso Large zzso association studies devoted solely to zzso will be necessary to identify new candidate genes and proteins that are involved in zzso zzso
