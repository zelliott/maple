Research using zzso burn models has defined significant cardiac deficits after burn zzso The zzso response to burn and burn complicated by zzso including the cardiac dysfunction associated with these zzso remains a very complex zzso process which, despite active study, remains zzso The zzso inflammatory zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso continue to play an active role in zzso cardiac zzso However, perhaps of greater interest are the late zzso high mobility group box 1 and zzso migration zzso factor, because they offer a very realistic window for therapeutic intervention for controlling the inflammatory zzso In addition, several other zzso of cardiac dysfunction have been identified and include the heat shock zzso zzso and the inflammatory zzso These new zzso provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention, but further research is needed to clarify the importance of their mechanisms of action and the complex interactions between these various signaling zzso
