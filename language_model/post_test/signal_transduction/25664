The epidemic of obesity and diabetes is causing an increased zzso of zzso heart zzso While the primary zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso levels resulting from an imbalance in energy availability and zzso increasing evidence suggests a relationship between zzso of membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we report that the zzso easily shocked zzso zzso that harbor a zzso in zzso zzso synthesis display zzso and defects in cardiac relaxation and are prone to developing cardiac arrest and zzso under zzso The zzso zzso hearts exhibit elevated zzso of zzso suggestive of a zzso zzso heart zzso Moreover, the low zzso levels in zzso flies mimic the effects of cholesterol zzso in zzso by stimulating the zzso zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling adversely affects heart function, reflecting the cardiac zzso zzso whereas suppressing zzso or zzso target gene function in zzso hearts zzso the cardiac zzso and heart function zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso signaling that alters zzso activity contributes to the progression of impaired heart function in flies and identifies a potential link to zzso cardiac diseases in zzso
