zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drives cell invasion through three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso barriers dominated by type I collagen or zzso Based largely on analyses of its impact on cell function under two-dimensional culture conditions, zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso with 1) a structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) a zzso zzso domain that regulates zzso recognition as well as zzso and 3) a type I zzso domain whose zzso tail controls zzso trafficking and signaling zzso The zzso zzso that zzso cell trafficking through 3-D zzso barriers in zzso or in zzso however, remain largely zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso activity is not confined strictly to the zzso zzso zzso or zzso domain sequences of zzso Indeed, even a zzso zzso supports invasion when zzso to the cell surface in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso tail zzso By contrast, the ability of zzso to support zzso activity zzso from zzso potential, and zzso it requires the specific participation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso are unexpectedly embedded within zzso but zzso sequences that serve to zzso the requisite zzso activity to the surface of zzso zzso
