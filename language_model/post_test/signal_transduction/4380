zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are common complications of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is due in part of expression of tissue factor on zzso cells in response to zzso including zzso beta zzso beta ) and tumor necrosis factor zzso Both zzso and zzso beta are thought to play significant roles in producing the zzso manifestations of zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso beta zzso of zzso and the ability of zzso products to promote tissue factor expression by zzso zzso Human zzso were treated with zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or bacterial zzso zzso The zzso were removed, and zzso cultured 18 zzso The zzso zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso beta zzso and for their ability to induce tissue factor expression on human zzso vein zzso cells and the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso alone did not promote zzso zzso or zzso beta zzso However, zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso exposed to zzso plus zzso promoted greater tissue factor expression on zzso cells than zzso from those treated with zzso zzso zzso did not increase zzso zzso in response to zzso but did enhance zzso zzso beta zzso and tissue zzso zzso Neither zzso nor active zzso zzso the level of zzso for zzso above that induced by zzso zzso However, both increased the zzso level of zzso beta zzso Thus, zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso by zzso zzso the effects on these two zzso were zzso by different zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso beta zzso was largely zzso via the zzso zzso type zzso zzso and correlated with an increase in the steady state level of zzso By contrast, enhanced zzso required zzso active zzso but was not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso relevant amounts of zzso can zzso with zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso could thereby play a role in the complex network of zzso involved in the zzso of zzso We speculate that limiting zzso activity during zzso could be a beneficial adjunct in the management of zzso
