A variety of zzso modifications such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso cellular signals, which culminate in changes in gene zzso In this article we examine the ways in which selective protein degradation provides an extra dimension to the regulation of such zzso zzso We discuss zzso how both zzso and zzso systems are used to zzso zzso and zzso family zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso with degradation, zzso signal propagation contingent upon the selective degradation of zzso zzso exemplified by the degradation of zzso to activate zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppression of zzso pathways by turnover of the zzso factors zzso and zzso
