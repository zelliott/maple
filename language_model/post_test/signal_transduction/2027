zzso zzso receptors constitute a zzso system zzso interactions in the small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso provoke major functional zzso in the large zzso zzso With two-dimensional zzso zzso we examined two synthetic peptides zzso and zzso encompassing the zzso regions of the zzso domain motifs from the zzso zzso complex zzso These zzso regions contain two zzso zzso represented by zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso interaction consists of two adjacent zzso with zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso heavily implicated in the zzso zzso region, as is zzso of zzso These zzso are situated within the zzso motifs of their respective zzso Further structural analysis of this unique zzso zzso suggests that two distinct zzso are zzso The major structural difference between the two zzso is a bend in the zzso between zzso and zzso whereas the zzso character in the other regions remains zzso Earlier zzso analysis has shown that a salt bridge between the side chains of zzso and zzso is zzso When this zzso pair was modeled into both zzso increased nuclear zzso effect violations suggested that the more bent structure was less able to accommodate this zzso These results provide a molecular level rationalization for previously reported zzso studies, as well as a basis for an atomic level understanding of the zzso interactions that regulate zzso zzso
