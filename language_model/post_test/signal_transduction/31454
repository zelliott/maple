The zzso growth factors zzso play a major role in regulating the systemic growth of zzso However, it is unclear to what extent their systemic and/or local functions act in concert with other local growth factors controlling the sizes of individual zzso We have specifically addressed whether growth control of the skeleton by zzso interacts genetically with that by Indian zzso zzso a locally produced growth signal for the zzso zzso Here, we report that disruption of both zzso and zzso signaling resulted in additive reduction in the size of the embryonic zzso Thus, zzso and zzso signaling appear to control the growth of the skeleton in parallel zzso
