zzso has been studied in the context of brain development, but whether it plays a role in the formation of brain tumors is zzso We demonstrate that the introduction of zzso active zzso into zzso cells of embryonic day zzso mice causes the formation of zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso arose in the fourth zzso in zzso of animals and were associated with zzso They were microscopically highly similar to zzso zzso zzso in humans, with an ongoing proliferation rate of zzso Signs of zzso zzso activity were also present in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso were elevated over those in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso approximately zzso in one case, suggesting that the role of this zzso in zzso may not be specific to zzso Our findings indicate that activated zzso can function as an zzso in the developing brain, and link the zzso zzso to human zzso zzso
