Several protein zzso zzso zzso expressed in insulin zzso are proposed to zzso insulin action and could act as key regulators of the insulin zzso zzso signaling zzso Among these zzso zzso is expressed in relatively high levels in zzso zzso We show that zzso knockout mice have reduced plasma zzso and insulin zzso in the zzso state compared with their zzso zzso The knockout animals were also more sensitive to zzso insulin as zzso by zzso zzso Despite increased zzso insulin sensitivity, zzso zzso of the zzso was not increased in muscle of zzso animals, as would be expected in zzso zzso Instead, the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were reduced in the muscle of knockout animals zzso with insulin in zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso was essentially identical between both groups of zzso zzso muscles isolated from zzso mice did not have a significant increase in zzso zzso in response to insulin, suggesting that zzso did not play a direct role in this zzso Taken together, our results suggest an indirect zzso of the zzso signaling pathways by zzso Since low dose injection of growth hormone zzso zzso the response to zzso insulin in zzso mice, we propose that the insulin hypersensitivity observed in zzso mice is secondary to their neuroendocrine zzso and zzso zzso
