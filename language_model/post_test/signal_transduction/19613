The last two decades have come up with some important zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and bio zzso zzso that have provided new insight into zzso mechanisms, occurring in the central nervous system zzso in spinal zzso 

In previous works, emerging from our theoretical and practical endeavors in the field, we have thoroughly described the principal intimate propensity and the zzso zzso intrinsic limitations for zzso after zzso and, at the same time, subtle targets for zzso reviewed the main related zzso zzso The aim of this paper is to emphasize the connections between such main aspects and some feasible zzso solutions, including the ones for clinical zzso 

zzso we stress upon some therapeutic suggestions regarding this subject matter by zzso the most up to date and efficient zzso within major limits, according to the very low capacities of zzso spinal zzso zzso to zzso self preserve and zzso Moreover, we also talk about accessible drugs, respectively those being already in clinical use (but at present, mainly used to treat other conditions, including the neurological ones) and zzso with relatively well known, determined effects and/or respectively, zzso 

The recent advances in the knowledge on the basic components of the zzso mentioned zzso SC propensity for self destroying and inefficient zzso repair mechanisms in the actual new context, will hopefully be, from now on, more effectively correlated with zzso still zzso especially by using stem cells within tissue engineering, including, if needed, more zzso approaches, based on zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso 

This paper contains the scientific motivated highlighting of some already available drugs, zzso (and not only) properties too, which enable practitioners with (although not yet capable to zzso anyway) more efficient therapeutic means, to approach the extremely difficult and still painfully disappointing domain, of spinal zzso injury zzso
