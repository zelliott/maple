zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso nitrogen species zzso are produced in many places in living cells and at an increased rate during zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in signal zzso but also modify cellular components and cause zzso We first look at the most common zzso and their zzso We then consider the ways in which the cell can regulate their production and zzso We critically assess current knowledge about modifications of zzso fatty acids zzso DNA, zzso and proteins and illustrate this knowledge with case stories wherever zzso Some zzso breakdown products, zzso from zzso can cause secondary zzso Other zzso products are secondary signaling zzso We consider the fate of the modified zzso the energetic costs to the cell of replacing such zzso as well as strategies to minimize transfer of zzso damaged components to the next zzso
