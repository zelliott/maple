Although circulating levels of zzso 8 zzso a potent zzso zzso and many other inflammatory zzso increase in response to zzso zzso only a small proportion of patients develop a clinically significant systemic inflammatory zzso The natural mechanisms that control the inflammatory response are poorly zzso To investigate the role of zzso in a human inflammatory model, 15 adult patients undergoing zzso bypass for zzso coronary artery bypass zzso were zzso Following zzso plasma zzso levels increased significantly from 58 zzso zzso and 66 zzso (after 20 zzso of zzso to 98 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), but this was accompanied by a zzso zzso decrease in the zzso binding affinity of circulating zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 20 zzso of bypass zzso zzso zzso release of zzso and zzso by peripheral blood zzso ex zzso was also zzso following zzso There were no significant changes in beta 2 zzso expression or zzso zzso metabolism of peripheral blood zzso These changes in zzso affinity and zzso responsiveness to zzso may represent an important in zzso regulatory mechanism which serves to prevent excessive tissue injury from inflammatory zzso
