We show that cells deleted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not take up zzso and cannot grow on media containing zzso as a sole carbon zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in these cells resulted in zzso transport and allowed growth on zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso or growth on zzso zzso is highly expressed on zzso low zzso or zzso carbon sources but is zzso in the presence of high zzso of zzso The maintenance of zzso zzso repression is strictly dependent on zzso and not on zzso zzso In zzso delta cells expression of zzso is zzso even when the entire repertoire of zzso genes is present and zzso zzso is zzso In addition, zzso repression of zzso does not require zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso We show that a signal zzso zzso defined by the zzso zzso regulation of zzso is distinct from but also zzso with general zzso regulation pathways in zzso zzso Finally, zzso repression of zzso and zzso is intact in zzso delta zzso delta zzso delta zzso delta zzso delta zzso delta zzso delta zzso cells, suggesting that the sensing and signaling mechanism for general zzso repression is independent from zzso zzso
