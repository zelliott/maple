Ethanol zzso administration to rats for 4 zzso markedly decreased zzso content in several zzso including zzso Total cellular zzso accounted for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso from zzso and control rats, respectively, and paralleled a zzso decrease in cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso or acute zzso administration did not elicit an zzso of zzso from liver cells of zzso rats while releasing zzso of total tissue zzso content from zzso of control zzso Despite the zzso decrease in zzso content, zzso from zzso rats did not accumulate zzso following stimulation of protein zzso C signaling pathway, whereas control zzso accumulated approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso zzso and transport are markedly impaired in liver cells after prolonged exposure to zzso The inability of liver cells, and possibly other zzso to accumulate zzso can help explain the reduction in tissue zzso content following chronic alcohol zzso
