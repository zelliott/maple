Cell polarization is an zzso zzso process that zzso zzso distribution of zzso and proteins and that is modified zzso during zzso processes such as cell division, migration, and zzso The plasticity with which cells change their behavior and zzso in response to cell intrinsic and zzso cues is an essential feature of normal zzso In disease states such as cancer, cells lose their ability to behave normally in response to zzso zzso A molecular understanding of mechanisms that alter the behavior of cancer cells is zzso Cell polarity proteins are a recognized class of molecules that can receive and interpret both intrinsic and zzso signals to zzso cell zzso In this review, we discuss how cell polarity proteins regulate a diverse array of biological processes and how they can contribute to zzso in the behavior of cancer zzso
