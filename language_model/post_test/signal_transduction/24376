A global picture of gene expression in the common zzso skin disease, zzso was obtained by interrogating the full set of zzso zzso with zzso and control skin zzso We identified zzso genes with potential roles in psoriasis zzso and revealed many zzso biological zzso A novel method for identifying zzso factor binding sites was also developed and applied to this zzso Many of the identified sites are known to be involved in immune response and zzso An in-depth study of immune system genes revealed the presence of many regulating zzso and zzso within involved skin, and markers of zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso The combination of many zzso T cells, zzso and regulating zzso in zzso zzso together with the detection of DC zzso markers in zzso skin, strongly suggests that the spatial organization of T cells and zzso could sustain chronic zzso zzso and persistence within focal skin zzso
