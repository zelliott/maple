zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso one of five known zzso zzso has been implicated in regulating zzso cell differentiation in animal models of human zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso diseases remains largely zzso Using an zzso blocking zzso we show that zzso zzso during the induction phase of experimental zzso zzso in zzso mice significantly increased the pool of zzso regulatory T cells zzso in the periphery and in the zzso and decreased the severity of clinical disease and zzso zzso zzso blockade promoted induction of zzso zzso immune responses and impaired zzso responses compared with zzso zzso In zzso we show that signaling with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso development, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor known to play a key role in zzso expression and zzso zzso of natural zzso using zzso zzso reversed the protective effects of zzso zzso These findings outline a novel role for zzso signaling in regulating zzso development in zzso making it an encouraging target for zzso zzso in zzso diseases, such as multiple zzso
