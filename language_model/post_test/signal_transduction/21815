zzso zzso is a critical signaling center for patterning the zzso It arises during zzso stages through the combined influences of zzso zzso signals and general zzso zzso zzso zzso signals require the nuclear zzso of zzso but how this is initiated remained a mystery until zzso New findings now demonstrate that maternal zzso activates the zzso zzso signaling zzso and is essential for organizer zzso Furthermore, two of the earliest identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso have now been shown to be required for induction of a fully functional zzso Finally, while it has been clear for a number of years that the zzso zzso a cocktail of growth factor antagonists, their necessity for organizer function has been in zzso Their requirement has now been demonstrated through a multiple zzso approach in zzso zzso Here, we discuss the impact these recent findings have on our understanding of formation and function of the zzso
