The role of zzso in zzso zzso transport and zzso signaling in rabbit cortical collecting system was zzso zzso kidney connecting zzso and cortical collecting zzso zzso referred to as cortical collecting system, were isolated by zzso and cultured to zzso on permeable filters and glass zzso zzso was present in the zzso of principal cells, but was absent from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased cellular zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport (41 zzso zzso This zzso effect could be fully zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso which suggests that the presence of zzso zzso alone is sufficient to enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso transport was not accompanied by a rise in zzso zzso replacement of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso generated zzso in zzso in individual cells of the zzso The functional parameters of these zzso such as frequency of zzso resting zzso increase in zzso and percentage of responding cells, were not affected by the level of zzso In contrast, loading the cells with zzso abruptly stopped these zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso of zzso binding by zzso are slow relative to the initiation of the zzso rise, so that zzso unlike zzso is unable to reduce zzso rapidly enough to prevent the initiation of zzso zzso zzso
