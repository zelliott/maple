Human zzso is a protein which zzso the synthesis of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the conversion of zzso to zzso Both zzso and zzso are powerful zzso zzso zzso zzso in different cell zzso Recently, the presence of zzso zzso has been found in a significant number zzso of patients with Type 2 or long-standing Type 1 zzso These zzso are biologically active, the majority of them zzso displaying zzso properties, zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines and in pancreatic zzso In cultured rat pancreatic zzso the human zzso inhibit zzso insulin release, zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso insulin zzso The clinical zzso of zzso Type 2 diabetes differs from the zzso zzso zzso diabetes of zzso zzso When accurately matched for age and zzso only zzso patients with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso patients, have reduced in zzso zzso function in comparison to zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso show enhanced zzso insulin release, zzso conversely, zzso knockout mice display a severe impairment in zzso zzso Few Japanese diabetic patients carry a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in Caucasian patients zzso in the zzso gene have not been zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso of zzso represents an alternative signaling zzso for zzso insulin zzso in human zzso More information, however, is necessary to gauge the role of zzso zzso in the context of the natural history of human Type 1 or Type 2 zzso
