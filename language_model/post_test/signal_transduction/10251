Two zzso signaling zzso which are used by different cell types, are zzso The zzso of zzso is critical for the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso in order to evaluate the similarities and distinctions between zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

zzso mice were zzso injected with zzso zzso 20 zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso 30 zzso after treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso Liver injury was assessed zzso and zzso zzso c release and processing of zzso in the liver were analyzed by Western zzso zzso of zzso were measured using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso prevented liver injury and zzso zzso induced by either zzso or zzso On the other hand, zzso with zzso prevented zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso liver injury and zzso Both zzso reduced the activities of zzso and zzso in the zzso of mice administered by zzso However, unlike zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso in zzso mice, although this inhibitor attenuated zzso 

zzso may rely on both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso If the zzso zzso is zzso the other zzso can zzso In contrast, zzso may mediate zzso zzso mainly through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
