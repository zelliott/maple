To investigate whether zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso was necessary for zzso in protecting human lens zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso zzso In addition, we studied the link between heat shock protein 70 zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso 

Cell zzso were assessed by Cell Counting zzso zzso kit and zzso blue zzso The effect of sodium zzso on zzso zzso was zzso After the zzso with 30 zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by flow zzso protein levels of zzso and zzso were zzso by western zzso and cell zzso of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso effect of sodium zzso on zzso expression was studied by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso Moreover, effect of zzso on zzso expression was also zzso 

Our data showed that sodium zzso increased cell zzso and prevented zzso zzso through zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso However, it failed to block the zzso zzso of zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso was necessary for zzso in protecting zzso from zzso zzso However, this zzso was not involved in the zzso zzso of zzso
