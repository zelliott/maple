zzso zzso is a primary influx route for water during brain zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that brain swelling triggers zzso signaling in zzso and that deletion of the zzso gene markedly interferes with these zzso Using in zzso zzso imaging, we show that zzso stress zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso spikes and that deletion of zzso reduces these zzso The zzso signals are partly dependent on zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was judged from the effects of appropriate zzso applied to cortical zzso Supporting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso stress was found to induce zzso release from cultured zzso in an zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso not only serves as an influx route for water but also is critical for initiating downstream signaling events that may affect and potentially exacerbate the pathological outcome in clinical conditions associated with brain zzso
