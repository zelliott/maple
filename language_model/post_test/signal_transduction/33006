The zzso zzso zzso mediates fusion and entry of the most commonly transmitted human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso We have isolated six new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A panel of zzso zzso point zzso was used to map the zzso of these zzso and the previously described zzso zzso to specific zzso acid zzso in the N zzso and/or second zzso loop regions of zzso This structural information was correlated with the zzso abilities to inhibit zzso zzso entry, zzso zzso envelope zzso membrane fusion, zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the ability of a zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and its ability to inhibit either the binding of a zzso zzso complex to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso whose zzso include zzso in the zzso N zzso strongly inhibited zzso binding but only moderately inhibited zzso fusion and entry and had no effect on zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso the most potent zzso of zzso entry and fusion, were less effective at zzso zzso binding and were zzso potent at zzso zzso zzso With respect to zzso zzso entry and fusion, zzso but not zzso was zzso synergistic when used in combination with zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso The data support a model wherein zzso entry occurs in three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso The zzso described will be useful for further zzso these zzso
