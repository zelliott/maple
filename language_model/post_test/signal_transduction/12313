zzso zzso 1 zzso is a common inherited zzso with variable onset and zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein containing the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that another zzso zzso protein zzso in mice is also localized to the zzso of outer segments zzso and connecting zzso in rod zzso overlapping with zzso zzso mice display scattered zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and progressive zzso zzso less severe and slower than in zzso zzso In single rods of zzso zzso is reduced, similar to that of zzso While individual zzso are normal, double zzso of zzso and zzso exhibit abnormal zzso zzso and reduced single rod zzso and dark zzso The zzso zzso of double zzso are more reduced than those of individual zzso zzso In support, zzso interacts with zzso in zzso cells and in zzso pull-down zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso are normal in single rods and whole zzso of individual or double zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together, zzso and zzso play essential and synergistic roles in affecting zzso and zzso zzso of rod zzso Our findings suggest that zzso in zzso could zzso zzso or modify zzso disease expression in zzso
