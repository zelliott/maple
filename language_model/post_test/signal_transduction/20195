Stem cell populations are maintained by keeping a balance between zzso zzso and differentiation of dividing stem zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso the key regulator maintaining this balance is the zzso zzso signaling pathway, with zzso activity promoting the zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso as an inhibitor of the zzso fate of stem cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly enhances zzso of zzso zzso and partially suppresses zzso of a weak zzso zzso The zzso tumor that is formed in a zzso zzso double zzso is due to a failure of germ cells to enter zzso zzso zzso likely zzso the zzso fate through zzso regulating zzso signaling or by functioning parallel to zzso
