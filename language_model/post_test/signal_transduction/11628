zzso encodes a zzso zzso gene involved in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is likewise implicated in zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso is a direct zzso target zzso suggesting that zzso may convey some of the effects of zzso zzso However, zzso appears to be essential for only early stages of zzso zzso and therefore other factors must be involved in maintaining later stages of zzso Based on function and pattern of zzso zzso family members, in particular zzso are candidates for regulation of expression of zzso zzso with this, we confirm prior results which demonstrated that zzso can be directly regulated by zzso zzso and identify functional zzso response motifs essential for this zzso We also find that zzso expression is markedly attenuated in a zzso and zzso fashion in the zzso zzso vestigial tail, and present data demonstrating that zzso and zzso zzso strongly to activate zzso Finally, we show that zzso positively regulates its own zzso These data prompt a model zzso zzso and zzso signaling function directly and zzso to initiate zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso is then zzso at least in part, by an zzso mechanism at later zzso
