zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role during flower development by maintaining the boundary between zzso and zzso in the inner two zzso It was proposed that zzso maintains this boundary by regulating cell proliferation in both zzso as zzso zzso zzso produce more zzso at the expense of zzso However, the cellular mechanism that zzso zzso function remains zzso Here zzso or tobacco zzso zzso zzso was zzso in tobacco plants to substantiate zzso role as a regulator of cell proliferation and boundary definition and provide evidence that its biological role may be zzso via hormonal zzso It was found that moderate levels of zzso zzso cell growth and zzso whereas high levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and cells zzso zzso displayed reduced hormone dependency for proliferation and zzso into zzso zzso also induced proliferation of female traits in the second and third flower whorls and promoted differentiation of zzso properties in zzso further supporting a role for zzso as a boundary zzso Moreover, zzso suppressed zzso development and promoted differentiation of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may regulate male and female development via its effect on zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest a model zzso the effect of zzso on cell growth and proliferation involves the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, differential zzso expression or different sensitivities of different cell types to zzso may determine whether zzso stimulates or suppresses their zzso
