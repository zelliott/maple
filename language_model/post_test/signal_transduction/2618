The zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells express a set of zzso genes but require additional zzso factors in serum to progress through the cell zzso zzso cells are zzso arrested in zzso phase and fail to fully traverse the zzso phase of the cell cycle when zzso by zzso zzso We now report that zzso normal rat kidney zzso zzso cells zzso by either zzso AA or zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso growth factor also zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso cells, zzso growth factor enhances the rate of zzso in zzso cells, and a progression factor zzso but not zzso expressed zzso fully protects zzso cells from zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and that the inability of zzso cells to transit the zzso checkpoint is the critical zzso in establishing the genetic zzso to direct the zzso signal to zzso The results suggest that zzso growth factors in zzso may signal cell fate positively or zzso in settings that limit the potential of cells to completely transit the cell zzso
