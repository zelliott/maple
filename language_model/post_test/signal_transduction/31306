To unravel the complex in zzso regulatory zzso of zzso networks, experiments with the living zzso are absolutely zzso zzso response experiments zzso have become increasingly popular in recent zzso The response of zzso zzso from all major parts of the central metabolism is monitored over time by modem zzso methods, producing several thousand data zzso zzso are applied to determine zzso kinetic parameters and to find unknown zzso regulatory zzso zzso to the complex regulatory structure of zzso networks and the amount of measured data, the evaluation of an zzso has to be extensively supported by zzso If the zzso regulatory mechanisms are part of the investigation, a large number of models with different zzso zzso have to be tested for their ability to reproduce the observed zzso In this contribution, a systematic zzso process for zzso exploratory zzso is introduced with the aim of discovering essential features of the biological zzso The process is based on data zzso zzso hypothesis generation, automatic model family generation, large-scale model selection and statistical analysis of the zzso models followed by an extraction of common zzso It is illustrated by the example of the aromatic zzso acid synthesis zzso in zzso zzso
