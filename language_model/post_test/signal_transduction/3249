zzso X syndrome zzso is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and zzso The protein zzso zzso by the fragile X mental zzso gene zzso is an zzso protein linked to zzso zzso Recently, in the zzso knockout mouse model of zzso zzso translation initiation signaling was zzso To investigate whether an altered signaling was also a feature of subjects with zzso compared to typical developing controls, we isolated total zzso and zzso control proteins from zzso of subjects from both groups zzso zzso and 14 zzso Although we did not observe any difference in the expression level of zzso zzso zzso for zzso initiation control proteins isolated from participant with zzso we found increased zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso and of the zzso regulator, the zzso protein zzso zzso in their protein zzso In addition, we observed increased zzso of the cap binding protein zzso initiation factor zzso zzso suggesting that protein synthesis is zzso in zzso Similar to the findings in zzso we observed increased zzso of zzso in brain tissue from patients with zzso zzso zzso 4) compared to normal zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Finally, we detected increased expression of the zzso zzso protein 2 zzso a known zzso zzso This data verify and extend previous findings using zzso for studies of zzso disorders and provide evidence that zzso of zzso signaling observed in the zzso mouse model also occurs in human zzso and may provide useful zzso for designing targeted treatments in zzso
