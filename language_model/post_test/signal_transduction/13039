To date, not much has been known regarding the role of zzso and zzso molecules in signaling of B zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed on the surface of freshly isolated zzso B cells, and their expression is zzso by zzso In the present study, we have investigated whether signaling via zzso could alter the proliferation and zzso synthesis of B zzso zzso B cells were zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features observed during the study were that zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced the proliferation and production of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso could efficiently block the proliferation and production of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso could also induce the zzso of zzso zzso from B cell zzso zzso zzso could zzso the growth of zzso and favored the zzso of zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso the level of zzso molecules zzso and zzso and decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso thereby providing a novel insight into the mechanism zzso triggering through zzso and zzso could deliver regulatory zzso Thus, this study is the first demonstration of a distinct signaling event induced by zzso and zzso molecules in B cell zzso Finally, the significance of the finding is that zzso provided negative signal for the proliferation and zzso zzso of normal B cells and B cell zzso In contrast, zzso encouraged the activity of B zzso
