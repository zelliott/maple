zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a critical part of the zzso protein zzso signal zzso pathway, which is involved in zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso of zzso on zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we induced zzso zzso in rats with zzso administration or zzso duct zzso An zzso carrying small interfering zzso targeting zzso zzso was constructed to determine its effect on zzso fibrosis, as evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso and suppressed proliferation and levels of zzso genes in zzso zzso cells in zzso More importantly, selective zzso of zzso remarkably attenuated the deposition of the zzso zzso in zzso liver in both zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso cells were proven to exert the ability to generate the zzso depending on the insults of the liver, which were remarkably reduced by zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso paralleled the increased expression of transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso bone zzso protein 4 zzso and small mothers against zzso zzso and was in reverse correlation with zzso in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso of zzso resulted in the increased level of zzso in parallel with suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment promoted zzso zzso 

Our study provides the first evidence for zzso suppression of zzso zzso through the reversal of zzso transition of both zzso and zzso zzso cells without interference of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is implicated in zzso zzso and selective zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso may present a novel option for zzso zzso zzso
