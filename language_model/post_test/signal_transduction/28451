The effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso transport in differentiated zzso zzso was zzso Whereas zzso had little influence on zzso zzso zzso it increased zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, reaching maximum at approximately 8 zzso The long-term effect of zzso on zzso transport was inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso while the content of zzso protein was not altered, zzso and Northern zzso analyses revealed that both zzso protein and zzso levels were increased by exposure of cells to zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso a selective protein zzso C zzso zzso In addition, in cells depleted of zzso zzso by prolonged treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso were both zzso In zzso zzso was shown to stimulate zzso zzso zzso To further investigate if zzso may be activated by zzso we tested several zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso was able to activate zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso may enhance zzso transport in zzso zzso by stimulating zzso expression via a zzso zzso
