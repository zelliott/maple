The role of tip and rear cells in collective migration is still a matter of debate and their differences at the zzso level are poorly zzso Here, we zzso these issues in the zzso zzso an organ that develops from the collective migration of clusters of cells that respond to zzso zzso a zzso growth factor zzso zzso expressed in surrounding zzso We track individual cells in the migratory cluster and zzso their features and unveil two zzso types of zzso zzso that account for tip and rear cells zzso Indeed, once the former are zzso they remain as such throughout zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso in a single tip cell can trigger the migration of the cells in the zzso Finally, we found specific zzso zzso at the tip cells and zzso how zzso cell features, such as zzso and zzso act on zzso the zzso of trailing and tip zzso Thus, the combined effect of zzso promoting leading cell zzso and the zzso of cell properties in a cluster can account for the wide range of migratory events driven by zzso
