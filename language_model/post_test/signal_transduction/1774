It has been suggested that zzso zzso protein zzso regulates signal zzso particularly in various zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso plays a role in zzso zzso of gastric zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in gastric zzso cells was examined zzso The role of zzso in the acid zzso zzso of gastric zzso cells was assessed by evaluating the effect of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso on gastric acid zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso was investigated in zzso zzso 

zzso was specifically expressed in gastric zzso cells and chief cells of the gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited gastric acid zzso in zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso completely inhibited acid zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso known to increase zzso zzso but did not affect acid zzso zzso by zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso has a potent zzso effect in zzso cells through zzso of only zzso acid zzso zzso As zzso is known to specifically inhibit zzso which plays an important role in signal zzso in various zzso cells, protein zzso zzso might also be crucial for zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso
