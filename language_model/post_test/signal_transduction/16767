Nuclear zzso such as estrogen, zzso or zzso hormone zzso have been shown to play a critical role in brain development and zzso The activity of these receptors is modulated by the interaction with several proteins and, in particular, zzso are required to enhance their zzso zzso The steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are currently the best characterized zzso and we review here the current knowledge on the distribution and function of these proteins in the zzso zzso models and zzso techniques have demonstrated the requirement for zzso and zzso in the brain, focusing mainly on steroid and zzso zzso development and zzso The precise function of zzso in the brain is currently unknown but its presence throughout the brain suggests an important zzso Although the molecular biology of zzso is relatively well known, the in zzso control of their zzso zzso modifications and zzso and zzso interactions with the different nuclear receptors remain zzso A complete understanding of hormone action on brain and behavior will not be attained until a better knowledge of zzso physiology is zzso
