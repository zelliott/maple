We have discovered two zzso zzso compounds having high in zzso affinity and selectivity for the human zzso D1 zzso Both compounds, zzso zzso and its zzso analog zzso were found through a routine zzso binding zzso The determined affinities zzso of these compounds for the cloned human zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso They exhibited at least zzso lower affinities for zzso zzso and for other zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both compounds were found to antagonize zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the human zzso zzso zzso In spite of their poor zzso stability and low zzso zzso and zzso appear to be among the first zzso highly selective zzso zzso zzso zzso reported, and may have utility in in zzso investigations requiring selective tagging or blockade of zzso zzso zzso
