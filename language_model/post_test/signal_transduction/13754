zzso zzso blood zzso is an attractive source of zzso stem cells zzso However, the number of zzso in zzso is zzso and attempts to amplify them in zzso remain zzso Several publications have documented amplification of zzso zzso cells zzso on zzso or zzso cells, but the lack of zzso in culture conditions and zzso definition zzso direct comparison of these zzso We investigated the ability of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso to amplify zzso zzso zzso zzso derived zzso zzso as zzso were maintained on zzso zzso layers and the number of cells and their marker expression were monitored over 21 zzso Although both types of zzso layers supported zzso expansion, only zzso cells triggered amplification of zzso cells, which peaked at 14 zzso The amplified cells differentiated into all cell zzso as zzso by in zzso zzso zzso and were capable of zzso and zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted amplification of zzso cells, previously defined as precursors with more limited differentiation zzso A competitive zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso cells had a preference for interacting with zzso cells in zzso zzso and zzso analysis of both zzso cell types identified differences in gene expression that correlated with propensity of zzso and zzso to support zzso cell amplification and differentiation zzso Finally, we used zzso sequencing of zzso cells and zzso to uncover relevant networks illustrating the complex interaction between zzso cells and zzso leading to zzso cell zzso
