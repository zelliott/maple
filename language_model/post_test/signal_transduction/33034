The zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in vascular zzso cells involves zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso which may be responsible for the sustained release of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be activated by zzso oxygen species zzso such as zzso in several cell zzso zzso production in zzso zzso cells appears to require the participation of a zzso small zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso might serve as a zzso for the effect of zzso stress on zzso zzso zzso Exposure of bovine zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso stress of 20 zzso for zzso zzso zzso total cellular and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso Treating zzso cells with the antioxidants zzso and zzso zzso inhibited in a zzso manner the zzso increase in total zzso and, specifically, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the onset of zzso stress caused an enhanced generation of zzso zzso as evidenced by an oxidized protein detection zzso which were required for the zzso total cellular and zzso zzso zzso zzso Total cellular and zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely blocked in sheared bovine zzso zzso cells expressing a dominant negative zzso gene product zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso via regulation of the zzso zzso changes in zzso cells in zzso and pathological zzso
