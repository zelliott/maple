Eleven distinct zzso of zzso zzso C zzso which are grouped into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso These zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso in response to the zzso of more than 100 different cell surface zzso All zzso zzso contain X and Y zzso which form the zzso core, as well as various combinations of regulatory zzso that are common to many other signaling zzso These regulatory zzso serve to target zzso zzso to the vicinity of their zzso or zzso through zzso or zzso zzso These zzso (with their binding partners in parentheses or zzso include the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso beta gamma zzso of G zzso and the zzso region including the C2 domain zzso alpha zzso of zzso of zzso the zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso 2 domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso domain zzso and C2 domain zzso of zzso and the Ras binding domain zzso zzso of zzso The presence of distinct regulatory zzso in zzso zzso renders them susceptible to different modes of zzso Given that the partners that interact with these regulatory zzso of zzso zzso are generated or eliminated in specific regions of the cell in response to changes in zzso status, the zzso and zzso of each zzso zzso are likely highly regulated zzso
