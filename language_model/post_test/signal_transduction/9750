zzso is the hallmark of zzso zzso positively correlated with the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso We previously reported that expression levels of zzso a member of transforming growth zzso super family, correlate with the zzso invasive behavior of human zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso of zzso suppresses zzso zzso by zzso of zzso In human primary zzso zzso expression of zzso positively zzso with WHO zzso tumor grades and expression of zzso in the corresponding zzso zzso In human zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso significantly decreases colony formation and zzso of zzso In zzso cellular depletion of zzso in zzso inhibited brain zzso growth and prolonged the survival of mice with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso suppressed tumor vessel growth in zzso zzso Using zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, our further experiments revealed that zzso zzso expression might, at least in part, mediate through the zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our data revealed that zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells resulted in changes to zzso zzso and subsequent colony formation, in zzso tumor growth, and zzso all of which are consistent with the regulation of zzso through the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human zzso
