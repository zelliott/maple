The skeletal body muscle of zzso is derived from zzso arranged zzso structures, the zzso Only the zzso zzso half of the zzso the zzso gives rise to muscle cells during normal zzso Head muscle takes its origin from the zzso the zzso zzso head zzso and the zzso zzso Some muscle precursor cells, for instance those for limb and tongue muscle, migrate over considerable distances before zzso at their target zzso In recent years, our understanding of the molecular events underlying zzso has increased zzso Muscle differentiation is preceded by several steps during which precursor cells are zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso factors of the basic zzso zzso These factors bind to promoters of many zzso genes and interact with zzso zzso zzso binding zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso serum response zzso box zzso zzso zzso events leading to zzso precursor cell zzso and to the formation of muscle zzso are being zzso zzso signals zzso from the neural tube, zzso and zzso zzso findings concerning the role of the zzso and neural tube in muscle development suggest that the zzso events leading to zzso are more complex than originally zzso zzso from the lateral plate counteract those from the zzso zzso and induce the locally restricted zzso of muscle precursor zzso Future investigations will have to show how zzso molecules and their receptors interact in the process of zzso muscle formation in the zzso
