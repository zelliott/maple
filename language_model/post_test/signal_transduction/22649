zzso zzso are major integral components of the outer membrane of zzso bacteria being exclusively located in its outer leaflet facing the bacterial zzso zzso they consist in different bacterial strains of a highly variable zzso chain, a less variable core zzso and a zzso zzso termed zzso A, with low structural zzso zzso participate in the zzso membrane functions and are, therefore, essential for bacterial growth and zzso They contribute to the low membrane zzso and increase the resistance towards zzso zzso They are also the primary target for the attack of zzso drugs and proteins such as components of the zzso immune zzso When set free zzso zzso in higher organisms, a broad spectrum of biological zzso They play an important role in the manifestation of zzso infection and are therefore termed zzso zzso parameters such as the molecular zzso and the charges of the zzso A portion, which is responsible for zzso biological activities and is therefore termed the zzso zzso of zzso are correlated with the biological activity of chemically different zzso
