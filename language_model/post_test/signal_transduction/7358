The gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso causes the release of pancreatic zzso zzso and growth of the normal zzso zzso zzso administration has been used in animal models to study zzso and also as a promoter of zzso or zzso pancreatic zzso Defining zzso receptors in normal human zzso has been problematic because of its zzso location, high zzso of pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso Most studies indicate that the zzso zzso in human zzso is the zzso type, and zzso is the zzso form in zzso zzso In pancreatic cancer cells and tumors, the role of zzso is better established because receptors are often zzso by these cancer cells and stimulation of such receptors promotes zzso Furthermore, in established cancer, zzso production of zzso and/or zzso occurs and their actions stimulate the synthesis of more receptors plus growth by an zzso zzso zzso it was thought that the mechanism by which zzso served to zzso zzso was by interplay with inflammation in the pancreatic zzso But with the recent findings of zzso receptors on early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and on zzso cells, the question has been raised that perhaps zzso actions are not the result of cancer but an early driving promoter of zzso This review will zzso what is known regarding zzso its zzso and pancreatic cancer, and also what is unknown and requires further investigation to determine which comes first, the chicken or the egg, zzso or the zzso
