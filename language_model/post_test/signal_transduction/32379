zzso a member of the zzso family of small zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso required for cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso zzso a zzso of large, zzso zzso Like other small zzso zzso zzso is activated by a zzso exchange factor and zzso by a zzso protein zzso An unidentified zzso zzso protein has been shown to function as a specific zzso Here we report the cloning of a zzso zzso this GAP from a human zzso cell zzso zzso analysis reveals the presence of three consensus box regions characteristic of zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein containing the three boxes derived from the new clone strongly zzso the zzso activity of zzso but was much less effective on other zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso clone encodes a specific GAP for zzso zzso analysis also reveals a potential zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso domain preceding the first consensus zzso zzso experiments show that this motif can interact with the zzso zzso of zzso alpha and of zzso Thus, zzso may function as a link between zzso and other signaling zzso
