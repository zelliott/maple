zzso is a program of cellular self-destruction culminating in the clearance of cell corpses by neighboring zzso Studies in recent years have served to characterize a number of structural and molecular plasma membrane zzso that act in concert to mediate efficient zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso signals, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its oxidized counterpart, zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso I, are exposed on the surface of zzso cells and function to mediate zzso by neighboring zzso zzso Plasma membrane zzso zzso a common feature of the zzso program, provides a structural context for the zzso of recognition signals zzso as zzso molecules zzso on the surface of these membrane zzso zzso cells also zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso that recruit zzso to the site of the zzso zzso Taken together, these events serve to mediate the disposal of zzso cells prior to their zzso zzso thus preventing the inflammation and tissue zzso that would otherwise zzso
