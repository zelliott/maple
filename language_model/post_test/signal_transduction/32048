Upon disruption of zzso zzso plant cells activate at least two branches of the unfolded protein response zzso through zzso and zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso molecular zzso and the zzso of the zzso degradation protein zzso Here, we discuss a new zzso stress response zzso in plants that is associated with an zzso stress response in zzso a cell death zzso Both zzso and zzso stress induce the expression of the novel zzso factor zzso which binds and activates zzso protein zzso promoters to induce zzso expression and cause the zzso of zzso an zzso of the cell death zzso In contrast to this zzso zzso the zzso molecular zzso binding protein zzso zzso the propagation of the cell death signal by modulating the expression and activity of components of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell death zzso This interaction zzso zzso cell death and promotes a better adaptation of zzso transgenic lines to zzso
