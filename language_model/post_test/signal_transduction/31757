Complex disorders are a class of diseases whose zzso zzso is caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental zzso zzso the complexity underlying the genetic architecture of such traits may help develop more efficient diagnostic tests and therapeutic zzso Despite the continuous advances in revealing the genetic basis of many of complex diseases using zzso association studies zzso a major proportion of their genetic zzso has remained zzso in part because zzso are unable to reliably detect small individual risk contributions and to capture the underlying genetic zzso In this paper we describe a zzso method to analyze the association between multiple genetic factors and a complex zzso Starting from sets of markers selected based on zzso biomedical knowledge, our method generates zzso models relevant to the biological process underlying a complex trait for which zzso data is zzso We tested the zzso of our method using the zzso zzso zzso zzso a number of biological zzso the method was able to identify several immune system related zzso models significantly associated with zzso Arthritis zzso and Crohn's disease zzso zzso zzso models were also zzso in an independent zzso zzso The method we present provides a framework for capturing joint contributions of genetic factors to complex zzso In contrast to zzso approaches, its results can be given a direct biological zzso The zzso zzso models generated by our analysis may serve as a predictor to estimate the risk of zzso development in individuals of Caucasian zzso
