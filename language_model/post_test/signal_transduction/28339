zzso zzso zzso is a major regulator of bone zzso zzso zzso participate in regulating zzso but roles of specific zzso in bone metabolism are largely zzso We demonstrate that young zzso weeks) female mice lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit increased zzso bone mass due to zzso defects in zzso zzso These defects are zzso in zzso as reduced association of zzso with bone and as reduced serum concentration of zzso collagen zzso specific products of zzso bone zzso zzso cells are generated readily from zzso bone-marrow zzso However, cultures of these cells contain few mature, polarized cells and perform poorly in bone zzso zzso in zzso zzso structures by which zzso adhere to zzso are zzso and tend to form large clusters in these cells, suggesting that lack of zzso adversely affects zzso arrangement in the final stages of zzso zzso The gender and age zzso of the bone zzso suggest that it is modulated by hormonal status, despite normal serum levels of zzso and zzso in affected zzso zzso of bone zzso by zzso and, surprisingly, zzso activity and zzso zzso are normal in zzso zzso indicating that loss of zzso does not cause widespread disruption of these signaling zzso These results establish zzso as a zzso required for optimal structure, zzso organization, and function of zzso in zzso and in zzso
