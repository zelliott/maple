While zzso of several zzso zzso has been reported in different types of human cancer, the role of zzso in zzso has not been clearly zzso Here, by zzso we have found expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso of zzso colon cancer tissue samples as well as association of zzso with liver zzso We then demonstrated that zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in colon cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso colon cancer cells whereas these phenomena in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were diminished, indicating that both membrane association and zzso zzso of zzso are required for proper zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso showed no differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso unlike zzso may be involved in signal zzso Moreover, zzso cells showed an increase in zzso protein zzso through the formation of a nuclear complex with zzso D1 and zzso Small interfering zzso analysis confirmed that zzso activates the Ras signaling zzso These data not only describe the induction of zzso expression during zzso zzso but also provide a molecular mechanism for colon cancer development through the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protein signaling pathway, identifying zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso
