zzso zzso are neuroendocrine cells that zzso and zzso zzso these processes being positively controlled by zzso derived from zzso sympathetic zzso Previously, we showed that zzso contain a large number of zzso zzso that specifically accumulate zzso through a zzso zzso zzso and contain proteins for zzso such as zzso 2 zzso These findings suggested that the zzso are counterparts of synaptic zzso and are involved in zzso chemical zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso actually zzso zzso upon stimulation by zzso in the presence of zzso at 37 degrees zzso The ability of zzso zzso disappeared when the cells were incubated at below 20 degrees zzso Loss of the activity was also observed on successive zzso but it was recovered after 12 zzso zzso A low concentration of cadmium zzso or zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso E zzso synaptic zzso protein 25 zzso and thus inhibited the zzso The released zzso zzso zzso themselves via zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso are zzso zzso and that the zzso system regulates zzso the synthesis and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso chemical zzso seems to be a novel mechanism that regulates hormonal zzso by neuroendocrine zzso
