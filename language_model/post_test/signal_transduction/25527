zzso B zzso protein zzso a zzso of zzso was originally identified by its binding with the zzso of the zzso B virus zzso protein zzso We have recently shown that zzso promotes the growth of both normal liver cells and zzso cells in zzso but the molecular mechanisms of this have not been zzso In this study, we investigated the potential effects of zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells and the zzso signaling zzso zzso these zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoted the proliferation of zzso cells, as shown by the zzso zzso We also showed that zzso induced cellular zzso in the S phase zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells showed zzso of the zzso zzso this zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and suppressed the cell cycle promotion induced by zzso in zzso zzso The increase in zzso protein levels induced by zzso was inhibited when cells were incubated with zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that the proliferation of zzso cells promoted by zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
