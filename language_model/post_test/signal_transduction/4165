Cross signaling between zzso channel and zzso zzso was explored in whole cell clamped rat zzso zzso under conditions where global zzso zzso zzso were strongly zzso by zzso the zzso with high zzso of zzso 2 and zzso zzso channel and zzso zzso were respectively activated by a zzso pulse to zzso zzso and rapid zzso 50 zzso application of 5 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso of zzso of zzso channel with respect to the time of application of caffeine pulse provided experimental evidence that zzso between the zzso and zzso channel is zzso exclusively through the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso complex independent of global zzso zzso zzso
