zzso are zzso zzso proteins that are thought to act as zzso zzso zzso zzso contain two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 have been identified as the cause of zzso zzso an zzso human neurodegenerative disease with similarity to zzso In a screen for zzso zzso that disrupt patterning of the early mouse zzso we identified a line named zzso carrying a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a variety of patterning defects that first appear at zzso zzso include a specific failure in zzso of the anterior neural plate, loss of heart looping and irregular zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression fails to initiate along the anterior zzso at zzso and zzso is zzso from the anterior neural zzso at zzso revealing a crucial role for zzso 2 in the formation and function of these two signaling zzso zzso 2 is also required for normal organization of the zzso zzso zzso a signaling center that directs limb zzso zzso expression of zzso 2 in zzso suggests it may interact with zzso 1 in zzso development or zzso We further show that zzso 2 associates with zzso zzso 1 in mouse zzso providing a zzso link between zzso and a zzso zzso Based on our results, and on those of others, we propose that zzso proteins act as zzso zzso during embryonic zzso
