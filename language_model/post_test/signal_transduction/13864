zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso profoundly zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso the zzso that converts zzso zzso to active zzso We zzso that the induction of a cortisol zzso upon zzso of the zzso zzso may impact on the zzso natural killer zzso cell population and on local expression of zzso target zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were processed for zzso cell zzso analysis and primary zzso zzso The cultures remained either zzso or were zzso for 4 or 8 zzso A tissue zzso was constructed from zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso An abnormal zzso cell test was defined as greater than zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso 

Increased zzso cell density was associated with lower zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell density also corresponded to impaired induction of key zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso growth factor binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso member 3 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso cell density in zzso was not associated with increased in zzso expression of either zzso or zzso two zzso implicated in zzso cell zzso 

zzso levels of zzso cells in the zzso underlying the surface zzso are associated with inadequate cortisol zzso by resident zzso cells and zzso induction of key zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and the zzso transport zzso Our observations suggest that zzso cell testing identifies those women at risk of zzso failure due to relative zzso cortisol zzso
