Stroke and many neurodegenerative diseases culminate in zzso death through a mechanism known as zzso zzso proceeds through a complex signaling zzso that includes the participation of the zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso effects on resident central nervous system cells as well alters zzso barrier zzso zzso which further promotes zzso Another signaling zzso that promotes zzso and zzso dysfunction is zzso oxide zzso although its precise role in pathological progression remains zzso We examine here the potentially interrelated roles of zzso NO and zzso zzso which is the toxic zzso of zzso in zzso breakdown and zzso following zzso injection of the zzso analog zzso zzso We find that NO and zzso production are linked to zzso zzso injury, and demonstrate that NO provision zzso to restore the toxic effects of zzso in zzso mice that are normally resistant to zzso NO also promotes zzso breakdown and zzso Interestingly, zzso breakdown in itself does not suffice to elicit zzso a subsequent zzso event is zzso In conclusion, NO and zzso function as downstream zzso of zzso zzso
