To establish zzso cell lines with stable expression of human zzso hormone zzso zzso 

The zzso gene fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso form zzso were cloned separately into zzso zzso after zzso with zzso I and Not I, and the resulted zzso and zzso plasmids were verified by restriction zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso cells were zzso with these plasmids and the expression of zzso and zzso in the cells were examined by zzso and zzso 

zzso and restriction zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso zzso were correctly cloned into zzso After a zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso plasmids and zzso selection, the positive cell clones zzso expressing the zzso were zzso which showed expressions of zzso and zzso zzso detected by zzso These positive cells showed high levels of zzso and zzso production in response to zzso zzso 

The zzso cell lines with stable expression of zzso or zzso gene established in this study provide useful cell models for studying the zzso functions of zzso zzso
