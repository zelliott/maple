The effect of zzso II zzso zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in a Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso the rat vascular zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso II treatment induced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso activated zzso activity, with a peak at 30 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, P zzso zzso versus zzso which was maintained until 3 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 minutes was inhibited by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso by zzso zzso zzso 4, P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso The direct addition of zzso also induced a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso activity, with a peak at 10 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, P zzso zzso versus zzso which remained elevated until 1 zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can also activate zzso at 5 minutes, but this activity was reduced at 30 minutes and could not be seen at 1 hour, indicating that the time course was different from that seen with zzso zzso zzso an zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso oxygen intermediate zzso levels to assess the role of zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso of cells with 500 zzso zzso for 1 hour attenuated approximately 50% of Aug zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso at least zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was reduced by approximately zzso by zzso Finally, zzso toxin completely blocked zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in part by altering the zzso tone and zzso signaling of zzso
