zzso of growth zzso family proteins have been defined as candidate tumor zzso for more than a zzso Recent emerging results using zzso and knockout mice are expanding the previous understanding of this protein zzso The results of zzso knockout mouse experiments revealed that zzso has a protective effect on zzso Our recent results showed that zzso is zzso in zzso cancer, and zzso colon cancer cell invasion through an zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso premature zzso in normal human zzso cells, and zzso or cell cycle arrest in various adherent cancer zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may also have roles in cancer progression and/or zzso transformation under some zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso shows an zzso effect on the transition from zzso to zzso phase and DNA zzso respectively, suggesting that these proteins may play roles during cell proliferation in some zzso ING family proteins may play dual roles, similar to transforming growth zzso which has tumor zzso functions in normal zzso and also zzso functions in invasive zzso zzso In the present article, we briefly review ING history and propose a possible interpretation of discrepancies between past and recent zzso
