zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso and zzso development, as well as the zzso of circulating cells to sites of zzso Because vascular cell zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso is stable, these zzso can be detected and selectively zzso from cell zzso using zzso With this approach, zzso zzso zzso expression was demonstrated on zzso in the bone zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cavity of normal mice, but not in peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso in the bone zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that can bind to the zzso tail and initiate zzso zzso was associated selectively with zzso zzso that were isolated from human zzso T cells or from zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso in the zzso zzso tail was zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso A rapid and transient zzso affinity zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso correlated temporally with induced zzso binding to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso may initiate zzso signaling zzso through zzso that regulate zzso maturation and zzso
