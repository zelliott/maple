zzso oxide zzso is a signal zzso involved in regulation of zzso and zzso functions of the vascular zzso such as zzso We examined whether zzso marker gene expression of signal zzso pathways in cultured pulmonary artery zzso cell zzso zzso were exposed to a NO zzso 1 zzso zzso for zzso 5, and 24 zzso thereafter, expression levels of 96 marker genes associated with 18 signal zzso pathways were assessed using a signal zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso NO zzso of zzso pathways and nuclear factor zzso zzso were further zzso Gene array analyses revealed that 17 genes in 13 signal pathways were zzso or zzso in cells exposed to zzso four of which were significantly altered by NO and are associated with zzso zzso zzso pathways resulted in identification of 11 genes in this zzso Nuclear factor zzso studies demonstrated that zzso expression of these signal zzso genes was associated with regulation of zzso zzso zzso shift analysis verified the effects of NO on zzso activity of zzso These results demonstrated that NO signaling zzso at least 13 signal zzso pathways including zzso families in zzso
