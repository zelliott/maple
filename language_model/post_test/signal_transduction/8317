In the past 3 years, altered expression of the zzso scaffolding protein has emerged as contributing to cancer zzso in multiple cancer zzso However, whereas some studies have identified elevated zzso expression as zzso other work has suggested a negative role in tumor zzso We here show that the zzso genetic background significantly limits zzso tumor initiation in the zzso virus middle T genetic zzso Action of zzso is tumor cell zzso with immune cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso The majority of the zzso zzso tumors of zzso virus middle zzso mice are characterized by depressed zzso of proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso emphasizing an important role of zzso as a scaffolding protein for these zzso zzso Analysis of cells derived from primary zzso and zzso tumors showed persistently reduced zzso zzso attachment, and migration, consistent with a role for zzso zzso of zzso in promoting tumor zzso This study provides the first in zzso evidence of a role for zzso in breast cancer progression and suggests that zzso expression may provide a zzso for tumor zzso
