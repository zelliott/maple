There is substantial evidence for the existence of mutually exclusive molecular pathways to zzso in the formation of zzso and invasive zzso zzso The most common genetic zzso in low grade zzso zzso zzso zzso are loss of zzso of part or all of zzso 9 and zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso The zzso to development of invasive zzso seems to start with zzso progress to zzso in zzso followed by invasion of the zzso zzso The most frequent genetic zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso is zzso of zzso followed by loss of zzso of zzso zzso A marker for progression in zzso is loss of zzso zzso which occurs in approximately zzso of zzso zzso Global trends of increased zzso instability and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in DNA correlate with increased tumor invasion and zzso When researching markers of zzso cancer for clinical use, it is important that biomedical pathways and their zzso are measured in the same tumor zzso This review examines the published data and proposes a model for the mechanisms behind zzso cancer zzso
