The zzso conversion of zzso to zzso represents the most distinctive zzso zzso in the ink zzso of the zzso zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso have remained so far largely zzso In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that zzso can stimulate zzso activity and promote zzso synthesis in zzso ink zzso via the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of intact ink zzso with either zzso or zzso resulted in an up to zzso increase of zzso activity and a more than zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso was induced by an NO donor and by zzso An zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso blocker suppressed zzso zzso zzso evidence indicated that enhanced zzso production was localized largely in the mature part of the ink zzso Increased de zzso synthesis of zzso was demonstrated in zzso and zzso ink zzso by a combined zzso approach based on zzso determination of zzso levels and high performance liquid zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid, a specific zzso marker, in zzso zzso These results fill a longstanding gap in the understanding of the complex zzso mechanisms underlying zzso of zzso in the mature ink zzso cells of zzso zzso and disclose a novel zzso role of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso
