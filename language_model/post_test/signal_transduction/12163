Studies have shown zzso zzso acid to be less toxic than zzso acid and to zzso zzso acid zzso toxicity in zzso models in zzso However, to what degree these effects are zzso by zzso extent is zzso 

We evaluated whether zzso per zzso is associated with zzso zzso and determined the role of zzso and zzso acid, the most abundant fatty acids in western zzso on zzso zzso and zzso in an in zzso model of zzso induced in three zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso The impact of incubation for 24 h with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso alone or combined zzso ratio 2 : 1) on zzso zzso and insulin zzso was zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso extent was larger when cells were treated with zzso than with zzso zzso the latter fatty acid was associated with increased zzso zzso Cell zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso but not zzso acid, impaired insulin zzso Despite the higher amount of fat resulting from incubation of the two fatty acids combined, the zzso rate and impaired insulin zzso were lower than in cells treated with zzso acid alone, indicating a protective effect of zzso zzso 

zzso acid is more zzso but less zzso than zzso acid in zzso cell zzso These data may provide a biological basis for clinical findings on dietary patterns and zzso models of zzso fatty liver zzso
