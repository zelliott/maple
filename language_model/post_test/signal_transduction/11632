In zzso development, muscle is specified in the zzso lateral marginal zone zzso of the zzso zzso Two critical events specify the formation of skeletal zzso the expression of the zzso zzso factor, zzso and the zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso by the adjacent zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling during early zzso stages converts zzso protein into an zzso differentiation factor in the zzso Yet, the zzso signaling factors connecting zzso antagonism and zzso of zzso remain zzso Our data show that zzso antagonism zzso the activity of zzso protein zzso zzso and that the activity of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prevented muscle zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced muscle zzso however, the zzso of a zzso active zzso with zzso efficiently induced muscle zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not induce the zzso of zzso but increased its protein levels and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is subsequent to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso by converting the zzso protein into a potent differentiation zzso
