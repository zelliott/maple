zzso zzso small zzso zzso are negative regulators of gene expression and play important roles in gene regulation in the zzso To examine the role of zzso in the expression of the two zzso of the cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso which regulate cardiac zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso using zzso small interfering zzso zzso against zzso an essential zzso for zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were zzso As a result, zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso simultaneously and the zzso gene but not zzso which implied that specific zzso could zzso the zzso zzso Among 19 selected zzso zzso was found to most strongly zzso the zzso gene but not zzso Moreover, zzso protein was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Through a zzso screening using zzso we identified zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso which zzso regulates zzso transcription, as a target of zzso Moreover, zzso was demonstrated to zzso zzso gene regulation via zzso hormone signaling and to be zzso during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem zzso cells or in zzso hearts in association with zzso gene zzso These findings suggested that zzso regulates zzso gene expression by targeting zzso in zzso
