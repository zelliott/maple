The roles of bone zzso proteins zzso and their receptors zzso in zzso biology are not zzso In this study, frozen zzso from 26 World Health Organization zzso I to III zzso were analyzed by Western zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso II, and zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Sections from 20 normal zzso 2 zzso zzso and 51 zzso were analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso cultures from 11 zzso were treated with zzso and evaluated for cell proliferation and signaling zzso zzso zzso media from 7 cultures were analyzed for zzso by zzso Bone zzso protein 4 was zzso detected in adult zzso but was detected in zzso or zzso of Grade I zzso and in zzso of Grade II zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso Bone zzso protein receptors zzso and II were detected in zzso and in all zzso zzso and activated zzso was detected in all zzso zzso Bone zzso protein 4 zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso and it was detected in zzso media from 4 of 7 zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso may play zzso roles and interact with other transforming growth zzso zzso members in regulating zzso growth and zzso
