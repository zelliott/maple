The primary zzso surface of the insulin zzso spans one face of the zzso zzso of the zzso (the zzso zzso and an zzso in its zzso segment zzso zzso analysis of the free zzso has defined a zzso zzso motif in which the zzso zzso packs against zzso zzso 2 and zzso To relate structure to function, we exploited expanded zzso technology to insert zzso zzso at key sites in zzso and zzso The pattern of zzso zzso within the free and bound zzso is in zzso with the crystal structure and prior zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso in zzso 2 and 3, predicted to be zzso by zzso efficiently zzso to zzso Furthermore, anomalous zzso were identified on neighboring surfaces of zzso and insulin that impair zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso disproportionately to their effects on insulin zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso in addition to its zzso role, provides a signaling element in the mechanism of zzso zzso
