Previous work has demonstrated that zzso growth factor family zzso signaling through the zzso pathway, prevent zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso even in the presence of factors that promote differentiation zzso zzso and zzso The working hypothesis is that a release from zzso zzso zzso signaling is prerequisite for the initiation of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso results demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso is zzso after treatment with zzso or zzso Thus, studies were conducted to evaluate a role for zzso zzso in the termination of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus, de zzso zzso and translation of one or more protein zzso or zzso zzso results in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso amplification reveals expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5, in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso 3 zzso of zzso zzso the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso 5, and subsequently (by 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso is associated with the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and is inhibited by the selective zzso zzso zzso In turn, regulation of zzso activity occurs via the zzso degradation zzso because treatment of cells with the zzso zzso zzso markedly promotes zzso zzso These data provide direct evidence for zzso negative feedback due to regulation of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso
