zzso zzso in response to pressure or volume overload plays an important role in the zzso of heart zzso Various mechanisms have been suggested to translate mechanical stress into structural changes, one of them being the release of zzso factors such as zzso II and zzso which in turn promote cardiac zzso and zzso A large body of evidence suggests that the zzso effects of these factors are zzso by receptors coupled to the zzso family of zzso G zzso Most zzso zzso however, can also activate G proteins of the zzso family, but the role of zzso in cardiac zzso is not zzso 

We use zzso zzso in zzso and conditional gene zzso in zzso to study the role of the zzso family in pressure zzso cardiac zzso We show in detail that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not affect zzso heart function but protects mice from pressure zzso zzso and zzso as efficiently as zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso prevents the development of heart failure up to 1 year after zzso On the molecular level, we show that zzso but not zzso controls zzso expression of zzso genes through zzso of the small zzso zzso and consecutive zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

Our data show that the zzso family of zzso G proteins is centrally involved in pressure zzso cardiac zzso and plays a central role in the transition to heart zzso
