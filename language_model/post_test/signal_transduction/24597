To study the effects of a novel zzso zzso detected in zzso of lip biopsy specimens from zzso syndrome zzso patients and a human T cell line, on the infected T zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the infected and zzso cell zzso Surface zzso expression was determined by flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso activity was measured using an zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso was assessed with a fluorescent zzso 

zzso cells expressed less zzso and zzso zzso but more zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cells also produced less zzso and displayed reduced zzso zzso and calcium zzso A similar zzso in calcium zzso was detected in T cells from SS zzso 

These data suggest a possible involvement of the newly described zzso in T cell zzso
