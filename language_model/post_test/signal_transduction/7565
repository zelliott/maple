The essential role of mechanical signals in regulating the function of living cells is universally zzso However, how mechanical signals are zzso in cells to regulate gene expression is largely zzso We previously demonstrated that the gene zzso zzso zzso is sensitively regulated by mechanical zzso In the present study, mouse zzso DNA containing the zzso promoter was zzso and a zzso set of zzso zzso was zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells for their responses to the zzso of culture zzso The results showed significant zzso activities of the zzso and zzso promoter zzso whereas the zzso construct was zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed higher zzso activity, whereas only the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited repression of expression when the host cells were cultured on low zzso zzso Internal deletion of the segment between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso promoter construct abolished the low zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion or zzso of an zzso zzso factor binding site in this region also abolished this repression zzso The level of zzso increased in cells cultured under a low tension condition, corresponding to the zzso of zzso zzso gene expression is further affected by the treatment of cells with zzso inhibitor and zzso suggesting an upstream signaling zzso
