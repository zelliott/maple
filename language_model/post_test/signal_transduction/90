Balancing zzso and intrinsic cues plays an integral part in shaping the complex architecture of the nervous zzso During development, zzso precursor cells integrate environmental signals and coordinate the zzso of the zzso machinery necessary for differentiation and zzso In this issue of Genes & Development, zzso and colleagues zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling contributes to the decision of an zzso precursor cell to zzso during development and after zzso These findings provide new insight into the precise zzso coordination required for zzso zzso
