zzso target and zzso effects of specific compounds is critical to drug discovery and zzso We generated a compendium of zzso zzso profiles by testing the collection of viable zzso zzso deletion zzso for hypersensitivity to 82 compounds and natural product zzso To cluster compounds with a similar zzso and to reveal insights into the cellular pathways and proteins affected, we applied both a zzso zzso and a zzso method, which allows a gene or compound to be associated with more than one zzso In particular, zzso a breast cancer zzso was found to disrupt calcium zzso and zzso zzso was recognized as a target for zzso B, a zzso zzso with zzso zzso Further, the profile of crude extracts resembled that of its constituent zzso natural product, enabling detailed zzso of extract activity prior to zzso This compendium should serve as a valuable key for interpreting cellular effects of novel compounds with similar zzso
