In response to stimulation with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the regulatory molecules zzso zzso and zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular signal that coordinates the assembly of this complex has remained zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso was zzso zzso on zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso zzso but not zzso was required for zzso of zzso and directly zzso zzso in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso was pivotal for zzso interactions among zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of signaling by the zzso factor zzso zzso therefore serves a key role in the negative feedback of zzso zzso signaling by orchestrating assembly of the zzso zzso complex to limit inflammatory gene zzso
