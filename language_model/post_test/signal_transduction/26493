zzso protein 27 zzso was originally isolated by screening for genes specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso C, the human zzso of zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in mouse white and brown zzso zzso was recently reported to be a zzso zzso zzso protein that promotes zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, we showed that zzso was also expressed in the fatty liver of the zzso type II diabetes model zzso The expression of zzso was markedly decreased in zzso lacking the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A functional zzso response element site was identified in the zzso promoter zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso in zzso or in zzso led to increased zzso through increased zzso zzso The current status of the zzso roles of the zzso signal in fatty liver are discussed along with its significance as a factor involved in the development of zzso zzso
