zzso formation, stabilization and maintenance comprise several remarkably precise and rapid zzso The initial steps involve delivery to the site of initial contact between zzso and zzso of transport carriers containing several sets of synaptic proteins necessary for proper synaptic zzso This occurs both zzso and zzso and is zzso by apparently distinct zzso carriers that fuse with the synaptic plasma membrane to deliver receptors for zzso zzso channels, zzso and zzso The zzso carriers in the developing zzso give rise to synaptic zzso On the zzso side, the so-called spine apparatus may represent a zzso zzso that gives rise to the zzso players in synaptic zzso Recent evidence indicates that recognition zzso particularly neural cell zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso structures and thus can provide a signal for zzso of these transport carriers at nascent zzso
