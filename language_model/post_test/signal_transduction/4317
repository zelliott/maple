zzso that define a new family, termed zzso zzso zzso have recently been identified as structural components of zzso tight junctions and zzso zzso and as cell signaling proteins in zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso gene has been shown to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and to act in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso that controls zzso induction in zzso zzso The combined data from recent zzso and genetic analyses of zzso zzso zzso suggest that certain tight junction proteins can play an important role in cell signaling zzso One possibility is that zzso segregation of signaling receptors to the zzso membrane domain of polarized zzso cells is crucial for proper cell zzso and that zzso zzso zzso may be required for this zzso
