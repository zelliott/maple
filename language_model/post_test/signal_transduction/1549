The human pathogen zzso zzso zzso host cell zzso during infection by delivering the outer membrane protein zzso to the host cell's zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein sharing several features with the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso which is involved in the regulation of zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso species produced by host cells is efficiently targeted to zzso zzso zzso resides in the zzso outer membrane and forms zzso with similar sizes as in the outer bacterial zzso The zzso completely lose their membrane potential, a characteristic previously observed in cells infected with zzso or treated with zzso zzso zzso related bacterial zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso coli remain in the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso in zzso is independent of a linear signal zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso outer membrane in zzso depends on the activity of zzso zzso and zzso but is independent of zzso Our data show that human zzso and bacterial zzso are imported into zzso by a similar zzso
