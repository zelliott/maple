The zzso gene encodes a regulatory zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which directs the zzso zzso to zzso involved in zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso repression of many zzso including the zzso structural genes that zzso the zzso zzso zzso In this report, we explore the role of zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso and very rapid loss of zzso transport activity - more rapid than can be explained by loss of the zzso protein zzso In a zzso strain we observe a significantly reduced rate of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the rapid loss of zzso transport activity does not zzso Instead, surprisingly, the slow rate of zzso of zzso zzso is accompanied by an increase in zzso transport zzso Loss of zzso modestly reduces the rates of both zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso strain suppresses the effect on zzso zzso zzso and partially restores the zzso of zzso transport activity, but does not affect the zzso of zzso gene expression to repression by zzso observed in this zzso Thus, protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso plays a role in zzso of the zzso signal during zzso zzso of zzso zzso but only zzso is involved in zzso zzso of zzso transport activity and zzso repression of zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso partially restores zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso strain, which lacks zzso zzso but does not rescue rapid zzso of zzso transport activity or sensitivity to zzso zzso A model for the role of zzso and zzso in zzso signaling pathways is zzso We also uncovered a previously zzso zzso delay in the zzso but not the zzso zzso and this delay is suppressed by zzso zzso The zzso delay seen in zzso zzso is slightly suppressed as well, but zzso zzso does not suppress other zzso zzso such as zzso to zzso zzso
