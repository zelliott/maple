zzso cell zzso zzso express high levels of the zzso zzso zzso and we have shown that zzso contributes to the zzso zzso in a transgenic mouse zzso The basis of zzso zzso regulation in zzso is zzso The sonic zzso zzso signaling zzso is frequently altered in zzso zzso of zzso signaling include the downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso Seven candidate zzso binding sites were identified in the zzso zzso zzso of increasing amounts of zzso in zzso resulted in a corresponding zzso increase in zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso was also able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in no significant changes in zzso promoter activity compared with zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be zzso processed into an zzso repressive form that can inhibit downstream zzso by zzso zzso zzso possessing only the zzso region or the zzso region were made and used in zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso shift analysis and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso binding site 4 zzso to zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso samples from transgenic mice expressing an zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly higher levels of zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso Together, these findings provide consistent evidence that zzso proteins can zzso regulate the zzso promoter and that zzso can inhibit zzso by zzso These studies further suggest that one consequence of the deregulation of zzso signaling in zzso is the zzso of zzso
