zzso hormone zzso is produced and zzso in multiple molecular zzso These zzso differ in their zzso structures, which determine the particular behavior of a given zzso in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso systems, this and other laboratories have shown that highly zzso human zzso zzso exhibit lower zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso relationships than their less zzso zzso It is not known, however, whether this characteristic behavior of the zzso zzso is reproduced by zzso zzso systems, in which unique zzso of the zzso are zzso zzso To gain further insights into the zzso relationship of the various zzso zzso we analyzed the capacity of nine charge zzso obtained after high-resolution zzso zzso window, zzso to zzso of anterior zzso zzso extracts to bind and activate their zzso zzso expressed by naturally occurring zzso cell systems zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso as well as by human embryonic zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems, the zzso displaced zzso zzso from the zzso in a zzso manner; however, whereas in the zzso systems, the zzso binding activity varied according to the zzso pH zzso content of the zzso with the less zzso zzso exhibiting higher zzso binding activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso for the zzso cell and zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, zzso than the more zzso zzso in the zzso zzso this relationship was practically absent zzso zzso zzso p zzso The capacity of the zzso to induce zzso zzso by rat zzso cells followed the same trend shown by its corresponding zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Interestingly and in contrast to the results observed in the zzso zzso binding zzso the ability of the zzso to induce zzso production by zzso cells varied according to their zzso pH value, with the more zzso zzso exhibiting lower potency than their less zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The results yielded by the zzso zzso suggest that the different potency of the zzso to elicit a biological effect in a naturally occurring zzso system depends primarily on the particular affinity of the zzso zzso for each zzso The existence of a clear zzso between zzso binding and signal zzso in the zzso system indicate that this later function is rather related to the different ability of the zzso zzso zzso to induce and/or stabilize distinct zzso zzso that may permit preferential or different degrees of zzso of a given signal zzso zzso Thus, the human zzso zzso system apparently possesses sufficient versatility to respond in a different manner to zzso diverse zzso zzso
