zzso injection of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic zzso which can zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kelly, zzso Because zzso activates the major forms of zzso oxide zzso zzso to produce zzso oxide zzso NO may play a role during zzso zzso Here we show that zzso application of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso with zzso blocked zzso synaptic zzso Thus, NO is necessary for zzso synaptic zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso mixture zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso synaptic zzso even though zzso or zzso blocked zzso synaptic zzso This result indicates that NO is not a retrograde zzso in zzso synaptic zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso with zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso alone blocked zzso synaptic zzso without affecting zzso synaptic zzso Our results suggest that NO works as a zzso zzso zzso during zzso synaptic zzso
