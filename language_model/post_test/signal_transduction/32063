Events normally taking place in the terminal zzso differentiation in the growth plate are also observed during zzso zzso development, suggesting that zzso such as zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso regulating zzso activity in the growth plate, may play a key role in zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the possible zzso between zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso protein 5 zzso and 6, zzso zzso and zzso bone zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso expression levels were investigated in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and active zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, 9, 13, 14, zzso 5, as well as collagen X zzso expression levels were evaluated after zzso zzso in zzso zzso The investigation of zzso binding to zzso promoter was assessed with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of experimental zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 7, 9, 13, 14, zzso 5, and collagen X zzso zzso as well as possible interactions between zzso and zzso and zzso promoters by using a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression levels were found to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared with zzso We showed that treatment of cultured zzso with zzso resulted in increased zzso nuclear zzso and zzso expression and that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso through zzso binding on zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced nuclear zzso protein levels, zzso and collagen X zzso whereas increased zzso protein levels in zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by using zzso regulates zzso 13, 14, zzso and zzso zzso evidenced by the observed strong binding of zzso to zzso 13, 14, zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that zzso zzso signaling zzso through zzso may contribute to zzso zzso and cartilage degradation in zzso
