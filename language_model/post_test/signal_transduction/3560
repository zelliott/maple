zzso is the major zzso in zzso An almost complete set of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso but only limited information is available regarding molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a member of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor family zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso failed to accumulate zzso at the levels achieved in the wild type, and were highly susceptible to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were not fully induced in the zzso indicating that the zzso defects were at least partly a result of reduced expression levels of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso induction of zzso in response to differential pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in the zzso zone, the zzso zzso site, and the induction was abolished in the presence of either a general zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed repression of the zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso background but not in zzso plants defective for salicylic acid zzso We discuss zzso as a key zzso factor involved in previously unknown regulatory mechanisms to induce zzso zzso in zzso
