We have examined the role of zzso in neural induction and zzso of the central nervous system zzso Using zzso zzso with dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that a patterned zzso can still develop following zzso of zzso zzso The most severely affected zzso developed with strong zzso zzso In these zzso head development and expression of a marker of zzso and zzso and of markers of the zzso occurred relatively zzso However, the expression levels of a zzso marker, zzso were considerably reduced compared to those in control zzso The results support the idea that zzso are involved in inducing zzso development, but they suggest that other signals are also necessary for zzso patterning of the primary body zzso
