In systems biology, questions concerning the molecular and cellular makeup of an zzso are of utmost importance, especially when trying to understand how unreliable zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels, among zzso reliable and zzso zzso The repertoire and speed of biological zzso are limited by zzso or zzso zzso an example can be found in zzso where fluctuations in zzso states limit the information they can zzso almost zzso of the total energy allocated for the brain used for zzso purposes, either via action zzso or by synaptic zzso Here, we consider the zzso for zzso to zzso zzso and zzso efficiency, wherein benefits and costs zzso against each other in the context of zzso and zzso zzso In particular, we try to link information zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso processing and show how they are related in a fundamental way through a complexity zzso zzso
