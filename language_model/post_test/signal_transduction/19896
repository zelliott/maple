zzso zzso between zzso oxygen species zzso and salicylic acid zzso programmed cell death zzso and zzso responses is complex and much remains to be zzso Recent reports have implicated zzso zzso in zzso responses, but the relationships between zzso zzso and zzso remain to be zzso zzso This question was investigated in zzso zzso zzso plants zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso trigger zzso zzso zzso formation and a wide range of pathogen zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that leaf zzso contents were markedly decreased in zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso blocked zzso formation, zzso zzso and associated zzso responses in a manner that closely zzso the effect of genetically blocking zzso synthesis through zzso zzso 1 zzso The effects of zzso were linked to repression of zzso transcripts but not decreased zzso stress or zzso and caused loss of resistance to virulent zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso formation and resistance could be partly restored by zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate a role for zzso in cell death triggered by zzso zzso zzso , and suggest that the tissue content of this compound is a key factor determining whether zzso stress zzso or opposes zzso zzso
