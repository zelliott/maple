The mechanism involved in the zzso actions of chronic zzso treatment on zzso cell zzso was studied in adult zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso (2 zzso g body weight, zzso twice zzso for 15 days and another set of rats was treated with zzso plus zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso zzso for 15 zzso zzso treatment with zzso increased serum zzso but decreased serum zzso testosterone, zzso and zzso zzso fluid zzso testosterone and zzso zzso Administration of zzso with zzso partially prevented the decrease in serum and zzso testosterone and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso number, zzso and zzso zzso production were diminished by zzso treatment which remained at control level in the zzso plus zzso treated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly decreased in zzso treated zzso zzso plus zzso treatment did not affect zzso activity but decreased zzso activity, indicating a direct zzso effect of excess zzso on zzso cell testosterone zzso The indirect effect of zzso thus, assume to be zzso through lower zzso which regulates the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso testosterone production by zzso cells of zzso and zzso plus zzso treated rats were decreased compared to control suggesting the deleterious effect of excess zzso on zzso signal zzso and thus zzso
