zzso of the zzso signaling cascade provides key signals during development and in zzso Here we provide evidence, by designing a zzso zzso with zzso signaling activity, that physical proximity of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso triggers the zzso signaling zzso We have uncovered a branch of the zzso zzso in which zzso activity is regulated zzso with the levels of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso normally required for controlling zzso levels, suggesting that modulated degradation of zzso is not required for zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso recruits zzso to the zzso and that this interaction leads to zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso is no longer bound by zzso resulting in nuclear signaling by zzso
