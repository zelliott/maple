We recently found that plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diminished in zzso cell culture models of insulin zzso Here we delineated whether increased zzso flux through the zzso zzso zzso zzso causes the zzso zzso and insulin resistance induced by zzso Increased zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso cultured under conditions closely resembling zzso zzso (5 zzso insulin for 12 zzso and in cells where zzso activity was amplified by 2 zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and experimental zzso challenge induced comparable losses of zzso and zzso In addition to protecting against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso state, zzso zzso corrected the zzso insult on these zzso Moreover, in accordance with zzso flux directly weakening zzso structure, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso zzso structure and insulin zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with a loss of zzso plasma membrane zzso and insulin zzso A slight decrease in zzso zzso resulted from amplifying zzso by zzso and zzso However, experimental maintenance of the zzso zzso pool under both conditions with zzso did not reverse the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, less invasive challenges with zzso in the absence of insulin, also led to zzso zzso zzso we suggest that the functionality of cell systems dependent on zzso and/or zzso status, such as the zzso transport system, can be critically compromised by inappropriate zzso zzso
