zzso of human peripheral blood zzso via T cell zzso complex resulted in a zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso Within 10 zzso of stimulation zzso was zzso to, and thus activated in, the plasma zzso of human zzso followed by a fast zzso of this zzso from the plasma zzso This short term zzso and zzso zzso proved to be zzso A zzso zzso After 90 zzso of stimulation zzso was zzso to and remained bound to the plasma zzso for up to 4 zzso zzso of human zzso with 200 zzso zzso specifically and completely abolished the sustained zzso of zzso Neither the zzso zzso direct zzso of zzso nor the specific activity of the plasma zzso zzso was influenced by zzso suggesting that a signal zzso zzso leading to sustained zzso of zzso was influenced by the zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso in a zzso manner, the zzso of zzso zzso elevated incorporation of zzso fatty acids into plasma membrane zzso While zzso zzso synthesis and cellular proliferation were completely inhibited by 200 zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, expression of zzso zzso receptors was not influenced by the zzso zzso These results suggest that synthesis and expression of zzso zzso receptors might be regulated by a zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso fatty acids might represent another mechanism of signal zzso implicated in the zzso and zzso of zzso which is specifically inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso by introducing zzso zzso prevented zzso synthesis and proliferation in zzso human zzso The results suggest a possible link between zzso of zzso and regulation of zzso synthesis in activated human zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso may result in zzso of zzso gene expression in human zzso
