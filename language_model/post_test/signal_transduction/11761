We studied the mechanism zzso insulin activates de zzso zzso acid synthesis in zzso zzso zzso rapidly activated zzso zzso zzso in intact and zzso preparations of zzso in a zzso zzso The apparent zzso of the zzso was decreased by treatment with insulin, whereas the zzso was zzso No zzso was found by zzso zzso growth zzso zzso II, or zzso but zzso growth factor, which, like insulin, is known to activate de zzso zzso acid synthesis in intact zzso also zzso zzso zzso In zzso or membrane zzso the effect of insulin on zzso was fully zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso C zzso An zzso raised against zzso completely blocked the effect of insulin on zzso Although the above findings suggested involvement of a zzso in zzso zzso of zzso neither zzso nor protein zzso C zzso appeared to be zzso On the other hand, insulin zzso the release of a zzso factor, which activated zzso zzso This zzso factor had a molecular weight of less than zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso blocked the zzso of zzso by insulin, suggesting involvement of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also blocked by zzso of intact zzso with zzso toxin and by prior addition, to zzso of an zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
