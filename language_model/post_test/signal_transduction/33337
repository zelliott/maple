The zzso and zzso zzso proteins have recently been identified as important zzso of the responses to transforming growth factor beta zzso and related zzso We have previously shown that zzso and zzso (the product of the tumor zzso gene zzso 4) strongly zzso as zzso of zzso zzso and that inactive zzso truncated zzso of either zzso act as zzso zzso of the natural zzso zzso The finding that zzso unlike zzso does not interact with the zzso zzso coupled with the distinct structural features of zzso raises the possibility that zzso zzso not only with zzso but also with zzso and zzso to mediate signaling by zzso family zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso zzso taken from zzso zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso thereby mimicking the effects of zzso family members - bone zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso Low levels of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso also zzso to induce zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso as it does with zzso to induce gene expression from the promoter for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso were required for this zzso Finally, a short zzso zzso of zzso previously identified as a zzso of zzso 4 in tumors, blocked nuclear zzso of zzso zzso 1, 2, 3 and 4, consistent with our observation of a physical interaction between truncated zzso and the other zzso 

Our observations indicate that zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso to act as a common zzso of signaling by zzso factors, and provide a mechanism that explains the zzso interference with zzso signaling that results from expression of the naturally occurring zzso 4 zzso zzso
