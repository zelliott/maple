zzso zzso are characterized by distinct structural and functional entities involved in the generation and transmission of the action potential and the zzso zzso zzso Key to their function is the specific organization of zzso channels and zzso to and within distinct membrane zzso which supports the zzso propagation of the zzso zzso This review addresses the current knowledge on the molecular actors regulating the distinct trafficking and targeting mechanisms of zzso channels in the highly polarized cardiac zzso In addition to ubiquitous mechanisms shared by other excitable cells, cardiac zzso show unique zzso illustrated by the molecular organization of zzso zzso zzso the zzso disc and the gap zzso Many factors contribute to the specialization of the cardiac zzso and the functional expression of cardiac zzso channels, including various zzso zzso motors, small zzso membrane zzso and zzso The discovery of genetic defects in some of these actors, leading to complex cardiac disorders, emphasizes the importance of trafficking and targeting of zzso channels to cardiac zzso A major challenge in the field is to understand how these and other actors work together in intact zzso to fine-tune zzso channel expression and control cardiac zzso
