zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso contributes to the selective interaction between HS and various proteins in zzso To clarify the in zzso importance of HS fine structures, we characterized the functions of the zzso HS zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso in zzso or zzso had unexpectedly little effect on zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso HS revealed not only a loss of corresponding zzso but also a zzso increase of zzso at other positions, which maintains the level of HS total zzso The restricted zzso of zzso zzso are ascribed to this compensation because zzso signaling is strongly disrupted by zzso zzso double zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso which removes zzso zzso groups without increasing zzso zzso These findings suggest that the overall zzso level is more important than strictly defined HS fine structures for zzso signaling in some zzso zzso
