zzso zzso represent the third most frequent type of central nervous system zzso tumor of childhood, after zzso and zzso No zzso biological markers are available, and differentiation from zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The present objective was, for a sample of 27 children with zzso zzso and 7 with zzso to describe and compare the zzso status of 19 genes (with current zzso symbol, if zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three adult zzso were used as a zzso We detected a similar percentage of zzso tumors in both groups zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso No gene was zzso in that control zzso zzso was the most frequently zzso gene in both benign tumors zzso and zzso zzso The genes associated with zzso were zzso in both groups of zzso The percentages of TRAIL zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso were 30, zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and 50, 50, and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso No other gene was zzso in the benign tumors, whereas zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso Although we did not observe a statistical relationship between zzso and clinical outcome, the zzso pattern does not appear to be randomly distributed in zzso and may represent a mechanism of tumor development and zzso
