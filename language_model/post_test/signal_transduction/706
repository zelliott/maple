zzso mice carrying the zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso develop numerous zzso along the entire length of the zzso and consequently die at an early zzso This short lifespan would prevent the zzso of zzso genetic zzso or zzso zzso necessary for tumor zzso To overcome this zzso we generated zzso zzso hybrids by crossing zzso and zzso females to zzso zzso zzso These hybrids developed few zzso tumors and often lived longer than 1 zzso Many of the tumors zzso were invasive zzso in which zzso tissue penetrated through the muscle wall into the zzso In a few cases zzso zzso zzso by extension to regional zzso zzso The development of these familial zzso does not require zzso gains or losses, a high level of zzso instability, or the presence of zzso To test whether genetic instability might accelerate tumor zzso we generated zzso mice zzso for the zzso zzso of the zzso breakage syndrome gene zzso and also treated zzso mice with a strong zzso zzso These imposed genetic zzso did not reduce the time required for zzso to form nor increase the percentage of zzso nor drive progression to the point of distant zzso In zzso we have found that the zzso mouse model for familial zzso cancer can develop frequent invasive zzso in the absence of overt zzso zzso zzso factors that promote invasion include zzso zzso changes, conservative zzso zzso or direct effects of zzso in the zzso hybrid genetic zzso
