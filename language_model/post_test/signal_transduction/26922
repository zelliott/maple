The molecular mechanisms governing the spontaneous recovery seen following brain injury remain zzso but recent studies indicate that zzso stimulation of zzso zzso contributes to the repair zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso zzso is tempered by the demonstration that traumatic brain injury zzso results in the selective death of zzso immature zzso compromising the cell population poised to compensate for zzso zzso zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso zzso as a critical player in the survival of immature zzso zzso following brain zzso While zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso development, zzso neural cultures derived from zzso mice display increased cell death and blunted zzso cascade zzso in response to zzso stress, without affecting zzso zzso When compared with zzso zzso cultures, zzso loss rendered immature zzso zzso susceptible to zzso damage, without altering the survival of neural zzso zzso zzso zzso stress is a major contributor to zzso cell death following brain zzso zzso with the enhanced vulnerability of cultured zzso immature zzso zzso mice exhibited a significantly greater loss of zzso immature zzso within the zzso zzso after zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was zzso Together, these data identify a new and unexpected role for zzso in zzso zzso functioning as a selective survival mechanism for immature zzso zzso within the zzso zone of the zzso zzso following zzso
