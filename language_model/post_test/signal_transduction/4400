In zzso zzso smooth muscle cells, zzso Y zzso stimulates zzso of zzso from zzso store sites via zzso zzso However, it has been debated whether or not zzso zzso by zzso receptors depends on the generation of zzso zzso zzso following zzso of zzso zzso To examine this question, we studied the effect of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso rise in zzso free zzso concentration zzso in comparison with that on zzso II zzso zzso increase, which is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso study using the zzso dye zzso revealed that application of zzso induced a rapid but transient zzso increase in a single cell, arising from zzso calcium zzso Application of zzso to the same cell induced a zzso rise with a pattern similar to that induced by zzso zzso increased the formation of zzso by about zzso fold, while the zzso zzso formation was very zzso zzso completely inhibited not only zzso zzso but also zzso zzso induced by either zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso increase was about zzso more potent that on the zzso zzso zzso an inactive analog of zzso had no influence on any of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso A completely inhibited the zzso growth zzso zzso increase but had no effect on the zzso zzso increase, indicating that zzso zzso is not involved in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso from zzso stores in zzso smooth muscle cells is secondary to the very small generation of zzso following stimulation of zzso zzso which may account for the hypersensitivity of the zzso effect to zzso
