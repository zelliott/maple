To understand the mechanism of zzso cell zzso we examined the consequences of deletion derivatives of zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso on zzso transcription, on levels of free versus zzso zzso and on zzso limiting zzso that could impact cell zzso zzso showed that individual zzso zzso and zzso increased the zzso expression to varying zzso with pronounced induction in zzso zzso the ratio of soluble zzso versus zzso form of zzso increased in zzso however without increase of its total amount, unraveling zzso complexity in zzso zzso zzso characteristics of cell zzso accompanied by a severe reduction in the levels of zzso zzso factor zzso were observed in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was suppressed by either zzso or zzso zzso but neither by zzso nor by zzso zzso However, the cell zzso of the zzso strain was almost completely zzso not only by the zzso clone but also by the zzso zzso suggesting zzso might be limiting in zzso Thus, increase in the ratio of free zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso reduction in zzso levels can account for zzso zzso in concert with a potential role of small zzso on the zzso zzso
