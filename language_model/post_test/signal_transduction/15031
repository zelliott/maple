The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical copper transport protein functioning in systemic copper zzso and supply of copper to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso can lead to the usually lethal zzso zzso zzso function is regulated by zzso trafficking between the zzso Network and the plasma zzso We have previously reported zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso but the specific zzso sites had not been zzso As copper stimulates both trafficking and zzso of zzso we aimed to identify all the specific zzso and to determine whether trafficking and zzso are zzso We identified zzso in zzso zzso sites in the human zzso and eight in zzso all clustered within the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Eight sites were zzso and hence candidates for regulating zzso trafficking or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site zzso resulted in zzso of zzso in the presence of added copper in both polarized zzso zzso canine zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, strongly suggesting that zzso of specific zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma zzso A zzso zzso site, zzso when zzso to zzso also resulted in zzso in the presence of added copper in polarized zzso zzso kidney zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso of specific zzso zzso in zzso regulates its zzso zzso and hence function and will facilitate identification of the zzso and signaling pathways involved in regulating this pivotal copper zzso
