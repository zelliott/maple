zzso of zzso plays a role in the development of drug resistance in leukemia and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that act as signal zzso in zzso initiated by many growth factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked to drug resistance in zzso In this study we investigated effects of zzso and zzso on zzso growth zzso of zzso breast cancer zzso In the absence of zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso active form of zzso in zzso cells did not affect proliferation zzso zzso of zzso increased resistance of zzso cells to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso sensitivity of individual zzso clones showed that zzso resistance was positively correlated with level of zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso also increased resistance to zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso cells zzso zzso resulted in greater zzso resistance than induction of zzso activity in zzso cells lacking zzso zzso Furthermore, levels of zzso zzso were increased in zzso cells zzso a zzso active zzso zzso cells zzso zzso active zzso were also more resistant to zzso which, like zzso is a zzso of zzso These observations suggest both independent and overlapping roles for zzso and zzso zzso in the resistance to growth zzso by zzso
