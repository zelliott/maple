zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice, result in reduced numbers and responses of peripheral B zzso Surface zzso signaling is defective in zzso zzso B cells as they do not zzso upon zzso zzso and lack zzso zzso type II zzso zzso through zzso and zzso play a critical role in B cell zzso To investigate the consequences of the lack of both zzso and zzso on B cell development and function, mice were generated that were zzso for targeted zzso in the zzso and the zzso genes zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a synergistic effect on the zzso zzso In zzso mice the number of B cells was reduced 3- to zzso compared to zzso mice and mature B cells zzso were virtually zzso serum levels of all zzso zzso were zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, although zzso zzso and zzso mice produced zzso centers in response to zzso zzso the zzso mice did zzso zzso and functional B cell defects in zzso mice may result from a combination of intrinsic B cell zzso lack of zzso T cell help and zzso zzso These data suggest that signals through zzso and zzso are necessary for the production and maintenance of the mature B zzso
