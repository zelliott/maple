zzso the detailed mechanisms of a zzso agent action on cancer cells is essential for planning the clinical applications because drug effects are often tissue and cell type zzso This study set out to zzso the molecular pathways of zzso effects in human zzso zzso cancer cells using as an experimental model four cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso All cell lines were sensitive to zzso although to different zzso In primary zzso the drug displayed substantially lower zzso In zzso cancer cells, zzso changes characteristic to zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of membrane asymmetry only within a narrow concentration range, from 6 to 50 zzso At higher zzso other zzso of cell death perhaps associated with zzso collapse was zzso Low doses of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and led to its degradation observed on the background of a sustained or increasing zzso level and zzso of zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso was essential for the zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells, whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso were likely to comprise main survival zzso Our results suggest an importance of cautious interpreting of biological effects of zzso in laboratory studies and for determining optimal doses of zzso to achieve the desired therapeutic effect in zzso zzso zzso
