Several lines of evidence suggest a zzso role of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We showed in previous studies that its zzso through drugs with zzso properties, have beneficial effects in zzso zzso We tested whether zzso a well-known zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso and readily available for clinical use, could have a beneficial effect in zzso mice in comparison with zzso the gold standard treatment for zzso zzso zzso old zzso mice received for five weeks: zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso strength and strength zzso to zzso zzso reduced serum zzso zzso zzso reduced markers of zzso zzso zzso reduced muscle necrosis and enhanced zzso The positive results were more evident with the daily administration of zzso and were comparable to the effect of zzso Our data support the novel hypothesis that, as other more specific therapeutic approaches are still under development, this zzso compound is a promising option to be further investigated in zzso zzso
