To further understand the mechanism underlying zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, the effect of the hormone on zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso activities as well as on the zzso of G alpha i was studied in zzso from chick skeletal muscle zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity in a dose zzso zzso and time zzso zzso dependent fashion, provided zzso (10 zzso was present in the zzso High affinity zzso activity was unaffected by the zzso In the absence of zzso or in the presence of zzso (20 zzso zzso effects on zzso were zzso zzso activity was increased zzso in cells zzso (1 zzso 5 zzso with the zzso Moreover, zzso of G alpha i from zzso zzso zzso showed that 5 zzso exposure to 1 zzso zzso increased zzso zzso the zzso of its alpha zzso The present data suggest that in muscle cells, zzso activates zzso by a non zzso zzso action which could imply zzso of zzso function by zzso alpha i zzso
