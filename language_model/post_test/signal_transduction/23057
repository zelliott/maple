We have recently shown that, in human zzso zzso zzso fails to induce specific zzso activities to the zzso response region zzso a regulatory element located in the zzso gene promoter, which is required for zzso zzso by zzso and zzso gamma zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso is also unable to induce the binding of zzso or zzso to the zzso element zzso despite the fact that both proteins are expressed in zzso Whereas zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso are efficient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to trigger zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso therefore explaining its inability to induce the zzso expression in these zzso By contrast, we demonstrate that zzso alone represents an efficient stimulus of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso belongs to the recently cloned zzso zzso protein zzso gene family (which also includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that is believed to be, at least in part, under the control of zzso zzso factors and whose products are potential zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso through a mechanism that involves zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso transcripts zzso other family members are unaffected by zzso in zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells suppresses zzso growth arrest, zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that, in zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is neither required for zzso induction by zzso nor involved in the regulatory effects of zzso on zzso zzso
