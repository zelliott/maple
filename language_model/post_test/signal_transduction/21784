zzso belongs to the zzso family and is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso To explore the function of zzso on zzso cells, we treated human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and human zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso and analyzed its effect on zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation of zzso cells and the activity was specifically blocked by zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso An alternatively spliced zzso of zzso was isolated and also was shown to induce proliferation of zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso with both zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso antagonized the activity of zzso because it diminished zzso proliferation of zzso zzso significantly induced zzso migration and vascular tube formation on zzso in zzso In zzso zzso also enhanced tumor zzso zzso of zzso with zzso induced transcripts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, incubation of zzso with zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso and promotes zzso
