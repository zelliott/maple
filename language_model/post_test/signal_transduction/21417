zzso is an zzso dominant genetic zzso disorder, characterized by zzso white hair and patches located on the forehead, anterior zzso and zzso Most zzso patients have a zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso cell zzso The white hair and patches of such patients are already completely formed at birth and do not usually expand zzso This stability of pigmented spots also applies to zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, two novel cases of zzso were reported in 2001, in which both mother and daughter having a novel zzso zzso in their zzso gene showed progressive zzso To prepare an animal model of this zzso to explore undefined functions of zzso signaling for maintaining pigmented zzso in the skin or more specifically the integrity of the zzso stem cell system in the zzso skin, we produced transgenic mice expressing zzso zzso These mice well zzso the white spotting pattern of zzso however, no change in this pattern was observed after birth, even after increasing the zzso expression by various zzso Here, we report the unexpectedly extremely stable maintenance of the zzso stem cell system under stringent conditions for zzso zzso
