zzso recovery after peripheral nerve injury is often poor despite high zzso capacity of peripheral zzso In search for novel treatments, brief electrical stimulation of the acutely zzso nerve has recently been identified as a clinically feasible approach increasing precision of zzso zzso The effects of this stimulation appear to be zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso but the zzso zzso are zzso A potential candidate is the zzso zzso known to be selectively zzso in motor but not sensory nerve branches of the mouse zzso nerve and to enhance growth of motor but not sensory zzso in zzso Here, we show that short-term zzso electrical stimulation (1 zzso 20 zzso of the zzso and surgically repaired zzso nerve in zzso mice causes a motor zzso enhancement of zzso expression zzso with previously reported acceleration of muscle zzso Such enhanced zzso expression was not observed after electrical stimulation in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the degree of proper zzso of the zzso muscle, as indicated by retrograde labeling of zzso was reduced in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso Also, recovery of zzso muscle function, evaluated by a novel zzso motion analysis approach, and zzso regrowth into the zzso nerve zzso assessed zzso were considerably delayed in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso signaling is important for functional recovery after nerve repair and suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso is linked to this zzso
