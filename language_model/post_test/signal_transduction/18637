zzso mechanisms that control zzso zzso during zzso central nervous system zzso development are poorly zzso In this study, we identified zzso an zzso zzso zzso regulator, by screening for genes zzso in the zzso nerves of zzso zzso The predicted primary structure of zzso is zzso zzso in zzso and zzso In the developing zzso zzso is specifically expressed in zzso but not their zzso Its expression increases in parallel with that of major zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso is a nuclear protein that possesses zzso repression zzso In the developing chick neural tube, zzso can promote zzso precursor formation upon zzso zzso In addition, zzso can interact and cooperate with the zzso zzso factor zzso to promote precocious and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso via zzso in an zzso cell line leads to the zzso of zzso gene zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso important for zzso maturation and that zzso cooperation can serve as a mechanism for zzso zzso
