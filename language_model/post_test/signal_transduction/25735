Human zzso memory zzso zzso T cells can rapidly zzso across an zzso cell zzso zzso in response either to zzso or to zzso signals displayed by human zzso zzso zzso under conditions of zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that the zzso zzso migration zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression by the zzso whereas zzso zzso does zzso In this study, we further analyze these responses using blocking zzso and small interfering zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso depends on zzso on zzso as well as on zzso and depends on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso is engaged by zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are engaged by both zzso accessory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an alternative zzso for zzso contributes exclusively to zzso zzso and zzso appears to be zzso in either zzso These data further define and further highlight the differences in the two pathways of zzso zzso T cell recruitment into sites of peripheral zzso
