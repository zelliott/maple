We have previously shown that ethanol zzso zzso protective zzso zzso in gastric surface zzso zzso This study investigates the defense systems in rat gastric zzso cells zzso exposed simultaneously to zzso and zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso exposure to zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso activity and decreased cell zzso indicating zzso damaging zzso zzso exposure to zzso (5 zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso opposing zzso decrease in cell membrane integrity and in cell viability as shown by decreasing zzso expression with zzso zzso Low doses of zzso decreased the zzso zzso induced zzso activity independently from zzso zzso and inhibited zzso decrease in zzso precursor protein levels, also indicating the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso (5 zzso protection in zzso exposed zzso seems to have two distinct zzso zzso of zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso
