zzso and zzso are zzso proteins that are involved in host recognition of specific bacterial molecules and are genetically associated with several inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso stimulation activates zzso through zzso a zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso activates zzso in response to zzso and zzso stimulation is zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso with zzso zzso chains at zzso 209 zzso located in its zzso domain upon zzso or zzso stimulation and by induced zzso of zzso zzso of zzso at zzso was essential for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not require the zzso activity of zzso or alter the interaction of zzso with zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso of zzso was found to mediate the recruitment of zzso a zzso that was found to be essential for zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso links zzso to zzso complexes, a critical step in zzso zzso zzso
