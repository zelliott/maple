zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and was originally identified as a zzso zzso Previously, we found that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso led to accumulated zzso oxygen species and promoted leaf zzso induced by zzso stress, which was suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso in zzso response zzso Whether zzso function is involved in zzso zzso and/or the response zzso remained zzso Here we show that neither zzso zzso nor a zzso zzso zzso of zzso generates a higher level of zzso than the wild type and display a typical zzso zzso in zzso zzso treated with zzso acid zzso Nevertheless, zzso suppresses the zzso of early flowering and zzso leaf zzso in zzso zzso We reveal that a functional zzso response is essential for zzso function in leaf zzso and floral zzso but zzso is unlikely a regulatory component integral to the zzso zzso
