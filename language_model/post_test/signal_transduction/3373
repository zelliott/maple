zzso of conventional transforming growth zzso zzso and bone zzso protein zzso zzso are composed of two zzso to zzso acid peptides that are produced through the zzso processing of a zzso precursor by zzso such as zzso We report the identification of an zzso zzso zzso processing site in the zzso zzso zzso of the Glass bottom boat zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 6, and 7) zzso that generates a zzso acid, active zzso zzso distinct from the conventional zzso acid zzso zzso the large zzso form of zzso exhibited greater signaling activity and a longer range than the shorter form zzso The abundance of zzso and zzso varied among different zzso raising the possibility that differential processing could account for zzso behaviors of zzso In human zzso zzso that abolished the zzso zzso site in zzso zzso or zzso hormone were associated with zzso lip with or without zzso zzso zzso premature zzso failure zzso and persistent zzso duct syndrome zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso processing during zzso The identification of this large zzso zzso form and the functional differences between large and small zzso exemplifies the potential for differential zzso processing to substantially affect zzso and zzso signaling output in different tissue and cellular zzso
