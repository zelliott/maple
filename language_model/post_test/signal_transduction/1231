We investigated how the synthesis of zzso zzso by zzso acting through zzso and zzso is strongly amplified by simultaneous incubation with zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso acid type B receptors zzso known to inhibit zzso zzso via zzso Because these agents have opposite effects on zzso levels, the unexpected increase in zzso synthesis when they are applied simultaneously has been zzso zzso From previous reports, it appears that zzso type II contributes most significantly to this zzso 

We found that simultaneous application of zzso and zzso specifically influences the zzso of molecules involved in the induction and termination of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has a higher affinity for zzso zzso zzso when these zzso are zzso with zzso Our data also suggest that, when zzso and zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso from zzso zzso These zzso regulations of zzso of the zzso zzso complex might be responsible for the drastic increase of zzso synthesis in response to the simultaneous zzso 

zzso signals arriving at a particular zzso zzso on molecular detectors of coincidence and trigger specific zzso zzso We zzso that this phenomenon comes from the complex molecular zzso involved, including scaffolding proteins that make zzso interactions between associated molecules zzso The zzso of simultaneous signaling is addressed as a key to synaptic zzso
