zzso and zzso of individuals with allergic diseases express increased levels of the zzso zzso receptors zzso or zzso on their zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso activates the cells to release inflammatory zzso In mast cells, the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso receptors zzso has recently been shown to activate these cells independent of zzso It has not been determined if such is true of the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine whether zzso zzso alone can activate zzso human zzso and how this may relate to the zzso by zzso immune zzso zzso zzso cultured for 48 h with zzso to zzso zzso were zzso with human myeloma zzso and further cultured for 24 h with or without zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso zzso and zzso (as an index of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso showed that in zzso zzso zzso with zzso alone caused a release of zzso and zzso The addition of zzso zzso to zzso the bound zzso resulted in the enhancement of the zzso Such zzso by zzso zzso and zzso immune complex was blocked with an zzso zzso confirming the specific involvement of zzso zzso Neither of the zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso contrary to previous zzso These results show for the first time, that in zzso zzso zzso zzso alone can activate zzso and that zzso of such zzso by zzso zzso only enhances the zzso These observations have implications for the understanding of the zzso of zzso inflammation accompanying many allergic zzso
