zzso is a common condition in zzso life, where elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso may lead to adverse zzso zzso namely in the presence of inflammatory zzso In this review, we zzso recent concepts on zzso damage to brain cells and associated zzso zzso Exposure of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso an inflammatory response with the release of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso cells revealed to be particularly susceptible to zzso zzso pointing to a mechanism that may preside to the vulnerability evidenced by premature zzso zzso of zzso mechanisms of zzso and zzso to zzso revealed that zzso and zzso pathways as well as zzso and zzso signaling zzso are key zzso of both zzso production and cell toxicity observed upon zzso zzso zzso these mechanisms is essential for the development of new strategies targeting zzso zzso Thus, a therapeutic approach for the prevention or zzso of neurological deficits resulting from moderate to severe zzso may consist on the use of zzso such as zzso that showed ability to suppress the release of zzso from zzso exposed to zzso zzso acid zzso that zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso loss of cell survival, and zzso that evidenced a unique role in preventing zzso in in zzso and in zzso zzso Novel pharmacological strategies may reduce the zzso of zzso zzso and prevent minor cerebral zzso that may result in mental zzso
