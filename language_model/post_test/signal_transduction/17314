BACKGROUND In recent years it became evident that several types of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the classical zzso type known in zzso an zzso type containing an additional zzso is present in primates and zzso This specific zzso zzso introduces a zzso unknown regulatory zzso of the zzso at the zzso level which can lead to the expression of an alternative protein covering the zzso part zzso Furthermore, an zzso type lacking zzso 10 at the zzso and protein levels has been described in the New World zzso zzso giving rise to an additional zzso type in which zzso acids of the zzso hinge region connecting the zzso repeat domain and zzso domain are zzso zzso zzso information was retrieved by systematic searches using zzso zzso zzso models were retrieved from a zzso hormone receptors web application and from recent zzso zzso In a novel approach, we combine functional aspects with three-dimensional properties of the zzso and the different zzso types to deduce zzso relationships between these two zzso On this basis, the zzso impact and zzso consequences of the different zzso types are zzso zzso The complex system of different zzso types and two corresponding hormones zzso and zzso represents a major challenge for future studies on selective hormone zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso The presence of these naturally occurring zzso types requires zzso of our present view on zzso function, experimental zzso and data zzso but also offers new clinical approaches to interfere with zzso action in zzso
