Gene therapy is a novel approach for enhancing the viability of zzso zzso zzso of growth factor genes pertinent to zzso and zzso of genes of relevant signal pathways are imperative for improving zzso zzso The authors investigated the gene expression profiles of growth factors and signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso after zzso gene zzso 

Twenty zzso rats were divided into two zzso The experimental group zzso zzso 10) received the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso injected into the zzso of the zzso area, whereas the control group zzso zzso 10) received the zzso zzso Seven days later, a zzso random zzso was zzso Seven days after surgery, zzso viability was zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways was assessed by quantitative analysis of the products of zzso zzso chain zzso 

Transfer of zzso zzso gene significantly improved zzso viability zzso zzso zzso zzso of expression of zzso and zzso genes in the zzso were significantly elevated after zzso gene transfer zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes was not zzso 

Transfer of zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso promotes expression of zzso and zzso genes and zzso of zzso gene in addition to its effects on the zzso zzso The finding implies that transfer of the gene of one growth factor ultimately improves the expression of the genes of multiple growth zzso zzso of the zzso gene suggests that the zzso zzso may be important in enhancement of zzso viability and will likely be a target of future efforts of regulation of signaling process in treatment of zzso zzso
