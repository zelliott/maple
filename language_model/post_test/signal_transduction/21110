Using a laser scanning zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso indicator zzso the zzso zzso dynamics in cultured kidney inner zzso collecting duct cells was zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso intensity increased zzso zzso similarly increased zzso and zzso but zzso and zzso did zzso A ratio between zzso and zzso was about zzso zzso zzso at rest and increased zzso zzso zzso at the peak of stimulation zzso zzso zzso In zzso condition, zzso increased zzso and zzso with a smaller peak intensity, but the peak ratio was similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time resolution of 100 zzso in line scanning mode did not detect the delay between nuclear and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that nuclear zzso was not diffused from the zzso and that it may be directly released from the nuclear zzso a possible zzso zzso
