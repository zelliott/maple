In developing zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the neural tube and in the zzso zzso that gives rise to skeletal zzso zzso zzso develop muscular and neural tube zzso zzso zzso is essential for the proper zzso of the zzso determination factor zzso zzso during early muscle development and zzso zzso zzso result in muscle tumors, providing evidence that zzso has diverse functions in zzso To investigate the specific functions of zzso in development, we have examined cell survival and gene expression in zzso zzso zzso and neural tube of developing zzso and zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso by signals from neural zzso and surface zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso and is accompanied by a marked increase in programmed cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated normally in the zzso zzso but zzso cells are zzso and zzso is prevalent in newly formed zzso but not in the neural tube or mature zzso In neural tube and zzso regions where cell survival is zzso the closely related zzso gene is zzso and its expression becomes expanded into the zzso neural tube and zzso where zzso would normally be zzso These results establish that zzso has complementary functions in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and in repression of zzso during neural tube and zzso zzso
