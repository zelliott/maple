zzso are known to interfere with the production of inflammatory zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of xenon and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso factor zzso and production of tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Whole blood was incubated with zzso in the absence or presence of the either xenon (30 and 60 zzso and zzso (1 and 2 minimum zzso zzso concentration zzso After 4 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso was investigated using isolated zzso from the blood zzso zzso zzso were prepared, and binding of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to its target DNA were measured with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso were significantly increased in the presence of xenon compared with zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso which was associated with a decreased production of zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that xenon and zzso have opposite effects on the zzso production of zzso and zzso Furthermore, xenon increases, whereas zzso zzso the zzso of zzso providing a possible molecular mechanism for the different effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This study has shown that zzso respond to zzso zzso in the presence of xenon with an increased zzso of nuclear zzso factor zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism for the different effects of both zzso on zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso
