zzso zzso 2 zzso is expressed in vascular zzso cells zzso However, the role of zzso in vascular barrier integrity and zzso is not well zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso generates zzso oxide to mediate vascular zzso compromising survival in patients with zzso We recently observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso might suppress zzso exerting a protective effect against zzso barrier disruption and zzso 

Mice deficient in zzso and zzso underwent zzso challenge or zzso factor zzso zzso zzso were performed to examine vascular zzso and the underlying zzso 

zzso deletion zzso vascular leakage and zzso after either zzso challenge or zzso zzso zzso injection induced zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso and lungs of zzso mice, which were zzso compared with values seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso was enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion or zzso zzso blockade protected zzso mice from zzso of barrier disruption after zzso challenge and zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice exhibited greater stimulation of zzso and zzso with enhanced zzso oxide production in response to zzso or zzso compared with that seen in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed more severe zzso of zzso junctions with zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso which was restored by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso diminishes harmful robust zzso stimulation and thereby zzso vascular barrier zzso suggesting potential usefulness of zzso zzso as novel therapeutic agents for zzso
