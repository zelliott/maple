The zzso zzso are a group of zzso which in addition to their zzso activity are capable of modulating a variety of cellular zzso One such prominent effect of zzso is their potent zzso action, which can be observed both on zzso and zzso cells of many different zzso zzso are also used in the clinic, mainly in zzso and viral diseases, and their cell growth zzso effect has been suggested to be of major importance in their zzso and zzso zzso The aim of the present review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso cell cycle progression in various cell zzso With the recent progress in our understanding of how the cell cycle is regulated at the molecular level, it has become possible to delineate zzso zzso of zzso in this zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso may not only help in understanding its zzso and zzso activities, but may also provide an insight into cell cycle regulation in general and aid in making zzso a more useful tool in treating zzso
