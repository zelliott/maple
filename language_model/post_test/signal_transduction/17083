The present study is aimed to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol extract on zzso zzso and clarify the possible zzso 

zzso with zzso left anterior descending coronary artery were treated with zzso ethanol extract zzso zzso zzso daily via zzso for 4 zzso zzso changes and collagen distribution were evaluated by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso I and zzso III were detected by real-time zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso 

zzso treatment was significantly reduced the heart zzso weight ratio zzso as well as the left zzso zzso weight ratio zzso It also significantly alleviated the degree of zzso decreased zzso collagen volume fraction zzso together with markedly prevented the zzso of zzso I and zzso III zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas improved zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ameliorates zzso zzso induced by cardiac zzso with zzso left anterior descending coronary artery, the mechanism maybe involve in zzso the zzso zzso zzso
