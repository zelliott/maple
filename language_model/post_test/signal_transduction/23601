To investigate the potential roles of zzso zzso 4 zzso on the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells and its molecular zzso 

A zzso zzso expression zzso containing human zzso gene was constructed and zzso into the human gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso with zzso zzso were selected and zzso The effect of zzso zzso on gastric cancer cell growth was assessed using cell growth zzso The migration and invasion were assessed using a zzso migration zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso were detected using the zzso zzso zzso were implanted zzso into male zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were then calculated and zzso zzso zzso in the implanted tumor was performed using zzso zzso 

Growth zzso over a six-day time course showed significantly promoted cell proliferation of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells promoted the migration zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and invasion zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, significantly increased zzso level and increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso cells with zzso zzso However, increased zzso zzso level but decreased zzso zzso zzso level was zzso 

Our observations indicated a mechanism by which zzso of zzso zzso signaling promotes the expression and zzso of zzso zzso and influences the progress of gastric zzso
