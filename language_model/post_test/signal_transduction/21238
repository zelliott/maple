We have examined expression of the zzso zzso Delta zzso and the regulatory relationships between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso during zzso development in zzso Delta is expressed in all zzso zzso cells and zzso sensory organ precursors zzso and is expressed zzso in zzso zzso We find that Delta expression in zzso zzso cells is detected prior to the onset of zzso expression and arises normally in the absence of zzso function, indicating that initial Delta expression in the zzso is not dependent on zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso results in loss of Delta protein zzso suggesting that Delta expression is zzso in part, by zzso zzso zzso We find that Delta zzso is required for correct zzso of early zzso gene expression in developing zzso Within zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso prohibits adoption of the zzso fate by zzso expression of zzso zzso
