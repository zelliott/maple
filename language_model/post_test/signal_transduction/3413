zzso is a widespread environmental zzso which zzso severe toxic zzso including zzso and zzso likely by zzso zzso zzso Indeed, cadmium has been described to act as an zzso zzso and its toxicity is exerted both in zzso and in zzso through induction of zzso and/or necrosis by not fully clarified zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the present study was to further investigate the molecular mechanism by which cadmium might alter zzso of zzso target cells, such as zzso zzso inducing cell zzso and/or zzso Human zzso cells zzso zzso in culture were used as an in zzso model to characterize the zzso mechanisms induced by this heavy zzso zzso were incubated in the zzso absence of zzso zzso cadmium zzso at different times and DNA fragmentation and zzso of zzso 8 and zzso were induced upon zzso treatment triggering zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso partially blocked these zzso No zzso of zzso was zzso To determine the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in these events, we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which were activated by 10 zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the zzso and blunted zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not reduce the zzso zzso zzso suggesting an independent zzso of these zzso In conclusion, at least 2 pathways appear activated by cadmium in zzso a direct induction of zzso followed by zzso of zzso and an indirect induction by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso triggering zzso of zzso and zzso
