zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso in tumor cells has been implicated as an essential mechanism in defining stage, direction, and fate of tumor zzso This general concept is supported by results from three lines of zzso zzso Numerous zzso studies have shown a clear correlation between zzso zzso status of primary tumor and zzso potential of human cancer as reflected by zzso or 10-year survival rates of zzso zzso zzso expressed in tumor cells are either zzso molecules per zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Some are directly involved in cell zzso They are recognized by zzso or other zzso proteins or by complementary carbohydrates (through zzso zzso zzso or zzso of functionally important membrane components may alter tumor cell zzso or zzso in a direction that either promotes or zzso invasion and zzso Examples of such receptors are zzso zzso zzso family receptors zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling essential for tumor cell growth, invasion, and zzso The zzso molecules susceptible to zzso and zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso protein zzso C, and zzso zzso affecting protein zzso zzso Some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce tumor cell differentiation and subsequent zzso zzso zzso may block zzso of tumor cells, providing conditions favorable for zzso from zzso suppression of tumor growth by the zzso Various zzso that block zzso tumor cell zzso or block zzso processing have been shown to inhibit tumor cell zzso This provides the basis for further development of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that inhibit protein zzso C and zzso zzso zzso have been applied for zzso of zzso A crucial mechanism for zzso of zzso by these zzso may involve blocking of zzso signaling for expression of zzso and zzso This provides the basis for development of zzso zzso
