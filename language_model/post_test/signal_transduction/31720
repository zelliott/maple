zzso zzso including zzso and its zzso have been actively studied both zzso and zzso However, the single treatment of zzso zzso has been modest in most cancer zzso We have previously demonstrated that the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso also zzso and zzso zzso which is a tumor zzso in lung zzso Moreover, we show that zzso as an zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso of zzso and elevated zzso levels in zzso cell zzso Combination of zzso with zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso efficacy both in cell cultures and in a zzso mouse zzso In addition, zzso zzso the growth of both zzso sensitive and resistant zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso by a selective zzso zzso or zzso of zzso expression by zzso reverses the growth zzso effects of zzso on zzso resistant cells, suggesting the important role of zzso zzso in enhancing zzso zzso efficacy by zzso Thus, our results provide a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance zzso cancer therapy by using zzso or targeting zzso
