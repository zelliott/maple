zzso tolerance in plants is a complex trait that occurs in many plant species during growth at low, zzso temperatures, a process known as cold zzso This process is regulated by a zzso system expressing broad variation in the degree of freezing tolerance among wheat zzso zzso analysis is a powerful and rapid approach to gene zzso In species such as zzso for which large scale zzso screening and transgenic studies are not currently practical, zzso comparison by this methodology represents an essential approach to identifying key genes in the acquisition of freezing zzso A zzso was constructed with zzso amplified zzso zzso from zzso wheat expressed sequence tags zzso that represent zzso zzso Gene expression during cold zzso was compared in 2 zzso with marked differences in freezing zzso zzso levels of more than 300 genes were altered by zzso Among these, 65 genes were regulated differently between the 2 zzso for at least 1 time zzso These include genes that zzso potential regulatory proteins and proteins that act in plant zzso including protein zzso putative zzso factors, zzso binding zzso a zzso localized zzso an zzso zzso a cell wall associated zzso and proteins involved in zzso
