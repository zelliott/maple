Adult stem cells maintain organ systems throughout the course of life and facilitate repair after injury or zzso A fundamental property of stem and zzso cell division is the capacity to retain a zzso state or generate differentiated daughter zzso however, little is currently known about signals that regulate the balance between these zzso Here, we characterize a zzso cellular compartment in the adult zzso zzso Using genetic mosaic analysis we demonstrate that differentiated cells in the zzso arise from a common zzso Furthermore, we show that reduction of zzso zzso leads to an increase in the number of zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso of the zzso zzso leads to a decrease in zzso Thus, the zzso zzso default state is zzso which is inhibited through the zzso zzso zzso The ability to zzso manipulate and genetically trace cell lineages in the zzso should lead to the discovery of additional genes that regulate stem and zzso cell biology in the gastrointestinal zzso
