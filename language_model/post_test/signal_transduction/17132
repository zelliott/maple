Heat shock protein 90 zzso serves as an zzso molecular zzso for numerous cell signaling zzso including many zzso and clinically validated cancer targets that are involved in cell proliferation and zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso tumor cell growth and zzso in zzso and solid zzso However, little is known about the effects of zzso on zzso that are resistant to chemotherapy, which is emerging as a major clinical zzso In this study, the effects of zzso on the zzso human chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso cell line were zzso We observed that zzso exhibited zzso and zzso zzso activities against zzso zzso These effects included the induction of zzso and secondary necrosis in addition to cell cycle arrest at the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was predominantly zzso by the zzso pathway, initiated by the release of zzso c and the participation of zzso family zzso zzso also induced the zzso of the zzso zzso and -9 cascade and the subsequent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways may be involved in zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and several zzso related to drug resistance and zzso were also shown to be zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these results provide a possible molecular mechanism for the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells and provide new insights into the future application of zzso as a therapeutic agent for zzso zzso
