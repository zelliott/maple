Evidence is presented for zzso zzso having a role as a secondary zzso connecting the cell surface zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso II involved in zzso of zzso of zzso Studies were conducted using zzso whose primary zzso is in the structural gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso These zzso show zzso prolonged zzso of zzso zzso in response to stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso Investigation of signal zzso in these zzso indicated that, while events associated with production and relay of zzso zzso signals were normal, certain events associated with movement were (like the zzso zzso zzso zzso prolonged and these included zzso II association with the zzso and zzso of zzso heavy and light chain zzso These events can be correlated with the zzso becoming zzso and zzso decreasing their zzso speed after zzso zzso Other zzso studied in which the zzso of zzso zzso was reduced or absent produced zzso reduced or absent zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II on the zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso heavy zzso As a consequence, zzso of the zzso tail and its zzso from the zzso are zzso
