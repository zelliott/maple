In flooded soils, the rapid effects of decreasing oxygen availability on root zzso activity are likely to generate many potential chemical signals that may impact on zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso tests showed that filtered zzso zzso collected at realistic flow rates from plants flooded for 2 h and 4 zzso contained one or more factors that reduced zzso zzso The closure could not be attributed to increased root output of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso since zzso and deliveries of zzso zzso were unaffected by soil zzso Although zzso sap collected from the shoot base of zzso flooded plants became more alkaline within 2 h of zzso this rapid pH change of zzso units did not alter zzso of zzso zzso sufficiently to prompt a transient increase in zzso zzso zzso More zzso zzso was detected in the zzso when excised zzso sections were zzso with pH 7 zzso compared with pH 6 zzso zzso collected from the fifth oldest leaf of zzso zzso plants and plants flooded for 3 h was more zzso by approximately zzso pH units, than sap collected from the shoot zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso in sap collected from the fifth oldest zzso compared with the shoot base of flooded zzso However, water loss from zzso detached leaves was not reduced when the pH of the feeding solution containing zzso zzso was increased from zzso to zzso Thus, the extent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not sufficient to raise zzso zzso to zzso active zzso Using a detached zzso zzso significant zzso zzso activity was also detected in zzso sap collected at intervals during the first 24 h of soil zzso
