zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso that are downstream zzso of zzso and zzso small zzso and are implicated in zzso zzso Early expression of zzso in zzso zzso is tissue zzso suggesting a role in zzso and in zzso neural crest zzso cell zzso By observing zzso in zzso and after zzso we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso also specifically modified the expression of several NC zzso Twist expression was decreased and zzso expression zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso migration could be rescued with zzso but not with zzso which, in fact, cooperated with zzso in zzso zzso The data confirm that neither zzso nor zzso expression alone is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, they show that, in this zzso zzso and zzso expression is not zzso nor are these factors subject to obligatory zzso and that their expression depends on signal zzso Our results also represent the first evidence that zzso links zzso signals to the genetic cascade of zzso factors necessary for zzso zzso
