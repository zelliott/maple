In this paper, we present a zzso model for the zzso loop zzso a motif found in integrated cellular networks of zzso regulation and zzso zzso Previous zzso analysis indicates that this motif can serve as a zzso switch or a zzso We investigate how zzso and intrinsic noise affects its dynamic behaviors zzso We find that this motif can exploit noise to enrich its zzso zzso When the zzso is in the zzso region, under fluctuation of zzso noise, the zzso system can switch from one steady state to the other and meanwhile one zzso production is amplified for more than three orders of zzso Further, from an engineering perspective, this zzso switch and amplifier for gene expression is very easy to zzso Without zzso noise, spontaneous transition between states occurs as the consequence of intrinsic zzso Such a switch is controlled by the parameters and system zzso On the other hand, intrinsic noise can induce sustained zzso zzso when the corresponding deterministic system does not zzso Such zzso zzso shows the best performance at an optimal noise level, indicating the occurrence of intrinsic noise zzso resonance which can contribute to the zzso of this zzso When considering the effects of zzso noise near zzso points, a similar phenomenon of zzso noise zzso resonance is zzso
