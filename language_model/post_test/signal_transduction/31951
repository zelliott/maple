We recently reported the discovery of the novel zzso zzso 1 as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso evaluation of 1 at high dosage zzso zzso revealed the zzso value zzso zzso likely due to poor zzso of this zzso Efforts to improve zzso by reducing the aromatic ring count of the core system led to zzso zzso zzso Further zzso of the zzso group led to compound zzso with acceptable zzso and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso factor zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso tissue and inhibited tumor growth zzso ratio, zzso in a mouse zzso zzso model zzso to the improved zzso profile based on increased zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid zzso
