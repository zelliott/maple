zzso is an zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso and zzso activity that primarily targets vascular zzso growth factor receptors zzso Although zzso is an active agent for the treatment of zzso zzso it is unclear whether zzso acts through only zzso mechanisms or also directly targets tumor zzso We previously showed that zzso directly induced zzso of zzso zzso To further confirm these direct effects, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso cells and the underlying zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity in a zzso manner, and decreased zzso protein zzso zzso with this finding, zzso decreased zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated these effects, including zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso suggesting that they were zzso by zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso C zzso zzso and subsequent protein zzso C zzso zzso Because zzso zzso significantly affects zzso activity and is known to be regulated by zzso zzso may inhibit zzso zzso via the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso markedly decreased the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso may reduce zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso However, because zzso cells do not precisely reflect the zzso of zzso cells, we confirmed the key findings in a human zzso cell line, zzso In conclusion, zzso directly zzso zzso synthesis and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
