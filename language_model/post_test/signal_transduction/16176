zzso 1, zzso zzso B and zzso A are natural products that zzso and in some cases zzso inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cell zzso The cellular targets of these small molecules have yet to be zzso We have discovered that these molecules target zzso binding protein zzso and its closest zzso zzso protein zzso zzso not known to be involved in cancer cell zzso zzso and the zzso constitute an zzso zzso protein zzso members of which have been implicated in signal zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso The functions of zzso and the zzso however, remain largely zzso Based on our findings, we have named the aforementioned natural products zzso Here we used zzso to reveal new cellular activities of zzso The zzso are powerful zzso of zzso and zzso that will be useful in uncovering their cellular functions and their roles in human zzso
