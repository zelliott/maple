During early pregnancy, zzso differentiation occurs in an environment of relative low oxygen tension which is essential for normal embryonic and zzso zzso At around zzso zzso zzso when the zzso space opens to maternal blood, there is an increase in zzso This increase zzso with the time of zzso zzso invasion into the maternal zzso which allows zzso zzso cells to access and zzso the maternal spiral zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso is a zzso factor which activates gene zzso in response to varying oxygen concentration of zzso zzso is a zzso composed of the zzso zzso and the zzso expressed zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have demonstrated that the zzso events of early zzso differentiation are in part zzso by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso via zzso zzso is a disease of pregnancy that is characterized by shallow zzso zzso Recently, we have reported that zzso is zzso in zzso pregnancy and that its zzso restores invasive capability to zzso zzso Because zzso is downstream of zzso in the present study we investigated the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso controls using in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and protein expression are zzso elevated in zzso zzso tissue when compared to normal zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may result from a zzso failure of oxygen to increase or of zzso cells to respond and/or sense an increase in zzso This will prevent the normal zzso zzso and will lead to poor zzso invasion zzso the pregnancy to zzso
