An zzso set of zzso zzso class II and I molecules is known to select the T cell repertoire in the zzso and to present processed zzso peptides zzso to mature peripheral zzso T helper zzso and zzso T zzso zzso cells in the zzso This review highlights new studies which address how zzso presenting cells zzso integrate the responses of zzso zzso and T zzso zzso cells to determine the outcome of immune zzso Together with other findings, these studies emphasize that understanding the mechanism of immune processes requires consideration of zzso molecules in the context of the peptides they zzso the zzso presenting cells zzso that express them and the T zzso that recognize zzso The activities of zzso and zzso surface structures are becoming integrated into a zzso understanding of the cellular interactions between regulatory and zzso T cells with zzso
