zzso of zzso responsiveness following T cell zzso represents an important mechanism that shapes the fate of T cells after encounters with zzso We activated T cells in mice with zzso and assessed their ability to zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso After 4 h of zzso in zzso T cells became deficient in their ability to zzso zzso in response to either zzso The loss of zzso sensitivity was accompanied by increased zzso zzso for multiple zzso of zzso signaling zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso The transcript levels of these zzso were elevated only during the early hours after zzso and were at or below normal levels by 60 zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso of zzso signaling was zzso and sensitivity was restored by 3 days zzso The loss of sensitivity to zzso persisted, however, and was still evident at 3 zzso These data suggest that zzso mechanisms specific for zzso of zzso signaling may be present at later stages of the T cell zzso The loss of zzso signaling may be a factor in differentiation of T cells during and after zzso and it could also represent a protective mechanism against the toxic effects of zzso during immune zzso
