In zzso rat zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso activates a program of genetic and zzso changes characterized by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso gene and enlargement zzso of the zzso The low molecular weight zzso Ras has been established as an important regulator of zzso both in zzso and in zzso Ras activates a zzso cascade involving zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso However, the extent of involvement of this zzso in regulating zzso responses is zzso We demonstrate here that both zzso stimulation and Ras can also activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso effect on zzso occurs through a zzso requiring Ras and zzso zzso zzso A zzso activated zzso of zzso that zzso activates zzso stimulates zzso reporter gene zzso while a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso activity is increased in the zzso of mice zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso activity is zzso These results suggest that the zzso mediates zzso gene expression through a zzso zzso and that zzso of this zzso is associated with in zzso and in zzso zzso
