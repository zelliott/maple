zzso growth factors zzso are key regulators of development, growth, and zzso In most zzso species including humans, there is one IGF-1 gene and one zzso zzso Here we report the identification and functional characterization of 4 distinct zzso genes zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso These genes zzso 4 structurally distinct and functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in multiple zzso in adult zzso zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso and zzso zzso only in the zzso zzso analysis showed that all 4 zzso caused similar zzso defects but with different zzso Many of these zzso had fully or partially duplicated zzso suggesting that an excess of zzso signaling causes defects in the zzso formation and an expansion of the zzso zzso the most potent zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso expression caused defects in the zzso formation and expansion of the zzso but it did not alter the anterior neural zzso These results not only provide new insights into the functional conservation and divergence of the multiple zzso genes but also reveal a novel role of zzso signaling in zzso formation and zzso development in a zzso zzso
