The responses of zzso plants to rising atmospheric zzso levels are considered to be largely dependent on effects exerted through altered zzso In contrast, the nature of the responses of zzso plants to high zzso remains controversial because of the absence of zzso zzso effects on zzso In this study, the effects of atmospheric zzso availability on the zzso zzso and zzso profiles of two ranks of source leaves in zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in plants grown under ambient zzso conditions zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso ) or with zzso enrichment zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth at high zzso had no effect on photosynthesis, zzso leaf zzso ratios or zzso zzso However, leaf zzso rates, zzso metabolism and protein zzso zzso were altered at high zzso in a zzso specific zzso Although no significant zzso zzso changes in the leaf zzso were observed, zzso analysis revealed that the abundance of transcripts zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor and a zzso were changed by the growth zzso level in a leaf rank specific zzso Moreover, zzso zzso changes in the leaf zzso were most evident in the oldest source zzso Small changes in water status may be responsible for the observed responses to high zzso particularly in the older leaf zzso
