In zzso and zzso giant nerve zzso zzso appears to be an zzso signaling zzso We have investigated zzso transport and metabolism by zzso central nerve fibers in order to identify possible mechanisms by which zzso could zzso this zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso nerve zzso was temperature and zzso dependent, linear with time for at least zzso and zzso at about zzso zzso Most accumulated zzso was associated with the zzso zzso sheath and remained as zzso zzso known to block zzso transport in zzso peripheral nerves or zzso brain slices or cell cultures were also effective on zzso central nerve zzso zzso zzso levels were only zzso of control levels when zzso zzso was present, and zzso zzso zzso 38% and zzso of control levels, respectively, when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were without zzso effect on tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso was an equivalent zzso substitute for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had comparable effects on isolated zzso giant nerve zzso studies indicate that zzso is taken up primarily by the zzso zzso of zzso central nerve fibers by a zzso zzso zzso transport system and is retained by the fibers primarily in that zzso Our results suggest that the zzso are not only the target of the zzso signal released from zzso regions of the zzso zzso giant zzso during zzso zzso but that they are also the primary site of its zzso
