The zzso of zzso is well established and zzso studies identify an increased zzso of zzso tumors zzso cell and zzso cell zzso associated with zzso zzso Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of zzso skin zzso but zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and subsequent regulation of downstream target genes may contribute to tumor promotion and zzso In this study, we investigated zzso of the zzso signal regulated zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells, a spontaneously immortalized human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso stimulate rapid zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, upon extended exposure (24 zzso persistent stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected at low zzso zzso of zzso Although zzso and zzso were activated with similar time and concentration zzso the mechanism of zzso differed for these two zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was fully dependent on the zzso activity of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and partially dependent on zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso resulted in increased production of zzso zzso zzso an zzso regulated gene zzso zzso induction by zzso was prevented when zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling was zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso is a component of zzso signal zzso and gene expression in zzso and that low zzso zzso of zzso stimulate key signaling pathways upon extended zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and subsequent regulation of genes including zzso zzso and the zzso degrading zzso may play an important role in zzso skin zzso
