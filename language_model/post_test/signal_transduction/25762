Many zzso disorders (including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative zzso are linked to zzso dysfunction, which leads to impaired cellular zzso and increased zzso zzso However, it is not known what genetic and molecular pathways zzso differential vulnerability to zzso dysfunction observed among different cell zzso 

Starting with an zzso cell line as a model for a zzso cell type, we isolated a novel zzso line (named zzso that was more susceptible to cell death induced by zzso respiratory chain zzso than the parental zzso line zzso zzso for zzso Compared to parental zzso cells, zzso cells were also more vulnerable to direct zzso stress, but equally vulnerable to zzso zzso and less vulnerable to protein zzso zzso zzso Thus, differential vulnerability to zzso toxins between these two cell types likely reflects differences in their ability to handle metabolically generated zzso oxygen species rather than differences in zzso zzso or in downstream zzso zzso zzso gene expression analysis and follow-up zzso studies revealed that, in this experimental system, increased vulnerability to zzso and zzso stress was associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso and phase zzso zzso zzso most of which are zzso zzso zzso zzso increased expression of molecular zzso many of which are also considered zzso zzso zzso zzso increased expression of zzso zzso genes and zzso factors that zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso 

The molecular profile presented here will enable identification of individual genes or gene clusters that shape vulnerability to zzso dysfunction and thus represent potential therapeutic targets for diabetes and neurodegenerative zzso In addition, the newly identified zzso cell line represents a new experimental model for investigating how zzso antioxidants affect zzso sensing and insulin release by pancreatic zzso zzso
