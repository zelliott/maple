zzso in the zzso gene result in zzso syndrome zzso in humans, a zzso disorder that includes a wide range of zzso zzso and neurological zzso In addition to the ability of zzso to forward signal through its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can also act as a zzso and zzso a reverse signal by either zzso or zzso zzso To investigate how zzso acts to influence development and zzso disease, we generated mice harboring a series of targeted point zzso in the zzso gene that independently zzso specific reverse signaling zzso while maintaining forward signaling zzso We demonstrate that both zzso and zzso reverse signaling by zzso are zzso for zzso and skeletal development, whereas zzso reverse signaling by zzso is critical for the formation of a major zzso zzso zzso the corpus zzso zzso is strongly expressed within zzso of the corpus zzso and reverse signaling acts autonomously in cortical zzso to mediate an avoidance response to its signaling partner zzso These results demonstrate the importance of zzso reverse signaling for a subset of zzso zzso roles in zzso
