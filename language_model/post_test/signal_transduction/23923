Human subjects consuming fish oil showed a significant suppression of zzso zzso expression in blood zzso when zzso in zzso with zzso zzso an zzso for zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso promoter reporter gene also demonstrated that zzso zzso expression was zzso inhibited by zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso the major zzso zzso fatty acids zzso present in fish zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso significantly suppressed zzso expression induced by a synthetic zzso a zzso zzso These results correlated with the preferential suppression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso B zzso by zzso and zzso The target of zzso by zzso is zzso itself or its associated zzso but not downstream signaling zzso In contrast, zzso expression by zzso or zzso zzso was zzso by zzso acid, a saturated fatty zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso is zzso through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso Thus, the beneficial or zzso effects of different types of dietary fatty acids on the risk of the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases may be in part zzso through the zzso of zzso
