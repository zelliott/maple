One of the zzso aspects of zzso zzso zzso in cells is the zzso between such zzso in the external and internal zzso and its potential to zzso zzso signal zzso Here, we employed zzso recovery after zzso to study the effects of zzso zzso of influenza zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso on the lateral diffusion of zzso raft and zzso Ras zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso proteins (but not their zzso zzso zzso the lateral diffusion of zzso (but not zzso suggesting stabilized interactions of zzso with the clusters of zzso zzso zzso These zzso were paralleled by specific effects on the activity of zzso but not of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso proteins facilitated the early step zzso zzso is converted to an zzso zzso state but inhibited the ensuing step of downstream signaling via the zzso zzso We propose a model for the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso of raft zzso where external zzso zzso or zzso zzso enhances the association of zzso proteins with the stabilized zzso promoting either enhancement or zzso of zzso
