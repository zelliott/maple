The zzso of cells is coordinated by a large array of different types of zzso protein zzso protein zzso and second zzso zzso Current experimental evidence suggests that these zzso zzso and other zzso form a vast complicated interconnected zzso network inside the zzso A generic model of this zzso network is presented which is specifically designed to examine the global properties that can be expected from a model based on the available knowledge of these molecular zzso Different protein types are represented as zzso in a network that interact via a connection zzso During zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate and zzso other protein types by altering the level of zzso of their regulatory zzso The occupancy of regulatory sites on protein zzso and zzso in turn determines their zzso zzso Carlo simulations are carried out on ensembles of zzso Steady states and periodic zzso are observed in these zzso We discuss the potential of this type of model for understanding cell zzso
