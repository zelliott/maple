zzso tube defects zzso represent a common group of severe zzso zzso that result from failure of neural tube closure during early zzso Their zzso is quite complex involving environmental and genetic factors and their underlying molecular and cellular zzso mechanisms remain poorly zzso Animal studies have recently demonstrated an essential role for the zzso cell polarity zzso zzso in zzso a zzso process called zzso extension during neural tube zzso zzso in members of this zzso lead to zzso in zzso models, representing novel and exciting candidates for human zzso zzso studies in zzso have focused mainly on zzso genes based on the finding that zzso zzso acid supplementation reduces the risk of zzso by zzso A few zzso in these genes have been found to be significantly associated with an increased risk for zzso The candidate gene approach investigating genes involved in zzso has failed to identify major zzso genes in the zzso of zzso Despite this history of generally negative findings, we are achieving a rapid and impressive progress in understanding the genetic basis of zzso based mainly on the powerful tool of animal zzso
