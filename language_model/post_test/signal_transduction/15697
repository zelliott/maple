zzso responses zzso therapeutic approaches to many cardiovascular diseases, and zzso zzso zzso are in widespread clinical zzso The role of zzso in zzso biology has been extensively zzso yet zzso signaling pathways in zzso cells remain incompletely zzso We found that zzso promoted zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso in cultured zzso zzso Although zzso activity was zzso by both zzso and zzso only zzso signaling was significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso or by zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso zzso zzso activated the small zzso zzso and promoted zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We analyzed pathways known to regulate zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso None of these zzso altered zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity but did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor compound C had no effect on zzso zzso activity, despite completely blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity, yet zzso of zzso zzso activity using zzso failed to affect zzso zzso by zzso These data suggest that the zzso but not the zzso activity, of zzso and zzso is necessary for zzso signaling to zzso
