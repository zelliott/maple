zzso zzso activated zzso zzso a regulator of cellular zzso has been shown to relax zzso smooth muscle via zzso and independent zzso We have examined the role of zzso in different smooth muscles using the zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations of mouse zzso zzso artery, zzso and urinary zzso were zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso relaxation in zzso rings zzso with zzso and activated with zzso Less prominent relaxation was noted in the other zzso This difference in sensitivity to zzso was not due to differences in the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso had a greater effect on zzso induced by zzso compared to zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso in response to the protein zzso C zzso zzso were prominently inhibited by zzso The zzso relaxation observed in the zzso was not prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso relaxations in zzso preparations induced by zzso or sodium zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso In conclusion, zzso induced relaxation of smooth muscle is zzso and most prominent in large elastic zzso The smooth muscle relaxation is zzso and occurs downstream of zzso zzso and is associated with attenuated zzso responses to zzso
