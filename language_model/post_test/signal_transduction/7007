A key feature of the zzso is structural zzso the ability of zzso to alter their zzso and connectivity in response to sensory experience and other changes in the zzso How this structural plasticity is achieved at the molecular level is not well zzso We provide evidence that changes in sensory experience simultaneously trigger multiple signaling pathways that either promote or restrict growth of the zzso zzso structural plasticity is achieved through a balance of these opposing zzso Specifically, we have uncovered a novel, zzso signaling zzso that restricts zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso is regulated at the zzso level by calcium influx through zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cultured rat cortical zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso visual zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that changes in zzso activity initiate competing signaling pathways that positively and zzso regulate the growth of the zzso zzso It is the balance of these opposing signals that leads to proper zzso zzso
