What determines the degree of zzso or sensitivity to zzso radiation is not yet zzso As a zzso to the ability of zzso to induce zzso some questions arise as to whether zzso cells escape zzso because of their inability to mount a zzso response to zzso of zzso To shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of tumor cell response to radiation, we tested whether exposure to zzso radiation (of zzso zzso is associated with changes in zzso levels in zzso tumor zzso cells and whether the ability of zzso to induce zzso is inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate an immediate decrease in cellular levels of zzso in response to radiation, while zzso levels zzso Under the same conditions the cellular zzso zzso levels decrease as well, being accompanied by the zzso of zzso alpha from the membrane to the zzso zzso of membrane zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on cell survival after zzso while treatment with zzso during and after zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso sensitize cells to radiation by zzso zzso zzso It is thus plausible that in human zzso zzso cells, radiation activates predominantly the zzso to induce resistance, while both zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways are zzso and demonstrate no significant role in the zzso of the sensitivity or the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso
