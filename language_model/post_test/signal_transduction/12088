zzso and zzso are zzso involved in regulating the numbers and function of zzso lineage populations and have been shown to contribute to zzso zzso Type I zzso is an important zzso produced by zzso and can have profound regulatory effects on their zzso In this study, we compared bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice to assess the contribution of zzso type I zzso to the zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso were capable of higher zzso zzso production, which contributed significantly to their zzso zzso zzso analysis found that of the zzso type I zzso genes specific to either zzso or zzso zzso of these gene zzso were unique to zzso while only 50 were unique to zzso Moreover, zzso displayed enhanced zzso zzso levels, relative to zzso of a number of genes identified as being dependent on type I zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso As a result of prior type I zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation zzso displayed increased zzso of the zzso zzso pathways compared with zzso which correlated with the distinct zzso profiles of the two zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso type I zzso signaling loop regulated the production of the zzso and zzso signature zzso zzso and zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso type I zzso play significant roles in regulating the differences in zzso and function between zzso and zzso
