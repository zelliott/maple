There is a growing body of evidence that links cancer with genes and pathways that are required for normal embryonic development, increasing the possibility that cancer cells with stem cell properties, particularly zzso and zzso are primarily involved in tumor formation and zzso One novel zzso that is important in regulating the zzso zzso survival and growth in a variety of adult and embryonic zzso is the zzso signaling zzso zzso are a large family of zzso zzso and zzso proteins with a broad spectrum of zzso zzso signaling is zzso by zzso which, in the case of most class 3 zzso require high affinity zzso zzso The zzso also function as receptors for zzso and other growth factors, and their expression is abnormal in zzso Various zzso can either promote or inhibit tumor progression through the promotion or zzso of processes such as tumor zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso In normal zzso zzso signaling is mainly active in precursor zzso This increases the possibility of tumors being derived from such cells, possibly even stem cells, which are unable to differentiate and/or to stop zzso In this review, we zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso signal zzso involved in the stem cell zzso and describe the evidence that links zzso to the control of tumor zzso
