A zzso of the gene zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with one zzso zinc finger zzso The zzso zzso which exists in most plant zzso zinc finger proteins zzso does not exist in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was significantly zzso by zzso zzso both in leaves and zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso resulted in a reduced sensitivity to zzso during seed zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of some stress and zzso marker zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased, in the zzso zzso lines, when plants were treated with zzso zzso We further studied the effects of zzso zzso on the regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulators, such as zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso lines, while positive zzso signaling regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in comparison to wild type zzso zzso zzso lines also exhibited small zzso impairment of zzso zzso zzso The data zzso zzso suggests that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso may be a promising gene for negative regulating zzso zzso Our findings broaden our understanding of this zzso zzso zzso function, and add to the body of evidence that has been developed in earlier zzso
