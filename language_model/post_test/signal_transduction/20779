zzso zzso cells zzso are not merely a selective zzso barrier between blood and underlying tissue but actively play an important role in maintaining zzso of zzso zzso that have a variety of zzso zzso zzso and zzso capabilities regulate vascular zzso and interact with other cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells and white zzso Recent evidence suggests that these functions are affected by zzso stress on the zzso wall, which is a zzso force zzso the zzso surface of the blood vessel when a viscous fluid such as blood flows over zzso Wall zzso stress reportedly regulates zzso vessel growth and zzso and might be a local risk factor in the zzso of zzso zzso stress also zzso the production of zzso substances such as zzso relaxing factor, zzso zzso and zzso and regulates zzso zzso and zzso More recent studies have shown that zzso stress exerts an influence on the expression of zzso such as tissue zzso zzso zzso These facts suggest that zzso serve as zzso by which changes in blood flow or zzso stress are recognized by the zzso and the signal is transmitted to zzso zzso It has been indicated so far that zzso zzso and the membrane potential might be involved in the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to zzso stress, will help us to understand the mechanism not only of blood zzso vessel growth and zzso but also zzso
