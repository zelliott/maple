A complex of reactions regulating the number of cells in zzso and zzso under normal and zzso conditions is one of the most important systems of zzso zzso In this system, which controls both cell proliferation and zzso clearance has been given special attention during the last three zzso Some stages of the clearance are known (the choice of zzso cells, their destruction not affecting the surrounding zzso and, finally, removal of the zzso and undeniable progress has been achieved in the understanding of the second stage mechanisms, whereas mechanisms of elimination per zzso of cells or their fragments still continue to be terra zzso The clearance of such cells is mainly determined by different components of natural and zzso zzso zzso complement, zzso zzso cells, zzso Recently specific zzso zzso such as zzso DNA, heat shock zzso and other potential zzso released by cells during their elimination have been zzso Entering the zzso space, these signals induce inflammation and injury of the surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso Heat shock zzso in addition to zzso activity, act as zzso zzso and zzso molecules in the interactions of dying cells and the immune zzso
