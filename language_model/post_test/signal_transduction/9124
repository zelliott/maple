zzso data suggest that zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso could increase the risk of zzso tumor development, but unequivocal evidence is still zzso To explore the role of zzso zzso in zzso in breast tumor development and zzso we took advantage of a zzso mouse model harboring a zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Although in adult zzso zzso a single zzso zzso did not contribute to zzso zzso zzso the presence of two zzso zzso led to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso further markedly zzso the risk of zzso zzso in a mouse model with high zzso to zzso tumors zzso zzso as demonstrated by the occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso mice versus zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso increased the activity of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso to increase cell proliferation and the expression of the zzso target gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We next sought to understand the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso by zzso zzso studies with a breast cancer cell line zzso zzso showed that zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells through decreasing zzso zzso activity and target gene zzso whereas sustained zzso signaling was observed in zzso zzso zzso these findings show for the first time that a zzso zzso promotes the development of zzso zzso via zzso zzso of zzso thereby zzso a fertile genetic ground for zzso
