Although first described as early as 1898 and long considered a vestigial zzso of little functional importance, the primary zzso has become one of the hottest research topics in modern cell biology and zzso zzso zzso are zzso sensory zzso present in a single copy on the surface of most zzso or differentiated zzso cells, and defects in their assembly or function are tightly coupled to many zzso zzso diseases and zzso In normal zzso the primary zzso coordinates a series of signal zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso the primary zzso may function as a zzso zzso and zzso unit that zzso the zzso environment and zzso signals to the cell zzso zzso zzso which depend on zzso zzso for appropriate zzso Indeed, zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso called zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso transport zzso result in zzso of primary zzso and in the collecting ducts of kidney zzso this is accompanied by development of zzso zzso zzso kidney disease zzso While zzso was one of the first diseases to be linked to dysfunctional primary zzso defects in this zzso have subsequently been associated with many other zzso including cancer, zzso diabetes as well as a number of zzso zzso zzso these disorders of the zzso are now referred to as the zzso In this review, we provide a brief overview of the structure and function of primary zzso and some of their roles in zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso development, health and zzso
