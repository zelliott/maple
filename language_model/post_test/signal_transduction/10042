The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso nuclear protein controlled by zzso zzso zzso in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit zzso zzso Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain zzso zzso by triggering zzso zzso Active zzso zzso to the zzso motif zzso zzso zzso of zzso truncated zzso in zzso initiated zzso at the zzso domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for zzso at zzso The zzso and zzso sites were essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso signaling in zzso cells, whereas the zzso domain and zzso sites were zzso zzso zzso by serum increased the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso and the degradation of zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso whereas depletion of zzso zzso suppressed such zzso The zzso of zzso signaling zzso by serum correlated with the zzso zzso degradation rate in a zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso can be achieved via zzso and zzso cooperation, thereby sustaining zzso zzso
