The brain zzso constitutes a barrier to the passive movement of substances from the blood into the cerebral zzso and disruption of this barrier after a stroke or trauma has potentially fatal zzso zzso oxygen species zzso which are formed during these cerebrovascular zzso have a key role in this zzso zzso are formed zzso by zzso and also by the zzso of cell receptors that zzso signals from inflammatory zzso zzso activated zzso zzso forms zzso acid that interacts with zzso and zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso also contributes to zzso There is a surge in zzso following zzso after cerebral zzso and the interaction of the signaling pathways plays a role in zzso This review critically evaluates the literature and concludes that the zzso zzso is a consequence of the initial zzso resulting from the zzso surge after zzso
