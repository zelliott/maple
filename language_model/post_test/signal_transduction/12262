Phase II zzso are induced primarily through the common zzso response element zzso zzso Studies performed in different cell types and with different zzso appear to indicate variation in the upstream signaling pathways involved in the induction of these phase II zzso Nonetheless, whether variation in signaling among phase II genes in the same cell with the same zzso is zzso This study is designed to answer this question using human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso as a model and screening with a variety of protein zzso zzso with varying degrees of zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced the expression of phase II genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased the induction of all of these zzso confirming the involvement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no effect, while a zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso and zzso induction by zzso but not that by zzso Among the zzso zzso used, one eliminated gene induction by zzso and zzso while two others showed no zzso One zzso inhibitor decreased the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso on the other hand, the zzso effects of another zzso inhibitor on gene induction seems to be zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that although phase II genes are zzso induced through zzso signaling by zzso the upstream signaling pathways involved are zzso and zzso zzso It is also suggested that commercial zzso zzso may produce zzso effects on phase II gene expression via mechanisms unrelated to their zzso zzso
