zzso Y zzso exerts its functions through six zzso of receptors zzso zzso zzso is regulated by several factors through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, no information exists regarding the zzso role of zzso on zzso zzso during zzso The aims of this study were to zzso 1) the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and 2) the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso or zzso duct zzso zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle for 7 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed in liver sections and isolated zzso zzso zzso was assessed in serum and zzso from normal and zzso rats, as well as zzso from normal and zzso zzso and normal rat zzso cell line zzso normal zzso culture zzso We evaluated zzso zzso zzso mass zzso in liver sections and proliferation in zzso With the use of zzso the effects of zzso or zzso zzso on zzso proliferation were zzso The expression of zzso and all zzso were increased after zzso zzso levels were lower in serum and zzso zzso from zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso from zzso was detected at both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso cellular nuclear zzso zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso to zzso rats increased zzso proliferation and zzso zzso treatment of zzso decreased zzso expression and increased the cell cycle arrest, whereas treatment with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso targeting zzso signaling may prove beneficial for the treatment of zzso
