zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso in the zzso integration zzso zzso pathway, have been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso However, it remains to be established whether zzso is also involved in zzso brain zzso We used zzso mice to examine the role of this zzso in the mechanisms of focal cerebral zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso was induced by transient zzso of the middle cerebral zzso Motor deficits and zzso volume were assessed 3 days zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by Western zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso membrane potential changes induced by zzso were also zzso 

zzso mice have larger stroke and more severe motor deficits, effects that were independent of zzso cerebral blood flow, vascular factors, or zzso zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso and decreased the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso involved in zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory gene expression was enhanced in zzso zzso Furthermore, the association of zzso with activated zzso was increased in zzso mice, resulting in a reduction in the zzso handling ability of zzso The zzso dysfunction was reversed by pharmacological zzso of zzso 

zzso activates an zzso zzso zzso that acts independently of zzso by controlling zzso activity and preventing its deleterious zzso and zzso zzso The findings raise the possibility that emerging treatment strategies for diseases attributable to zzso zzso zzso could also lead to new therapeutic avenues for zzso zzso
