zzso channel zzso is involved in normal zzso processes and pathology of various zzso Although it is recognized that blockade of zzso zzso the cell zzso it is not well understood the potential function of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of the zzso inhibitor on cell zzso cell cycle progression in human zzso cancer cell line zzso as well as the effect on the zzso levels of zzso and zzso In this study crystal violet method was used to study the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso on zzso cell zzso The zzso of the inhibitor on the cell cycle distribution was investigated by the flow zzso zzso Western zzso was performed to measure the zzso levels of zzso and zzso Our data indicated zzso played an important role in zzso cell proliferation and cell zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation when compared with the zzso zzso of zzso arrested cell cycle progression and suppressed the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells by zzso of cell proliferation by zzso inhibitor zzso could be through arresting cell cycle zzso which is probably by suppressing zzso of zzso and zzso
