This review provides an updated account of the regulation of the zzso stress protein zzso Where zzso observations made with zzso are also zzso However, a discussion of the plant stress protein response is intentionally omitted (for a review, see zzso The stress protein response, as discussed zzso is understood to relate to the response by virtually all cells to heat and other zzso that results in the induced expression of so-called heat shock or stress zzso The protein products of these genes zzso largely to the zzso nucleus, or zzso An analogous response controls the expression of related zzso whose products reside in the zzso zzso The response, termed zzso stress response or unfolded protein response, is zzso by a separate regulation system that is not discussed in this zzso Note, however, that recent work suggests the existence of zzso between the regulatory systems controlling the stress protein and zzso stress responses zzso
