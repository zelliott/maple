zzso acid zzso is a naturally occurring zzso acid in human zzso Data obtained from in zzso and in zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso mostly presents zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso also zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso at protein and zzso levels in zzso zzso cells and as a result it inhibited zzso zzso zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso In the further experiments, zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were suppressed significantly by zzso In addition, zzso did not affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso suppresses zzso zzso expression via attenuating the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling pathways suggesting that zzso the zzso compound in our food, could exert zzso effects through zzso zzso zzso
