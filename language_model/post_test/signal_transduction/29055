The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a transient embryonic structure essential for the zzso patterning and outgrowth of the zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso function in limb skeletal patterning has remained zzso In this study, we genetically zzso the zzso by zzso removing zzso function and found that zzso limb development failed in zzso zzso We showed that zzso promotes survival of zzso cells and interacts with zzso signaling during zzso zzso Interestingly, cell proliferation and survival were not significantly reduced in the zzso zzso of zzso limb zzso We established zzso expression as an early marker of zzso limb zzso and discovered a dynamic zzso process of zzso limb zzso We found that premature zzso loss in zzso limb buds delayed generation of zzso zzso which in turn failed to reach a threshold number required to form a normal zzso Taken together, we have uncovered a novel zzso zzso the zzso regulates the number of zzso zzso by determining the onset of their zzso
