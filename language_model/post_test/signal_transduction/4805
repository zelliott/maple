The objective of this study was to compare expression of genes associated with zzso deposition and removal between bulls and zzso in the zzso zzso muscle zzso tissue of Korean zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and fatty acid transport protein 1 in zzso zzso increased zzso gene expression of both zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso gene expression of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Steers showed higher expression levels of insulin signaling zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso 1 than bulls but lower protein levels of nuclear zzso box O 1 zzso than bulls, suggesting that increased insulin signaling following zzso decreases nuclear zzso levels, leading to zzso of zzso gene zzso These findings suggest that zzso contributes to increases in zzso zzso and zzso and a decrease in zzso resulting in improved zzso
