Cellular zzso is a major defense against zzso In human zzso suppressing both the zzso and zzso pathways is necessary to bypass zzso zzso as well as zzso induced by zzso expression of a dominant negative form of the zzso repeat binding factor 2, zzso We recently reported that exposure to zzso zzso to the zzso 3' zzso zzso activates both the zzso and zzso pathways and leads to zzso in primary human zzso To further characterize zzso zzso we compared established zzso zzso cell lines lacking functional zzso and/or zzso pathways to the normal parental zzso Here, we report that, as in zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso pathways is necessary to suppress zzso zzso Moreover, zzso rapidly zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line, demonstrating the potential of using zzso as a novel zzso zzso Our data support the hypothesis that exposure of the zzso tandem repeat zzso 3' zzso sequence is the event that zzso signaling through DNA damage response pathways after experimental zzso zzso serial passage, or acute zzso damage of normal zzso
