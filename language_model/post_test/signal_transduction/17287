zzso cocaine administration zzso behavioral zzso in about zzso of treated zzso zzso oxide could be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of behavioral cocaine effects, probably by zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, since zzso of the zzso zzso zzso development of zzso in zzso On the other hand, increased zzso availability by zzso 5 zzso has been correlated to the misuse and recreational use of these agents and also to the zzso use with illicit drugs in zzso zzso is an important brain region for conditioning to general context previously associated to drug zzso influencing zzso behavior and zzso Moreover, cocaine and other drugs of abuse can affect the strength of zzso zzso in this structure, zzso zzso zzso activity in main regions of the reward zzso 

The objective of this study is to determine whether the pharmacological manipulation of zzso signaling zzso altered changes induced by repeated cocaine zzso 

The present investigation showed a relationship between behavioral cocaine zzso reduced threshold to generate long-term zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso activity in this zzso However, when zzso or zzso were zzso the number of zzso animals was reduced, and the threshold to generate zzso was zzso The opposite occurred when zzso availability was zzso 

We demonstrate a key role of the zzso activity and zzso signaling zzso in the development of cocaine zzso and in the associated enhancement of zzso synaptic zzso
