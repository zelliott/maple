Most models regarding the zzso origin of zzso T cell zzso and memory subset diversification suggest that during the first contact of a zzso T cell with the zzso zzso cell major decisions for subsequent differentiation are zzso Data using novel zzso T cell tracking technologies demonstrate that a single zzso zzso T cell can give rise to virtually all different zzso of zzso and memory T cells, and direct major zzso of subset diversification to the time period beyond the first cell zzso zzso some zzso zzso characteristics typical for zzso T cells are probably still maintained within distinct zzso of memory T zzso These observations have direct consequences for clinical applications like adoptive T cell zzso
