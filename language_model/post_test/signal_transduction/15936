zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso signal zzso There are 49 zzso zzso in zzso and zzso of some of these are known to play important roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Here, using mass zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as novel sites of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to F zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso including that of zzso whereas the zzso zzso displayed only modest reduction in zzso Relative to zzso the ability of zzso to bind to and zzso zzso was zzso resulting in reduced zzso downstream gene zzso While the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso it impaired zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Interestingly however, the zzso zzso exhibited normal zzso binding zzso Finally, zzso of zzso only partially restored the zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that the mechanism zzso zzso of zzso is important for zzso zzso is via zzso As such, our results indicate that zzso plays a critical yet differential role in zzso zzso and function via a mechanism involving zzso zzso and stabilization of the active zzso
