The generally accepted synaptic concept is an zzso based on two major assumptions essential for a system of zzso to be orderly zzso zzso specificity of anatomical connections between zzso is zzso and, zzso it is zzso that the signal is transmitted via isolated compartment of zzso space, the synaptic zzso In the framework of this conceptual model, systems can be built using a single sort of signal zzso and knowledge on diversity of zzso remains zzso To provide that the signal is properly delivered to a due address, zzso can however equally zzso the chemical mode of zzso According to an alternative conceptual model proposed by the author, orderliness of a zzso system is based on plurality of signal zzso To describe the idealized elementary unit of zzso integration, the term zzso is zzso zzso is defined as the network of individually specific zzso differing in their respective zzso It is zzso that zzso the zzso situation is changed evenly throughout the zzso and zzso responses of sensitive targets to a specific zzso situation are composed into a well zzso zzso The functional repertory of a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso will thus include at least zzso integrated zzso The conceptual zzso zzso to a theoretical limit of the zzso (when zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso simpler nervous systems roughly zzso to a single zzso while evolved brains and cords include multiple units of zzso zzso
