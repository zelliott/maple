zzso of the external zzso are among the most common zzso anomalies in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso develop from the embryonic zzso and the zzso and zzso develop from the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso the zzso derived zzso zzso functions as an organizer and expresses sonic zzso zzso zzso knockout mice lack external zzso and have a persistent zzso This identified an early requirement for zzso but precluded analysis of its later role in the zzso zzso We conducted temporally controlled deletions of zzso and report that zzso is required continuously through the onset of sexual zzso zzso function is zzso into two zzso zzso an zzso phase, during which zzso regulates outgrowth and patterning of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and a later external zzso phase, during which zzso regulates zzso tube zzso zzso of zzso function during the zzso phase causes coordinated zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso during the external zzso phase causes zzso zzso directs zzso zzso by promoting cell proliferation in adjacent zzso zzso zzso Additionally, conditional zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows that the zzso is a direct target of zzso and is required for zzso tube closure, highlighting a novel role for zzso zzso in zzso Identification of the stages during which disruption of zzso results in either isolated or coordinated zzso of zzso and external zzso zzso provides a new tool for investigating the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
