zzso zzso after tissue damage depends on the proper organization of stem cells and their zzso though the repair mechanisms are zzso The zzso zzso zzso is well suited to approach this problem, as it is composed of zzso units called zzso of zzso We found that zzso a zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso after injury in zzso Unlike controls, zzso mice maintained an expanded population of zzso zzso cells in the zzso We used an in zzso system to enrich for zzso zzso stem cells to discover that zzso inhibited proliferation of these zzso Surprisingly, the effects of zzso were zzso by zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a zzso mechanism for forming new zzso units to zzso zzso
