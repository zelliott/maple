The effects of zzso a soy zzso zzso and zzso on collagen and DNA zzso zzso by the zzso and the zzso incorporation zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and expression zzso by Western zzso of the zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso son of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso were examined in normal human zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso cells were subjected to repetitive stress with 30 zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso for 1 h per day over the course of 5 zzso Also, the cells were treated with zzso alone or with zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso at 1 zzso zzso the zzso of collagen zzso evoked by zzso in zzso more effectively than zzso at the same zzso At 10 zzso zzso exerted significantly diminished protective effect on collagen zzso in zzso while at 100 zzso it induced zzso of this zzso The protective effect of zzso on collagen zzso was not related to zzso of zzso activity or the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso It was found that zzso at 1 zzso diminished zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso These results suggest that the mechanism of the protective effect of zzso on collagen zzso in zzso zzso may be due to prevention of disturbances in the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso evoked by the zzso
