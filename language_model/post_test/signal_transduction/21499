To investigate the relationship between the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 6 zzso and human colon zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, and 4 were constructed and zzso into the cultured human colon cancer cells of the line zzso zzso hours later zzso was used to detect the zzso expression of zzso and the zzso genes zzso and zzso flow zzso zzso was used to detect the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso into a plate and zzso with zzso or zzso and zzso cells without zzso were used as zzso zzso hours later zzso was used to observe the cell zzso Another zzso cells were zzso into a plate and zzso with zzso or zzso or blank zzso as zzso zzso hours zzso Western zzso was used to detect the protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso protein expression rate was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, significantly lower than that of the blank control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with an zzso rate of zzso and was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, significantly lower than that in the blank control group too zzso zzso zzso with an zzso rate of zzso And the zzso protein expression rates of the zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both not significant different from that of the blank control group (both P zzso zzso The early cell zzso rates of the zzso and zzso groups were zzso and zzso respectively, both significantly higher than that of the blank control group zzso both P zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso was significantly lower and the zzso expression of zzso was significantly higher in the zzso and zzso groups than in the blank control and blank zzso groups (all P zzso zzso The protein expression patterns of zzso and zzso was consistent with that of their protein zzso 

zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso of colon cancer cells by regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso
