The zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins regulate various aspects of zzso development by selectively binding to the 3' untranslated region of their target zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso also act in the zzso where they zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso differentiation when combined with zzso in negative regulators of the zzso zzso and suppress the zzso zzso caused by zzso that reduce zzso zzso zzso acts zzso in the zzso cells to limit their zzso competence to respond to the zzso patterning zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso inhibit primary zzso cell fate zzso in two distinct pathways acting in the zzso and in the zzso The zzso thereby ensure that the zzso signal selects only one zzso precursor cell for the primary cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulate various aspects of zzso cell fate zzso and they may play a zzso role in modulating signal zzso during animal zzso
