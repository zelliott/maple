zzso of zzso proteins or viral infection may interfere with proper protein folding activity in the zzso zzso zzso Several pathways that maintain cellular zzso were activated in response to these zzso zzso Here we investigated which of these zzso zzso pathways induce zzso and potentially zzso zzso and zzso A, two zzso stress zzso increased the expression of zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were observed during zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor Bay zzso or zzso zzso dominant negative zzso significantly inhibited the induction of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the nuclear zzso DNA binding activity and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso B virus zzso large surface zzso zzso of zzso stress, enhanced the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice showed higher expression of zzso protein in liver and kidney tissue expressing zzso zzso large surface protein in zzso Similarly, increased expression of zzso zzso was observed in human zzso zzso tissue expressing zzso zzso large surface zzso In zzso cells expressing zzso zzso large surface zzso zzso growth was zzso and the enhancement was abolished by the addition of specific zzso zzso Thus, zzso stress due either to expression of viral surface proteins or drugs can stimulate the expression of zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results provide important insights into cellular zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso
