In the present study, we investigated the effects of potential zzso zzso zzso on the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso with a focus on the zzso gene expression and cell cycle progression in rat liver zzso cells, and compared them with the effects of a model toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso The low zzso and zzso doses of zzso corresponding to expected zzso levels, induced a transient zzso of zzso to the nucleus, while high zzso doses induced a long-term zzso nuclear zzso followed by its degradation, similar to the effects of zzso Whereas high doses of zzso recruited zzso zzso to rat zzso promoter, the low doses did not induce its DNA zzso as revealed by the zzso zzso zzso This corresponded with the fact that the zzso doses of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in a way similar to zzso while the low doses of zzso were only poor zzso of zzso zzso zzso patterns of expression were observed also for other zzso gene targets, such as zzso and zzso Also, only zzso doses of zzso were able to mimic the effects of zzso on cell cycle and proliferation of liver zzso cells or zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso at low zzso may have unique effects on gene expression in zzso zzso Although both zzso and the high doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso doses of zzso unlike the zzso doses of zzso increased zzso levels of this important zzso and zzso junctions zzso These present data suggest that the outcome of zzso zzso induced by zzso at zzso expected in zzso may differ from the zzso zzso triggered by zzso toxic zzso such as zzso
