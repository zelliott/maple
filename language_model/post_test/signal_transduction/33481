zzso products of zzso fatty acids are formed via zzso zzso reactions and appear to be a new class of zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso alleviate inflammatory responses in zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully zzso zzso we report that zzso and zzso suppress zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso In zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line, zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso activity, thereby suppressing expression of its target gene such as zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso activity was not affected by zzso zzso (a NO zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (an zzso suggesting an underlying mechanism independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso alone zzso both zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso 1 zzso and strongly zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso small interfering zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a negative regulator for zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also largely attenuated by the zzso small interfering zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso inhibit zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso in zzso
