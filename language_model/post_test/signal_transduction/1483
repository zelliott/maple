Here, we report that mouse lung expresses zzso zzso transcripts of the rod and cone zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, a major zzso protein zzso in lung zzso was zzso with zzso that react with both rod and cone zzso We show that zzso is, in fact, a mixture of rod and cone zzso based on three additional lines of zzso First, zzso was also zzso with zzso specific for the cone zzso zzso Second, the expression of zzso zzso with zzso recognizing both rod and cone zzso was substantially reduced in lung zzso from zzso zzso In contrast, the fraction of zzso stained with cone zzso zzso was not altered in the zzso zzso Third, the absence of the zzso transcript was correlated with reduced levels of zzso in zzso zzso We have also found that mouse lung contains a small zzso transcript that has a zzso deletion resulting in a frame change, derived by differential zzso processing of zzso 3 of zzso zzso searches also revealed a rat zzso zzso that has the same zzso deletion causing the same frame zzso However, the premature zzso stop zzso seen in the short zzso transcript is absent and the regular stop zzso is out of frame leading to a predicted zzso extension into the 3' zzso These findings show that rod and cone zzso zzso are expressed in lung and seem to have a critical role in regulating zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
