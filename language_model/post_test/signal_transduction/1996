A sustained zzso effect of zzso has been zzso This study was initiated to investigate this topic and especially zzso the role of protein zzso C zzso zzso force zzso and action potential duration at zzso zzso zzso were measured in guinea-pig zzso muscles before and after 5 zzso challenge with 5 zzso zzso zzso contained 30 zzso exposure to the test agents zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso was given at the end of test exposure and after 15 zzso zzso zzso are mean zzso zzso of zzso P zzso or zzso zzso considered significant and zzso zzso The first zzso challenge significantly increased zzso force (27 zzso zzso in the control zzso zzso in the test groups were 2 zzso 4 zzso 1 zzso 5 zzso + zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso After zzso of zzso DOG and zzso zzso induced 3 zzso 8 zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso + zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso increase in test groups compared with 22 zzso zzso increase in zzso force in the control zzso After 45 zzso zzso of zzso the zzso response was still significantly reduced compared with control (29 zzso 4 zzso 79 zzso zzso zzso stimulation shortened zzso in controls at both time points (5 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso with no significant zzso in test zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso effects on zzso force as well as zzso A role for zzso in signal zzso is supported with respect to zzso zzso
