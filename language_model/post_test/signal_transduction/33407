Through their interaction with the zzso zzso factor zzso family, members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso elicit a wide range of biological effects including zzso zzso zzso or cell zzso We have identified and characterized a novel component of the zzso signaling complex, designated zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso finger motif and an extended zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso or zzso signaling complex through its interaction with zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso that is required for cell zzso and also for protection against zzso Thus, zzso acts as a zzso regulator that may influence signals responsible for cell zzso and cell death induced by members of the zzso zzso
