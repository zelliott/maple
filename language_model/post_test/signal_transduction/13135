The subdivision of the zzso wing zzso disc into zzso zzso compartments and zzso wall zzso zzso depends on zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso which zzso activates zzso zzso in D compartment cells and maintains zzso Complex zzso gene expression in prospective zzso zzso We examine the source, identity and mode of action of the zzso zzso that specify these zzso Of the three known zzso for the zzso zzso only zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso is required for wing disc zzso We show that zzso activity is required specifically in the zzso region of the wing disc for zzso and zzso gene zzso However, zzso expression of zzso in other locations does not reorganize zzso or zzso gene zzso zzso zzso appears to play a zzso rather than an zzso role in organizing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of other localized factors that control where zzso signaling is zzso After zzso is zzso zzso the level of zzso activity declines in D compartment cells as they zzso and move zzso away from the source of the zzso zzso We present evidence that this reduction is necessary for D and V compartment cells to interact along the compartment boundary to induce signals, like zzso zzso which organize the subsequent growth and differentiation of the wing zzso
