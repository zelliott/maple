Although clock genes are the hallmark of zzso zzso they are also currently considered as zzso factors that have a prominent role in the pharmacology of the zzso The expression of these zzso factors in the zzso brain is not only zzso rhythmic but is also modulated by external zzso and zzso An altered expression of clock zzso as evidenced in transgenic mice, has a profound influence on the behavioral effects of psychoactive zzso Focusing on clock genes expressed in the brain might lead to the discovery of novel zzso zzso
