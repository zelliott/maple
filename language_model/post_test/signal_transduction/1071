zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso can cause growth zzso and zzso effects on zzso in many types of cancer zzso However, the expression and effects of zzso in zzso leukemia cells have not been zzso In this study, we found no zzso expression in the human zzso leukemia cell lines either at baseline or after stimulation with zzso zzso acid zzso Human zzso zzso induced growth arrest and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We have previously identified zzso alpha as a nuclear zzso for zzso and have proceeded to examine further the role of this interaction in leukemia cell zzso In signaling zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso signaling while enhancing zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso was administered to these cells in combination with an zzso zzso the ability of these zzso to induce differentiation was zzso On the other hand, zzso enhanced the effect of an zzso zzso to induce differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso Further studies showed that zzso zzso (at the zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso has zzso activity against zzso leukemia zzso while it enhances signaling through zzso it zzso signaling by activated zzso
