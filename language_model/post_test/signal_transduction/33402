The vast majority of cases of zzso are associated with zzso 17) leading to the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso alpha is invariably transcribed and is believed to mediate zzso zzso was initially considered to be a zzso zzso However, zzso of other zzso finger containing proteins shows no direct evidence for DNA zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso are more likely to represent sites of zzso interaction and may be critical for the stability of the zzso nuclear zzso of which zzso is an integral zzso In zzso the nuclear bodies become zzso presumably as a consequence of the presence of zzso alpha and zzso zzso proteins that might render the structure zzso zzso alpha is capable of binding zzso and zzso it into the disrupted nuclear zzso zzso of zzso would be expected to limit high affinity binding of zzso zzso and residual zzso to DNA response elements and might account for the block in zzso differentiation at the zzso stage that characterizes zzso Recently zzso has been found to have growth zzso zzso It is unclear whether this is a property of zzso itself or reflects a zzso function of the zzso nuclear zzso Hence the zzso alpha zzso alone may be sufficient to cause zzso zzso zzso function may prevent its zzso activity, leading to zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso pathways due to zzso of zzso and/or an abnormal repertoire and character of response element zzso zzso by the fusion zzso causing the block in zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha would be expected to account for the similar zzso zzso associated with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso and zzso at the structural and functional level will determine whether zzso and other proteins disrupted in zzso associated zzso play an active or purely zzso role in zzso and will help dissect the events leading to transformation from those causing blockade of zzso differentiation and zzso the response to zzso
