zzso of the zzso zzso factor family normally reside in the zzso of cells in a complex with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso leads to zzso degradation of the zzso proteins and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso fused to fluorescent proteins was used to measure the dynamics of these processes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso degradation indicated that in the presence of dual fluorescent fusion protein zzso the zzso of zzso degradation was reduced and that of zzso zzso was significantly increased when compared with cells expressing the single fluorescent fusion zzso These results suggest that the ratio of zzso and zzso determine the zzso of zzso factor zzso into the nucleus and indicate that the complex of zzso and zzso is the true zzso for zzso stimulation in zzso zzso When cells were treated with the zzso nuclear export zzso zzso B zzso there was nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso accumulating more zzso No zzso zzso zzso was seen in response to zzso zzso Following 1 hour treatment with zzso significant zzso nuclear zzso but low levels of zzso nuclear zzso was zzso When these cells were zzso with zzso degradation of zzso was observed in both the zzso and zzso A normal transient zzso response was observed in the same cells using zzso imaging of zzso zzso These observations suggest that both normal zzso and zzso repression of zzso zzso occur even when nuclear export of zzso is zzso The results provide functional evidence that other factors, such as modification of zzso by zzso or interaction with other proteins such as zzso zzso may critically zzso the zzso of zzso through this zzso zzso
