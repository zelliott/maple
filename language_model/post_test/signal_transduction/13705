The mechanism by which protective immunity to zzso is lost in the absence of continued exposure to this zzso has yet to be fully zzso It has been recently shown that zzso produced during human and zzso acute malaria zzso the immune response to zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso is important to maintain long-term protective immunity against zzso zzso AS zzso On day 60 zzso zzso mice still had chronic zzso and efficiently controlled zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of chronic mice showed zzso numbers of zzso memory zzso zzso cells, which is associated with increased levels of zzso zzso zzso high expression of zzso genes and zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso was no longer detected and protective immunity to zzso challenge was mostly lost with zzso zzso zzso cured mice had high serum levels of zzso zzso but zzso zzso cell numbers, zzso zzso T cell zzso and zzso production were similar to zzso zzso zzso the zzso of cured mice with low doses of zzso rescued zzso zzso and the capacity to control zzso challenge, increasing the zzso cell population and restoring the zzso T cell responses to zzso Contribution of zzso signaling to the zzso T cell responses in chronic mice was supported by data obtained in mice lacking the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is required to maintain protective immunity against zzso zzso and aid in establishing the molecular basis of zzso immunity in human zzso
