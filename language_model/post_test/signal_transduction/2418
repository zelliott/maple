The bacterial zzso protein zzso activates zzso when zzso on zzso 54 in its zzso zzso regulatory domain or when altered by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso domain of zzso which acts positively on the remainder of the zzso is zzso to a large family of signal zzso zzso called receiver zzso zzso of an zzso zzso in a receiver domain zzso the function of a downstream target, but the accompanying structural changes are not zzso In the present work we examine structural and functional differences between the zzso receiver domain of zzso and zzso forms carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso of such zzso resulted in both increased structural changes in the zzso domain, monitored by zzso chemical shift differences, and increased zzso zzso by the full-length zzso zzso changes caused by zzso outside the active site zzso and zzso were not only local but extended over a substantial portion of the zzso domain including the region from zzso 3 to zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso to the active zzso Interestingly, the zzso substitution of zzso for zzso at the site of zzso zzso also triggered structural changes in the zzso zzso Thus, the active site and the zzso face appear to zzso zzso with respect to how zzso may affect the structure of receiver zzso and how structural changes may be communicated to the remainder of zzso are zzso
