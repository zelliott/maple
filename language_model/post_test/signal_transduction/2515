We recently showed that zzso signal zzso with zzso zzso signal zzso by a complex of zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso to stimulate the expansion of human primitive zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of a zzso for zzso zzso whose zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso in combination with zzso on human zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso culture of zzso blood zzso cells, whereas FL alone zzso only zzso zzso colony formation, zzso bursts and mixed colonies in addition to zzso colonies were induced by FL with zzso but not zzso zzso In suspension culture, zzso cells generated a small number of zzso cells in the presence of FL or zzso zzso However, the addition of zzso to the culture with FL induced the generation of a significant number of zzso cells and zzso in addition to zzso zzso The combination of FL and zzso also induced a remarkable expansion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso although FL or zzso alone induced the generation of only a small number of zzso for zzso zzso The synergistic effects of FL and zzso were confirmed in zzso zzso and suspension zzso In addition, the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the synergistic zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso with zzso signal to stimulate human zzso zzso and zzso and the expansion of primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso
