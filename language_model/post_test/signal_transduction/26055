Specialized zzso cells in the zzso skin play important roles in zzso zzso but how they arise zzso is largely zzso Here we show that zzso cells zzso differentiate in the zzso zzso zzso skin soon after zzso based on the expression of a zzso form of the zzso that zzso to the plasma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso Like zzso in other species, we show that the expression of these genes is likely to be driven by an zzso of zzso which is also sufficient to promote the formation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso form in the skin as two distinct zzso that resemble the zzso and zzso cells of the zzso The zzso expresses zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso plasma zzso whereas the zzso expresses zzso and zzso the zzso zzso or zzso These two zzso are specified during early zzso differentiation by a zzso switch that can be regulated by zzso signaling and by the expression of zzso a zzso factor of the zzso zzso These results have implications for how zzso are specified in zzso and become functionally zzso
