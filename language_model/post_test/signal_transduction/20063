The zzso base exerts a supportive role for the brain and includes the zzso zzso and zzso bones that arise from zzso precursors in the early zzso As the zzso bone and the zzso part of the zzso are zzso derivatives that arise in close proximity to the zzso and floor plate, it has been assumed that their development, like the zzso zzso is dependent on Sonic zzso zzso and zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso Here we examined the development of the zzso base in chick and mouse zzso to compare the molecular signals that are required for zzso induction in the trunk and zzso We found that zzso zzso is required but the molecular network controlling zzso base development is distinct from that in the zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso zzso base did not undergo zzso commitment as determined by the loss of zzso expression and there was a decrease in cell zzso In contrast, induction of the zzso capsule occurred normally demonstrating that induction of the zzso base is zzso from formation of the sensory zzso Lastly, we found that the early zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso likely accounting for why development of the zzso base occurs after the zzso zzso Our data reveal that zzso and zzso skeletal induction is controlled by zzso yet zzso distinct mechanisms that zzso development of the zzso base with that of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
