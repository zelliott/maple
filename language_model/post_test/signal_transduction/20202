zzso receptors zzso sense structural patterns in microbial molecules and initiate immune defense zzso The structures of many zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been studied in the last 10 zzso These structures reveal the extraordinary diversity of zzso zzso Some zzso use internal zzso pockets to bind bacterial zzso and others use zzso surfaces to bind zzso zzso The structures suggest a common zzso mechanism for zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and so activates zzso signaling zzso Recently, the structure of the death domain complex of one of the signaling zzso zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso has been zzso This structure shows how zzso of signaling adapters recruits downstream zzso However, we are still far from a complete understanding of zzso zzso We need to study the structures of zzso in complex with their zzso We also need to determine the structures of zzso zzso to understand zzso mechanisms and the specificity of the signaling zzso Ultimately, we will have to study the structures of the complete zzso signaling complexes containing full-length zzso zzso zzso and bridging zzso and some of the downstream zzso to understand how zzso sense microbial infections and activate immune responses against zzso
