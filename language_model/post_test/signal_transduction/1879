In the spinal neural tube, populations of zzso precursors that express a unique combination of zzso factors give rise to specific classes of zzso at precise locations along the zzso zzso zzso the patterning mechanisms that generate restricted gene expression along the zzso axis is therefore crucial to understanding the creation of diverse neural cell zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso and other transforming growth factor beta zzso proteins are expressed by the zzso cells of the neural tube (the zzso and surrounding zzso and evidence indicates that they play a role in assigning cell zzso We have manipulated the level of zzso signaling in the chicken neural tube to show that zzso provide patterning information to both zzso and intermediate zzso zzso regulation of the expression boundaries of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso generates precursor populations with distinct zzso zzso Within the resulting zzso thresholds of zzso act to set expression domain boundaries of zzso regulators of the zzso and basic zzso zzso families, ultimately leading to the generation of a diversity of differentiated neural cell zzso This evidence strongly suggests that zzso are the key regulators of zzso cell identity in the spinal neural zzso
