zzso aromatic zzso zzso are widespread environmental zzso which are known to be zzso and zzso These compounds cause a range of zzso zzso particularly to the zzso apparatus and cardiovascular system during zzso zzso However, little is known concerning microscopic effects, especially on the sensitive early life stages or on the molecular basis of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we explored the zzso defects caused by zzso exposure to environmentally relevant zzso of zzso a zzso zzso The results showed that zzso substantially disrupted the zzso zzso pattern and caused zzso of motor zzso The expression of a protein associated with zzso growth, growth associated protein 43, was decreased in the central nervous system after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a vital role in a variety of zzso including zzso development, synaptic zzso and zzso survival and zzso Our results showed that the expression of zzso dependent zzso II and zzso zzso which belong to the zzso pathway, were increased in a zzso manner after exposure to zzso zzso an important neurotransmitter which is known to suppress retinal cells zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso acts as an zzso retrograde signal that can coordinate zzso targeting and zzso during zzso The level of NO was decreased in a zzso manner following exposure to zzso Taken together, the defects in zzso and the damage to related mechanisms provided the basis for a better understanding of the zzso effects of zzso
