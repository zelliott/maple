zzso zzso the most common sustained zzso is believed to be triggered by zzso electrical activity originating in the zzso sleeves surrounding the pulmonary veins zzso It has been reported that zzso sleeves have the potential to generate zzso in response to zzso This study investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in zzso zzso isolated from zzso Application of 10 zzso zzso to zzso zzso induced repetitive and transient increases in zzso zzso zzso The zzso transient was accompanied by zzso and induced automatic rhythmic action zzso at approximately zzso in zzso patch clamp preparations in zzso of zzso were zzso When the recording mode was switched from zzso to zzso mode during the continuous presence of zzso an zzso current was zzso The zzso current was always inward, irrespective of the membrane potential, indicating that the current was derived mainly from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was suppressed by blocking either the zzso or zzso Additionally, this zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso C and the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by a protein zzso C zzso We observed that the zzso system was enriched in zzso in the zzso in contrast to those of the atrium, and that the zzso and zzso were zzso along zzso zzso These findings suggest that a functional zzso between the zzso and zzso causes zzso zzso of the zzso during the presence of combined zzso and zzso zzso
