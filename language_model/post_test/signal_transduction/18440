Rod zzso detect and zzso incident photons exceptionally zzso They collect sparse photons with high efficiency, maintain a low dark noise, and generate zzso responses to each absorbed zzso The mechanisms involved in zzso zzso of the effective lifetime of a single active zzso zzso amplification of the activity of this single zzso by a zzso zzso and reliable transmission of small synaptic zzso throughout the nervous zzso Indeed, several other sensory systems reach or approach limits set by zzso of their input zzso For example, zzso receptors can detect single zzso zzso Although our understanding of visual zzso and signal processing has advanced rapidly during the past zzso years, fundamental questions still remain: What mechanisms are responsible for the zzso of the zzso elementary zzso What are the tradeoffs of speed and sensitivity in the zzso zzso How are the rod zzso responses reliably transmitted to the rest of the visual zzso Future technical zzso particularly better methods to monitor the activity of intermediate steps in zzso will play an important role in providing zzso
