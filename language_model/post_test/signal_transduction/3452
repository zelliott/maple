zzso zzso genes have been confirmed involved in lots of zzso This study evaluated the role of genetic zzso in zzso zzso genes in zzso quality and idiopathic male zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso eligible zzso men and zzso fertile zzso zzso quality analysis was performed by zzso zzso zzso It was found that genetic zzso of zzso was associated with idiopathic male zzso Additionally, in strategy analysis, the zzso C zzso might decrease the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso may have a higher risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These significant differences were retained after zzso zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso and zzso may modify the risk of abnormal zzso zzso which could result in male zzso zzso have been confirmed involved in lots of zzso To our knowledge, few studies have zzso the role of genetic zzso in zzso zzso genes in zzso quality and idiopathic male infertility, although zzso is indispensable in normal zzso In this original study, we evaluated the potential impact of the zzso in zzso zzso genes on the risk of abnormal zzso quality based on zzso zzso patients and zzso controls, and provided the first evidence that zzso in zzso in zzso may modify the risk of abnormal zzso zzso which could result in male zzso
