zzso potential is a key zzso of vascular tone and many zzso act through the zzso of zzso channel currents zzso the zzso zzso channel zzso involved in setting the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are potentially important intermediaries in such zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso express multiple zzso zzso but the reason for such zzso is zzso We investigated which of these zzso are involved in zzso zzso and regulation of vascular zzso channels important in modulating membrane zzso 

zzso zzso were selectively depleted (by zzso by zzso of cultured zzso with selective short interfering zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso in zzso accounting for zzso of the total response to zzso zzso zzso zzso played a minor role in zzso zzso whereas zzso made no significant zzso zzso was also the principal zzso involved in zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso using the fluorescent zzso for zzso activity, zzso and the substantial zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso current was shown to play a vital role in setting the resting membrane potential and in zzso the zzso observed upon zzso zzso 

zzso but not the closely related zzso plays a principal role in zzso zzso and regulation of the membrane potential in zzso These findings identify zzso as a vital component in the zzso apparatus central to the control of blood zzso
