zzso zzso is a common type of cancer with poor zzso This study examines the in zzso and in zzso mechanisms of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso cells were treated with different zzso zzso and analyzed with Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso wound healing, flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso nude mice model was applied to confirm the cellular zzso zzso showed strong zzso cell viability zzso in a dose dependent manner and significantly reduced the cell zzso proteins as well as inducing cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase through zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso However, protein zzso 2A zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor totally reversed the zzso zzso The zzso nude mice model further confirmed that zzso inhibited zzso tumor cell growth and down regulated the zzso signaling and cell cycle regulating zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso cell proliferation zzso and tumor growth suppression by zzso are zzso through zzso zzso
