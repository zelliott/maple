We describe a novel, typically zzso sensor zzso in zzso of green zzso The gene for this zzso sensor zzso zzso is found in zzso zzso from which zzso zzso The zzso gene has moved, during evolution, from the ancestral zzso to the nuclear zzso of zzso algae and green zzso The zzso protein is now zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and imported into their zzso as a protein zzso In the model higher plant zzso zzso zzso is zzso and required for control of zzso of zzso genes by the zzso state of an electron carrier connecting zzso I and zzso zzso therefore provides a zzso regulatory mechanism that couples photosynthesis to gene zzso This mechanism is inherited directly from the zzso zzso of zzso is intrinsic to zzso and is targeted to zzso zzso
