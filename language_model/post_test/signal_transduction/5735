The zzso zzso of zzso are responsible for its zzso signaling events in zzso zzso blood vessel zzso and zzso although the molecular mechanisms governing these processes are zzso To provide a foundation for the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso we determined the crystal structure of the zzso portion of zzso We found that it contains three distinctly folded zzso namely zzso zzso and death domain zzso These three zzso form a structural zzso with zzso binding to both zzso and zzso thereby zzso the zzso zzso in a closed zzso and suppressing its biological zzso zzso of the closed zzso of the zzso zzso leads to the zzso of the zzso in the promotion of zzso and blood vessel zzso Finally, we provide evidence showing that the zzso nature of zzso zzso is likely to be shared by the zzso and zzso families of scaffold zzso
