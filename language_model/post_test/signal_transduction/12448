zzso cancer represents a major health issue and its zzso is rising zzso In developed countries, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of death from cancer in zzso zzso deprivation reduces zzso activity in zzso zzso of patients with advanced disease, but most zzso zzso within 2 years to an incurable zzso zzso Even for patients with early disease at the time of diagnosis, a proportion of patients will zzso develop relapsed disease following radical zzso Treatment options for patients with zzso prostate cancer are very limited and, even with toxic therapy, such as zzso the life expectancy is only improved by a median of 2 zzso Advances in molecular zzso have identified key zzso pathways that are considered to be driving events in prostate zzso The zzso of multiple zzso pathways increases further the possibility of zzso among zzso zzso zzso Hence zzso networks that may incorporate distinct pathways in prostate cancer, particularly in zzso disease, are increasingly appreciated in drug development zzso With the development of potent zzso zzso capable of specifically suppressing the activities of individual zzso zzso it may be that, by combining these agents as guided by the molecular signature of prostate cancer, a more efficient therapeutic regime may be zzso Therefore the present review focuses on evidence of abnormal zzso in prostate cancer and the potential of these targets in drug development, and incorporates key findings of relevant clinical trials to zzso
