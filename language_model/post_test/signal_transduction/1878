During zzso zzso zzso differentiation depends on the expression of zzso cells missing zzso zzso how zzso fate is achieved thus requires knowledge of the zzso and spatial control mechanisms directing zzso zzso A recent report showed that in the adult bristle zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated by zzso signaling ( Van De zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here we show that the effect of zzso zzso on zzso is zzso In the zzso bipolar zzso zzso sensory lineage in the embryonic peripheral nervous system zzso zzso cell division of the zzso precursor produces a zzso and a zzso cell, where zzso expression is activated in the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso is specifically activated in one of the daughter cells and is required for zzso expression and a zzso zzso Thus zzso activity has opposite consequences on zzso expression in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can direct zzso in a subset of embryonic zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is supported in certain zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso protein zzso is one of the factors that provide such zzso
