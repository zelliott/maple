The network that controls zzso in zzso coli is one of the most completely characterized signal zzso systems to zzso zzso zzso accounts for characteristics such as high sensitivity, precise adaptation over a wide dynamic range of zzso zzso and zzso to variations in the amounts of zzso zzso To gain insights into the zzso relationship of zzso clusters and understand the mechanism behind the zzso zzso we develop and analyze a model for a single zzso of zzso This new model extends an earlier model zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) to incorporate the recent experimental findings that the core structure of zzso clusters is the zzso of zzso zzso We show that the model can reproduce most of the zzso behaviors, including zzso adaptation, high sensitivity, and zzso to zzso zzso In addition, the model makes a number of new predictions as to how the adaptation time varies with the expression level of various proteins involved in signal zzso Our results provide a more zzso description of the zzso relationship for the signaling system, and show the key role of the interaction among zzso members of the zzso in the zzso response of zzso
