To explore the relationship between zzso mechanisms and zzso cells zzso in the outer muscle layer of the zzso 

In zzso tissue from male zzso zzso were identified by their response to zzso oxide zzso with a rise in zzso Sections of the lateral zzso wall were incubated in zzso solution containing 1 zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso were then exposed to 100 zzso of the NO donor zzso for 10 zzso control zzso remained in zzso zzso zzso were then processed for zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso marker protein gene product zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were found mainly in the outer muscle layers of the zzso zzso Three types were identified based on zzso on the outer surface of the zzso wall, on the surface of the muscle zzso and within the muscle zzso Some of the intramuscular zzso stained for zzso but they did not stain with zzso zzso Nerve zzso were seen in close contact with the zzso intramuscular zzso and these nerves expressed zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso of intramuscular zzso can zzso zzso and might release zzso onto the underlying zzso These cells are in close contact with nerves, suggesting that they might be activated by neural zzso Thus there may be a system in the zzso involving zzso nerves acting on zzso which can activate the smooth muscle via a complex zzso zzso
