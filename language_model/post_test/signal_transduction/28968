zzso mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing zzso are not well zzso Rapid induction of gene expression of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the Japanese quail zzso zzso is the earliest event yet recorded in the zzso signal zzso zzso Here we show zzso of gene expression in the quail zzso associated with the initiation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We identified two waves of gene zzso The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso to zzso quail zzso zzso growth and expression of zzso which was shown to be zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso in the zzso zzso therefore seems to trigger zzso zzso seasonal zzso
