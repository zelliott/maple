The zzso zzso factor zzso is expressed by skeletal muscle and zzso proliferation of muscle precursor cells, an important feature of skeletal muscle maintenance and zzso We hypothesized that muscle precursor cells from patients with type 2 diabetes had a deficient response to zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso and its zzso zzso were measured in skeletal muscle zzso from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes by use of zzso and Western zzso zzso signaling and response were studied following administration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso signaling zzso in zzso cultures established from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 zzso zzso proliferation rate was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were increased in both muscle tissue and cultured zzso from diabetic zzso Nonetheless, in the diabetic zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The deficient response to zzso administration in the diabetic zzso was further emphasized by a lack of increase in zzso cell proliferation and a decreased zzso induction of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein was zzso in diabetic zzso and zzso of zzso rescued zzso gene expression in diabetic zzso whereas neither zzso or zzso signaling nor proliferation rate was zzso In conclusion, although zzso and zzso proteins were increased in muscle tissue and zzso from diabetic patients, zzso signaling and zzso cell proliferation were impaired in diabetic zzso suggesting a novel mechanism by which muscle function is compromised in zzso
