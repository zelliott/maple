The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade is present and responsive to insulin in skeletal muscle and if high-fat feeding zzso zzso zzso of this signaling zzso zzso rats were assigned to either control zzso zzso zzso or high zzso zzso zzso zzso dietary zzso After a zzso dietary period, animals were subjected to hind limb zzso in the presence zzso zzso 8 per zzso or absence zzso zzso 8 per zzso of zzso zzso feeding reduced rates of zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso In plasma membrane zzso neither the high-fat diet nor insulin altered the insulin zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso protein containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso but high-fat feeding did decrease zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were present in the skeletal muscle and reflected the protein concentration of experimental zzso Despite zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso being unaffected by high-fat zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso toward zzso and zzso zzso 4 protein concentration were all significantly reduced in zzso plasma membrane prepared from the skeletal muscle of high zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signaling cascade is present in skeletal muscle, activated by insulin, and impaired by high-fat zzso
