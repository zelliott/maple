To study the role of the zzso domain and particularly the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso differentiation of human primary stem cells, we infected zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso receptors containing the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain of either the normal zzso or a truncated zzso devoid of zzso zzso zzso differentiation of the infected zzso could thus be studied after stimulation by zzso The complete zzso was used to assess its ability to substitute for zzso in zzso zzso Typical zzso zzso colonies were observed from zzso cells grown in zzso when infected with any of the three viral zzso These results demonstrate that: zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso colony formation showing that zzso terminal differentiation can be induced by a zzso zzso in human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso a signal leading to terminal zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso in contrast to results previously reported in zzso models, zzso zzso of the zzso are not required for growth and terminal differentiation of human zzso zzso
