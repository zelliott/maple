zzso zzso zzso stem cells from embryonic stem cells zzso could provide a zzso experimental system for understanding zzso differentiation pathways and may ultimately provide cells for zzso damaged zzso zzso We tested a zzso differentiation procedure in which zzso were first cultured with zzso A to favor formation of definitive zzso and then treated with zzso medium with or without zzso The definitive zzso expressed a number of genes associated with zzso development through mouse embryonic day zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed and zzso zzso The zzso stem cell marker zzso gene was also activated in the zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso and zzso zzso stem cell markers were zzso Exposure of the zzso to zzso medium with zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso the remaining zzso stem cell markers and the later gut markers zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, genes associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also simulated by zzso The zzso differentiation protocol generated gut bodies with zzso structures that included regions of zzso zzso cells and regions of cell zzso These gut bodies also had a smooth muscle component and some underwent zzso zzso The ability of the definitive zzso to differentiate into zzso zzso was supported by the zzso zzso of these cells into mouse zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that definitive zzso derived from zzso can carry out zzso cell differentiation pathways and may provide cells to restore damaged zzso zzso
