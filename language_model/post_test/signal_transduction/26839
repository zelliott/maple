zzso of zzso is a promising strategy for discovery of novel zzso zzso In this study, we examined the ability of a novel zzso zzso of zzso acid, that is, zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso in cancer zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The mechanism of cell death was investigated in zzso cells where it caused zzso by acting against several potential zzso zzso zzso It inhibited zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso which may enhance the sensitivity of cells to zzso Also, zzso decreased the activity of Bid and zzso in zzso caused zzso loss, releasing zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso down stream zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso from zzso to the nucleus indicated some zzso zzso Though it zzso zzso and zzso the zzso inhibitor yet had no effect on zzso as against zzso zzso by zzso zzso Attempts were made to examine any acclaimed role of zzso in the zzso of zzso using zzso where it had no effect on zzso activity while the zzso inhibited zzso zzso suggesting predominance of intrinsic zzso Our studies thus demonstrated that zzso exerts zzso action in cancer cells while it required zzso higher the concentration to produce zzso in normal human zzso and zzso cell line, and therefore, may find usefulness in the management of human zzso
