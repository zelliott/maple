The zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of 76 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein essential for zzso development and zzso zzso It contains a zzso motif zzso domain, 3 zzso zzso a zzso region, and a zzso zzso 2 zzso Whereas the other zzso have been extensively zzso the role of the SAM domain in zzso function is not zzso To understand the function of this domain, we generated zzso zzso mice with the SAM domain zzso Analysis of these mice showed that zzso development was partially blocked at the zzso to zzso zzso Positive and negative zzso selection was also zzso In addition, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso signaling in T cells from these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso leading to defective zzso production and zzso Moreover, despite normal association between zzso and zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso was impaired by the deletion of the SAM zzso Altogether, our data demonstrated that the SAM domain is indispensable for optimal zzso zzso
