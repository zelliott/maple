zzso neural circuit assembly is achieved by initial overproduction of zzso and zzso followed by refinement through elimination of exuberant zzso and zzso zzso cells are the primary cells responsible for clearing zzso debris, but the cellular and molecular basis of zzso pruning is poorly zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso transform into zzso through zzso of a zzso zzso program at the initiation of metamorphosis and are the primary zzso cell type in the zzso zzso We examined the zzso elimination of two zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nerve zzso zzso only zzso are pruned or entire cells are zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso are engulfed by zzso using the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in a partially redundant zzso In contrast, while elimination of zzso cell bodies requires zzso elimination of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso we also found that elimination of zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso promote zzso destruction through zzso zzso This study identifies a novel role for zzso in the clearance of synaptic and zzso debris and for zzso as a new zzso zzso zzso pruning and zzso unexpectedly, that the zzso signaling pathways engaged by zzso depend on whether zzso debris was generated through cell death or local zzso
