zzso disease zzso is a complex disease with genetic and environmental risk factors implicated in its zzso however, its zzso is poorly zzso To decipher zzso genetic zzso we combined gene expression profiling with zzso analysis and association zzso We compared the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of 15 patients and 14 matched controls using zzso zzso and found that the zzso signaling zzso was zzso among the zzso expressed zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of this zzso stand out as they are also among the top zzso expressed zzso Twelve zzso tagging zzso at the zzso locus and 15 zzso in zzso found associated in at least one published BD zzso association study were tested for association with BD in a zzso of zzso Iranian patients and zzso zzso We found a novel association with BD for the zzso zzso located downstream of zzso and zzso three associations at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction analysis indicated the existence of zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are members of the zzso growth factor zzso family, seem to zzso BD zzso through main effects and zzso zzso These association findings support a role for the zzso signaling zzso in BD zzso that warrants further investigation and highlight the importance of combining genetic and zzso approaches to dissect the genetic architecture of complex zzso
