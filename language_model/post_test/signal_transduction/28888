The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of zzso capsule on the gene expression in zzso cells zzso during their interaction with zzso zzso To this end, we used an zzso virulent strain of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain derived from the same genetic zzso DC were exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains for 4 h and 18 zzso and their zzso profiles were analyzed using the zzso mouse gene chip zzso A large number of DC genes were zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso In particular, we observed the zzso of the genes involved in DC zzso such as cell surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso and the genes involved in zzso processing and presentation as well as cell cycle or zzso The zzso gene expression data were confirmed by real-time reverse zzso while the expression of zzso genes was correlated with their zzso A completely different pattern of gene expression was observed for DC treated with an zzso strain of zzso zzso In particular, no significant induction was observed in the expression of the genes mentioned zzso Moreover, a number of zzso such as those coding for zzso were zzso These results suggest that the zzso capsule zzso the cell wall of zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in inducing DC response, highlighting the molecular basis of the true nature of immune zzso exerted by zzso zzso
