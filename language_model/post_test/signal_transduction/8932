The zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso has been widely accepted as a key zzso zzso zzso and zzso in tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso We have recently reported that zzso regulates the transient zzso and zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso in the zzso domain and zzso in the zzso regulatory domain were zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso using chemical zzso and small interfering zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were differently regulated via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso but not zzso was involved in the zzso of zzso Surprisingly, modified zzso was essential to prevent zzso cellular zzso however, the zzso zzso was independent of the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso controls two different signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to the survival of cells exposed to the death signal from the zzso zzso
