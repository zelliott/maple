zzso growth factor beta zzso family members are known for their important role in bone zzso zzso and, to a smaller extent, bone zzso protein 2 zzso have been reported to regulate the gene expression of different zzso markers in zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in these zzso Here we report that zzso like zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso This was zzso through an increase in the zzso rate of the gene rather than through the stabilization of zzso collagen zzso and required new protein zzso In addition, zzso and zzso increases in zzso collagen zzso levels were both dependent on protein zzso C and protein zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso participated in the zzso of zzso collagen gene expression by zzso and zzso In response to either zzso or zzso the stimulation of zzso collagen zzso levels was paralleled by an early increase in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Moreover, the effects of both zzso and zzso on zzso collagen gene expression were markedly decreased in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso Our findings therefore show that zzso and zzso which signal through discrete zzso zzso are able to trigger zzso if not zzso zzso zzso leading to comparable actions on the zzso of the zzso collagen gene in zzso zzso
