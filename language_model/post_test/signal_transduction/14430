The zzso zzso zzso possesses no zzso activity amid potentially beneficial therapeutic zzso We here characterized interactions between zzso (1 zzso and the zzso system in cultured rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso rise observed in zzso and zzso was markedly reduced in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso with no zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso responses were even more reduced in the presence of the more abundant zzso zzso zzso this action was maintained in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were also reduced by zzso to zzso expected to increase zzso levels by increasing in zzso Application of zzso at 1 zzso elevated zzso zzso responses in both cell types, further confirming our finding that zzso zzso is zzso coupled to the action of zzso However, zzso of zzso levels of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso (with zzso and zzso could not be achieved under resting zzso Because zzso did not mimic the zzso actions, and zzso toxin treatment had no effect on zzso responses, we propose that the effects of zzso were zzso via a zzso active zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso Instead, zzso via zzso and zzso C appears to be zzso coupled to zzso zzso responses, as the inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso Our data highlight the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and provide evidence for the presence of an additional pharmacological target, sensitive to zzso and to zzso
