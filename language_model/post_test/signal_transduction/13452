Bone zzso proteins zzso are members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling molecules that play important roles in a wide variety of zzso zzso In this study, we have used an zzso specific for the zzso and activated form of zzso to examine zzso patterns of zzso signaling in chick zzso during early zzso We find complex spatial and zzso zzso of zzso signaling that zzso how zzso may function in multiple patterning events in the early chick zzso In the zzso zzso we find that zzso signaling is initially ubiquitous and is extinguished in the zzso at the onset of primitive streak zzso At the head process stage, zzso signaling is zzso in prospective neural plate, while it is strongly activated at the neural plate border, a region which is populated by cells that will give rise to neural zzso During later development, we find a dynamic zzso zzso of zzso signaling along the zzso zzso in the zzso neural tube, in the zzso and in the zzso during their maturation zzso We discuss the implication of our results for zzso functions of zzso signaling during chick zzso
