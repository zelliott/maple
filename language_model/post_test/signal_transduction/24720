zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that exerts its effects on different target cells by interacting with a specific zzso This interaction leads to the association and zzso of a second membrane zzso zzso which is the zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso from a human zzso line has been zzso We report here the cloning and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso derived from rat zzso zzso of zzso molecules from the different species and cell types reveals zzso overall zzso acid zzso and zzso identity in the growth factor signaling zzso Two zzso zzso species, a moderately abundant species of zzso zzso and a lesser one of zzso zzso were present in rat zzso zzso protection analyses demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in four different zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequences between both zzso in the different cell types are quite similar, supporting the prediction that the different responses initiated by zzso on different target cells are modulated by zzso proteins zzso to the activated zzso zzso
