zzso a zzso compound with a combination of zzso zzso and zzso properties, is used as an alternative for zzso or zzso plus zzso hormone therapy for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause and zzso The current study compares the zzso gene expression profiles after short-term (21 zzso treatment with zzso to the profiles after treatment with zzso zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso in healthy zzso women undergoing zzso for zzso zzso The impact of zzso treatment on zzso gene expression zzso zzso was much higher than the effect of zzso (173 zzso or zzso + zzso treatment zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gene expression profiles after zzso treatment show a weak similarity to the profiles after zzso treatment zzso 72 zzso and even less profile similarity to zzso + zzso treatment zzso 17 zzso Interestingly, 95 zzso genes were zzso zzso of profile similarity into biological processes and pathways showed that zzso downstream zzso such as cell cycle and cell zzso are not affected by zzso + zzso slightly by zzso but are significantly affected by zzso In conclusion, zzso treatment results in a zzso gene expression profile in the human zzso which shares only limited resemblance to zzso and even less resemblance to zzso + zzso induced zzso
