Signal zzso plays a key role in regulating important functions in both zzso and zzso organisms and largely controls the manner in which cells respond to zzso Signal zzso pathways coordinate the functions in different type of cells in animals and control the growth and differentiation in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways are largely activated by second zzso zzso zzso zzso has a complex life cycle involving four zzso stages with various second zzso systems able to regulate its growth and zzso Signal zzso often alters the status of zzso in target proteins and thus alters the activities of these zzso In this review, two major signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso pathway, are zzso zzso zzso are also discussed due to their importance in zzso target proteins and terminating signal zzso zzso of the unique pathways in this pathogen may lead to the development of novel therapeutic zzso
