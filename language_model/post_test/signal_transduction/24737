zzso zzso may result in distinct zzso patterns of zzso zzso To define the zzso distribution of zzso signals induced by stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso we expressed the cloned zzso in zzso zzso zzso were then loaded with zzso and observed using zzso zzso zzso induced a single concentric wave of increased zzso that radiated inward from the plasma zzso With zzso zzso however, regions of the zzso wave spontaneously reorganized into repetitive zzso zzso zzso stimulation of a small part of the plasma membrane resulted in a zzso wave which began at the point of zzso radiated toward the center of the cell, then reorganized into multiple zzso of zzso zzso waves and spirals of increased zzso The pattern of zzso signaling induced by focal or global stimulation was not altered in zzso zzso although signals did not zzso as zzso Finally, zzso zzso signaling patterns induced by zzso were inhibited by caffeine, while neither zzso nor zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso increases in zzso zzso Thus, stimulation of the zzso zzso in this cell system zzso a complex pattern of zzso signaling which is influenced by zzso the magnitude of the zzso zzso the distribution of the surface receptors that are zzso and zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso space as well as from two distinct zzso zzso zzso The manner in which a single type of zzso is activated may represent an important potential mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
