zzso worms alter their zzso immune system to diminish the inflammatory responses directed against them, using very efficient zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso profoundly reduces the progression of inflammatory diseases via zzso of zzso Here we zzso the signaling events in zzso triggered by zzso zzso zzso was predominantly taken up by zzso and subsequently induced the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression induced by zzso in zzso was zzso zzso sensitive and dependent on zzso of both zzso zzso in clear contrast to expression of zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso was induced by zzso and regulated by zzso Chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso however, zzso the downstream target of zzso was not activated following zzso zzso To characterize signaling elements involved in zzso of the zzso zzso we applied mathematical zzso Experimental testing of the in zzso generated hypotheses identified dual specificity zzso zzso 1 and 2, as regulators in zzso triggered zzso in zzso and in zzso In particular, zzso was subsequently found to be responsible for regulation of zzso and zzso and controlled the zzso expression in zzso by zzso Thus, we show that zzso exploits zzso and zzso pathways of zzso zzso to induce regulatory zzso This study provides insights into molecular mechanisms of zzso manipulation by zzso and highlights the utility of mathematical modeling for the zzso of regulatory circuits of immune zzso
