Sleep is zzso zzso such that sleep drive reflects the duration of prior zzso However, despite the discovery of genes important for sleep, a coherent molecular model for sleep zzso has yet to zzso To better understand the function and regulation of sleep, we employed a zzso approach in zzso An zzso in the zzso domain protein zzso zzso exhibited one of the strongest baseline sleep zzso thus far observed, a zzso h sleep zzso zzso this is coupled to a reduced zzso response to sleep zzso consistent with a disrupted sleep zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in reduced sleep zzso consolidation, and zzso suggesting an important role for protein turnover in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, inc and zzso expression in zzso zzso during development contributes to their adult sleep zzso Similar to flies with increased zzso zzso loss of inc and zzso result in zzso to a mechanical stimulus in adult zzso Furthermore, the inc sleep duration zzso can be rescued by pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso Taken together, these results establish inc and zzso as important new players in setting the sleep zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in zzso
