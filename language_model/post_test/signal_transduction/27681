We have been studying the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso We have previously determined that the zzso factor, upstream zzso factor 2 zzso can activate the zzso gene through an zzso element in the core zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso interacts functionally with zzso proteins to zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso element by zzso The zzso relevance of this interaction was shown in zzso by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso that lacked zzso sites, inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso could reverse the zzso effect of zzso zzso our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso element is zzso by zzso
