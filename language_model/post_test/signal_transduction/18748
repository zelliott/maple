We have developed small zzso zzso of gamma zzso zzso based not on the classical model of zzso initiated signaling by zzso interaction, but rather on direct zzso signaling by zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso are transported to the nucleus of cells as a complex where zzso provides a classical zzso nuclear zzso sequence zzso for such zzso The C zzso of zzso represented here by the mouse zzso zzso zzso was capable of also forming a complex with zzso and zzso when introduced zzso and provided the zzso signaling for nuclear zzso zzso mouse zzso and human zzso zzso both induced an zzso state and zzso of zzso class II molecules in cells similar to that of full length zzso Both zzso and its zzso zzso bind to an zzso site, zzso on the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso This binding plays a role in zzso zzso events, zzso by zzso and zzso zzso that result in the zzso and binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso Important structural requirements for zzso zzso activity are a zzso zzso and an alpha zzso in the zzso Finally, zzso zzso and reporter gene studies of zzso and zzso zzso treated cells indicate that they, along with zzso and zzso bind to the zzso element of zzso activated genes and participate in zzso zzso It is important to note that zzso zzso events played the key role in development of zzso zzso
