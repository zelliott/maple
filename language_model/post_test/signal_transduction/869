In zzso diseases, the mechanisms of how zzso zzso zzso cells are affected in the zzso area remain to be zzso To investigate one aspect of the mechanisms, we focused on the role of zzso C in regulating the migratory mobility of the zzso cells via zzso By zzso zzso zzso we found zzso C expression to be increased in zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso C inhibited the migration of zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso accumulated at focal zzso in these zzso These changes were associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prevented the migration of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso of the zzso signal is responsible for impaired migration of zzso caused by zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso C is involved in the impaired mobility of zzso zzso cells through increased amounts of zzso complex as well as the prevention of zzso zzso
