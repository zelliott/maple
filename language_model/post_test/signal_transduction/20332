The zzso zzso zzso signaling and the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling are implicated in lung cancer zzso Here, we sought to investigate whether zzso regulated the zzso signaling in zzso cell lung cancer zzso and the underlying zzso We examined and analyzed the correlation of the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analysis of tissue specimens from 162 zzso patients and 38 patients with benign pulmonary zzso showed that zzso zzso IGF-1, and zzso were zzso while zzso was not expressed in zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was positively correlated with that of zzso IGF-1, and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P values are equal to zzso while zzso expression was positively associated with that of IGF-1 and zzso zzso zzso respectively, P values are equal to zzso Additionally, zzso IGF-1, and zzso but not zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso cells treated with zzso showed significantly higher IGF-1 and zzso levels than those receiving the combination treatment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or controls zzso values are equal to zzso The zzso zzso further revealed that zzso and IGF-1 zzso promoted zzso cell zzso Together, our study provides the first direct evidence for an interaction between zzso and zzso in lung zzso We showed that zzso zzso the zzso signaling through zzso in lung cancer zzso and zzso zzso These findings shed further light on the mechanisms zzso zzso promotes lung cancer and highlight the zzso and zzso signaling pathways as promising targets for zzso therapy for lung zzso
