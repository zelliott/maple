Cell survival is maintained by growth factors and critically depends on sufficient energy zzso New evidence suggests that a rise in cellular energy production is not merely a zzso response to increased demand but subject to regulation by zzso zzso The mechanisms operating in this control are largely zzso Work on transformed cells identified direct targeting of zzso zzso by signaling proteins as one zzso But zzso zzso zzso and zzso may also be subject to regulation by growth and survival zzso Both, positive and negative regulators of cell survival impinge on the processes of cellular energy production to regulate growth and survival versus zzso
