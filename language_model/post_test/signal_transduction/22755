Upon liver injury, zzso zzso cells zzso show increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso control different functions in a zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso with zzso growth factor zzso and after induction of liver injury in zzso zzso were isolated from normal human liver zzso cultured on zzso and used in their zzso zzso In in zzso experiments, zzso were isolated from normal rats or at different time points after a single zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with complete zzso of zzso proliferation and with a 57% reduction in zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso binding of the zzso complex and of zzso to the related regulatory elements was zzso The zzso of the DNA binding activity of zzso was zzso by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso was also reduced, but not zzso by treatment with zzso In zzso isolated from zzso rats, zzso activity increased as early as 6 hours following liver damage, and declined zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso zzso regulates proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Acute liver damage in zzso leads to zzso of zzso in zzso
