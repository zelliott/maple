The zzso tumor zzso locus is widely zzso in cancer but little is known about the tumor biology of its two products, zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and zzso promoters are zzso in a significant fraction of human colon zzso zzso a functional zzso We have demonstrated previously that zzso colon tumors display increased growth and zzso in zzso mice carrying the zzso (multiple zzso zzso zzso We present here an analysis in a mixed genetic background of zzso colon tumors zzso in mice with or without selective deficiencies in zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not significantly alter tumor zzso In contrast, tumors in mice lacking zzso were moderately larger and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that these tumors contained significantly more pockets of necrosis zzso a marker of zzso in zzso less zzso zzso and higher red blood cell density zzso zzso within zzso zzso analyses demonstrated increased levels of vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human colon tumor cells in zzso inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso colon tumor zzso in part through zzso zzso zzso
