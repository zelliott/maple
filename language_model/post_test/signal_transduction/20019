During construction of several gene deletion zzso in zzso zzso zzso which involved a zzso zzso incubation step, additional spontaneous zzso were observed which resulted in stable heat resistance and in some cases zzso zzso zzso sequencing of one strain which was both heat resistant and salt zzso followed by zzso and sequencing of four other zzso which shared these zzso revealed independent zzso in zzso in all zzso This gene encodes a zzso stress signaling protein of the zzso family, members of which exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were predicted to lead to single zzso acid zzso or protein zzso An independent zzso zzso zzso created using a suicide zzso also displayed heat resistance and salt hypersensitivity zzso which could be restored to zzso levels following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed improved growth in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso incubation of a zzso industrial zzso zzso strain also resulted in spontaneous zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that this is not a zzso phenomenon and that it is independent of a zzso integration zzso zzso of milk by the zzso strain was inhibited by lower salt zzso than the parent zzso This study demonstrates that spontaneous zzso can occur during zzso growth of zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso leads to temperature resistance and salt zzso
