zzso dysfunction contributes to the zzso of zzso diabetes, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates zzso zzso and function as well as fatty acid zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso zzso stress may be one of the mechanisms linking zzso dysfunction and these zzso Here we investigate whether zzso zzso affects the zzso stress response induced by specific nutritional and pharmacological challenges in the zzso By using flow zzso western zzso real time zzso and several pharmacological and nutritional interventions in zzso knock out and zzso mice, we confirmed that zzso coordinates zzso function in brain and reported for the first time that a) zzso of zzso is associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso associated with increased zzso zzso protein levels in zzso and zzso of animals fed zzso zzso and b) in animals fed chronically with high fat diet zzso or high protein diet zzso we observed a failure to appropriately induce zzso stress response in the absence of zzso associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso This contrasted with the appropriate zzso of zzso stress response observed in wild type zzso Additionally, inefficient in zzso induction of zzso stress by zzso seems result in zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is required for a zzso zzso response to nutritional stress imposed by zzso and zzso diets and that genetic zzso of zzso might increase the zzso to zzso damage and cell zzso
