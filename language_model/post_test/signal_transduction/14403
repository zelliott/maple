zzso is a zzso that zzso zzso and synaptic function, with vulnerability extending into zzso We assessed the zzso of effects in rats on zzso of neural cell number and size, and on zzso and zzso zzso systems, conducting assessments at 6 months of age, after prenatal nicotine exposure, adolescent exposure, or sequential exposure in both zzso For prenatal zzso zzso of cell number and size showed few abnormalities by 6 months, but there were persistent deficits in zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso a pattern consistent with zzso zzso these effects were more prominent in males than zzso The expression of zzso receptors also showed permanent effects in zzso with suppression of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, cell signaling through zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of neurotransmitter zzso zzso exposure in adolescence produced lasting effects that were similar to those of prenatal zzso However, when animals were exposed to prenatal nicotine and received nicotine subsequently in adolescence, the adverse effects then extended to zzso whereas the net effect in males was similar to that of prenatal nicotine by zzso Our results indicate that prenatal or adolescent nicotine exposure evoke permanent changes in synaptic function that transcend the recovery of zzso zzso of structural zzso further, prenatal exposure zzso females to the subsequent adverse effects of adolescent zzso thus creating a population that may be especially vulnerable to the lasting behavioral consequences of nicotine intake in zzso
