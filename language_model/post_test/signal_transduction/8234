One mechanism zzso structures use for controlling cell number zzso zzso involves the zzso and sensing of a factor, such as zzso zzso or myostatin zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso factors for sensing cell density prior to zzso and zzso development zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso which enables starving cells to respond to zzso zzso zzso Its actions are zzso by two zzso zzso activates a G zzso signaling zzso regulating gene expression zzso An unknown zzso zzso activates zzso C zzso which regulates the lifetime of zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso an unusual zzso zzso that is fused to a zzso zzso zzso domain and that zzso in zzso of a late zzso zzso Loss of zzso resulted in formation of persistent loose zzso and altered expression of zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be rescued by full-length zzso and the zzso domain zzso The zzso zzso domain is zzso for the zzso role of zzso zzso cells zzso and bind zzso but are unable to induce downstream zzso zzso of zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso of the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso actions are zzso by zzso
