Majority of the promoter elements of zzso do not function well in other zzso systems and analysis of their sequences has established the presence of only single zzso sequence located at the zzso zzso Additional sequences for the appropriate functioning of these promoters have been proposed but not zzso probably due to the absence of sufficient number of strong zzso zzso In the current study, we have isolated functional zzso sequences of zzso from the pool of random DNA zzso Based on the promoter activity in zzso zzso and score assigned by neural network promoter prediction program, we selected one of these promoter zzso namely zzso for characterization in order to understand the structure of zzso promoters of zzso zzso complexes were subjected to zzso I zzso and subsequent zzso Our results demonstrate that in addition to zzso zzso DNA sequence at zzso site can also influence the activity of zzso promoters by modulating the promoter recognition by zzso zzso and subsequent formation of open zzso We also provide evidence that despite exhibiting similarities in zzso and zzso zzso promoter regions of zzso and zzso coli differ from each other due to differences in their requirement of zzso sequences between the two zzso
