The present study investigated the effect of zzso acid on the zzso acid zzso zzso presumably zzso receptors formed of zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso acid (10 zzso zzso currents through receptors expressing zzso and 3 zzso to zzso of zzso level during initial 20 zzso following application, being still evident at zzso zzso of the drug, while it never or little enhanced currents through receptors expressing zzso and 2 zzso or zzso 2, and 3 zzso zzso 30 zzso after zzso The effect of zzso acid on zzso currents was not observed in zzso zzso solution, and the zzso was blocked by either zzso a selective zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso or zzso an active zzso inhibitor zzso when zzso with the zzso In contrast, the protein synthesis zzso zzso the selective inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the selective zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the inactive zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the zzso In the zzso of zzso calcium zzso zzso influx in response to zzso zzso was greatest with receptors formed in zzso expressing zzso The results of the present study indicate that zzso acid zzso a long-lasting zzso of zzso zzso possibly as a result of the interaction with a zzso zzso
