zzso of the zzso feedback loop is critical for zzso zzso in response to cellular zzso The zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso can block this loop by zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation in response to zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso but not zzso and zzso leads to a drastic zzso of zzso and native zzso This effect is dependent on the zzso zzso activity of zzso but not zzso and requires the central zzso binding domain zzso zzso of zzso We further show that zzso inhibited 26 S zzso degradation of zzso zzso in zzso and consistently prolonged the zzso of zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso unlike zzso and zzso zzso regulates the levels of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the turnover and activity of zzso through a zzso zzso
