Plant growth and development are coordinated by several groups of zzso hormones, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular studies have suggested the existence of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We report that zzso a key zzso factor activated by zzso zzso interacts in zzso and in zzso with zzso OF zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso regulators that zzso the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses of plants with zzso in the genes zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso suppressed root and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of proteins of the zzso family reduced the abundance and zzso activity of zzso zzso gene analyses further indicated that zzso and zzso antagonize each other's zzso zzso Our data indicated that zzso and zzso served as positive and negative regulators, respectively, of both the zzso and the zzso signaling pathways and establish zzso as zzso of signaling zzso between zzso and zzso in controlling cell zzso and regulation of plant zzso
