Evidence is emerging that zzso zzso alpha zzso is central to the rapid zzso of zzso signaling to the downstream zzso zzso however, the mechanisms underlying this zzso function are not fully zzso Here we report a paradigm of zzso regulation through zzso zzso by zzso which zzso zzso zzso 260 within the zzso zzso zzso This zzso event is required for zzso the zzso function of the zzso by triggering its interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, we find that the focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in the migration process, is also recruited in this zzso Our data indicate that the zzso of zzso is a zzso process occurring in the zzso of normal and zzso zzso breast cells and that zzso is zzso in a subset of breast zzso
