The T cell repertoire is shaped by positive and negative selection of zzso zzso signals that determine these selection processes are only partly zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be important for signal zzso through the zzso but there has been disagreement about whether zzso is a positive or negative regulator of zzso zzso Using zzso mice expressing transgenic zzso we show that in the absence of zzso there is a large increase in the thresholds of zzso stimulation required for both positive and negative zzso Our results zzso demonstrate that in zzso zzso zzso is a positive regulator of the zzso signals that drive zzso selection zzso
