zzso uses a type III zzso system zzso to deliver six zzso proteins into host zzso These six proteins harbor distinct activities that are zzso of host functions but often have acquired unique zzso zzso The host targets for these zzso appear to be limited to a few key signaling components such as G proteins and zzso whereas their models of action are diverse and zzso The functions of these zzso are to zzso the host immune defense response, including zzso of the zzso structure, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso production, and induction of zzso These zzso also interfere with communications between the innate and the zzso immune response, thus aiding the establishment of a systemic zzso
