Although zzso and clinical studies on zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso agents, show promising results, further ways to improve and broaden the scope of application of this therapeutic approach are zzso To this end, we have investigated the possibility of improving the response of zzso zzso breast cancer cells to zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso Human breast cancer cell lines with or without the expression of zzso and/or zzso were treated with zzso and zzso zzso as single agents and in zzso zzso zzso induced DNA damage zzso a zzso arrest and decrease in zzso paralleled by the induction of zzso zzso zzso alone caused a zzso arrest and decreased cell zzso Most importantly, sequential combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to significantly decrease growth compared to zzso zzso zzso Global zzso profiling revealed that this decrease in growth was associated with zzso of zzso zzso and the induction of zzso Taken together, these results suggest an improved treatment strategy for zzso and possibly also zzso breast zzso with similar molecular zzso
