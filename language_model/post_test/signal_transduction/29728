zzso is a major risk factor for the development of heart zzso zzso it is now appreciated that a change in the number of zzso is one of multiple structural and functional zzso zzso leading to heart zzso Here we investigate the effect of zzso the product of the obese zzso zzso on proliferation of human and zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso and zzso significant increase in proliferation of zzso cells that was inhibited by zzso with zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso proliferation via zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso We confirmed that zzso activates both zzso zzso zzso zzso and association of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We also examined zzso incorporation as a measure of new DNA synthesis and demonstrated a zzso effect of zzso in both zzso cells and human zzso zzso incorporation in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso and zzso Our results establish a zzso effect of zzso in zzso and provide additional evidence for a potential direct link between zzso and cardiac zzso in zzso
