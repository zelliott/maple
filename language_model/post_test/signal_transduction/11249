A18 zzso transgenic zzso which are zzso restricted and normally selected into the zzso zzso are exclusively selected into the zzso lineage in an zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell selection in the zzso background is far more efficient than default selection of A18 zzso cells on a zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests the involvement of special selecting zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for A18 with zzso properties for the A18 zzso have previously been shown to effect a lineage diversion from zzso to zzso in fetal zzso organ cultures and zzso the zzso background contains unidentified natural zzso class II zzso which similarly show zzso properties for the A18 zzso Despite the presence of these unidentified zzso class II zzso in the zzso background and their potential influence on developing A18 zzso however, zzso class I molecules were essential for zzso selection of A18 zzso T zzso
