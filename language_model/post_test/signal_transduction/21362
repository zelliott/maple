zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling is correlated with breast and other zzso Our goal was to identify compounds that block zzso signaling as a first step toward investigating new strategies for suppression of invasive and other breast zzso In a limited zzso screen, zzso zzso zzso the major zzso in green tea, emerged as an intriguing zzso zzso studies have associated green tea consumption with reduced recurrence of invasive and other breast zzso zzso signaling was inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner in breast cancer zzso The apparent mechanism targeted the zzso zzso zzso which we had previously characterized as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso zzso levels through an increase in zzso zzso stability, but not zzso zzso To test zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso lines had reduced sensitivity to zzso in the suppression of zzso signaling and of a target gene zzso Because our ongoing studies clinically link zzso of zzso with invasive breast cancer, we tested if zzso also regulated biological functions associated with zzso zzso signaling and with invasive breast zzso zzso reduced both breast cancer cell zzso proliferation and zzso in an zzso zzso Together, the emerging mechanism is that zzso blocks zzso signaling by inducing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso aspects of invasive breast zzso These studies provide a framework for considering future studies in breast cancer treatment and zzso
