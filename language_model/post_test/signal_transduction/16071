The presence of zzso in tumors is associated with compromised zzso immune responses and has a clear negative impact on survival of cancer zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is considered as a promising cancer zzso zzso We have reported previously that zzso leaf zzso zzso prophylaxis restricts tumor growth in mice by immune zzso In zzso here, involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso in association with tumor growth restriction is zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso of zzso along with its zzso zzso restricts zzso migration at the tumor zzso zzso is not zzso to zzso but significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso It also reverses the functional impairment of zzso cells by zzso in terms of zzso zzso cellular proliferation and tumor cell zzso zzso also zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso by increasing zzso and zzso but decreasing zzso zzso zzso and zzso creating an zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso needed for successful zzso function, is also inhibited by zzso 

All of these coordinated events might result in zzso of zzso zzso growth and therefore increased zzso of mice having zzso treatment before zzso after tumor zzso Thus, the possibility of zzso being an excellent tool as a zzso zzso breaker by zzso the zzso functions of zzso in cancer needs to be explored further in the zzso
