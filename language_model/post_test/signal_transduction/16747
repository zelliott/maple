zzso exerts biological effects on a variety of cells, including zzso zzso has been reported to be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso In this study, we have identified an zzso element located at zzso which appears to regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso We also confirmed that the zzso factor binds to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso pathways and expression of dominant negative zzso or zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our findings indicate that zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by zzso and zzso through zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso
