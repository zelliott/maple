zzso zzso zzso is one of the most frequent inherited zzso diseases in man and is characterized by an almost complete arrest of B cell differentiation at the zzso cell zzso The gene defective in zzso encodes the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Next to the zzso strain of mice, carrying a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso zzso which results in the zzso zzso zzso zzso additional mouse models have been developed to study the role of zzso in zzso This review discusses the analyses of zzso zzso obtained by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, and transgenic mice that express zzso or zzso forms of the zzso zzso These studies provided information on the function of zzso at several important checkpoints throughout B cell zzso zzso of the mouse models indicated that zzso is not essential for zzso cell zzso signaling in the zzso By contrast, zzso B cell zzso signaling appears to be required for the survival of immature B cells in the bone zzso that have performed a successful zzso zzso L chain locus zzso resulting in the expression of a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso is also shown to be involved in signaling pathways that govern the development of peripheral B cells, including zzso entry, zzso maturation and plasma cell zzso
