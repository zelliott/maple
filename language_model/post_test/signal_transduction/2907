zzso leaf movement zzso zzso is adopted by several plant species including zzso zzso as a mechanism to escape adverse growth zzso Among the signals that trigger zzso growth are, the gaseous hormone zzso low light zzso and zzso temperatures zzso Recent studies indicated that the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and salicylic acid zzso zzso by the plant upon zzso infestation repress low zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth response induced by high temperature zzso treatment and upon application of the gaseous hormone zzso is highly similar to the response induced by low zzso To test if these environmental signals induce zzso growth via parallel pathways or zzso zzso we studied here the roles of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso For this, we used a zzso camera zzso Our study includes pharmacological application of zzso and zzso and biological infestation using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso lacking zzso or zzso zzso zzso The data demonstrate that zzso is a positive, and zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso growth and that both hormones repress the response to zzso Taking previous studies into account, we conclude that zzso is the first among many tested components which is zzso zzso growth under all tested zzso environmental zzso However, since zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso growth and is zzso low zzso and zzso leaf movement, we conclude that zzso hormones control zzso growth by affecting zzso zzso zzso
