Most loss of function zzso of zzso identified in different forms of zzso disrupt not only the zzso G protein zzso zzso but also its zzso expressed zzso zzso However, the possibility that zzso zzso contributes to disease zzso has remained zzso We therefore examined the signaling property of human zzso and the effects of one novel zzso or zzso and two previously described zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected human zzso zzso at the plasma membrane of zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso human zzso was similar to that in cells zzso expressing zzso zzso Human zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso type 1 and either of these zzso Moreover, zzso of human zzso or zzso markedly enhanced the zzso zzso zzso in zzso kidney cells that zzso express zzso zzso type zzso In contrast, each zzso zzso failed to mediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a reduced zzso toxin response over the zzso level compared with zzso zzso and zzso completely failed to respond to zzso zzso These findings were comparable to those observed with each corresponding zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso Thus, zzso that typically zzso zzso also impair zzso activity, consistent with a possible role for zzso zzso in diseases caused by paternal zzso zzso
