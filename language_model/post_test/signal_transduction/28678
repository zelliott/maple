zzso growth factor zzso has been associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso promotes zzso gene zzso by zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso also plays a role in zzso collagen I zzso zzso stimulates the activity of zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso starting at 1 zzso zzso a zzso downstream of zzso is zzso and concentrates in the membrane fraction within 5 zzso of zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso decreases zzso zzso and zzso collagen zzso zzso Similarly, zzso or an zzso dominant negative construct blocks zzso induction of zzso promoter zzso However, zzso stimulation alone is not sufficient to increase collagen I zzso since neither a zzso active zzso zzso construct nor zzso which zzso zzso zzso is able to stimulate zzso promoter activity or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso promoter activity by zzso In a zzso zzso system, blockade of the zzso zzso significantly decreases zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso in which the three zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso This induction is blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso activity independently of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso total zzso zzso of zzso is decreased by zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso at zzso zzso other than the direct zzso zzso I target zzso Thus, although the zzso zzso alone is insufficient to stimulate zzso gene transcription, its zzso by zzso enhances zzso zzso activity leading to increased collagen I expression in human zzso zzso This zzso between the zzso and zzso pathways likely contributes to zzso induction of zzso zzso
