zzso zzso mediates destruction of zzso zzso in diverse inflammatory diseases including arthritis, zzso and pulmonary zzso by zzso zzso cells that interact with zzso proteins through zzso zzso In zzso zzso signaling is modulated by focal zzso zzso protein complexes that are enriched with zzso zzso and zzso We assessed the importance of zzso zzso in regulating zzso interactions and zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso enhanced the maturation of focal zzso as defined by zzso and enrichment with zzso and zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso and recruitment of zzso to focal zzso Treatment with the potent zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in the absence of zzso zzso many of these responses indicating the importance of zzso zzso zzso of collagen zzso complexes revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was also enriched in focal zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or by zzso zzso markedly altered zzso zzso zzso and maturation of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso promoted focal zzso zzso Association of zzso with zzso in focal zzso correlated temporally with zzso of zzso and was zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso maturation of focal zzso is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso at zzso leading to recruitment of zzso a process that may influence the downstream zzso of zzso
