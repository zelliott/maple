zzso is a B zzso zzso involved in cell zzso and zzso Since zzso is likely to play an important role in interactions between B cells and other cells, and in regulating signaling zzso we characterized the expression of zzso zzso during different stages of B cell zzso In contrast to previous reports, we show that zzso is expressed on B cell zzso prior to expression of zzso zzso B cell precursors from the fetal liver and early B lineage cells zzso from the bone zzso both express a low density of surface zzso The majority of the earliest B cell zzso zzso in the bone zzso however, do not express zzso As B cells mature, the density of zzso molecules on the cell surface zzso zzso bone zzso cells express high levels of zzso as do zzso B zzso The correlation of zzso levels with B cell maturation is zzso in an in zzso culture system, which zzso stages of B cell development based on zzso Following zzso of mature resting zzso B cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso Finally, we show that the addition of zzso zzso zzso the zzso response of both zzso and zzso B cells, suggesting a role for zzso in diverse signaling zzso
