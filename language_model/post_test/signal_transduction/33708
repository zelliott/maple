The great diversity of the expression sites and proposed function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is paralleled by a diversity of its zzso zzso many of which have still remained zzso We have used different approaches to discover novel zzso By means of a zzso approach, we have detected several distinct zzso changes in zzso as well as zzso zzso states of zzso protein in zzso zzso The most prominent change involved zzso of a zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso acid zzso analysis, this zzso was shown to zzso to zzso translation factor zzso This protein is a key regulator of protein synthesis and zzso upon zzso the zzso step of zzso chain zzso These findings define a novel mechanism by which zzso assumes a so far zzso zzso zzso We next zzso the zzso zzso zzso We found that this effect is not zzso by any of the known pathways known to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but by protein zzso zzso zzso with this idea, we also found that direct stimulation of protein zzso C with a zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we discovered by Western zzso that zzso induced zzso of a higher molecular weight zzso zzso We were able to show that this band corresponded to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is part of a distinct zzso cascade and promotes expression of the zzso light chain gene and plays an obligatory role in muscle cell development and zzso The role of zzso in zzso has remained zzso but it is likely to represent an important novel zzso zzso zzso effects on smooth muscle zzso Further zzso of these novel zzso pathways will have significant relevance for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso
