In zzso zzso the cell surface zzso zzso was shown to be critical for invasive growth and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso gene is controlled by the interplay of a multitude of regulators, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso plays an essential role in this regulatory process and that it functions at the convergence of at least two zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso cascade and the zzso zzso Despite this central role in the control of zzso growth and starch zzso the exact molecular function of zzso is zzso We subjected zzso to a detailed molecular analysis and report here on its role in zzso regulation, as well as on the identification of specific zzso required to zzso zzso zzso in response to nutritional zzso We show that zzso contains two independent zzso zzso one of which is a highly zzso sequence that is found in several proteins with unidentified function in zzso and zzso zzso We also identify zzso zzso acids that are required for the zzso zzso
