The zzso zzso is a potent regulator of plant zzso Since its discovery in the beginning of the zzso century many aspects of zzso biology have been extensively zzso ranging from zzso and metabolism to the zzso of molecular components of downstream zzso With the identification of the zzso protein zzso as an zzso zzso a major breakthrough in understanding zzso signaling has been achieved and recent modeling approaches have shed light on the putative mechanisms underlying the establishment of zzso zzso and zzso essential for many zzso zzso Here, we review these and other recent advances in unraveling the entanglement of zzso polar transport and cellular signaling events that allow small zzso molecules to facilitate their complex regulatory zzso
