To zzso the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso in minute zzso zzso on the basis of the previously reported role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a negative zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were constructed from 42 consecutive radical zzso specimens with minute zzso zzso Standard zzso analysis for zzso zzso members zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso For all zzso zzso expression score was calculated as the sum of intensity zzso extent of zzso In addition, for zzso presence of zzso zzso expression zzso focal absence of zzso was also zzso zzso status of all zzso was compared between tumor and paired benign zzso zzso among markers was also zzso 

zzso expression was seen in all 36 zzso minute zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 32 of 36 tumors zzso zzso expression levels were higher in tumors compared with paired benign tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso was present in all 34 zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in cancer compared with normal tissue zzso zzso Only a minority of tumors demonstrating higher zzso expression and zzso (2 of 32 and 2 of 34, zzso had associated zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found evidence of zzso of zzso zzso in minute zzso zzso that appears to be unrelated to zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter finding suggests an alternative signaling mechanism controlling zzso zzso in minute prostate zzso
