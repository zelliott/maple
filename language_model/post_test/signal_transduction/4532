zzso is a G zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and mediates many zzso zzso zzso signaling also has been shown to regulate T cell zzso but its sites and mechanism of action in this process remain zzso In this study, we created a zzso zzso mouse and used zzso as a surrogate marker to examine zzso zzso zzso was knocked into the zzso region of zzso by gene zzso We show that zzso is expressed highly on zzso cells in the blood, zzso and bone zzso and moderately on zzso circulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso is detected on resting or activated T zzso or on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cultured bone zzso zzso cells expressed zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso prevented cell surface but not zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is unlikely to play an intrinsic role on zzso T cells and primary zzso zzso Instead, its effect on T cell immunity in zzso may involve zzso or other zzso zzso Further, our data reveal a surprising role for the zzso region of zzso zzso in regulating zzso protein targeting to the plasma zzso
