In rat zzso zzso a zzso active G zzso causes cellular injury and zzso However, stimulation of the zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso for 48 h causes little cellular injury and zzso zzso of the G beta zzso zzso beta zzso increases the zzso cardiac injury, indicating that G beta gamma released from zzso zzso the G zzso cellular zzso zzso with zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso is significantly blunted by beta zzso zzso of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso increases the cellular injury induced by zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso does not affect the zzso cardiac zzso These results suggest that G beta gamma released from zzso upon zzso zzso stimulation activates zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso but not zzso plays an important role in the protection against the G zzso cellular injury and zzso
