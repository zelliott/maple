The signaling mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso mediates suppression of zzso zzso synthesis remains largely zzso zzso zzso mice have demonstrated that zzso plays a critical role in the suppression of zzso zzso release, although the mechanism by which zzso mediates this zzso is still not zzso Using an zzso system, we have expressed a dominant negative zzso zzso in human zzso to broaden the investigation to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso signaling and gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso of zzso signaling 3, tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recently identified zzso zzso T cell protein zzso zzso and signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso of zzso class II and zzso zzso In agreement with the studies in zzso mice, zzso of the zzso zzso completely reversed the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, real-time zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso expression did not affect immediate suppression of zzso zzso but did reverse the suppression observed at later time points, suggesting a zzso regulation of zzso zzso levels by zzso In conclusion, although zzso does appear to be the dominant zzso of the majority of zzso functions, there are elements of its zzso activity that are zzso zzso
