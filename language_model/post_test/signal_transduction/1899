The role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso of spontaneously zzso rats zzso was zzso The protein expressions of zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and the level of zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso in cardiac zzso from zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso zzso control zzso rats zzso were examined by Western zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso and the ratio of left zzso weight to body weight were unchanged in zzso zzso while they were increased significantly in zzso zzso as compared with those of zzso zzso There were no differences in zzso beta zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso 1/2 between zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso was significantly increased by zzso zzso as compared with that of zzso zzso Although the expression of zzso 1/2, the downstream signal zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, was zzso the level of zzso 1/2, the active form of zzso 1/2, was increased by zzso zzso in zzso zzso To further zzso the effect of zzso beta zzso on zzso growth and the relation between zzso beta zzso and zzso 1/2 activity, zzso zzso incorporation zzso and zzso analysis of zzso 1/2 were performed after cultured zzso rat zzso were zzso with zzso It was shown that zzso zzso incorporation and zzso 1/2 level were significantly increased after zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso beta zzso may play an important role in the zzso zzso of spontaneously zzso zzso
