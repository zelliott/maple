In healthy bones, zzso has to be tightly controlled to avoid pathological zzso In this study, we investigated interactions between zzso D3 zzso and zzso A in the regulation of zzso induced zzso In human zzso cultures, we demonstrated that besides stimulation of zzso zzso also induced zzso A, a strong inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso the natural zzso of zzso A, was zzso zzso This resulted in an increase in zzso A activity during zzso zzso We also showed that in zzso zzso zzso can be further increased when zzso A activity was zzso by adding zzso zzso This observation implies that, besides stimulation of zzso zzso also controls zzso zzso zzso of zzso Besides zzso A, zzso also zzso zzso zzso another inhibitor of zzso zzso which has been shown to zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso between these two systems became evident from the synergistic increase in zzso expression upon blocking zzso activity in zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that zzso stimulation of zzso by human zzso is suppressed by zzso induction of zzso of zzso zzso induction by zzso may actually be controlled via interplay with zzso A and zzso Finally, this complex regulation of zzso zzso the significance of tight control of zzso to prevent excessive zzso and consequently reduction in bone quality and zzso
