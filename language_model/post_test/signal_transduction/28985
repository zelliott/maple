zzso of gene expression in zzso is an important tool for studying zzso cell zzso We constructed transgenic mice in which zzso zzso was placed under the control of regulatory elements from the zzso zzso factor zzso gene using bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso artificial zzso that contained either 50 or 108 zzso DNA zzso to the zzso zzso zzso start site gave rise to transgenic lines in which zzso is expressed specifically in cells of the zzso zzso as judged by zzso of the zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso is first zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and completely marks all zzso components of the skin in zzso zzso To test the utility of the zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso of the protein zzso A alpha zzso zzso zzso modified such that zzso zzso activates zzso zzso On an zzso background, animals carrying both the zzso zzso and the targeted zzso zzso zzso exhibited a darker coat color than control zzso due to a shift from zzso to zzso zzso Our results confirm that zzso signaling is a key component of zzso zzso and provide a new tool for studying zzso cell zzso
