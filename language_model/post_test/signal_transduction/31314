The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of molecular oxygen to form zzso zzso While classically linked to the respiratory burst in zzso recent evidence now shows that zzso (and associated zzso oxygen species, zzso generated by zzso zzso in zzso cells serves myriad functions in health and zzso An entire new family of zzso zzso zzso zzso has emerged, which vary widely in cell and tissue distribution, as well as in function and zzso A major concept in zzso signaling is that while zzso zzso zzso are necessary for normal cellular function, excessive zzso stress can contribute to pathological zzso This certainly is true in the central nervous system zzso where normal zzso zzso function appears to be required for processes such as zzso zzso memory, and central cardiovascular zzso but overproduction of zzso contributes to zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso Despite implications of zzso zzso in normal and pathological zzso zzso still relatively little is known about the mechanisms zzso This paper summarizes the evidence for zzso zzso distribution, regulation, and function in the zzso emphasizing the diversity of zzso zzso and their new and emerging role in zzso zzso In addition, perspectives for future research and novel therapeutic targets are zzso
