We report that zzso causes a zzso of B cells and modestly increases B cell life zzso zzso injection of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases in both zzso cell number and the percentage of zzso B zzso These effects are observed within 1 day of zzso administration and plateau after approximately 3 days if zzso treatment is zzso The increase in zzso B cell number is zzso dose dependent, zzso T cell independent, zzso independent, and zzso zzso zzso in the number of B cells in the blood and the percentage of mature B cells in the bone zzso zzso with the increase in zzso B cell number, suggest that zzso of circulating B cells to the zzso is partially responsible for zzso induction of zzso B cell zzso zzso reduction in the effect of 5 days of zzso treatment on zzso B cell number when B zzso is blocked with zzso zzso suggests that generation of new B cells is also involved in zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso labeling experiments demonstrate that zzso modestly zzso the life span of newly generated zzso B cells, and experiments that measure B cell zzso zzso expression as an indicator of B cell age suggest that zzso may also prolong the life span of mature zzso B zzso Thus, zzso increases zzso B cell number through two zzso zzso increased net migration of circulating B cells to the zzso and increased B cell life zzso Both effects may promote zzso responses to a systemic zzso zzso
