zzso and zzso visual impairment and vascular zzso are increasing as causes of vision zzso The detailed mechanisms of how obesity and diabetes affect eye health are still largely unknown, but animal models have been useful in exploring the effects of potential protective compounds, zzso compounds characterized by zzso and zzso zzso These properties occur in zzso and zzso zzso wild zzso zzso zzso are a major source of dietary zzso in zzso zzso The main aim of the present work was to study the protective effects of dietary zzso zzso on the level of gene expression in zzso in mice that develop obesity when fed a high-fat diet zzso 

Mice zzso per group, four zzso were fed ad zzso a normal control diet zzso a zzso or a diet with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 12 zzso Food consumption, weight gain, and blood pressure were measured during the feeding period and whole blood serum markers of obesity at zzso zzso were collected, and zzso extracted from all 24 mice and pooled samples from four mice per group were zzso to zzso V2 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for genes and transcript zzso The expression profiles in the zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso and DAVID to screen for high zzso changes as well as for zzso changes in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso groups gained weight from week 5 and final weight, blood zzso serum free fatty zzso and zzso blood pressure as compared to mice fed the control diets zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on these parameters other than a trend to reduce zzso blood pressure in the zzso mice zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso enrichment analysis of 810 zzso expressed genes zzso zzso in the zzso displayed differential regulation of genes in zzso groups, mainly pathways for zzso zzso and zzso stress, especially systemic lupus zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Mice fed a zzso had increased retinal gene expression of several zzso while the zzso mice showed potential zzso of these zzso when compared to the zzso zzso zzso also reduced the expression of genes in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and increased those in the zzso metabolism zzso 

zzso feeding zzso differential expression of several stress-related genes in the mouse zzso Despite minor effects in the zzso a diet rich in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso otherwise induced by zzso Thus, the early stages of zzso and stress-related gene expression changes in the zzso may be prevented with zzso in the zzso
