The elevated expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is necessary for the invasive zzso of several types of zzso is controlled by growth factors such as zzso growth factor, transforming growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor which bind to and activate protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Since these activated receptors communicate with the nucleus via a signaling zzso in which zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso we determined the effect of a specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on zzso expression in two zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso and zzso characterized as avid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of either cell line reduced the amount of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, a compound zzso chemically unrelated to zzso zzso had little effect on zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso and correlated with decreased zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso reduction in the in zzso zzso of zzso cells whereas it had little effect on proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso reporter driven by the zzso promoter indicated that diminished zzso of the zzso was largely a consequence of reduced promoter zzso These findings suggest that interfering with zzso may provide a novel means of controlling the zzso of tumors in which this signaling cascade is activated by zzso and/or zzso growth zzso
