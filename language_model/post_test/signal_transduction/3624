A significant proportion of multiple sclerosis zzso patients have functionally relevant zzso deficits, which significantly contribute to zzso Although clinical and experimental studies have been conducted to understand the zzso of zzso dysfunction in zzso no zzso and zzso studies have investigated potential zzso of synaptic connections of zzso zzso cells zzso For this reason we analyzed zzso PC zzso connectivity in mice with zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso a mouse model of zzso We observed a strong reduction in the frequency of the spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso recorded from PCs during the symptomatic phase of the disease, and in presence of prominent zzso zzso not only in the white matter zzso but also in the molecular layer zzso The massive zzso zzso on PCs from basket and zzso cells was reduced and associated to a decrease of the number of these zzso zzso On the contrary no significant loss of the PCs could be zzso zzso of zzso zzso was sufficient to mimic the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso We thus suggest that zzso and zzso zzso together with a zzso of basket and zzso cells and their synaptic zzso contribute to impair zzso transmission on PCs during zzso Our results support a growing body of evidence that zzso signaling is compromised in zzso and in zzso and show a selective zzso to zzso and synaptic zzso of zzso zzso zzso
