zzso zzso zzso 5 is zzso expressed in the brain and plays an essential role in central nervous system development and synaptic zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso specific zzso of zzso Here, we show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in selective zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso alone was sufficient to induce the zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso in a cellular zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells where zzso was zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The time course of induction coincided with that of zzso zzso When zzso activity was zzso either by zzso or zzso of dominant negative zzso there was a reduction of zzso zzso The results show that the zzso of zzso by zzso sustained zzso zzso at 3-6 zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso
