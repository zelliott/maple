The mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso release zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso at the zzso mossy zzso zzso are not well zzso We have observed a long-lasting zzso of zzso evoked zzso zzso currents zzso after a brief application of zzso zzso at zzso ranging from zzso to 10 zzso The zzso outlasted the change in holding current caused by the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that this action is not contingent on the opening of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso by zzso was prevented by G protein and protein zzso A zzso zzso and was enhanced after stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso We conclude that zzso present at mossy fiber terminals mediate the zzso of zzso release through a zzso mechanism that involves the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
