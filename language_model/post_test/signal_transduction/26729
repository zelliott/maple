The gene zzso zzso identified 12 years ago in genetic screens for zzso that control both cell division and cell migration during embryonic zzso development, is the founding member of the zzso zzso family of zzso proteins that have diverse roles in cell zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso proteins share three zzso zzso a divergent zzso region zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity, zzso a zzso site used to direct key target proteins to the zzso for degradation, and zzso a zzso site that binds and zzso zzso zzso zzso The notion that zzso act as scaffolding proteins to balance signaling levels in multiple pathways retains an attractive zzso but given recent data showing that divergent zzso act by means of novel zzso mechanisms, the zzso activity of zzso remains zzso Here, we focus on the role of zzso during zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso reveals zzso sometimes contradictory zzso In zzso multiple zzso zzso exhibit overlapping and zzso zzso Recent data indicate the mechanism of zzso activity is zzso and requires the zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the connections between zzso in disease and cancer that have implications for their normal roles during zzso
