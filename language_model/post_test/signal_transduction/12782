To investigate differences in growth hormone zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso we have examined the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso abundance in response to zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso rats a single injection of zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso 6 h after zzso Administration of zzso 30 zzso prior to zzso injection completely abolished this zzso In contrast, in zzso intact rats killed 6 h after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso abundance was not significantly different from zzso control rats although the serum zzso concentration was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso In immature rats, injection of zzso (1 zzso g body zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not block the zzso increase in zzso zzso but rather significantly enhanced the zzso zzso These data indicate that continuing protein synthesis is required for zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso rat but is not required for zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso rats protein synthesis is not required for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso
