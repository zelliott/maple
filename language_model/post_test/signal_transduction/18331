zzso has been implicated as an intermediate in the signal zzso of several zzso including tumor necrosis factor zzso Both zzso and zzso activate a wide variety of cellular responses, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whether zzso zzso these signals through the same mechanism as zzso is not zzso In the present study we investigated the role of the T zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cellular responses by comparing the responses of zzso T cells with zzso cells, zzso zzso T zzso Treatment with zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso reporter gene expression in a zzso manner in zzso cells but not in zzso cells, suggesting the critical role of zzso zzso These effects were specific to zzso as zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was minimally zzso zzso was also found to be required for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso activated the protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso and activated zzso and zzso oxygen zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso activated zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso but has minimal or no role in zzso of these responses by zzso
