Exercise capacity and skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise are reduced with advancing zzso This reduction in blood flow capacity may be related to increased zzso of skeletal muscle resistance vessels to zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that aging results in increased zzso responses of skeletal muscle resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso muscles of young (4 zzso and aged (24 zzso zzso rats were isolated, zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso in response to increases in zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and increases in zzso pressure zzso zzso were evaluated in the absence of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso were similar in both zzso and zzso muscle zzso from young and aged zzso In contrast, active zzso responses to changes in zzso pressure were diminished in zzso and zzso zzso from aged zzso To assess whether zzso in the mechanical properties of resistance zzso zzso altered zzso zzso passive diameter responses to pressure and mechanical zzso were zzso There was no effect of age on the structural behavior zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso from either the zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that aging does not result in a zzso decrease in zzso responsiveness of skeletal muscle zzso Rather, zzso adaptations of zzso of resistance zzso appear to be limited to mechanisms that are uniquely involved in the signaling of the zzso zzso
