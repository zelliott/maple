zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a pivotal role in tumor zzso zzso this zzso signaling zzso presents a promising alternative for the treatment of zzso However, recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested that zzso activity is zzso distributed throughout the tumor zzso To further evaluate this phenomenon, the regional differences in zzso signaling activities in zzso were studied using zzso zzso zzso in an experimental zzso brain tumor zzso Regional zzso was assessed using the small zzso inhibitor zzso which selectively zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were implanted into the zzso zzso chamber preparation of nude zzso The process of tumor zzso was repeatedly assessed over 22 zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor vascular density zzso Regional zzso evaluation indicated that the magnitude of this zzso effect was pronounced in the more zzso and better zzso zzso areas than in the zzso areas of the tumor zzso These results demonstrate regional differences in zzso activity in zzso that may have significant impact on the zzso of tumors to compounds that target zzso This finding should be considered in upcoming clinical trials targeting individual signal zzso systems in cancer zzso
