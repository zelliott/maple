zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso system, are enormously useful in predicting the functions of novel zzso zzso screens typically do not include all of the zzso and specificity tests used in small-scale studies, but the effects of omitting these steps have not been zzso We performed zzso screens that included all standard controls, using the predicted zzso proteins expressed from the human zzso class III region, a region of the zzso associated with many zzso zzso The 91 novel interactions identified provide insight into the potential functions of many zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, our results predict that 1/3 of the proteins may have a role in zzso processing, which suggests zzso of functionally related genes within the human zzso Most importantly, our analysis shows that omitting standard controls in zzso screens could significantly compromise data zzso
