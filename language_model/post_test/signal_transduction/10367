Upon infection of host cells, zzso zzso coli zzso delivers a set of zzso proteins into the host cell zzso via the type III zzso system zzso The zzso zzso various host cell zzso We found that zzso interferes with the spreading and ultimately with the attachment of suspended zzso or zzso cells, and we isolated zzso zzso zzso that failed to similarly affect host zzso In most zzso the zzso sites were mapped to genes zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other zzso contained insertions in zzso or upstream of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso upstream of zzso was associated with a reduction in zzso protein production and was studied zzso To determine whether the apparent repression was due to zzso expression of the downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso a positive regulator of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that upon zzso of the zzso zzso system, zzso (the response zzso activates both zzso and zzso expression and that zzso and zzso act zzso directly or indirectly zzso expression of the zzso zzso
