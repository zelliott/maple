zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso which have similar structural architecture as well as functional similarities, are expressed in the same brain zzso zzso It is intriguing that two zzso proteins with virtually the same functional roles are expressed in the same zzso Recently we have shown that zzso and zzso possess different regulatory processes including zzso trafficking properties, which implies that they might employ different signaling mechanisms for regulation of the same cellular zzso Here we studied the signaling pathways of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso them with zzso studies in zzso cells and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso C were commonly involved in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso of zzso were found not to be zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso but not zzso were blocked by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and by dominant negative zzso of Ras and zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was able to couple with zzso to mediate zzso zzso We conclude that zzso mainly zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which involves the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of the zzso protein plays a main role in zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests one example of intricate cellular regulations in the brain, that is, zzso zzso could regulate zzso activity more zzso through alternative usage of either the zzso or zzso zzso depending on the cellular zzso
