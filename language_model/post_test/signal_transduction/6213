zzso zzso cells possess a plasma membrane sensor able to detect the presence of zzso zzso acids and then to activate a signaling zzso leading to zzso induction of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso acid zzso This sensing function requires the zzso zzso and associated zzso and zzso zzso all essential to zzso by zzso processing, of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex is also essential to zzso zzso but its exact role in the zzso acid signaling zzso remains zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso lacking this zzso zzso is not zzso and zzso is not induced in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that zzso is the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso is significantly similar to zzso zzso its zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso and its zzso causes zzso zzso zzso and high-level zzso zzso We further show that zzso processing also requires the zzso complex but is insensitive to zzso zzso However, zzso processing does not require zzso zzso or zzso when zzso is zzso Finally, we describe the properties of a particular zzso zzso that suggest that zzso acts with zzso in zzso acid detection and signal zzso We propose that zzso and zzso form the core components of the zzso acid zzso Upon detection of external zzso zzso zzso likely zzso a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso to gain access to and to cleave zzso this requiring prior zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
