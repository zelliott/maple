Acute kidney injury zzso is common in zzso patients and has a poor zzso zzso new therapeutic strategies are zzso zzso a novel third-generation zzso calcium channel blocker, has been demonstrated effective for zzso However, its potential effect on zzso injury remains zzso In the present study, an in zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso injury was used to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanisms of zzso on human kidney cell zzso zzso 

zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso depletion and recovery zzso zzso zzso depletion for 2 h and recovery for 30 zzso with or without zzso (1 zzso and 10 zzso 24 zzso then cell viability and zzso were determined using the cell counting zzso zzso zzso and zzso V flow zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso c zzso c) was examined by western zzso 

zzso A zzso was found to induce zzso of zzso The proportion of early zzso and activity of zzso peaked at 30 zzso after zzso depletion and recovery and were attenuated by zzso The expression of zzso c and zzso was zzso while that of zzso was increased significantly in zzso treated zzso 

We conclude that zzso protects zzso against zzso induced by zzso depletion and recovery by regulating the zzso zzso
