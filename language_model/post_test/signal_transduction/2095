zzso of zzso zzso zzso which are dispersed throughout the zzso zzso express specific cell surface carbohydrates and project to discrete regions of the zzso zzso Cell surface carbohydrates such as zzso have been zzso to mediate sorting and selective zzso of discrete zzso zzso during development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso outgrowth by both zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso in zzso indicating that cell surface carbohydrates may be zzso for zzso stimulation of zzso growth in zzso In the present study, the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso outgrowth was examined in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth which was specifically inhibited by zzso to zzso and zzso calcium channels and to zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can evoke zzso zzso responses capable of influencing zzso zzso
