zzso proteins have been implicated in the zzso of zzso but how the zzso influences the zzso zzso associated with adverse cardiac zzso remains zzso zzso muscle zzso of zzso signaling zzso is a zzso zzso protein localized to the Z disc that activates serum response zzso zzso zzso by inducing nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We show that STARS expression is zzso in mouse models of cardiac zzso and in failing human zzso A zzso region of the STARS promoter containing an essential binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso mediates cardiac expression of zzso which in turn activates zzso target zzso zzso zzso of STARS in the heart zzso the heart to pressure overload and zzso zzso resulting in exaggerated deterioration in cardiac function in response to these zzso zzso These findings suggest that STARS zzso the responsiveness of the heart to stress signaling by functioning as a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
