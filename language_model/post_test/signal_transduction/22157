zzso Plants can escape from specific environmental stresses through active growth zzso Here, we compared two such zzso syndromes to investigate whether plants use zzso signal zzso pathways to escape from different zzso zzso Full zzso is a threat to zzso plants as it cuts off their access to oxygen and zzso zzso neighbors, in contrast, take away resources such as zzso Both zzso and shade can be escaped through rapid shoot zzso We zzso the precise zzso and zzso control of zzso zzso responses to shade and zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso induced by zzso and that induced by shade occurred with similar zzso both involving cell zzso These responses were induced by two different signals, elevated zzso and a reduced red : zzso light ratio (R : zzso zzso A downstream target for zzso was zzso acid, but low R : zzso appeared to act independently of this zzso zzso however, appeared to be essential to both zzso and low R : zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso a family of cell zzso zzso represent elements of a zzso growth machinery that is activated by zzso signaling events to regulate escape from zzso
