zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso family, comprises 31 zzso acids and is derived from the selective zzso of big zzso by zzso Although zzso zzso reportedly exerts biological effects by direct or indirect zzso its conversion to zzso zzso mechanisms, it is unclear whether in diabetes the vascular effects of zzso zzso display gender zzso We investigated this question by exposing zzso artery rings to zzso zzso using arteries from mice in the early or chronic phase of zzso In the early stage of diabetes, the zzso zzso contraction was similar between zzso and zzso control and zzso zzso diabetic zzso In the chronic stage of diabetes, the zzso zzso contraction was enhanced in diabetic female mice, but not in diabetic male mice zzso both zzso control and zzso diabetic zzso This enhancement was largely prevented by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signal related zzso 1 and 2 zzso or zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso artery may be specifically enhanced in established diabetic female mice, and that this enhancement may be due to zzso in the activities of zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso
