zzso cell death is a fundamental and highly regulated biological process in which a cell is instructed to actively participate in its own zzso This process of cellular suicide is activated by zzso and environmental cues and normally plays an essential role in eliminating zzso damaged, and zzso cells of many tissue zzso In recent years, a number of experimental studies have provided evidence of widespread zzso and zzso zzso following injury to the central nervous system zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso can be detected from hours to days following injury and may contribute to neurological zzso Given these findings, understanding the zzso signaling events controlling zzso is a first step towards developing therapeutic agents that target this cell death zzso This review will focus on molecular cell death pathways that are responsible for generating the zzso zzso It will also zzso what is currently known about the zzso signals that are activated in the injured zzso and what potential strategies might be pursued to reduce this cell death process as a means to promote functional zzso
