With the progress of research in molecular biology and greater understanding of cell zzso systems emerge an increasing array of potential targets for the therapy of zzso While traditional chemotherapy aims to elicit zzso cell death, it also produces zzso side effects on zzso zzso zzso By zzso cell surface receptors which link specific zzso secondary zzso zzso researchers are increasingly able to define the biological network which drives cellular zzso Of importance are routes involved in zzso zzso zzso survival and zzso Thus targeted therapy is directed to specific differential growth processes particular to zzso zzso The principle mode of action generally involves the zzso mechanism and identifying the zzso zzso for drug zzso Various targeted agents have been studied and many have translated into significant clinical zzso This chapter will describe some examples which illustrate the role of this approach in gastrointestinal zzso
