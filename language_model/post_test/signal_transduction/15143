In Parkinson's disease, impaired function of zzso complex I is involved in selective zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are now considered to play an active role in zzso death process through zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to production of zzso oxygen zzso This paper presents our recent findings on new functions of zzso in regulation of their zzso state and function through zzso zzso a mixed zzso binding between zzso groups of zzso and protein zzso in complex I zzso Type A zzso zzso zzso localized at the zzso outer membrane is a binding site of zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso type B zzso zzso of zzso bind to zzso to protect zzso cells against zzso through induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review discusses the new role of zzso in regulation of zzso cell death of neurodegenerative zzso
