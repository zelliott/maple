Rainbow trout zzso zzso and yellow perch zzso zzso have a different sensitivity to cadmium zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Metals and particularly zzso impair cortisol zzso by zzso cells in both zzso The purpose of the present study was to assess in zzso the effect of zzso on cortisol zzso by zzso cells of trout and perch, to compare the sensitivity of adrenal zzso in these two zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso for 60 zzso then zzso with zzso zzso or with zzso a cortisol zzso zzso inhibited zzso cortisol zzso in a zzso manner in both fish species, however, the zzso zzso resulting in 50% zzso of cortisol zzso was significantly lower in trout zzso zzso zzso zzso than perch zzso zzso zzso zzso To test the specificity of zzso to act as an zzso zzso the zzso zzso that kills 50% of the zzso was also evaluated to determine the zzso ratio ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of trout were more sensitive than those of perch and zzso had a higher zzso potential and specificity in trout than in zzso However, in both species, zzso had the same effect on zzso zzso and zzso cortisol zzso with zzso maintaining cortisol zzso until cell viability was zzso These results confirm that for both species, zzso interferes in the zzso zzso of cortisol synthesis in a step prior to the zzso zzso Data provided by the present study revealed important differences in vulnerability of adrenal zzso between rainbow trout and yellow zzso
