Whereas most zzso T cells in zzso zzso and zzso express the zzso beta zzso and depend absolutely on zzso competence for their development, a substantial population of T cells expressing zzso alpha matures zzso Although the existence of these zzso zzso is well established, relatively little is known about differences that might exist among zzso cells in their requirement for particular zzso pathways during the development and maintenance of normal zzso zzso mice whose T lineage expresses an zzso zzso exhibited decreased zzso signaling and a diminution in mature zzso T zzso We now have determined that although zzso zzso induction by zzso alpha and zzso beta T cells was unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso beta zzso beta T cells were zzso reduced compared to their zzso beta zzso alpha or zzso delta zzso This finding was most prominent in zzso but was also apparent in zzso patches of transgenic zzso In addition, diminished zzso zzso responses of zzso beta zzso zzso were observed after enteric zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso signaling is more important for the zzso zzso beta zzso beta population than for other zzso zzso and thus regulates the number, function, and normal balance of zzso zzso in the zzso
