Numerous in zzso and in zzso studies zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso signaling in vascular development and zzso Mice and humans with zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso genes exhibit a range of vascular defects that include zzso fragile and zzso vessels, defective zzso zzso severe vascular zzso including zzso zzso and disrupted vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment and zzso Despite a wealth of data, the functions of zzso zzso signals during zzso are poorly zzso since early embryonic zzso and difficulty distinguishing between primary and secondary defects frequently confound zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso signaling during zzso we have zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the developing chick limb and zzso We find that the great vessels are zzso zzso and frequently develop zzso and zzso zzso Neither zzso nor dominant negative zzso zzso zzso causes similar vascular zzso However, simultaneous zzso of zzso active zzso receptors with zzso suppresses the zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso zzso is the target of zzso zzso Despite the gross zzso zzso further analyses find no evidence of zzso and vessel structure is zzso Furthermore, enlarged vessels and vascular zzso form in either the presence or absence of vascular smooth muscle, and vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment is zzso Our data define the zzso zzso zzso as an integral regulator of vessel caliber that is also essential for appropriate vessel zzso They demonstrate that zzso need not result in vessel zzso or zzso and zzso vessel maintenance from the presence of a vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso they zzso vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment and differentiation from zzso zzso zzso
