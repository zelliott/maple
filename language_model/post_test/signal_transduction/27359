It is well recognized that the zzso zzso system is altered during zzso zzso However, there are no data regarding either regulation of zzso zzso particularly at the zzso level, or zzso activity in isolated cardiac zzso exposed to chronic zzso 

In a chronic zzso model in which zzso rat zzso zzso were exposed to a zzso zzso environment for 72 hours, we investigated zzso beta zzso and zzso expression and zzso activity and zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by prolonged zzso zzso We found that zzso for 72 hours increased zzso membrane beta zzso zzso density by zzso This increase was not associated with a corresponding decrease in zzso beta zzso zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso increased the zzso levels of beta zzso by zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso in hypoxic zzso was not altered compared with zzso zzso zzso for 72 hours also did not affect zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso or zzso 

In zzso rat cardiac zzso chronic zzso zzso increases beta zzso and zzso expression but does not alter zzso activity zzso at either the zzso or the zzso level and zzso does not affect zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
