zzso control of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is governed by a zzso signal zzso system that zzso from the conventional zzso cascade that occurs in model zzso Although a zzso zzso zzso a hybrid zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso no zzso the zzso response regulator, has been zzso In this work, we present evidence that the zzso open reading frame zzso zzso encodes a novel response regulator indispensable for zzso zzso under zzso zzso Moreover, results from zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso of zzso expression requires the presence of both zzso and zzso and that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to substitute for zzso zzso control in zzso zzso In addition, in these two organisms, zzso and zzso proteins were identified in other bacteria, located in close proximity to a zzso zzso Using reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso we identified the zzso binding site upstream from the zzso start site of zzso Similar to our previous observations for zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso does not affect the symbiotic effectiveness of the zzso Thus, our findings reveal that zzso is the long-standing missing key regulator that allows the zzso of the zzso signal for the zzso of the zzso zzso
