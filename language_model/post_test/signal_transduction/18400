The induction of zzso by heat shock zzso and zzso stress zzso involves different pathways in zzso rat zzso zzso The pathways were analyzed by specific zzso of signal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited only the zzso but not the zzso expression of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso before stress also suppressed the expression of zzso only after zzso zzso Moreover, another inhibitor of zzso zzso exclusively suppressed zzso zzso zzso This different regulation was confirmed by exposing the cells to zzso acid zzso during stress which strongly increased the induction of zzso only after zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso had no influence on zzso expression in response to both zzso The results suggest that the induction of zzso by zzso stress is mainly transmitted by the zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso
