zzso signaling involves zzso interactions through direct zzso zzso Multiple zzso receptors and zzso are expressed in the zzso and hair zzso during embryonic development and the adult zzso Although zzso signaling plays an important role in regulating differentiation of the zzso and hair zzso it remains unclear how zzso signaling zzso in late-stage zzso differentiation and zzso hair cycle zzso 

We applied zzso system to generate conditional gene targeted mice that allow zzso of critical components of zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso the core component of all four zzso zzso and zzso an essential factor for zzso zzso were zzso in hair zzso lineages and zzso layer of the zzso using the zzso mouse zzso zzso conditional zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso conditional zzso led to zzso abnormalities in the zzso layer and altered zzso processing in the zzso suggesting a zzso of the zzso layer zzso zzso of zzso in hair zzso lineages resulted in zzso zzso zzso a decrease of zzso stem cell zzso and a zzso increase of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso hair zzso zzso hair zzso displayed a delay in zzso re-entry and zzso of proliferation and zzso during the hair cycle zzso Moreover, increased DNA double stand breaks were detected in zzso hair zzso and real time zzso analyses on zzso zzso isolated by zzso revealed an induction of DNA damage response and a paucity of DNA repair machinery in zzso zzso zzso 

our data reveal a role for zzso signaling in regulating late-stage zzso zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso hair cycle zzso by maintaining proper proliferation and differentiation of hair zzso stem zzso
