Regulatory molecular networks have numerous pharmacological and medical zzso The zzso mechanisms and the role of zzso in these regulatory networks are not fully zzso In this paper, we explore two zzso zzso the zzso relaxation zzso and the zzso We combine these mechanisms into one regulatory network so that only two zzso the strength of an additional regulatory connection and the zzso separation for one of the zzso control the transition from one mechanism to the zzso Our data support a qualitative difference between the zzso mechanisms, but in the zzso space, we found a single zzso region, suggesting that the two mechanisms support each zzso We examine interactions in a basic population: that is, a pair of the composite zzso We found that the relaxation zzso mechanism is much more resistant to zzso death as the cells are zzso coupled in a zzso Additionally, stationary pattern formation has been found to accompany the relaxation zzso but not the zzso zzso These properties may guide the identification of zzso mechanisms in complex natural regulatory zzso
