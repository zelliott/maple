Since its discovery, zzso has been shown to act upon various neurotransmitter systems at multiple levels of signaling in the zzso zzso affecting each neurotransmitter system within complex interactive zzso networks, is suggested to restore the balance among zzso signaling pathways in critical regions of the zzso Recent molecular studies have revealed the action of zzso on signal zzso mechanisms, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C, and its zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso Such effects are thought to trigger long-term changes in zzso signaling patterns that account for the zzso properties of zzso in the treatment of bipolar zzso Through its effects on zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C, zzso may alter the level of zzso of zzso zzso which leads to zzso changes associated with mood zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso factors, which in turn may zzso the expression of a variety of genes that compensate for zzso signaling associated with the zzso of bipolar zzso Future studies on long-term zzso changes caused by zzso in the brain will set the stage for new zzso zzso
