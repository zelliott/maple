zzso understanding and defining novel therapeutic targets of diabetic zzso and age-related zzso zzso zzso have been hampered by a lack of appropriate adult animal zzso Here we describe a simple and highly zzso adult zzso transgenic zzso model to study retinal zzso The retinal zzso in the adult zzso is highly organized and zzso zzso occurs in a predictable area of zzso zzso New retinal vessels and vascular sprouts can be accurately measured and zzso zzso active zzso agents including zzso and zzso effectively block zzso retinal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by the inhibitor zzso under zzso results in a high density of zzso zzso in all optical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on tissue zzso However, in the presence of zzso substantial zzso tip cell formation was detected only in zzso zzso zzso under zzso These findings suggest that zzso shifts the vascular targets of zzso zzso Our findings for the first time show a clinically relevant retinal zzso model in adult zzso which might serve as a platform for studying mechanisms of retinal zzso for defining novel therapeutic targets, and for screening of novel zzso zzso
