We have examined the signal zzso pathways of a number of zzso that interact with receptors that are members of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso protein was zzso on zzso in response to stimulation of appropriate target cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso or zzso These data suggest that a zzso zzso represents a point of convergence for signal zzso by a number of growth factor receptors that do not have zzso with any known protein zzso zzso To address the possibility that zzso may represent a zzso zzso involved in multiple signal zzso zzso we tested the capacity of this protein to bind a zzso zzso zzso or zzso Indeed, a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells as well as zzso zzso cells bound to a zzso of zzso acid and zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso Further, a zzso zzso present in both lineages also bound zzso These data indicate that a zzso zzso with properties consistent with those of a protein zzso zzso is involved in the signal zzso pathways of certain members of the newly identified zzso zzso zzso and may represent an early point of convergence in the zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso
