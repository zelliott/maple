Virtually every process in a cell is carried out by zzso complexes whose actions need to be perfectly zzso The synchronization and regulation of these biological functions is indeed critical and is usually carried out by complex networks of transient protein zzso Here, we review some of the many strategies that proteins in regulatory networks use to achieve the dynamic plasticity necessary to rapidly respond to diverse cellular zzso More specifically, we present recent work on the molecular bases of transient zzso interactions and the role that zzso modifications and zzso regions might zzso Finally, in light of some recent findings, we speculate on the possibility of a new regulatory code for zzso zzso proteins and the potential zzso and functional advantages that disorder might zzso
