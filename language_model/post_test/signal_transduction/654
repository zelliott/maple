Growth factors zzso are zzso signaling zzso regulating cell zzso differentiation and zzso They exert a wide spectrum of biological activities selectively binding to and zzso specific membrane receptors which then transfer the message to cell interior inducing specific zzso zzso zzso are especially involved in the regulation of zzso a zzso process underlining several zzso zzso able to zzso zzso interfering with the molecular recognition between a zzso and its zzso have a big zzso zzso Either zzso and the zzso are potential drug zzso zzso are useful molecules to develop new lead compounds zzso zzso interface for pharmacological zzso In this review we describe peptides targeting the receptors of the zzso growth factors zzso zzso and zzso The biological function and the structure of each growth zzso system are discussed, as well as the molecular interaction between peptides and the zzso Finally, we highlight the pharmacological and diagnostic applications of these peptides in zzso related zzso
