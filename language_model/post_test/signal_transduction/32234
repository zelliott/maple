zzso zzso is a key regulator of vascular zzso in brain development and in zzso studies show that zzso protects against zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role zzso plays in zzso in zzso rats with zzso zzso brain injury is not zzso Here, we report the function of zzso and signaling pathways involved in zzso after zzso brain zzso Neonatal zzso model was performed in zzso day 10 rats by zzso the right common carotid artery, followed by zzso zzso Expressions of zzso were determined by zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, and western zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso The expression of vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso were detected by western zzso Cellular zzso was detected with terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso was mainly localized to zzso and zzso immediately upon zzso When zzso was zzso zzso zzso was zzso followed by the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and cellular zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso may be attributed to regulation of zzso balance and zzso zzso zzso might be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in zzso with zzso brain zzso
