Here we consider the impact of the zzso zzso zzso on normal tissue zzso and on disease zzso with particular reference to evolution and progression of zzso We seek to describe the direct contributions played by zzso in creating the zzso of normal and zzso zzso and to discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the elements of the zzso that define the meaning of zzso recognition, response, and zzso zzso cells elicit responses in other cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and long-range zzso modes that range from direct contact to zzso communication via zzso zzso Such cellular responses include migration, zzso and zzso as well as production of zzso and zzso zzso together with, in the case of zzso zzso and breakdown of zzso zzso In normal zzso the removal of zzso cells is rapid and typically zzso We discuss the importance of this clearance process in tissue zzso and the consequences of its failure in disease zzso Using the typical cell culture environment in zzso as an illustrative example in which zzso occurs commonly in the absence of the removal mechanisms, we also discuss the zzso effects of persistent zzso cells on their otherwise viable zzso Since zzso is a common and sustained event in high-grade zzso we zzso on its purposeful role in conditioning the zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso and zzso we identify strategies targeting host responses to zzso cells as promising modes of future therapies that could be applied to multiple cancer types in which zzso zzso is zzso
