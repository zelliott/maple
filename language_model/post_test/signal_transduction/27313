The effect of spinal zzso zzso zzso on peripheral zzso zzso was studied in two rat models of zzso zzso zzso into zzso inflammatory sites was zzso reduced by zzso A1 zzso zzso injected through zzso zzso These effects were reversed by zzso zzso and were zzso by zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, as measured in air zzso zzso decreased markedly in inflamed zzso but remained near normal after zzso treatment with zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso A1 zzso zzso and zzso were reversed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso administered zzso zzso central zzso zzso activity can regulate zzso zzso in peripheral inflammatory sites by reducing local levels of zzso an zzso zzso which zzso zzso function through zzso zzso zzso This represents a previously unknown zzso by which the central nervous system influences inflammatory zzso
