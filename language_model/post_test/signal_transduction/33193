zzso is induced in bone zzso zzso by agents that increase the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and, in their presence, the zzso induced NO synthesis is down zzso Moreover, zzso 10 which zzso zzso in zzso is able to increase the zzso protein zzso A zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso synthesis like protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso or NO zzso zzso have no effect on the induction of zzso by zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is involved in the induction of zzso and supports the hypothesis that there is a zzso regulation of these two zzso that drives the zzso towards opposite functional zzso
