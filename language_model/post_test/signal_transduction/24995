zzso molecules bind zzso peptides and present them to T zzso There is a growing body of evidence that zzso molecules also serve other zzso We and others have described synthetic peptides derived from regions of zzso molecules that inhibit zzso proliferation or zzso in an zzso manner that is independent of interaction with the zzso zzso In this report, we describe the mechanism of action of a synthetic zzso class zzso zzso that blocks zzso zzso induced by zzso Both this zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity, but only zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso activity, placing the effects of zzso zzso upstream of zzso a zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso The zzso is taken up by cells, as demonstrated by zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso acts as an zzso with zzso zzso zzso downstream signaling events and zzso zzso zzso the mechanism of action of zzso peptides may provide new insights into zzso zzso and allow the development of novel zzso zzso
