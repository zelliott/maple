zzso factors are among the zzso molecules implicated in the signal exchange that leads to zzso zzso The role of these molecules in zzso development has been primarily studied in zzso invaded through infection zzso In these plants, zzso factors generate several responses required for zzso including the induction of cortical cell division to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a specific mode of zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso in which infection threads are never zzso The role of zzso factors in this particular mechanism is zzso In this work, a peanut zzso zzso strain unable to produce zzso factors was obtained and zzso The strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V2 is altered in the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso zzso involved in the first step of the zzso factor zzso zzso Further research revealed that, although its ability to zzso peanut roots was zzso it is not capable of inducing the division of cortical zzso The results obtained indicate that zzso zzso factors are essential for the induction of cortical cell division that leads to zzso zzso zzso
