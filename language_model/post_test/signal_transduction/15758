zzso in life span in zzso mice revealed that zzso zzso promotes zzso Interestingly, zzso is one of zzso imprinted genes transcribed from zzso zzso zzso of its zzso results in zzso zzso and has been demonstrated in a population of zzso adult zzso very small embryonic like stem cells zzso stem cells involved in tissue organ zzso Furthermore, based on recent observation that zzso signaling zzso is located downstream from insulin zzso and insulin like growth zzso zzso zzso the extended zzso of zzso mice may support beneficial effect of reduced zzso signaling on zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso in zzso renders them resistant to chronic zzso signaling and protects from premature depletion from adult zzso Thus, the studies in zzso mice indicate that some of the imprinted genes may play a role in zzso longevity and suggest that there are sex differences in life span that originate at the zzso zzso All this in zzso supports a concept that the zzso zzso may have a zzso effect on longevity in zzso We will discuss a role of zzso on life span in context of zzso zzso and zzso
