zzso growth zzso zzso is involved in repair and zzso in zzso in which zzso regulation of its production has been shown to be zzso We have investigated the effects of a second zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso on zzso zzso levels in cultured rat zzso zzso using a zzso protection zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso were increased using either the calcium zzso zzso or zzso The ability of these agents to increase zzso was confirmed by zzso using zzso as the zzso zzso Treatment of cells in zzso medium and zzso zzso zzso Essential zzso zzso + zzso with 500 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels in a zzso manner over zzso zzso zzso and zzso also decreased zzso zzso levels to zzso and zzso of control levels, respectively, in a zzso zzso Basic zzso growth factor zzso levels, which were simultaneously determined, were either unchanged or increased in cells treated with zzso or zzso zzso with the change in zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso levels in medium zzso for 48 h by zzso or zzso decreased to zzso and zzso respectively, of control levels in cells maintained in zzso + zzso To determine the role of protein synthesis in the effects of zzso and zzso cells were treated with these agents in the presence or absence of zzso zzso had no effect on the decrease in zzso zzso levels zzso by zzso but significantly attenuated the response to zzso Given these differences in the role of protein synthesis in and the time course of the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso levels, zzso experiments were zzso Treatment of cells with the combination of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso zzso levels that were approximately zzso of the levels present in cells treated with either agent zzso These data are consistent with a small additive effect, but suggest that the majority of the effect of zzso and zzso occurs via the same final zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
