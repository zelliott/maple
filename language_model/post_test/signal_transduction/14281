Breast cancer stem cells zzso are characterized by high zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and are zzso to current treatment zzso show a higher risk for zzso and influence the zzso to zzso transition zzso leading to a shorter time to recurrence and zzso In this study, we focused on examination of the mechanism of action of a small herbal zzso zzso zzso that has been shown to effectively suppress the growth of zzso and breast cancer cells zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso cells, and the zzso effects of zzso were measured using cell zzso zzso colony formation, invasion, migration, zzso formation, zzso and western zzso zzso 

zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso and this zzso resulted in growth zzso and induction of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso which facilitated zzso of zzso markers zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in reduced migration and invasion of both zzso and zzso zzso 

Together, our results suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in growth arrest and zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso appears to be a novel agent that targets both zzso and zzso
