zzso zzso which possesses a structural similarity with classic zzso coupled receptors zzso is the most important molecular target in zzso zzso signaling system for developing zzso zzso however, whether zzso may transmit zzso signaling to activate the zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso signaling system and consequently to be involved in the zzso biological events remains zzso 

In this study, using the acquired zzso cancer cell lines and their respective parental cells, we found that zzso may activate zzso through zzso zzso signaling zzso thereby promoting the zzso acquired zzso These observations were further zzso strengthened by data obtained from zzso cancer cells with artificially elevated zzso zzso zzso 

zzso our data demonstrate that zzso signaling zzso by zzso contributes to the acquired zzso through zzso the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso therefore improving our knowledge of the nature of the signal zzso of zzso and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the acquired zzso maintained by zzso zzso Moreover, our data that zzso after activated by zzso signaling axis may stimulate the zzso activity and consequently promotes acquired zzso expose a promising and potential target for developing zzso drugs aimed at zzso zzso and for combating the acquired resistance raised by using of zzso drugs targeting zzso
