zzso zinc finger zzso proteins are characterized by two zzso zzso motifs arranged in zzso Human zzso such as zzso zzso bind to and trigger the degradation of zzso zzso zzso and various zzso Although the molecular functions of plant zzso are unknown, recent genetic studies have revealed roles in zzso growth and environmental responses, as well as in the regulation of gene zzso Here we show that expression of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso sugar signaling zzso However, zzso acts as a positive regulator of zzso responses and a negative regulator of zzso responses, at least in part by modulating gene zzso zzso of zzso caused early zzso and slightly zzso zzso whereas plants zzso zzso were zzso late flowering and zzso The zzso zzso of plants zzso zzso were only partially rescued by zzso application of zzso zzso a reduction in the zzso response or defects in other zzso Likewise, the enhanced cold and drought tolerance of plants zzso zzso were not associated with increased zzso zzso suggesting that it is mainly zzso responses that are zzso zzso with this notion, zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso mimics the effects of zzso or zzso zzso on gene zzso zzso a gene network centered on a zzso and zzso putative zzso hormone zzso by zzso was severely zzso by zzso zzso Hence zzso may serve as a regulator connecting sugar, zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso
