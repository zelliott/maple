Cellular responses to external signals often reflect zzso in gene zzso The zzso of cell surface hormone or growth factor receptors upon the binding of appropriate zzso zzso signal zzso zzso that can ultimately impact the activity of defined sets of zzso zzso The interpretation of hormonal signals can also be initiated zzso as is the case for steroid hormone zzso In addition to recognizing specific hormones, steroid hormone receptors also function as zzso factors and directly zzso hormonal signals to zzso or repression of unique target zzso The delivery of activated steroid receptors to zzso zzso sites must be efficient to account for the zzso and selectivity of many zzso responses to steroid zzso Thus, the signal zzso capacity of steroid hormone receptors will be affected by the efficiency of zzso trafficking both between different zzso compartments zzso the zzso and zzso and within a specific compartment zzso the zzso This article will highlight the recent advances in our understanding of zzso and zzso trafficking of steroid zzso
