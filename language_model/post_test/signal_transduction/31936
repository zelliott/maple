zzso oxygen species zzso zzso aging and zzso zzso zzso composition is critical in modulating zzso However, how zzso zzso dietary effects on lifespan remains poorly zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a major zzso zzso responsible for scavenging zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso in lifespan zzso by diet in zzso We found that a high zzso protein zzso diet or low-calorie diet with zzso content, representing protein zzso increased lifespan but not resistance to acute zzso stress in zzso flies, relative to a standard base zzso A low zzso protein diet had an opposite zzso Our genetic analysis indicated that zzso zzso or zzso deletion did not alter lifespan patterns of flies responding to zzso However, zzso reduction blunted lifespan extension by the zzso diet but not the low-calorie zzso zzso and low-calorie diets both reduced target of zzso zzso signaling and only the zzso diet increased zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts in parallel with or downstream of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso decreased lifespan in zzso zzso but not zzso males fed the standard, zzso and low-calorie zzso whereas zzso zzso only increased lifespan in zzso zzso males fed the zzso diet, when compared to zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is required for lifespan extension by protein restriction only when dietary sugar is high and support the zzso role of zzso in aging and caution the use of zzso and antioxidants in aging zzso
