The nuclear factor zzso factor 2 zzso is a zzso factor that responds to zzso stress by binding to the zzso response element zzso in the promoter of genes coding for zzso zzso like zzso zzso 1 and proteins for zzso zzso The zzso zzso has nutritional interest zzso to its zzso by zzso such as zzso Recently, the zzso zzso was identified as having regulatory functions in zzso zzso zzso differentiation and liver energy zzso zzso of zzso increases energy metabolism and zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso but not soybean zzso high-fat diets reduce zzso expression of zzso and its downstream targets, suggesting a zzso influence on the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso This review examines data revealing the zzso zzso regulatory role in energy metabolism at the zzso cellular and whole animal zzso zzso the relationship of zzso and energy metabolism in cells, zzso and zzso systems will provide novel insights for nutritional interventions for obesity and its zzso such as zzso
