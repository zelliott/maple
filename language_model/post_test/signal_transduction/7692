zzso is zzso by cellulose zzso zzso contained in plasma zzso zzso In zzso zzso three types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for secondary cell wall zzso We report that zzso in these proteins zzso enhanced resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso fungus zzso zzso By contrast, zzso to these pathogens was not altered in cell wall zzso of primary wall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Double zzso indicated that zzso resistance was independent of salicylic acid, zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses identified a set of common zzso zzso zzso including a number of zzso acid zzso zzso genes zzso zzso peptides and zzso involved in the synthesis and zzso of zzso secondary zzso These data as well as the increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso support a direct role of zzso in resistance to this zzso Our results also indicate that zzso of secondary cell wall integrity by zzso cellulose synthesis leads to specific zzso of novel defense pathways that contribute to the generation of an zzso environment hostile to zzso
