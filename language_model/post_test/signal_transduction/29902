In zzso cells the neurotransmitter zzso is transferred from the zzso into synaptic zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso tail of zzso has been shown to contain signals that direct its sorting and zzso The role of zzso protein complexes in zzso sorting to synaptic zzso has been zzso A fusion protein between the zzso zzso tail and zzso zzso was used to identify zzso protein zzso protein 1, zzso protein 2 and zzso protein 180 complexes from a rat brain zzso In zzso zzso confirmed zzso alpha and zzso gamma complexes, but zzso protein 180 complexes were not detected by this zzso zzso and site directed zzso show that the zzso zzso tail contains multiple trafficking zzso These include a zzso zzso motif that serves as the signal for zzso alpha and a zzso motif that serves as the signal for zzso zzso A classical zzso motif is also involved in zzso trafficking, but does not interact with any known zzso zzso There appear to be two zzso zzso one involving the zzso protein 1 binding site and the other involving the zzso protein 2 binding zzso These results suggest a complex trafficking zzso for zzso
