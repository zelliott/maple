Acute zzso zzso elicits an inflammatory response that may exacerbate acute kidney injury, but the regulation of the initial signals that recruit zzso is not well zzso Here, we found that zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso was a critical, early zzso signal released during zzso injury in zzso and in zzso Within 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells of the zzso segment produced zzso which is a zzso factor that activates zzso zzso zzso knockout of zzso ameliorated the impairment of zzso function, zzso injury, and inflammation after acute zzso Bone zzso zzso experiments determined that zzso zzso injury required zzso expression by both zzso and zzso zzso cells, the latter identified as zzso zzso zzso cells in the outer zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso oxygen species, generated during zzso injury, zzso expression of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso gene zzso by zzso oxygen species is an early signal that promotes inflammation after zzso zzso zzso
