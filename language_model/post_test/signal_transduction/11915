In this study, we examined whether zzso cell zzso during zzso development and zzso was regulated by the class I zzso zzso zzso B zzso pathway, which is known to control the activity of zzso target of zzso zzso a major negative regulator of zzso zzso and zzso cells were obtained using an established zzso immature rat model that zzso zzso development and zzso zzso was evaluated by measuring the expression level of zzso protein light chain zzso zzso using western blots and zzso The activity of zzso and zzso was also examined by observing the zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso injection, zzso expression was suppressed and zzso of zzso and zzso increased in rat zzso zzso By contrast, zzso withdrawal by zzso clearance promoted zzso expression and decreased zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso treatment of rat zzso cells also indicated zzso of zzso expression accompanied by a marked increase in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso inhibitor VIII suppressed zzso zzso of zzso followed by an increase in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso and zzso inhibitor increased the levels of zzso and cell death of zzso cells compared with the single treatment with zzso Taken together, our findings indicated that zzso zzso of zzso suppresses zzso cell zzso during zzso development and is involved in the regulation of zzso cell zzso
