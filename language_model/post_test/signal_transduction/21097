zzso in human skin undergo zzso during various inflammatory processes and after ultraviolet zzso zzso To determine if zzso zzso may be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso a signal zzso zzso known to initiate programmed cell death of zzso we investigated zzso zzso zzso and function in zzso zzso zzso expressed the zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso significantly promoted their cell death, indicating that zzso in zzso is zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression within 16 to 24 h and zzso protein within 24 h and through 48 h after zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso as early as 4 h after zzso and elevated zzso zzso levels were maintained for at least 24 h zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our data strongly suggest that the zzso system contributes to zzso zzso in zzso human zzso
