The zzso zzso proteins are components of the zzso activity, which is central in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso Here we present a novel zzso reporter gene zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso precursor protein zzso We show that this zzso offers several advantages, including increased sensitivity and zzso improved zzso of zzso and simultaneous detection of all zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso can be used in parallel with a similar zzso that records zzso zzso of a zzso zzso The use of these zzso to analyze the effects of two known zzso zzso and zzso zzso active site zzso on zzso and zzso processing demonstrated that zzso and zzso that differently affect zzso and zzso zzso can be identified zzso The possibility in using these zzso for high zzso screening of candidate zzso zzso for zzso and zzso in parallel opens up new zzso to systematically search for novel zzso that selectively block zzso zzso while not affecting zzso zzso
