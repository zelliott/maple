The role of the abundant stress protein zzso in protecting cells against zzso damage is not well zzso The recent discovery that a class of zzso antibiotics bind specifically to zzso allowed us to address this problem from a new zzso We find that zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso and other factors, mediates the zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Failure to zzso results in zzso The zzso inhibit zzso both in zzso and in a cell zzso by preventing normal zzso of zzso from zzso causing its enhanced zzso This mechanism also explains the zzso zzso of several zzso protein zzso such as zzso which interact with zzso We propose that zzso is part of a quality control system that zzso protein zzso or degradation during recovery from zzso This function is used by a limited set of signal zzso molecules for their folding and regulation under zzso zzso The zzso shift the mode of zzso from zzso to degradation, and this effect is probably amplified for specific zzso zzso
