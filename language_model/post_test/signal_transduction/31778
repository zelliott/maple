Many dietary fatty acids zzso have potent effects on zzso which is not only energetically costly, but also contributes to a range of chronic zzso This presents an evolutionary zzso Why should the host initiate a costly and damaging response to commonly encountered zzso We propose that the immune system has evolved a capacity to modify expenditure on inflammation to compensate for the effects of dietary zzso on gut zzso In a comprehensive literature review, we show that the body zzso zzso inflammation in response to saturated zzso that promote harmful zzso In contrast, the host zzso reduces inflammation in response to the many zzso zzso with zzso zzso Our model is supported by contrasts involving zzso zzso and omega-3 zzso but with less consistent evidence for trans zzso which are a recent addition to the human zzso Our findings support the idea that the zzso immune system has evolved a capacity to detect zzso zzso in the composition of gut zzso from the profile of zzso consumed and to zzso the costs of inflammation in response to these zzso We conclude by extending the zzso signaling model to other zzso and consider implications for drug discovery and public zzso
