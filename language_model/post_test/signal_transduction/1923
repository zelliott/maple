Here we report that synaptic and zzso zzso zzso receptors have opposite effects on zzso zzso response element binding zzso function, gene regulation and zzso zzso zzso entry through synaptic zzso receptors induced zzso activity and zzso zzso factor zzso gene expression as strongly as did stimulation of zzso calcium zzso In contrast, calcium entry through zzso zzso zzso triggered by bath zzso exposure or zzso conditions, activated a general and dominant zzso zzso zzso that blocked induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors have zzso activity, whereas stimulation of zzso zzso receptors caused loss of zzso membrane potential (an early marker for zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso receptors may effectively prevent zzso loss following stroke and other zzso conditions associated with zzso zzso
