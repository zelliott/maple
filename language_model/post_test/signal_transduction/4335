zzso of cocaine on the muscle zzso zzso zzso were investigated by using a chemical kinetic technique with a zzso time zzso This zzso zzso regulates signal transmission between nerve and muscle cells, zzso muscle contraction, and is inhibited by cocaine, an abused zzso The zzso mechanism is not well understood because of the lack of chemical kinetic techniques with the appropriate zzso time zzso Such a technique, utilizing zzso zzso was recently zzso by using it the following results were zzso zzso The apparent cocaine zzso constant of the zzso zzso form is approximately 50 zzso High zzso concentration and, therefore, increased zzso of the zzso zzso form, decrease zzso affinity for cocaine approximately zzso zzso The rate of the zzso reaction with cocaine is at least approximately zzso slower than the zzso rate, resulting in a zzso decrease in the concentration of open zzso channels without a zzso decrease in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate increases approximately zzso as the cocaine concentration is increased from 20 to 60 zzso but then remains constant as the concentration is increased zzso The results are consistent with a mechanism in which cocaine first binds rapidly to a regulatory site of the zzso which can still form zzso zzso zzso a slow step zzso approximately 70 zzso leads to a zzso form that cannot form zzso channels, and zzso zzso signal transmission is, therefore, zzso zzso for the search for therapeutic agents that alleviate cocaine poisoning are zzso
