zzso of zzso spines under acute stress is attracting much zzso Exposure to acute stress zzso zzso zzso zzso from the adrenal cortex, resulting in rapid increase of zzso levels in plasma and the zzso 

Here we demonstrated the mechanisms of rapid effect zzso zzso of zzso on the density and zzso of spines by imaging zzso in adult male rat zzso zzso The application of zzso at zzso zzso induced a rapid increase in the density of spines of zzso zzso zzso The density of zzso spines zzso zzso was increased even at low zzso levels zzso zzso The density of zzso spines zzso zzso was increased at high zzso levels between zzso zzso The density of zzso spines zzso zzso was increased only at 1000 zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso abolished the effect of zzso zzso a single zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso receptors suppressed the zzso zzso 

These results imply that stress levels of zzso zzso zzso drive the zzso via synaptic zzso and multiple zzso zzso
