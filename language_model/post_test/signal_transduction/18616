zzso cells tend to continue moving in the same direction, a property called zzso During migration, cells, by definition, form new zzso at their front and break old zzso at the zzso We zzso that the distinction between new zzso at the front and older zzso at the rear plays a major role in directional zzso We propose specific mechanisms of persistence on the basis of known properties of zzso signals, in hope of stimulating investigation of these zzso
