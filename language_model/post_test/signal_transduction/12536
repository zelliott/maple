There is increasing evidence that zzso cells, in particular zzso interact zzso with zzso The well-known zzso organization of zzso in the barrel zzso offers a suitable and promising model to study such zzso zzso This review summarizes and discusses recent in zzso as well as in zzso works demonstrating that zzso receive, zzso and respond to zzso zzso In addition, they are active elements of brain metabolism and exhibit a certain degree of plasticity that affects zzso zzso zzso these findings indicate that the barrel zzso presents zzso compartments overlapping and interacting with zzso compartments and that these properties help define barrels as functional and independent zzso Finally, this review outlines how the use of the barrel zzso as a model might in the future help to address important questions related to dynamic zzso zzso
