zzso models have been effectively used to zzso zzso and predict the function of reconstructed zzso zzso zzso The first generation of these models used zzso zzso constraints associated with network zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso flux zzso These constraints restrict the allowable behaviors of a network to a convex mathematical solution space whose edges are extreme pathways that can be used to characterize the optimal performance of a network under a stated performance zzso The development of a second generation of zzso models by incorporating constraints associated with regulation of gene expression was described in a companion paper published in this journal, using zzso analysis to generate time courses of growth and zzso zzso using a skeleton representation of core zzso The imposition of these additional restrictions prevents the use of a subset of the extreme pathways that are derived from the zzso constraints, thus reducing the solution space and restricting allowable network zzso Here, we examine the reduction of the solution space due to regulatory constraints using extreme zzso zzso The imposition of environmental conditions and regulatory mechanisms sharply reduces the number of active extreme zzso This approach is demonstrated for the skeleton system mentioned above, which has 80 extreme zzso As regulatory constraints are applied to the system, the number of feasible extreme pathways is reduced to between 26 and 2 extreme zzso a reduction of between zzso and zzso The method developed here provides a way to interpret how regulatory mechanisms are used to zzso network functions and produce a small range of zzso meaningful behaviors from all allowable network zzso
