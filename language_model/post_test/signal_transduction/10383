zzso of the zzso regulatory factors zzso 3 and 7 zzso factors is essential for the induction of type I zzso zzso and development of the innate zzso zzso zzso zzso gene I has been shown to contribute to zzso zzso production independent of the zzso zzso pathways in response to a variety of zzso viruses and zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein zzso efficiently blocks zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso promoters but only zzso interferes with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso completely blocked zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso The level of zzso zzso was upstream of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso selectively zzso the zzso protein but not zzso zzso possesses two zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso domain consisting of seven zinc finger zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain had no significant effect on the zzso effect of zzso whereas deletion or zzso of zinc finger motif 7 zzso the zzso function of zzso on zzso or zzso gene zzso Furthermore, cells zzso expressing the active form of zzso induced an zzso state that zzso with replication of zzso zzso virus, an effect that was reversed by stable zzso of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso induction of the zzso zzso
