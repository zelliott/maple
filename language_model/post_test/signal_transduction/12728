The zzso of environmental conditions to cell growth and division is integral to cell zzso In zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso couples zzso status to cell growth rate by controlling the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is localized to the nucleus in rich zzso but upon zzso limitation or target of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso rapidly exits the nucleus, leading to repression of the zzso zzso Through systematic zzso screens we found that many components of the zzso system influence zzso zzso zzso the essential zzso escort protein zzso exhibited a zzso interaction with zzso zzso of zzso prevented nuclear zzso of zzso in rich zzso whereas loss of zzso resulted in nuclear zzso zzso in poor zzso These effects were specific to zzso and independent of the protein zzso C zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso lies in a distinct branch of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were defective in the zzso retention of zzso the control of cell size, and in the repression of the zzso zzso The zzso interaction is a zzso for growth regulation that links the zzso system and zzso zzso signaling to zzso zzso
