zzso are plant hormones with profound roles in growth and development, including control of leaf zzso Although the zzso signal is known to be perceived by zzso zzso zzso the underlying molecular mechanism and specificity of the receptors leading to delayed leaf zzso have not yet been zzso Here, we found that zzso one of the three zzso receptors in zzso plays a major role in controlling zzso leaf longevity through a specific zzso of a response regulator, zzso This result was obtained through identification of a zzso zzso zzso that shows delayed leaf zzso because of a zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso A zzso zzso in zzso but not of the other zzso zzso zzso a reduced sensitivity to zzso in zzso delay of leaf zzso and abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso transgenic zzso of zzso but not an zzso zzso zzso led to delayed zzso of zzso
