To investigate pulmonary vascular zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso expression in chronic smoke exposure and/or zzso zzso 

zzso male zzso rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control group zzso group), smoke exposure groups zzso zzso group), zzso groups zzso zzso group), smoke exposure plus zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were exposed to cigarette smoke and/or zzso air zzso zzso zzso zzso for 4 to 8 zzso A method by right cardiac zzso was used for measuring mean pulmonary artery pressure zzso Right zzso zzso left zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso were split and weighed and right zzso zzso index zzso was zzso To evaluate vascular zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and count of the percentage of zzso small pulmonary arteries which was determined by zzso analysis of zzso sections were zzso Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell zzso zzso was detected by in zzso end labeling technique zzso and proliferation by zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were used for the detection of zzso zzso and protein expression in pulmonary zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso (32 zzso zzso (32 zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than that in C group zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso all P zzso zzso but zzso in zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso (16 zzso 6) zzso zzso were not increased (all P zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), the percentage of zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso 15, 75 zzso 14, 56 zzso 11, 82 zzso 17, 83 zzso 17, 98 zzso 16, zzso were increased significantly (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased and proliferation was markedly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than those in C group (all P zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and protein were higher than those of C group (all P zzso zzso The differences were more significant between zzso and zzso group, zzso and zzso group (all P zzso zzso 

It is suggested that smoke is synergistic with zzso in zzso pulmonary vascular zzso The possible mechanism is through zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso
