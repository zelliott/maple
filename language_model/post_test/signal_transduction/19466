Using zzso zzso zzso zzso technique, 32 expressed sequence tags zzso were isolated from 96 clones of a channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library zzso zzso with a modified live zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of the 32 zzso in response to zzso zzso vaccination were then evaluated by quantitative zzso zzso Of the 32 zzso 28 were zzso in at least one vaccinated zzso Of the 28 zzso zzso 12 were consistently induced at least zzso higher in vaccinated fish compared to zzso control zzso Of the 12 zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso family zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso complex zzso 1) were consistently zzso greater than zzso The 12 consistently zzso genes also included zzso zzso zzso I zzso C, zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso 1, nascent zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain containing 4, and putative zzso zzso The 28 zzso zzso represent genes with putative functions in the following five major zzso zzso immune response zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation zzso zzso cell maintenance zzso and zzso unknown zzso
