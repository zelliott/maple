Biological systems that have been zzso verified to be robust to significant changes in their environments require mathematical models that are themselves zzso In this context, a necessary condition for model zzso is that the model dynamics should not be sensitive to small variations in the zzso zzso zzso analysis problems of this type have been extensively studied in the field of robust control theory and have been found to be very difficult to solve in zzso The authors describe how some tools from robust control theory and zzso zzso can be used to zzso the zzso of a recently proposed model of the molecular network underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in fields of zzso zzso zzso The network model, which consists of a system of seven coupled zzso differential zzso accurately reproduces the spontaneous zzso in zzso observed during the early development of zzso zzso The analysis by the authors zzso however, that very small variations in the model parameters can effectively destroy the required zzso zzso A biological interpretation of the analysis results is that correct functioning of a particular positive feedback loop in the proposed model is crucial to maintaining the required zzso zzso
