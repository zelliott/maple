The zzso zzso are recently discovered short, zzso zzso that regulate gene expression in zzso We have cloned short zzso from chicken zzso and identified five new chicken zzso zzso Genome analysis identified 17 new chicken zzso genes based on sequence zzso to previously characterized mouse zzso zzso Northern blots of chick zzso showed increased zzso of most zzso analyzed from zzso days to 5 days except, the stem zzso zzso which was expressed at high levels at early stages and then zzso In zzso analysis of mature zzso revealed the restricted expression of zzso in the central nervous system and of zzso in developing zzso in particular the developing zzso In addition, we investigated how zzso expression is controlled during zzso development using zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates the initiation of zzso gene zzso This may be zzso through the effects of zzso on zzso zzso These data provide the first demonstration that zzso signaling pathways affect zzso zzso Thus far, zzso have not been studied extensively in chicken zzso and our results show that this system can complement other model organisms to investigate the regulation of many other zzso
