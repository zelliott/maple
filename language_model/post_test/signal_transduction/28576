A zzso zzso of zzso zzso that was not zzso by transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso Previously, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso to zzso zzso in the corresponding position of zzso zzso was not zzso by the zzso active form of the zzso type I zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso effects of zzso on zzso signaling and found that there are considerable differences between zzso and zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso but did not affect the zzso of zzso while zzso blocked the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso with these results, zzso reduced zzso formation of zzso with zzso but not of zzso with zzso while zzso reduced zzso formation of both zzso and zzso with zzso However, zzso reduced the binding of zzso to a target DNA element as well as zzso and zzso had zzso effects on the zzso activity of several targets, as zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso might block the zzso zzso signaling in a zzso unknown manner after the zzso and zzso formation, such as in the process of nuclear zzso or zzso regulation, which we could not identify previously by using zzso
