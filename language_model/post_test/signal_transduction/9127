The zzso zzso originates from cells of the neural crest which migrate to the zzso angle during embryonic and fetal development of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso pathways requires the differentiation of the cells to a porous and zzso zzso as well as the zzso of zzso canal and zzso movement of the iris zzso A failure in these processes is responsible for primary zzso or infantile glaucoma which presents with increased resistance to zzso humor zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso Most cases appear to be of a sporadic nature but zzso cases are often caused by zzso in the zzso gene which encodes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause a reduction in zzso activity which probably leads to diminished turnover of an as yet unidentified zzso taking part in the signaling processes essential for formation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso More rarely, zzso in zzso transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2 zzso or in the zzso factor zzso have been described as zzso for primary zzso zzso
