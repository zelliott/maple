zzso auditory sensation is zzso by the organ of zzso a specialized sensory zzso found in the zzso of the inner zzso Proper auditory function requires that the many different cell types found in the sensory zzso be precisely ordered within an exquisitely patterned cellular zzso The development of this mosaic depends on a series of cell fate decisions that transform the initially nearly uniform cochlear zzso into the complex structure of the mature organ of zzso The zzso domain, which contains the zzso of both the zzso hair cells and their associated supporting cells, first becomes distinct from both the neural and the zzso zzso Further cell fate decisions zzso zzso cells into populations of inner and outer hair cells, and several different types of supporting zzso A number of different signaling pathways and zzso factors are known to be necessary for these zzso zzso in this review, we will zzso these results with an emphasis on recent zzso
