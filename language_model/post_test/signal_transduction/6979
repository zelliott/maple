zzso complications are common in patients with type 2 zzso zzso have been implicated in the induction of zzso and zzso zzso in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Other reports demonstrated the importance of the zzso cluster zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and insulin zzso Here we investigated whether the zzso effects of zzso on zzso function could be ascribed to zzso in zzso zzso The exposure of zzso to zzso media zzso from primary human subcutaneous zzso increased the expression of smooth muscle zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but markedly impaired the zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso Furthermore, CM promoted the zzso of zzso and zzso which have both been linked to zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was prevented when zzso were treated with pharmacological zzso for zzso and zzso before the addition of zzso The zzso of zzso with precursor zzso but not with precursor zzso resulted in impaired zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This zzso of insulin signaling by CM and zzso is associated with a reduction in the expression of the zzso zzso protein 8 zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso resulted in impaired zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Thus, the zzso effects of zzso zzso media on insulin action in primary zzso can be ascribed to the zzso and zzso induction of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso
