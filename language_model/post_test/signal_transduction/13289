zzso cell zzso zzso are rare zzso tumors of the zzso zzso The specific molecular zzso that characterize zzso have not yet been zzso zzso are zzso and genetically distinct from the more common pancreatic zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso and clinical features of zzso overlap with those of another rare pancreatic zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated a high frequency of zzso loss on zzso arm zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that similar zzso might also play a role in the zzso of some zzso We analyzed a series of 21 zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and for zzso loss on zzso zzso In addition, we evaluated the zzso for zzso in zzso and zzso expression using zzso and for zzso instability zzso using zzso chain amplification of a panel of zzso zzso zzso loss on zzso zzso was the most common genetic zzso in zzso present in 50% (6 of 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were detected in zzso (4 of 17) of the zzso including one zzso with an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and three zzso with zzso zzso zzso One zzso (1 of 13, zzso showed zzso shifts in four of the five markers tested zzso two zzso showed an zzso shift in only one of the five markers tested zzso and no shifts were detected in the remaining 10 zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no loss of zzso protein expression or zzso zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso are genetically distinct from pancreatic zzso zzso but some cases contain genetic zzso common to zzso similar zzso
