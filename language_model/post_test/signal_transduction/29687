The acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso products zzso zzso acid zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several lines of evidence suggest similar zzso mechanisms for these fusion zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to identify shared target genes in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso All three fusion proteins significantly zzso the expression of 38 genes and induced the expression of 14 zzso Several of the regulated genes were associated with zzso zzso One of these, zzso zzso was induced on the zzso and protein level by all three fusion zzso In addition, primary zzso blasts carrying one of the fusion proteins significantly zzso zzso The zzso promoter was cloned and shown to be induced by zzso with promoter zzso depending on the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The induction of zzso by zzso fusion proteins led to downstream signaling and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso including the zzso promoter, which was found to be bound by zzso in zzso after zzso zzso zzso protein levels and zzso and zzso target genes such as zzso and zzso D1 were found to be induced by the fusion zzso On the functional level, a dominant negative zzso inhibited colony growth of zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells enhanced proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells into zzso mice accelerated the development of zzso zzso of zzso into primitive zzso zzso zzso cells preserved the immature zzso during colony growth, suggesting enhanced zzso These data provide evidence that zzso of zzso signaling is a common feature of several balanced zzso in zzso
