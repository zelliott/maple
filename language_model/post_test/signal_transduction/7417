B cells detect foreign zzso through their B cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso when engaged by zzso zzso a signaling zzso zzso with signaling is zzso of the zzso complex, which acts to zzso signaling and facilitate zzso of zzso for processing and display on the cell zzso The relationship between signaling and zzso zzso is poorly zzso Here, we explore the interplay between zzso zzso and zzso that either promote or inhibit B cell zzso Specifically, synthetic zzso were generated that engage the zzso alone or both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, binds zzso zzso zzso found on host zzso zzso zzso signaling to prevent erroneous B cell zzso At low zzso zzso that can zzso the zzso and zzso promote rapid zzso zzso zzso slower zzso occurs with zzso that bind only the zzso At higher zzso zzso rapid zzso zzso occurs upon treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in response to synthetic zzso results in its entry into early zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso fail to activate key regulators of zzso presentation zzso zzso they also promote zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso can be zzso Together, our observations support a functional role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The reduction of cell surface zzso levels in the absence of B cell zzso should raise the threshold for zzso subsequent zzso The ability of the zzso synthetic zzso to trigger both signaling and entry of the zzso into early zzso suggests strategies for targeted zzso zzso
