The effects of zzso zzso toxins on the zzso zzso of zzso cell proteins were zzso zzso of the cells with the zzso toxin zzso zzso factor 1 zzso induced a marked increase in the zzso zzso of a number of zzso zzso of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso including focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein of 195 zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these proteins were significantly reduced by prior incubation with zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso function, suggesting a zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso cells with zzso resulted in a marked increase in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which was correlated with a stimulation of its zzso activity and with its association with downstream zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was specific for zzso since the zzso content of zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso also induced an increase in the zzso zzso of the zzso whereas zzso of a zzso form of the protein was without zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso proteins may play an important role in zzso by modulating the zzso zzso levels of zzso
