Many zzso bacteria employ zzso zzso zzso zzso sensing to control zzso To determine whether zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso respond to zzso we used a zzso zzso reporter zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to different zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso chains inhibited light output and growth in a zzso manner, while zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the production of zzso and cell wall zzso proteins but enhanced protein A zzso Since these processes are zzso regulated via the zzso zzso zzso zzso system, which in turn, is regulated via zzso we examined the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso At zzso zzso of zzso both zzso expression and zzso expression were zzso indicating that the action of zzso is zzso at least in part through antagonism of zzso sensing in zzso zzso Spent culture zzso from zzso zzso which produces both zzso and zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso although zzso itself was inactive in this zzso Since zzso sensing in zzso zzso depends on the activities of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane functionality by determining their influence on the membrane zzso zzso From the binding zzso zzso a zzso constant of 7 zzso was obtained for zzso indicating the presence of a specific zzso zzso whereas no binding was observed for zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso such as zzso are capable of interacting with the zzso zzso zzso membrane in a zzso specific manner and at zzso zzso zzso zzso production and both zzso and zzso zzso
