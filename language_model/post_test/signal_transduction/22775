zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso of zzso zzso production in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed the greatest zzso activity, stimulating zzso zzso production fourfold over the fully edited zzso zzso All of the other zzso tested displayed intermediate levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels by 50% produced a parallel decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production twofold over zzso levels through the zzso zzso and zzso over zzso levels through the zzso zzso but produced similar zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso competition for zzso binding to zzso best fit a zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 160 zzso whereas zzso best fit a zzso model with Ki zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso of the total population of zzso receptors labeled by zzso but only zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso values increased from zzso zzso for zzso to 20 zzso for zzso zzso zzso values were the same for both zzso zzso zzso values for zzso zzso production increased from zzso zzso for zzso to 30 zzso for zzso These results demonstrate that zzso editing decreases zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso editing may play a role in regulating zzso signal zzso and response to drug zzso
