To study the protective mechanism of zzso zzso a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on the senile multiple organ injury caused by bacterial pneumonia by observing the expression changes of molecules related to zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 

A total of 55 male zzso aged rats were divided into control group, zzso group, zzso group and zzso zzso There were 25 rats in the zzso group and 10 rats in each of the other three zzso Multiple organ injury in a rat model of pneumonia was induced by injection of zzso zzso through zzso zzso By means of zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso examinations were made on zzso expressions of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso heart and small zzso and also on the protein expressions of zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso factor 6 zzso and nuclear zzso zzso 

Expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso heart and small zzso in the zzso group were stronger than those in the control group zzso or zzso The protein expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were increased dramatically in the zzso group as compared with the control group zzso or zzso Compared with the zzso group, the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso heart and small zzso in the zzso group were weakened significantly zzso or zzso Meanwhile, the protein expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were decreased markedly in the zzso group zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso is effective in suppressing zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and reducing the zzso of zzso and inflammatory zzso which can further reduce the organ tissue zzso zzso zzso can decrease the levels of zzso signal zzso zzso including the targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is different from the special inhibitor that acts only on some zzso
