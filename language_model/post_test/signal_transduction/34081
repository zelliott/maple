Despite continued advances in surgical and medical therapies, the outcomes for patients diagnosed with zzso zzso remain zzso Recent data suggest that progression of these brain tumors is driven by a small zzso of tumor cells, which are termed cancer stem cells zzso because of their capability to zzso zzso and give rise to progeny of multiple zzso zzso According to the zzso hypothesis, current therapies that are extremely zzso to the bulk of highly zzso tumor cells fail to zzso the relatively zzso and resistant zzso zzso thereby allowing these cells to survive and drive tumor zzso This Review summarizes current knowledge regarding neural stem cells in the normal adult brain and zzso in zzso tumors and discusses the implications of the zzso hypothesis for the development of future therapies for brain zzso
