The zzso factor zzso is an important zzso of early B zzso To gain insight into the functions of zzso at distinct stages of zzso we zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is required for the zzso survival, and signaling of zzso cells and peripheral zzso subsets, including B1 cells and marginal zone B zzso The proliferation zzso of zzso zzso cells and the impaired expression of multiple cell cycle regulators are overcome by transformation with zzso The survival zzso of transformed zzso zzso cells can be rescued by the forced expression of the zzso targets zzso or zzso In mature B cells, zzso zzso interferes with signaling via the zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is required for zzso center formation and class switch zzso zzso analyses of zzso gene expression and zzso binding indicate that zzso regulates both common and distinct sets of genes in early and late stage B zzso By regulating important components of zzso factor and signaling networks, zzso appears to be involved in the coordination of cell zzso survival, and differentiation at multiple stages of B zzso
