The zzso hormone zzso has recently been found to positively regulate zzso branching and growth via zzso of zzso signaling in embryonic zzso root zzso zzso zzso but the cellular mechanisms zzso the regulation of these zzso processes have not been zzso In this study, we provide evidence linking zzso signaling to zzso dynamics via the zzso regulator zzso First, zzso of zzso can be suppressed by zzso zzso in embryonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso promotes zzso branching and zzso In addition, real time analysis of growing zzso ends indicates a similar correlation of zzso zzso and its activity in promoting zzso zzso rates and zzso in both zzso cells and zzso zzso growth zzso Moreover, direct zzso of zzso signaling leads to increased assembly of dynamic zzso in zzso growth zzso Finally, low doses of a zzso zzso drug zzso block zzso zzso branching and zzso Taken together, our results support a critical role of zzso dynamics in zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso
