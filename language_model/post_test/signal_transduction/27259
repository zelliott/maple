zzso is a cell surface zzso present on all T cells which has been shown to function as an zzso and signaling zzso zzso early in T cell development, human zzso zzso has been suggested to play a role during zzso However, the relevance of zzso in T cell development has been called into question recently, as neither disruption of the zzso gene nor zzso zzso treatment of fetal zzso organ cultures in mouse were shown to have any discernible zzso We have expressed zzso at high levels in transgenic mice and found a profound effect of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso are considerably reduced in cell number as a consequence of increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The remaining zzso cells have zzso levels of T cell zzso zzso and are resistant to zzso zzso by administration of zzso These effects are dependent on the zzso domain of zzso as mice expressing comparable levels of a zzso zzso zzso have a normal zzso The zzso zzso domain contains several regions of identity with mouse zzso and can interact zzso with mouse zzso signaling zzso These results suggest there is considerable zzso between zzso and zzso on developing zzso with consequences for the stimulation threshold of mature T zzso
