zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso agent because it shows zzso activity in transformed, but not in normal, zzso As with most zzso agents, however, its clinical use is restricted by either inherent or acquired resistance by cancer zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso zzso that antagonize the inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso zzso sensitize previously resistant human cancer cell lines, but not normal cells, to zzso zzso and that they do so in a zzso zzso We further show that the compounds have no zzso as single zzso Also, we demonstrate that several zzso family members likely participate in the zzso of cellular sensitivity to zzso Finally, we note that the compounds that sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL are the most zzso in binding to zzso zzso and in inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies thus describe valuable compounds that allow zzso of the signaling events occurring in TRAIL resistance, and demonstrate that these agents act as potent zzso agents in a variety of cancer cell zzso
