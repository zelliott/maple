In many sexually mature insects egg production and zzso are tightly coupled to zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in the accessory zzso of zzso zzso males and transferred to the female during zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso progression through a putative control point at about stage 9 of zzso Here we show that application of the juvenile hormone analogue zzso mimics the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso progression in sexually mature virgin zzso zzso is induced by zzso in nurse cells of stage 9 egg chambers at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus acts as an zzso of early zzso zzso zzso zzso application of juvenile hormone zzso however, protects early zzso zzso from zzso zzso These results suggest that the balance of these hormones in the zzso regulates whether zzso will progress through the control point at stage 9 or undergo zzso These data are further supported by a molecular analysis of the regulation of zzso protein synthesis and zzso into the zzso by the two zzso We conclude that juvenile hormone is a downstream component in the zzso response cascade and acts by stimulating zzso zzso progression and zzso zzso Since juvenile hormone analogue does not elicit increased zzso and reduced zzso zzso must have an zzso separate effect on these two zzso zzso
