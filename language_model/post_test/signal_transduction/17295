Our previous findings suggest that zzso dysfunction is the mechanism underlying cognitive deficits induced by zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso a natural zzso compound, possesses many important biological zzso Evidence shows that zzso can activate zzso signaling and suppress zzso box protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso Here we investigate whether zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in zzso mice and whether zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction and cognitive deficits through regulating the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso reversed the zzso abnormalities and cognitive deficits induced by zzso in mice through decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and decrease of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated the zzso dysfunction and cognitive deficits through promoting zzso zzso and zzso nuclear exclusion in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso mice, which weakened zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could be recommended as a possible candidate for the prevention and therapy of cognitive deficits in zzso brain zzso
