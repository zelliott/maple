zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso active zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although several proteins have been identified to be zzso of zzso zzso the zzso roles played by zzso in zzso and benign zzso diseases and the molecular mechanisms that are involved are not fully zzso We found that zzso expression zzso the zzso zzso of zzso a type II zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso requires zzso zzso activity to be intact but other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso are not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso or protein zzso of activated zzso zzso inhibitor of activated zzso zzso but zzso strongly zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso regulatory zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso regulatory zzso cooperated to significantly increase zzso from type IV zzso responsive promoters of class II zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso expressed class II zzso and showed enhanced de zzso membrane expression of major zzso complex zzso class II zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells strongly expressed zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the surrounding normal zzso did zzso Thus, zzso is able to zzso and activate zzso This may lead to enhanced zzso class II zzso which may explain why the zzso surrounding zzso zzso are infiltrated with zzso Such immune zzso activity of zzso may also relate to the development of zzso zzso
