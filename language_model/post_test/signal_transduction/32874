Over the past few years a great deal of research has examined how T zzso immune responses are initiated and subsequently zzso zzso of the zzso with an zzso zzso bound to an zzso protein on a professional zzso provides the crucial zzso stimulus required for T cell zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso molecules on zzso zzso a zzso or second signal within the T cell which zzso and sustains T cell zzso initiated through the zzso However, recently it has become clear that T cell immune responses are a result of a balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso that is expressed nearly exclusively on zzso and zzso T zzso Investigation into the role of zzso in the regulation of T cell immune responses has revealed that zzso is a very important zzso involved in the maintenance of T cell zzso In the present review, evidence for the proposed zzso role of zzso is examined and a model suggesting a role for zzso in both early and late stages of T cell zzso is zzso
