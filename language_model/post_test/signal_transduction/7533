The zzso zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of various tumors, and thus, has drawn considerable attention as drug target for cancer zzso Many zzso zzso are now under clinical investment, and one of them - zzso - has been approved by US zzso in 2012 for the treatment of zzso zzso cancer, which further proved the feasibility of zzso zzso method in cancer zzso 

This article briefly outlines the role of zzso in zzso and provides a broad overview of the zzso used to characterize new zzso Then, a series of representative zzso zzso of zzso especially from the published patent literature from 2011 to zzso are zzso zzso the challenges in the zzso inhibitor design, such as the inhibitor selectivity and resistance zzso are also zzso 

Up to now, at least 17 zzso of zzso are under clinical zzso and several agents exhibit encouraging zzso Thus, zzso zzso signaling has major therapeutic value in cancer zzso Focus on the selectivity of both types of zzso with potent selectivity or zzso have demonstrated zzso zzso The network pharmacology and clinical trials integrated would provide powerful tools to further evaluate the superiority of both zzso in continued efficacy and zzso
