zzso zzso signal zzso plays a crucial role in zzso and immune zzso zzso zzso signaling has been validated as a promising molecular target for cancer zzso discovery and zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso zzso was identified from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine zzso zzso used for treatment of cancer zzso While zzso has been shown to have potent zzso activities with low toxicity in various cancer types, the molecular mechanism of action of zzso remains largely zzso Here, we determine the zzso activities of 13 synthetic zzso derivatives zzso against human solid tumor zzso zzso which is the most potent in this series of novel zzso exhibits over zzso increase in biological activity compared to natural zzso Moreover, zzso directly zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso sites also was strongly inhibited in the range of 15 zzso of zzso in human melanoma cells at zzso after zzso Following zzso of zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso of downstream zzso signaling in melanoma zzso zzso also zzso expression of the zzso target proteins zzso zzso associated with induction of zzso In sum, our findings demonstrate that the novel zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of the zzso signaling pathway, providing evidence for a molecular mechanism zzso zzso exerts at least in part the zzso of human melanoma zzso In addition, zzso represents a promising lead compound for development of new zzso for cancer zzso
