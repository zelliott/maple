zzso Y zzso zzso inhibit zzso release by a zzso action at the zzso zzso of rat zzso We have examined the relationship between zzso via zzso zzso calcium channels zzso measured zzso by using the fluorescent calcium indicator zzso and zzso release, measured zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors reduced zzso and thereby inhibited synaptic zzso Multiple calcium channels are involved in synaptic transmission at this zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and unidentified zzso zzso The zzso of each of these calcium channel types contributes to the reduction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors fully zzso the zzso of zzso calcium influx by zzso receptors but not the zzso by zzso zzso suggesting a zzso action for zzso and zzso zzso probably by zzso to the same zzso
