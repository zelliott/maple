zzso zzso A zzso is one of the zzso zzso a group of plasma proteins that increases immensely in concentration during microbial infections and inflammatory conditions, and a close relationship between zzso levels and disease activity in zzso arthritis zzso has been zzso zzso is an inflammatory disease, where zzso play important roles, and zzso is thought to participate in the inflammatory reaction by being a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The biological effects of zzso are reportedly zzso mainly through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a G zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we confirmed the affinity of zzso for zzso by showing that zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso were activated by zzso and that the response was inhibited by the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso activates the zzso zzso and that a reserve pool of receptors is present in storage zzso mobilized by zzso agents such as zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The induced activity was inhibited by zzso zzso indicating the involvement of a zzso However, based on zzso zzso and use of zzso zzso zzso we found the zzso effects in zzso to be independent of zzso Based on these findings, we conclude that zzso signaling in zzso is zzso through a zzso distinct from zzso Future identification and characterization of the zzso zzso could lead to development of novel, therapeutic targets for treatment of zzso
