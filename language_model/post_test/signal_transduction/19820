We have previously shown zzso zzso zzso zzso release from the surface of the zzso zzso Given the zzso of zzso 26 zzso to the zzso areas of the zzso we have tested in a zzso expression system zzso zzso whether zzso may be sensitive to changes in zzso zzso responded to an increase in zzso at constant zzso pH by opening and to a decrease in zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso was partially activated at a zzso zzso of around 40 zzso zzso in isolated patches responded to changes in zzso suggesting direct zzso sensitivity of the zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells was sufficient to zzso them with the capacity to release zzso in a zzso zzso We have examined other zzso expressed zzso for their ability to respond to changes in zzso The closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso also displayed sensitivity to changes in zzso but with slightly different characteristics from zzso The more distant zzso exhibited zzso closing zzso zzso through zzso zzso while zzso displayed no zzso zzso These surprising findings suggest that zzso may play a zzso unappreciated variety of zzso roles, and that zzso and related zzso zzso may impart direct sensitivity to zzso throughout the zzso
