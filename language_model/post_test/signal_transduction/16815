zzso proteins are key regulators of membrane transport in zzso Recent evidence from different species supports the notion that some zzso proteins are crucial for zzso a pivotal procedure for successful cell zzso As a family of zzso small zzso of the Ras zzso the function of zzso proteins is modulated by zzso zzso binding and zzso To investigate the function of zzso zzso creating dominant negative or zzso active zzso forms of a zzso protein is a widely used zzso To study zzso in plant cells, using fluorescent dye to highlight the cell shape and the zzso and to monitor the formation of the newly formed cell plate in zzso cells, is easy and zzso In this chapter, we describe detailed methods for zzso generating transgenic plants expressing dominant negative or zzso active form of zzso zzso fluorescent zzso of cell shape, cell wall, and zzso of zzso root tip zzso zzso fluorescent zzso of newly formed cell zzso and zzso detecting fluorescent signals using zzso zzso zzso zzso in the genetic model plant species zzso zzso
