We have previously shown that the zzso zzso of zzso A3 causes a zzso rise in zzso calcium through the release from zzso stores in suspended human zzso The corresponding free acid was devoid of zzso We now report that the action of the free acid form of zzso A3 is dependent on the type of vehicle used, zzso it is active in releasing calcium when used in an ethanol vehicle but not in zzso The zzso zzso is equally active in either zzso The pattern of calcium release between the free acid and the zzso zzso is zzso zzso Both compounds show a zzso pattern, zzso an initial rapid phase followed by a slow decline in calcium levels but never reaching zzso A3 baseline zzso The zzso zzso appears slightly more potent in the initial phase of calcium release than the free acid zzso zzso zzso zzso free acid zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Both compounds appear to reach the same calcium levels at the plateau of the second prolonged phase zzso zzso zzso zzso free acid zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso zzso (an inhibitor of calcium zzso zzso with the second phase of the curve causing calcium levels to return to normal zzso levels for both zzso zzso of zzso zzso prior to the zzso addition or carrying out the experiments in zzso zzso eliminated the second phase completely, with the calcium peak returning rapidly to normal baseline levels, suggesting that the second phase is due to calcium zzso Again the zzso zzso is more active than the free acid zzso zzso free acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional experiments with zzso zzso zzso of zzso A3 demonstrated that the compound is zzso into the free acid zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso free acid, interfering with its entry into the cell while ethanol does zzso Once inside the cell, zzso interacts with its own zzso to release calcium rapidly from stores, but it also causes a more prolonged influx of calcium from the zzso zzso
