Environmental zzso genetic predisposition and old age are major risk factors for Parkinson's disease zzso Although the zzso underlying selective zzso zzso zzso remain zzso molecular studies in both toxin based models and genetic based models of the disease suggest a major zzso role for zzso dysfunction in the zzso of zzso Further, recent studies have presented clear evidence for a high burden of zzso deletions within the zzso zzso zzso in individuals with zzso Ultimately, an understanding of the molecular events which zzso zzso zzso in idiopathic zzso will enable the development of targeted and effective therapeutic zzso We review recent advances and current understanding of the genetic factors, molecular mechanisms and animal models of zzso
