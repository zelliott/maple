zzso a zzso is an important signaling zzso in the inflammatory zzso zzso of acute lung injury such as zzso zzso factor, and zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso protein B zzso a zzso protein of pulmonary zzso is essential for zzso function and lung zzso In this study we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso gene expression in zzso lung zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels in control and zzso cells after zzso incubation and zzso of zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso promoter activity, indicating that the zzso effects are exerted at the zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments showed that the zzso region is located within the zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and reporter zzso showed that zzso reduced the DNA binding activity and zzso capability of zzso zzso factor 1 zzso a key factor for zzso promoter zzso zzso these data showed that zzso zzso zzso gene expression by reducing the DNA zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C inhibitor zzso and the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partially reversed zzso zzso indicating that protein zzso play important roles in the zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso Chemical zzso of de zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity and zzso levels, suggesting that zzso does not play a role in the zzso
