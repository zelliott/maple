zzso zzso zzso include different inherited diseases that all result in progressive muscle zzso impaired locomotion and often premature zzso The major focus of MD research has been on alleviating the primary genetic deficit - using gene therapy and zzso approaches to promote expression of the deficient or zzso genes in the muscle zzso Although promising, these approaches have not yet entered into clinical practice and zzso for MD patients, there is currently no zzso Thus, the development of complementary and supportive therapies that slow disease progression and improve patients' quality of life is critically zzso The main features of zzso are zzso instability and increased zzso vulnerability to mechanical stress, resulting in zzso zzso zzso with progressive replacement of muscle zzso is a prominent feature in some zzso preventing complete zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso is the leading candidate for zzso zzso and zzso overproduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and their ability to zzso zzso regardless of their origin or zzso In animal models of zzso with prominent muscle fibrosis, zzso treatment has resulted in both prevention of collagen production in young animals and resolution of established zzso in older zzso the reduction in muscle collagen content was associated with improved muscle zzso and major improvements in muscle zzso Recently, these zzso improvements were also observed in MD with minor zzso involvement, probably due to a direct effect of zzso on muscle cells, resulting in zzso fusion that is dependent on zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso improves muscle zzso and muscle functions in various zzso via zzso of muscle zzso on the one hand, and increased zzso fusion on the zzso
