zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling requires the concerted action of both positive and negative zzso While the existence of numerous molecules that stimulate zzso activity has been well zzso direct biological zzso appear to be more limited in number and zzso zzso zzso zzso represents one such zzso zzso was initially identified in zzso zzso and appears to be absent from zzso and the zzso zzso To further investigate zzso function and evolution, we identified zzso zzso within zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a zzso target of zzso signaling during zzso where it acts to zzso zzso activity through an zzso feedback zzso The zzso and zzso portion of zzso is sufficient for its zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso with conservation of its role in zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate a high degree of identity throughout these zzso During formation of the zzso axis zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells in a pattern that reflects the profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also expressed zzso in the zzso zzso cells, supporting a zzso role in zzso zzso zzso this, zzso and transgenic zzso indicate that zzso is functionally interchangeable with zzso zzso we find that the zzso domain contains a region with the highest degree of zzso which we have implicated in zzso zzso and dubbed the zzso tail zzso zzso
