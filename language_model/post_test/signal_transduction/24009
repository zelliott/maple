zzso disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disease caused by zzso zzso expansion in the protein zzso zzso zzso in HD seems to involve the formation of zzso zzso inclusions and the abnormal regulation of zzso and signal zzso To identify previously zzso zzso proteins in a simple model system, we used a zzso zzso screen with a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso We found a predicted zzso domain protein zzso that interacts with zzso zzso in zzso zzso A human zzso of zzso is the zzso protein 4 zzso a protein involved in zzso and zzso syndrome zzso signal zzso zzso zzso in zzso with full-length zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso severity in the zzso of HD patients and partially zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also was observed in Western zzso from human HD brain zzso The zzso of zzso induced the death of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso and cellular toxicity may have a role in HD zzso
