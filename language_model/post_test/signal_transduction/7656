The zzso zzso family of proteins includes important regulators of downstream signaling initiated by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso proteins in zzso signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso family zzso zzso genes significantly reduced sustained zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Because expression of zzso was efficiently induced by zzso in zzso human zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso we further investigated the role of zzso in the growth and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased the growth of zzso zzso In contrast, expression of a dominant negative form of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell zzso In addition, expression of zzso reduced zzso zzso outgrowth of zzso cells, whereas expression of zzso enhanced zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso regulates zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso
