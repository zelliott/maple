The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso degrading zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso expression is driven by inflammatory zzso and has been suggested as the link between inflammation and a zzso deficit in zzso Studies also indicate that inflammatory zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso representing another mechanism by which inflammation could influence zzso zzso Here we examined circulating zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the acute phase protein zzso alongside plasma zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and whole blood zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in patients with major depressive disorder zzso compared with age and zzso zzso zzso no changes in zzso or zzso were observed, plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were increased in the depressed zzso Despite this inflammatory zzso zzso expression or plasma zzso were not significantly different between zzso patients and zzso In addition, there was no difference between controls and zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso or in expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso that drive their zzso Nonetheless, a depletion in zzso was evident in depressed patients and was correlated with zzso zzso In addition, we failed to observe any difference in zzso zzso expression in the blood cells from patients with zzso relative to zzso These data support the idea that a mild inflammatory signature is evident in zzso and is accompanied by reduced circulating zzso zzso However, we found no indication of zzso zzso in the depressed cohort suggesting that an alternative mechanism mediates the depletion of zzso zzso Taken together these data question the ability of the mild inflammatory zzso observed in depression to induce molecules such as zzso and zzso that could zzso impact upon zzso zzso
