Renal zzso is a major site for production and action of zzso zzso The zzso zzso functions as well as structural integrity are in part dependent on zzso under certain zzso or zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are both abundantly expressed in zzso inner zzso at zzso state, raising a question of which zzso zzso may mediate the known functions of zzso in the zzso As in many other cell types, zzso expression in zzso zzso is unlikely subject to robust zzso In contrast, zzso expression in zzso zzso is markedly zzso by chronic salt zzso zzso and zzso in zzso At cellular levels, the zzso pathways responsible for the zzso stimulation in zzso zzso cells seem to involve both the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso It is likely that in response to various insults that are zzso to zzso zzso the induction of PG synthesis may become more dependent on zzso than zzso and this phenomenon may be relevant to the zzso response against the zzso
