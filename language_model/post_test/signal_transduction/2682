The development of zzso to many natural product zzso drugs, termed zzso resistance zzso is a serious limitation to cancer zzso zzso is often associated with zzso of the zzso gene product, zzso a zzso drug zzso zzso the mechanisms that regulate the zzso zzso of zzso may afford a means of reducing or eliminating zzso We have found that zzso expression can be modulated by type I zzso protein zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may be modulated by selectively zzso zzso activity to effect zzso of zzso zzso factors which may be involved in zzso zzso High levels of type I zzso occur in primary breast zzso and patients exhibiting this zzso show decreased zzso The selective type I zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be particularly useful for zzso zzso and inhibit transient expression of a reporter gene under the control of zzso promoter zzso Thus, investigations of the zzso pathways involved in zzso regulation of zzso may lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing the expression of zzso and provide a focus for pharmacological zzso
