To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso on the growth of transplanted Morris zzso zzso in zzso in zzso 

21 Buffalo rats were randomly zzso into 4 groups, including one blank control group zzso zzso zzso one group for zzso control zzso zzso zzso and 2 experimental groups with zzso zzso zzso 6) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was fed to the rats for 4 weeks immediately after Morris zzso zzso was implanted in both zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were examined by flow zzso zzso and zzso expression in tumor cells was detected by Western zzso and zzso 

zzso weights of zzso treated group were less than those of the control zzso less than zzso the zzso rate was zzso The results of Western zzso and zzso showed that in zzso tumor zzso expression of zzso zzso protein was zzso the expression of zzso was zzso the percentage of zzso positive cells and the ratio of zzso were increased zzso less than zzso 

zzso can inhibit tumor growth, possibly via the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso as well as modulating the immune zzso
