During early development, zzso factors have been shown to be important for key events of coronary zzso including formation of the zzso zzso zzso factors are required for coronary vascular zzso zzso however, the role of zzso localized zzso in this process has not been zzso The current study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso controls coronary zzso focusing on the role of zzso zzso in establishing the zzso zzso during early coronary zzso To address the role of zzso zzso we zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors specifically from the mouse zzso and found that the number of zzso cells in the zzso was drastically reduced, and zzso coronary vascular zzso formation was significantly zzso Here we present evidence for a novel role for zzso zzso factors in controlling zzso formation by recruiting zzso cells to the zzso
