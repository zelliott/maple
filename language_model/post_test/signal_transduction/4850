The discovery of zzso zzso as gene regulators has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of zzso gene regulation in plants and zzso zzso have emerged as master regulators of plant growth and zzso Evidence suggesting that zzso play a role in plant stress responses arises from the discovery that zzso targets genes with known roles in stress zzso In addition, the expression profiles of most zzso that are implicated in plant growth and development are significantly altered during zzso These later findings imply that attenuated plant growth and development under stress may be under the control of zzso zzso Here we review recent progress in the understanding of zzso plant stress zzso
