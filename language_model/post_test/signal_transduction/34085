zzso trafficking and zzso dynamics are important cellular processes that drive tip growth in root zzso These processes interact with a multitude of signaling pathways that allow for the efficient transfer of information to specify the direction in which tip growth zzso Here, we show that zzso a class I zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is important for maintaining straight growth in zzso zzso zzso root zzso since zzso in the zzso gene resulted in zzso root hair zzso Live cell imaging of growing zzso root hairs revealed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso filaments extending into the extreme zzso The zzso zzso and pattern of zzso distribution in root hairs of zzso partially resembled that of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso Root hairs of double zzso zzso zzso were more severely zzso compared with single zzso zzso trafficking as revealed by a fluorescent zzso marker was slightly zzso and zzso stacks frequently zzso into the extreme root hair zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of green fluorescent zzso in tobacco zzso zzso zzso cells labeled zzso bodies that partially zzso with the zzso marker zzso while zzso fluorescent protein associated with zzso zzso A rescued the zzso of zzso indicating that the altered activity of an zzso zzso zzso factor contributes to the defective growth, zzso trafficking, and zzso organization of zzso root zzso We propose that zzso a regulator of membrane trafficking, and zzso a zzso zzso are components of zzso signaling pathways that affect zzso organization to specify growth orientation in zzso root zzso
