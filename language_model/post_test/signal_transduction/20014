Changes in the mechanical environment are a universal challenge for cells, and mechanical cues regulate tissue structure and cell physiology throughout zzso zzso is an important zzso pathway, fulfilling a wide range of roles in survival, zzso and zzso The two are connected, and in zzso zzso is rapidly induced in cells exposed to mechanical zzso In zzso zzso is also induced in several medically relevant circumstances that are also under mechanical stress such as bone and muscle zzso and tissue zzso The induction of zzso has wide-ranging effects on zzso In this article, I propose that the zzso response to mechanical stress is an important factor in a wide range of both zzso and pathological zzso
