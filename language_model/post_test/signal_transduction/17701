Central zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso for each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in the cells by zzso However, zzso protein in zzso cells was not detected by Western zzso The zzso zzso markedly decreased the expression of the zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso is in direct contrast to its previously published effects on zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso the expression of zzso but not zzso and on zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso zzso We suggest that these differences in the ability of zzso to induce or repress zzso and zzso are due to differences in zzso zzso or zzso signaling pathways in these zzso The abnormal translation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was ascribed to some zzso in the processing of the zzso zzso zzso with this idea is the finding that zzso zzso was translated in zzso zzso cells when the zzso zzso required no zzso before translation zzso
