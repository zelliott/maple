The extent to which zzso zzso zzso calcium signals are localized is a critical zzso for understanding the mechanism of zzso zzso The spatial characteristics of zzso calcium signals were determined by targeting a zzso calcium indicator to zzso zzso through the in zzso addition of a zzso zzso zzso Elementary zzso events observed with this indicator typically lasted less than 33 zzso had diameters less than 2 zzso and were zzso from each other by the calcium buffer zzso zzso calcium zzso are likely to result from synchronized triggering of such local release events, suggesting that zzso zzso proteins could be selectively activated by zzso near sites of local calcium zzso
