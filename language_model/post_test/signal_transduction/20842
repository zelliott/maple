The term zzso zzso refers to the mechanisms that transform chemical information into electrical zzso With the zzso technique it is possible to record those signals and to zzso something about the mechanism that produced zzso The direct zzso of a zzso channel by zzso is the final step in producing the zzso zzso zzso Because it occupies a critical position in the zzso process, zzso of the zzso channel's activity provide useful insights into the molecular processes underlying zzso zzso In addition to its zzso by zzso and zzso the channel is modulated by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso all at zzso zzso These effects are probably important in promoting signal zzso An unusual feature of this channel is its termination zzso can remain active for hundreds of milliseconds after the zzso has been zzso This is likely to add to the zzso properties of the zzso sensory zzso
