zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso whose zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso are reminiscent of the zzso zzso sequence of classical zzso zzso Both proteins contain an zzso zzso domain which is responsible for their association to zzso of the early zzso zzso zzso facing the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso is mostly at the zzso zzso of zzso is modestly zzso by several stresses zzso zzso and zzso in a manner dependent on the zzso zzso Some of these stresses also zzso zzso expression under the control of the zzso zzso zzso The N zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the expression of both genes along with protein zzso zzso lacking both zzso display reduced sensitivity to zzso although the drug is still able to manifest its zzso effect on a reporter zzso zzso and zzso have measurable zzso activity in zzso which is increased in the presence of zzso Both zzso could be responsible for the regulation of the zzso zzso state at the zzso conditions of the early zzso zzso zzso However, the differences in location and expression responses against stresses suggest that their functions are not totally zzso
