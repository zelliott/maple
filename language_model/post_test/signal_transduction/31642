The common zzso zzso zzso signal through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and play pivotal roles in zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso drugs targeting this pathway, the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso as part of a phase 2 zzso 

After zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined in T cells of de zzso kidney transplantation patients treated with zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso by zzso was determined in zzso zzso and zzso T cells from healthy individuals zzso 

zzso was 26, 72, and 37 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso T cells, zzso and 35, 61, and 76 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso T cells, zzso In kidney transplantation patients, 7 days after starting zzso treatment, zzso zzso was inhibited in zzso T cells zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso which persisted for the zzso study zzso In contrast, zzso treatment did not affect zzso or zzso zzso only zzso zzso was reduced by zzso on day 7 and recovered to zzso levels within 2 zzso zzso T cells showed a comparable profile to zzso T zzso zzso was not inhibited in zzso control zzso 

zzso therapy strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring offers a unique tool to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso zzso
