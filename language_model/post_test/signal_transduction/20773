We recently described the cloning of a fifth member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso class that zzso zzso zzso namely the human zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the present study we have examined in greater detail the functional zzso of the zzso zzso in two different cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso response zzso by zzso was significantly greater in zzso as compared to zzso cells, whereas the zzso values were zzso To investigate the relationship between zzso occupancy and zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso receptors in zzso cells (and hence the degree of zzso zzso we used the irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response required only about zzso zzso occupancy, consistent with a zzso reserve of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) for zzso zzso of zzso Despite the presence of such a high degree of zzso reserve, a range of intrinsic activities was displayed by structurally diverse classes of zzso For example, zzso and zzso were as zzso as zzso itself and thus acted as full zzso whereas zzso and zzso behaved as partial zzso and as shown previously zzso et zzso zzso zzso was a silent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also investigated zzso of additional signal zzso pathways by the zzso zzso and found that the responses differ in the two cell lines with respect to stimulation of zzso zzso For example, in zzso cells no zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed even at very high zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells zzso of zzso as low as 10 zzso induced stimulation of zzso and a rapid increase of zzso The zzso zzso failed to alter zzso acid release in either cell zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso in zzso cells was modest, averaging about zzso above zzso The increases of zzso and zzso required zzso zzso less than one order of magnitude greater than those zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, 55 and 8 zzso respectively), and both responses were blocked by 100 zzso zzso All three responses zzso zzso and zzso were sensitive to zzso toxin zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso in these signal zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
