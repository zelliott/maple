Although zzso has known zzso effects against adverse cardiovascular conditions, little is known about its effects on zzso contracting factor zzso zzso We aimed to determine the effects of zzso on the production of and responses to zzso in superior zzso arteries isolated from rats at the chronic stage of type 2 zzso 

zzso to zzso zzso were examined in superior zzso artery rings from aged type 2 diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats zzso zzso from control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats and from zzso zzso , zzso daily for zzso zzso zzso zzso artery expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also the level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso for zzso were detected by Western zzso 

zzso from zzso rats exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso which were inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso reductions in the zzso release of both zzso and zzso and zzso increased zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso arteries from zzso rats treated with zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso contraction, zzso suppressed zzso zzso production and zzso generation and zzso reduced zzso zzso protein zzso 

These results suggest that zzso exerts beneficial effects against abnormal zzso zzso by suppressing zzso and promoting zzso activity in the zzso arteries of rats at the chronic stage of type 2 zzso
