In plants, zzso and zzso control the defense responses to multiple zzso including insect zzso Among the defense proteins known to be regulated by zzso is zzso insect resistance zzso zzso zzso This protein is zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, its abundance significantly increases during fall zzso zzso zzso zzso Within 1 h of zzso by fall zzso zzso accumulates at the feeding site and continues to increase in abundance until 24 h without any increase in its transcript zzso zzso To resolve this zzso and zzso the role of zzso and zzso in the signaling of zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso and perception zzso on zzso expression were zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction examination of zzso levels in these treated plants demonstrate that zzso zzso is regulated by both transcript abundance and protein expression zzso The results also suggest that zzso functions upstream of zzso in the zzso expression pathway, allowing for both low-level zzso expression and a zzso defensive response, an immediate response involving zzso zzso and a delayed response inducing zzso transcript zzso
