zzso protein zzso plays an important role in the regulation of many different zzso such as cell growth, zzso migration, zzso and zzso Identification of zzso zzso proteins by means of zzso analysis provides insight into signal zzso pathways that are activated in response to, for example, growth factor stimulation or zzso zzso This review summarizes recent advances made in the field of zzso and provides examples of how zzso techniques can be combined to zzso investigate the dynamic changes in protein zzso in zzso By linking experimental data to clinical data zzso disease progression or response to zzso new disease markers could be identified, which could then be validated for applications in disease diagnosis and progression or prediction of a response to zzso
