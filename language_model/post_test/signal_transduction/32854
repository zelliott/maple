The hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso cells control spontaneous tone in isolated guinea pig zzso preparations was zzso zzso preparations were unable to develop a normal zzso tone in zzso oxygen zzso to systemic zzso oxygen zzso and, instead, developed a strong, smooth tone, similar to the zzso tone in zzso zzso zzso of the hydrogen zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells by 20 zzso zzso zzso transformed, in intact preparations in zzso zzso the tone from a strong, smooth type to an zzso tone of considerably less zzso Similar experiments in zzso preparations showed no change of tone and no zzso After zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso (1 zzso addition of 2 zzso hydrogen zzso to intact preparations displaying the zzso tone caused a transformation to a strong, smooth zzso These findings support the hypothesis that the spontaneous tone in this preparation is largely controlled by the zzso zzso zzso For the first time, previous findings on isolated cells can be linked to effects in intact tissue zzso The results also suggest that the regulation by the zzso cells involves the release of powerful relaxing and contracting factors from the zzso
