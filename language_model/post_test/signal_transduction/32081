zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso located within the mature central nervous system may remain zzso zzso or differentiate into zzso Human zzso zzso tumors often contain rapidly zzso zzso lineage zzso factor 2 zzso cells that resemble zzso In this study, we sought to identify candidate pathways that promote zzso differentiation or zzso rather than zzso Gene expression profiling conducted in both normal zzso zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso cells identified all the transcripts associated with the highly zzso state of these cells and showed that among the various cell types found within the brain, zzso tumor cells are most similar to zzso We then zzso zzso transcripts found in tumor samples from those found in normal brain samples and identified 28 zzso transcripts as candidates for promoting differentiation or zzso zzso analysis of human zzso data revealed that these genes have similar expression profiles in human tumors and were significantly enriched in zzso zzso suggesting an zzso zzso Treatment of primary zzso zzso cells with zzso of one candidate zzso zzso resulted in a decreased number of zzso Together, our findings show that comparison of the molecular zzso of zzso cells in tumors to the equivalent cells in the normal brain represents a novel approach for the identification of targeted zzso
