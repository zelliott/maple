zzso also known as zzso duct cancer, is the second most common primary zzso zzso with a median survival of less than 2 zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this disease are not zzso To survey activated zzso zzso signaling in zzso we employed zzso profiling coupled to mass zzso and identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso along with over 1,000 zzso zzso sites from about 750 different proteins in primary zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso (2 out of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso transforming ability both in zzso and in zzso and is responsive to its zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target and for a diagnostic molecular marker in zzso The identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso along with the presence of other zzso zzso zzso in lung cancer and glioblastoma, suggests that a more broadly based screen for activated zzso zzso in cancer is zzso
