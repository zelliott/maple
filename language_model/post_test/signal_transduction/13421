zzso transforming growth zzso zzso activity in zzso contributes to the development of diabetic zzso zzso stimulation of zzso activity and zzso synthesis are dependent on zzso zzso 1 zzso to convert zzso zzso to its biologically active zzso The mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso are not zzso High zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and decreased NO increases zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso Yet, the impact of NO signaling on zzso zzso of zzso is zzso We tested the role of NO signaling in the regulation of zzso expression and zzso zzso activity in rat zzso cells exposed to high zzso On exposure to 30 zzso zzso NO zzso in the zzso media and zzso zzso levels were significantly zzso The addition of an NO donor prevented the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of the NO donor were blocked by zzso (a soluble zzso zzso zzso or zzso (an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso These effects of high zzso were also reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that high zzso mediates increases in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso
