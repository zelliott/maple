Loss or zzso of the zzso gene are associated with increased risk of breast and zzso zzso and with prostate cancer zzso zzso Previously, we identified zzso as a target of zzso zzso which increases zzso sensitivity in human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso Considering that zzso is a crucial target in cancer therapy, in this work we investigated zzso role in the regulation of zzso of zzso 

We performed reverse zzso quantitative zzso zzso western zzso and zzso zzso to analyze zzso and/or zzso expression in response to ultraviolet or zzso exposure in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein recruitment to zzso promoter was studied by zzso zzso To assess expression of zzso and/or zzso target zzso we used a panel of zzso zzso cell zzso We finally analyzed these genes in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found that zzso was highly induced by zzso in zzso zzso however, this response was totally abolished in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso protein associates to zzso promoter after DNA damage in the presence of zzso Additionally, we demonstrated that zzso and/or zzso zzso genes involved in DNA damage and cell cycle regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso in zzso cells increased tumor growth and modulated these genes in zzso 

Although zzso zzso zzso in a zzso independent manner, zzso abolished zzso induction in response to DNA zzso In addition, several important zzso targets are modulated by zzso and zzso Altogether, these data might be important to understand the therapy response of zzso zzso
