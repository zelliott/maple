The movements of zzso within cells in response to external stimuli are zzso Internal zzso release activated by zzso zzso zzso is now widely zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso release, the identity and control of the zzso zzso pool and its relationship to other internal and external zzso pools all remain zzso We have characterized a highly sensitive and specific zzso zzso mechanism that zzso rapid and profound movements of zzso zzso via a mechanism distinct from that activated by zzso Using zzso neural or smooth muscle cells, application of zzso zzso of zzso zzso rapid release of zzso from a compartment that contains within it the zzso zzso zzso Although of similar zzso as zzso events, the apparent dependence on zzso zzso and blockade by zzso gamma S suggest a mechanism distinct from those zzso by known zzso Recent experiments in the presence of zzso reveal rapid and profound zzso zzso of zzso via a mechanism with identical zzso sensitivity and specificity to zzso zzso zzso These results were interpreted to suggest that zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso between different compartments distinguished by zzso zzso zzso release probably occurs via a similar mechanism except involving transfer between closed compartments and zzso zzso (perhaps the plasma zzso Recently, it has been revealed that zzso activates a zzso of zzso into the zzso pool from which zzso zzso zzso This is an important observation suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso process may control entry into and hence the size of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, it is possible that zzso zzso release observed in zzso cells reflects a reversal of the zzso that functions in intact cells to permit external zzso entry into the zzso zzso This type of process could mediate the longer-term zzso or zzso responses to external receptors which are known to be dependent on external zzso
