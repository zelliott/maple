Zipper zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein localized to the nucleus which exhibits zzso zzso activity and is associated with the stress dependent signal zzso zzso zzso forms zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso factors such as the zzso zzso responsive element binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso cells results in zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso and prevents zzso acid induced differentiation of the cells to zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso neural differentiation of zzso cells partly due to its zzso effect on zzso zzso
