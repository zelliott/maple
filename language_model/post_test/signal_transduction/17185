The notion that diabetic zzso is the leading cause of zzso zzso prompted us to investigate the effects of blood zzso fluctuation zzso under high zzso condition on kidney in the zzso 

The diabetic and zzso animal models were established in this zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis were applied to detect the expression of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso treatment increased type I collagen synthesis by two times compared with the zzso The expression of zzso was reduced markedly while zzso synthesis was enhanced after zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a significant increase in the mice treated with zzso Furthermore, zzso can markedly zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso showed zzso increases compared with the only diabetic zzso However, zzso levels were unchanged after zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso can accelerate the trend of kidney zzso in diabetic mice by increasing collagen production and zzso collagen zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways seem to play a role in the development of kidney zzso accelerated by blood zzso zzso
