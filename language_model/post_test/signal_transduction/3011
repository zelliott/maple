The consolidation of zzso fear involves zzso of genes necessary for long-term memory zzso An important question remains as to whether this results in part from zzso regulation and zzso zzso We examined whether zzso which is required for memory formation, is necessary for zzso cued fear zzso whether it is downstream of zzso zzso and whether this zzso zzso zzso modifications for zzso zzso zzso We initially found that zzso zzso mice exhibited deficits in cued fear conditioning (5 zzso presentations with 70 zzso 6 zzso tones and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We then demonstrated that: zzso zzso zzso increases after fear conditioning in zzso within both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso it increases after zzso application to primary zzso and zzso cultures in zzso and zzso these increases are dependent on zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso we found that both in zzso and in zzso zzso result in decreases in zzso promoter zzso zzso in zzso cells but increases in zzso promoter zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, no changes were observed in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by sodium zzso enhanced contextual but not cued fear conditioning and enhanced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso These data provide evidence for dynamic zzso regulation of zzso following zzso plasticity and during a zzso learning zzso Furthermore, zzso of this gene may be regulated through distinct zzso modifications in the zzso and zzso
