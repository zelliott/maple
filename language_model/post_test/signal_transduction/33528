zzso zzso network structures and functions in zzso organisms is an emerging goal of functional zzso We describe the zzso network of three core zzso processes in the genetic model plant zzso zzso fatty acid zzso starch metabolism and zzso acid zzso zzso 

These zzso networks form zzso populated by genes coding for zzso that represent the reactions generally considered to define each zzso However, the zzso also incorporate a wider set of genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulatory zzso We tested zzso the hypothesis that one of the genes tightly zzso with starch metabolism zzso a putative zzso zzso will have a role in this zzso Indeed, knockout lines of zzso have an altered starch zzso In addition, the zzso data define a novel zzso zzso structure associated with zzso in which genes performing smaller, more specific tasks appear to be recruited into zzso zzso with a broader zzso zzso 

Each of these core zzso pathways is structured as a module of zzso transcripts that zzso over a wide range of environmental and genetic zzso and zzso zzso and represent an expanded set of zzso associated with the common task of supporting the functionality of each zzso zzso As zzso demonstrated, zzso analysis can provide a rich approach towards understanding gene zzso
