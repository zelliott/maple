zzso zzso zzso zzso numerous zzso systems involved in the initiation and maintenance of zzso Bone cells play a critical role in the progression of arthritis, and some of the effects of zzso on inflammation may be zzso via these zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of zzso disruption of zzso signaling on joint zzso cartilage damage, and bone metabolism in the zzso mouse serum transfer model of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signaling was disrupted in zzso through transgenic zzso of zzso zzso type 2 under the control of a type I collagen zzso Arthritis was induced in 5-week-old male transgenic mice and their zzso zzso zzso and paw swelling was assessed daily until the mice were zzso The mice were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and serum was analyzed for zzso zzso hormone, and zzso 

Acute arthritis developed in both transgenic and zzso mice treated with zzso mouse zzso However, the arthritis and local inflammatory activity were significantly attenuated in transgenic mice, as judged by clinical and zzso zzso of inflammation and cartilage zzso Bone turnover and bone volume remained unchanged in zzso transgenic mice, while zzso mice exhibited zzso bone zzso suppressed zzso activity, and significantly reduced bone volume, compatible with the known effects of active inflammation on zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso tended to be lower in zzso transgenic mice than in control transgenic zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling in zzso significantly zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso arthritis in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso the zzso inflammatory response via a zzso zzso
