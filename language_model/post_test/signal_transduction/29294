The mouse zzso zzso is the only zzso organ capable of complete zzso upon zzso zzso making it zzso suited for in zzso gene function studies through zzso gene zzso A hurdle that has challenged the widespread adoption of this technique has been the inability to zzso zzso stem cells zzso We have overcome this limitation by infecting total primary zzso zzso cells in suspension with zzso zzso zzso cells gave rise to all major cell types of the zzso zzso and were capable of zzso outgrowth and functional differentiation in serial zzso To demonstrate that this method is a valuable alternative to developing transgenic animals, we used zzso zzso zzso to replicate zzso zzso zzso and used a zzso zzso zzso of zzso to reveal a requirement for zzso signaling during zzso zzso zzso this method is also zzso to zzso of cells from other zzso
