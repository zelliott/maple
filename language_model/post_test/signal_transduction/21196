We have cloned two zzso of the mouse zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso tails, produced through alternative zzso To determine the functional differences between the two zzso we examined the role of the zzso in regulation of the zzso zzso using zzso canine kidney cells expressing these zzso The zzso zzso zzso induced stress fiber formation, independent of an zzso while the zzso zzso zzso induced stress fiber zzso zzso toxin did not prevent stress fiber zzso This signaling zzso is zzso by zzso because zzso zzso zzso inhibited stress fiber zzso zzso the zzso significance of these zzso of the zzso zzso may lie in their different zzso dependency in zzso stress fiber formation via a zzso zzso G zzso
