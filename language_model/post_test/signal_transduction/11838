The functional analysis of genes from the model zzso zzso zzso has provided invaluable information for many cellular and zzso or zzso zzso including zzso The zzso aspect of zzso immunity is the zzso zzso response, first recognized in zzso This pioneering work led to a remarkable series of findings over the next 30 years, ranging from the identification and characterization of the zzso peptides produced, to the deciphering of the zzso pathways zzso the genes that zzso them and, ultimately, to the discovery of the receptors sensing zzso These studies on an insect model coincided with a revival of the field of innate zzso and had an unanticipated impact on the biomedical zzso
