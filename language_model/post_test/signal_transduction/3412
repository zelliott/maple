Previous studies reported that zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso zzso Here, we evaluated the zzso effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of dietary administration of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso sodium zzso colitis in zzso The mice were fed a diet supplemented with either zzso or zzso prior to zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso administration was more effective than zzso in preventing the zzso of colon length and the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in mouse colon zzso by zzso Our study observes that zzso treatment inhibited zzso 3 zzso 9 zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, zzso with zzso decreased the zzso zzso levels by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also found that treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso expression via zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling and zzso of zzso factor 2 zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso Moreover, dietary feeding with zzso markedly reduced zzso colon cancer in zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time the in zzso zzso efficacy and molecular mechanisms of dietary zzso against inflammatory zzso disease zzso and potentially colon cancer associated with zzso These findings provide insight into the biological actions of zzso and might establish a molecular basis for the development of new cancer zzso zzso
