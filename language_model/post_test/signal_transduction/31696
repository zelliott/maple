The sensory zzso and zzso of the zzso root zzso zzso arise from neural crest cells in the developing zzso zzso In mouse and zzso zzso formation is completed during zzso In contrast, zzso continue to add zzso and zzso to the zzso into adulthood, long after neural crest migration is zzso The molecular and cellular regulation of late zzso growth in the zzso remains to be zzso 

In the present study, we use transgenic zzso lines to examine zzso addition during zzso zzso zzso zzso addition is continuous over the period of zzso zzso zzso experiments support the hypothesis that new zzso are added from a population of resident, neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was used to assess the role of this signaling zzso in zzso zzso An increase in the number of zzso zzso is seen when zzso signaling is inhibited during both early and late zzso zzso 

zzso growth of the zzso zzso comes about, in part, by addition of new zzso from a resident zzso population, a process regulated by zzso zzso
