We have developed a zzso culture model for the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and adult rat zzso root zzso This zzso was used zzso for zzso We zzso for the presence of zzso zzso zzso molecules known to be involved in zzso growth and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and several molecules involved in the control of zzso dynamics and zzso during zzso growth were found, but zzso for zzso zzso zzso and cell surface zzso molecules were zzso zzso of zzso zzso by means of zzso showed that the transcript is present at the same level in zzso newborn and adult zzso Using the zzso reporter zzso we showed that there is local translation of zzso in zzso the rate being increased by zzso zzso down of zzso zzso by zzso inhibited the zzso of new zzso growth cones after in zzso zzso indicating that local translation of zzso molecules is important for successful zzso zzso
