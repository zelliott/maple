zzso zzso have the ability to act as zzso of the innate immune response in zzso Complex and largely unresolved perception systems exist for zzso on the plant cell surfaces that lead to the zzso of multiple zzso defense signaling zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the perception mechanism of cultured zzso zzso cells towards zzso from zzso zzso zzso with regard to the role of protein zzso during signal zzso responses to gain a better understanding of the zzso perception of zzso zzso signals in plant zzso In zzso labeling of protein zzso events during signal zzso indicated the rapid zzso of several proteins with the zzso of two proteins of 28 and 2 zzso zzso zzso differences and de zzso zzso zzso were also observed with two-dimensional zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso totally inhibited the zzso zzso response induced by zzso while the zzso burst was only partially inhibited by zzso zzso of protein zzso activity by zzso A intensified the zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and signal zzso responses during zzso zzso of tobacco cells require a balance between the actions of certain protein zzso and protein zzso
