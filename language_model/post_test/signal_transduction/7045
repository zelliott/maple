zzso organisms have serially repeated structures zzso that become specialized in some segments zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and trachea have a zzso origin and can convert into each zzso The zzso zzso tubes develop from ten trunk zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in the zzso and zzso form the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The early zzso and trachea gene networks are similar, with zzso and zzso genes inducing their zzso The initial zzso of the trachea and the zzso zzso is zzso but zzso of Snail in the zzso zzso an zzso transition zzso after which the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coalesce and migrate zzso joining the zzso zzso to form the ring zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and respiratory zzso arose through an extreme process of divergent evolution from a zzso repeated zzso
