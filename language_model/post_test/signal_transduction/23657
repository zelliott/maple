The zzso effect of zzso is generally attributed to zzso of zzso zzso and suppression of zzso stress, but recent studies showed that zzso also activates zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Yet, the significance and regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso two zzso targets of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso remains zzso Here we investigated the zzso relationship between the zzso signaling zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso in primary rat cortical zzso and zzso Our results show that zzso induced zzso and zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso also protected zzso against zzso in a zzso and zzso manner without affecting zzso zzso In contrast, at least a zzso higher concentration of zzso was needed to induce zzso production and zzso activity in zzso for protection of zzso Moreover, only zzso zzso zzso but not zzso expression requires zzso while zzso signaling had little role in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest distinct mechanisms of zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso for zzso and provide new insights into the mechanisms and potential of zzso in treating brain injury in zzso
