zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to invoke potent zzso protection in animal studies and recent clinical zzso Although the important role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso afforded by local zzso is well zzso our understanding of the zzso zzso of zzso remains zzso We therefore examined the hypothesis that the zzso protection afforded by zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso of which is associated with nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was induced in mice using four cycles of 5 zzso of zzso and 5 zzso of zzso of the zzso using a zzso This led to reduced zzso size (19 zzso zzso in zzso compared with 39 zzso zzso in zzso zzso improved functional recovery and reduced zzso after global zzso zzso injury using a zzso mouse heart zzso These effects were reversed by zzso with an inhibitor of zzso zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis demonstrated that, compared with control, zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, resulting in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and its zzso to the zzso Finally, zzso increased the expression of zzso target genes involved in zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we show for the first time that the zzso protection afforded by zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso pathway, zzso of which is associated with nuclear zzso of zzso and the zzso of its downstream targets zzso and zzso involved in cell zzso
