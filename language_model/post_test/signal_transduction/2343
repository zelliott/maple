Recent findings in auditory research have significantly changed our views of the processes involved in zzso Novel techniques and new approaches to investigate the zzso zzso have expanded our knowledge about the mechanical events occurring at zzso relevant stimulus zzso zzso performed in the zzso zzso regions demonstrate that although there is a change in the mechanical responses along the zzso the fundamental characteristics are similar across the frequency zzso The mechanical responses to sound stimulation exhibit tuning properties comparable to those measured zzso or from nerve zzso zzso in the mechanical responses have now clearly been observed at all cochlear zzso The mechanics of the zzso are vulnerable, and dramatic changes are seen especially when the sensory hair cells are affected, for example, following acoustic zzso or exposure to zzso compounds such as zzso The results suggest that there is a sharply tuned and vulnerable response related to the hair cells, superimposed on a more zzso broadly tuned zzso Studies of the zzso zzso down to the cellular level have demonstrated significant differences zzso across the hearing organ and have provided new information on the important mechanical interactions with the zzso zzso There is now ample evidence of reverse zzso in the auditory zzso zzso the zzso does not only receive and detect mechanical stimuli but can itself produce mechanical zzso zzso it has been shown that electrical stimulation elicits motion within the zzso very similar to that evoked by zzso In addition, the presence of zzso zzso of the hearing organ have now been demonstrated by several zzso
