To investigate the effects of soybean zzso on zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso zzso signal zzso in the zzso of rats with Alzheimer's disease zzso 

zzso rat model was established by bilateral zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso Sixty rats were equally zzso into 5 groups, zzso the model group, the high dose soybean zzso group (at the daily dose of 30 zzso the low dose soybean zzso group (at the daily dose of 10 zzso the zzso group (at the daily dose of zzso zzso and the zzso control zzso Three days after modeling 2 zzso soybean zzso or zzso was respectively zzso to rats in the high dose soybean zzso group, the low dose soybean zzso group, and the zzso group by zzso Equal volume of zzso zzso was administered to rats in the model group and the zzso zzso The treatment lasted for 21 zzso The contents of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso were measured by zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were measured by zzso zzso 

Compared with the model group, soybean zzso could significantly decrease the contents of zzso and zzso the activity of zzso and the zzso level of zzso in the zzso of zzso model rats zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso inflammatory signal zzso in the zzso of zzso rats, zzso the inflammatory zzso reduce the zzso of zzso and resist the zzso of zzso zzso
