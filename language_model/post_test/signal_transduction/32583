The effect of exercise on the skeleton is to initiate an zzso response so that high levels of activity induce increased bone formation, while disuse results in bone zzso This response tunes bone mass to an appropriate level with sufficient strength but not excessive mass, which would be energetically costly to build, zzso or zzso Interest in effects of exercise on bone stems from the prevalence of diseases that feature zzso zzso functionally inappropriate bone loss, such as zzso If exercise regimens can be specified that maximize bone mass in early life, then even after the catastrophic loss at menopause, the bone mass of women may remain above the threshold for zzso In addition, fuller understanding of the cascade of cellular events that follow loading of bone cells provides target processes for pharmacological mimicry of the effects of exercise in zzso Our studies therefore address these two areas, first to identify components of loading regimens that are zzso and second to identify novel genes which are regulated by zzso These studies have led directly to our work identifying expression of zzso zzso receptors in bone and the intriguing possibility that zzso communication in bone may share numerous similarities with zzso in the central nervous zzso
