zzso 1 cells, a human zzso cell line established from a patient with zzso zzso zzso produce zzso such as zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso stimulating zzso In the present study, we investigated the signal zzso zzso in the proliferation of zzso 1 cells evoked by zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 cells with zzso alpha for 48 h increased the incorporation of zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso alpha was evident at zzso zzso and the zzso effect was seen at 10 zzso zzso alpha evoked an influx of zzso into zzso 1 cells within 3 zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso These zzso effects of zzso alpha on both zzso incorporation and zzso influx were similarly inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso channels, in a zzso manner zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso alpha on zzso incorporation was inhibited by zzso zzso an zzso of zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso While the culture medium initially contained zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso incorporation by zzso and zzso under these baseline conditions was also zzso These results suggest that zzso alpha stimulates cell proliferation through a zzso zzso in zzso 1 zzso
