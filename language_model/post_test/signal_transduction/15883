In zzso cells, the zzso apparatus is a zzso compact structure composed of multiple membrane stacks connected by zzso zzso zzso are known to be important to zzso integrity, but the role of the zzso zzso in the maintenance of zzso architecture remains zzso Here we show that an increase in zzso activity, either by treatment of cells with zzso acid or by expression of zzso active zzso resulted in pronounced fragmentation of the zzso complex into zzso zzso zzso required the involvement of zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso and a potent zzso of zzso zzso moreover, zzso active zzso in and of itself, was sufficient for zzso zzso The zzso process was accompanied by formation of dynamic zzso patches in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso and zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso movement were all involved in the process of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Live imaging of zzso recovery revealed that fusion of the small zzso stacks into larger compartments was zzso in cells with active zzso Furthermore, the formation of zzso transport zzso derived from the zzso complex was enhanced upon zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was detected in cells expressing active zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is involved in regulation of the zzso structure, affecting zzso of zzso zzso
