zzso zzso transport is driven by zzso that act upon zzso or zzso The zzso motors, zzso zzso and zzso are believed to be responsible for retrograde and zzso transport of zzso cargo along zzso Many zzso display zzso zzso however, the mechanism regulating zzso is zzso zzso movement might be accomplished by alternative binding of different zzso factors to the zzso zzso different zzso could associate with the same cargo and have their motor activity zzso Although several studies have focused on the behavior of specific types of zzso little is known about the traffic of the zzso themselves and how it zzso with cargo zzso To address this question, we studied zzso zzso dynamics in living zzso cells expressing zzso intermediate zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion in an zzso zzso zzso structures display fast linear movement along zzso in both zzso and zzso directions, with zzso similar to that of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso often rapidly reverse their zzso zzso zzso associates with cargo moving in both directions as well as with those that rapidly reverse their direction of movement, suggesting that directional movement is not regulated by altering zzso association but rather by switching activity of zzso associated with the zzso These observations suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso associate with a given cargo and that coordinated regulation of motor activities controls zzso zzso
