zzso of a B cell expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso results in either zzso deletion or functional zzso Both of these processes lead to zzso tolerance and are essential for the prevention of zzso zzso Whereas zzso deletion results in the death of developing zzso B cells, functional zzso of zzso B zzso leads to complex changes in the zzso of peripheral B cells, described collectively as zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso in protein zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso and allows maturation and terminal differentiation of zzso B cells in the presence of the zzso zzso The importance of zzso in zzso tolerance is further underscored by the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the serum of zzso zzso As zzso of zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso our data suggest a selective and essential role of zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso
