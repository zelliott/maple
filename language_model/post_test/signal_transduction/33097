The related zzso focal zzso zzso zzso a recently discovered member of the focal zzso zzso family, has previously been reported to participate in signal zzso in zzso cells, zzso and B zzso We have found that zzso is zzso expressed in human T cells and is rapidly zzso upon the zzso of the T cell zzso zzso This zzso also results in an increase in the zzso and zzso activity of zzso After its zzso there was an increase in the association of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the adapter protein zzso This association was zzso through the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also zzso with the zzso domain of zzso and with the zzso protein zzso through its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso after T cell zzso stimulation was reduced by the zzso of cells with zzso D, suggesting the role of the zzso in this zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso in T cell zzso signaling and may act to link signals from the cell surface to the zzso and thereby affect the host immune zzso
