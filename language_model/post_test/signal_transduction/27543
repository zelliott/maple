The distribution and properties in brain of the alpha zzso of the major bovine brain Go zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso zzso arise from alternative zzso of zzso from a single zzso zzso whereas zzso is a zzso form of zzso All three Go zzso purify from brain with different populations of zzso zzso This variable zzso composition of Go zzso is likely a consequence of their functional zzso This study examined the zzso properties of the zzso zzso to see if these properties explain the variable zzso composition of their zzso The brain distribution of zzso differed substantially from that of zzso and zzso as did its zzso zzso binding zzso The unique zzso composition of zzso can be explained by its expression in different brain zzso The zzso and zzso showed slight differences in zzso zzso binding properties but no preference for particular zzso zzso when zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein occurred in a constant ratio to zzso throughout the brain, but was a much larger percent of total brain zzso than previously thought, approximately zzso These results suggest that zzso is a precursor of zzso and that the association of zzso zzso with different zzso zzso reflects the function of an zzso zzso signaling mechanism in zzso
