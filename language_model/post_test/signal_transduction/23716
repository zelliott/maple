zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso signaling zzso in the cardiovascular system, but its zzso dynamics in zzso is largely zzso 

To generate and characterize transgenic mice expressing the zzso resonance energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicator with an zzso of 500 zzso zzso in cardiovascular zzso 

Mouse lines with smooth zzso or ubiquitous expression of zzso were generated by random zzso using an zzso promoter zzso or by targeted integration of a zzso zzso expression cassette driven by the zzso early zzso zzso promoter into the zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells isolated from zzso zzso and colon of zzso mice showed strong sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 100 zzso whereas stimulation with zzso agents such as zzso zzso salt zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso resonance energy transfer changes corresponding to zzso peak zzso of zzso 3 zzso However, different types of smooth muscle cells had different sensitivities of their zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with peak zzso of zzso 1 to zzso 3 zzso could also be monitored in blood vessels of the isolated zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, with the use of a zzso zzso chamber model and zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso signals associated with zzso were detected in zzso in an acutely untouched zzso 

These zzso transgenic mice permit the zzso of cardiovascular zzso signals in live cells, zzso and mice under normal and pathological conditions or during zzso with zzso zzso
