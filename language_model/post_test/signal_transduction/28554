The first structure of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution in the presence of zzso and to zzso A resolution in the absence of zzso The zzso closure of 7 degrees is significantly smaller than that reported for zzso a model for zzso domain closure that has been proposed for zzso zzso Despite the zzso level of sequence identity and zzso similarity in the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso remarkable structural differences have now been zzso These differences correlate well with their divergent regulatory schemes of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of our structural results, we propose a mechanism by which the zzso of a zzso zzso located 25 A from the active site results in a zzso increase in the activity of the zzso zzso zzso
