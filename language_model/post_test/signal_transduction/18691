The aim of the present study was to investigate whether protein zzso C zzso zzso may be among the putative candidates implicated in the primary effects of the zzso II type 2 zzso zzso Western zzso analyses revealed the presence of zzso zzso iota, and zzso in zzso zzso After a zzso treatment with 3 zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of classical zzso zzso cells were characterized by the presence of one zzso process similar to that observed after treatment with zzso II or with zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso Similar findings were observed in cells expressing a zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso alpha in zzso cells also decreased cell number and zzso In conditions of acute zzso zzso II induced a zzso and transient zzso of zzso alpha activity, as well as a decrease in zzso alpha levels associated with the zzso Treatment of cells with zzso was also found to inhibit zzso (between zzso zzso but zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in a zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso (3 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso but failed to interfere with its zzso by the zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso alpha is not directly involved in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso alpha is a primary target of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha leads to a decrease in both zzso activity and cell zzso which may facilitate zzso zzso signaling through zzso thereby leading to zzso zzso
