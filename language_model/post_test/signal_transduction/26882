zzso side effects of zzso the most widely used zzso drugs, are well zzso while mechanisms involved are not fully zzso The cellular energy sensor and regulator zzso protein zzso zzso was suggested as a putative zzso of zzso of zzso the leading zzso drug, by our earlier zzso Here, we study the interference of zzso with zzso zzso and potentially involved zzso 

zzso of zzso on cell zzso are studied in isolated zzso zzso rat hearts and in hearts from zzso zzso zzso In both models, zzso zzso energetic, zzso and zzso zzso Despite energy depletion and unaffected zzso upstream zzso zzso does not activate the zzso zzso and even reduces zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso stress do activate zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter via zzso protein zzso zzso triggered by DNA zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso lead to zzso of zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that in the zzso heart, a combined energetic, zzso and zzso stress elicits a specific, zzso response where zzso is inhibited at least partially by the known negative zzso with zzso and zzso zzso largely triggered by DNA damage zzso Although such zzso can be zzso zzso by limiting zzso it primarily zzso a negative feedback that increases cellular energy deficits, and via zzso of zzso zzso it also contributes to the pathological cardiac zzso in chronic zzso zzso
