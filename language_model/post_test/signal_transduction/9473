zzso proteins are zzso zzso that play a central role in development, adult tissue zzso and zzso zzso of zzso proteins is zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso which zzso zzso from the zzso network to the cell surface for zzso It has recently been shown that recycling of zzso through a zzso zzso trafficking zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso but the mechanism of this retrograde transport zzso is poorly zzso Here, we report that zzso recycling is zzso through a zzso zzso that is independent of the zzso sorting zzso zzso and zzso We have found that the unrelated sorting zzso zzso has an zzso zzso function in zzso recycling and zzso zzso and show that zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso of the zzso to sort zzso into a zzso distinct retrieval zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is part of an alternative zzso zzso that functionally separates the retrograde transport of zzso from other zzso zzso
