Most plants form root zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which provide them with zzso and other zzso High soil zzso levels are known to affect AM zzso zzso but the underlying mechanisms are not zzso This report describes experimental conditions which triggered a novel zzso zzso under high zzso zzso the interaction between pea and two different AM zzso was almost completely abolished at a very early stage, prior to the formation of zzso As demonstrated by zzso experiments, zzso of AM zzso occurred at least partly in response to zzso zzso Early zzso events were examined with a focus on zzso compounds which stimulate zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso were also recently identified as novel plant hormones contributing to the control of shoot zzso Root zzso of plants grown under high zzso lost their ability to stimulate AM zzso and lacked zzso In addition, a systemic zzso of zzso release by high zzso supply was demonstrated using zzso zzso Nevertheless, supplementation with zzso zzso failed to restore root colonization under high zzso This observation does not exclude a contribution of zzso to the regulation of AM zzso by zzso but indicates that they are not the only factor zzso Together, the results suggest the existence of additional early signals that may control the differentiation of zzso
