zzso receptors in zzso such as sensory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are molecular devices for monitoring environmental zzso We report here that sensory domain sharing is widespread among different classes of zzso zzso We have identified two novel zzso zzso sensory zzso named zzso and zzso that are found in at least four classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso and either zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso proteins zzso Three other zzso sensory zzso were shared by at least two different classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso These observations suggest that zzso use similar zzso zzso to sense similar environmental signals and transmit this information via different signal zzso pathways to different regulatory zzso zzso regulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repression zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso The variety of signaling pathways using the zzso zzso indicates that these zzso sense some critically important zzso zzso
