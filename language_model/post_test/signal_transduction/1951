To induce zzso zzso toxin zzso must first bind zzso zzso at the plasma zzso enter the cell by zzso and then traffic retrograde into the zzso zzso We recently proposed that zzso provides the sorting motif necessary for retrograde trafficking into the zzso zzso of host cells, and that such trafficking depends on association with zzso zzso and zzso raft zzso To test this idea, we examined whether CT action in human zzso zzso cells depends on membrane zzso zzso of cholesterol with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and prolonged the time required for CT to enter the cell and induce zzso These effects were specific to CT, as identical conditions did not alter the potency or toxicity of anthrax zzso toxin that enters the cell by another zzso We found that zzso and trafficking of CT into the zzso apparatus depended on membrane zzso zzso depletion also changed the density and specific protein content of zzso zzso raft zzso but did not entirely zzso the zzso complex from these zzso raft zzso Taken together these data imply that cholesterol may function to couple the zzso complex with raft zzso and with other membrane components of the zzso raft required for CT entry into the zzso
