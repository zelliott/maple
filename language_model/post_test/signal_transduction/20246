A role for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in liver zzso has been proposed, but the implication of zzso is poorly understood zzso The aim of this work was to study the functional role of zzso in different cell populations implicated in liver zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two different mice models that develop spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and a model of experimental induced zzso zzso were zzso In addition, gene expression in zzso from chronic zzso C virus zzso patients or zzso liver samples was zzso zzso have indicated that zzso expression was increased in the zzso of all animal models, zzso with zzso development and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression zzso with zzso to zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso downstream zzso is necessary for zzso zzso as well as for the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso was not necessary for zzso zzso transition zzso but was required for zzso zzso in zzso Finally, zzso expression was elevated in patients with zzso C virus zzso fibrosis, increasing along the zzso zzso In zzso zzso progression both in zzso and in zzso zzso models and zzso is accompanied by increased zzso zzso which mediates acquisition and maintenance of the zzso zzso as well as zzso death of zzso
