The zzso zzso acid zzso controls important aspects of plant growth such as seed zzso zzso growth, and zzso The key components of the zzso signaling zzso have been identified over the past 10 zzso The current view is that zzso binds to a soluble zzso zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso proteins in a zzso manner and thereby zzso zzso protein degradation via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth responses can generally be correlated with and be explained by changes in zzso zzso zzso where the zzso zzso exerts a growth restraint that is relieved upon its zzso However, it is obvious that other mechanisms must exist that control the activity of this zzso This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of zzso zzso of its zzso and of its zzso with other signaling zzso
