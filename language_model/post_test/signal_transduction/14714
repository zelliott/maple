Evidence is accumulating that zzso cells produce signals, which interact with zzso cells in the same zzso Here, we zzso the mechanism for bystander signal arising in zzso zzso cells and repair deficient zzso zzso on the relationship between DNA repair capacity and bystander signal arising in zzso zzso In order to investigate the bystander effect, we carried out medium transfer experiments after zzso where zzso were scored in zzso zzso repair deficient zzso zzso When zzso medium from zzso cells was transferred to zzso zzso cells, the level of induction was independent of whether the medium came from zzso zzso zzso or zzso repair deficient zzso This result suggests that the zzso of a bystander signal is independent of the DNA repair capacity of the zzso zzso Also, zzso of the zzso cells with zzso zzso which suppresses zzso induction in zzso but not in zzso cells, suppressed bystander effects completely in both zzso media, suggesting that zzso is effective for suppression of bystander signal arising independently of DNA damage in zzso zzso zzso the work presented here adds to the understanding that it is the repair zzso of the cells receiving bystander signals, which determines overall response rather than that of the cell producing the bystander zzso
