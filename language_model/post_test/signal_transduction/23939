The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein complex that resembles the lid zzso of zzso Through its ability to regulate specific zzso protein degradation events, zzso controls multiple aspects of zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of zzso the last zzso zzso zzso from zzso We show that the zzso gene zzso to the previously identified zzso locus and that zzso zzso with zzso confirming that zzso is an integral component of zzso zzso is not only able to interact with the zzso zzso zzso which is partially responsible for the regulatory interaction between zzso and zzso but also interacts with zzso suggesting that zzso is able to regulate the activity of other zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and subsequent divergence events that led to the genes that zzso zzso and lid zzso occurred before the divergence of zzso and zzso zzso organisms and that the zzso zzso were more zzso than the lid zzso during zzso Comparative analyses of the zzso interaction of zzso revealed a set of zzso zzso contacts and resulted in a model of zzso zzso zzso some aspects of which were substantiated by in zzso zzso zzso
