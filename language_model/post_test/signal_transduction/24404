zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso signaling zzso that is involved in the early embryonic development and zzso in zzso While the zzso zzso zzso mice develop zzso zzso the zzso zzso die before zzso To investigate the role of zzso in later embryonic development, we constructed a novel zzso zzso zzso whose expression was attenuated by approximately zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, reduction in zzso expression caused zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso mouse zzso survived 3 days longer than the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, they showed anterior zzso partial axis duplication, and defective zzso zzso To determine the zzso where zzso functions for anterior and zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso whose zzso was derived predominantly from the zzso zzso zzso cells but the visceral zzso was from the wild zzso Although these zzso zzso still showed some anterior zzso their zzso zzso was zzso In addition, marker studies indicated that the zzso zzso was also defective in the zzso zzso Our results provide genetic evidence that expression of zzso at the normal level is essential for both anterior and zzso development, in the zzso derivatives and visceral zzso
