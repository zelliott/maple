zzso is a form of cell death historically defined by zzso and zzso changes that occur in the cell body and zzso However, in contrast to zzso cells in which zzso has been most zzso zzso zzso exhibit elaborate zzso with synaptic connections often located at sites a great distance from the cell zzso Signaling events occurring in synaptic terminals are believed to play important roles in either promoting zzso zzso of zzso receptors in zzso zzso or preventing zzso zzso of zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso cell death in various zzso and pathological zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso can be activated locally in synaptic terminals and zzso and have shown that such zzso can result in local functional and zzso zzso and can also zzso to the cell body resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, zzso zzso loss of plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, and production of factors capable of inducing nuclear zzso zzso and fragmentation can all occur locally in synaptic terminals in response to various zzso zzso of receptors for zzso factors zzso basic zzso growth factor, zzso form of zzso precursor protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso in synaptic terminals can exert zzso actions that either can be zzso locally or may require signals to the nucleus and zzso In addition to their roles in synaptic zzso and zzso death, zzso zzso may play roles in synaptic zzso For example, we found that zzso zzso can lead to zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso and that this action of zzso is correlated with reduced calcium responses to zzso We propose that zzso zzso function in a zzso in which low levels of zzso play roles in zzso responses to zzso whereas higher levels of zzso mediate synaptic zzso and cell zzso
