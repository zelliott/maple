In the brain, zzso zzso receptors mediate zzso zzso and, when intensely zzso can induce zzso cell zzso In addition to their zzso properties, however, zzso receptors have been functionally coupled to a variety of signal zzso events involving zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso In the present study, we tested whether zzso receptors are linked to appropriate signaling events in order to prevent zzso injury and/or enhance zzso zzso stimulation in zzso slice cultures caused the selective zzso of zzso through the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular damage due to serum zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso zzso signals in response to zzso zzso positive zzso of zzso receptors with the zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and reduced the extent of synaptic and zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso was zzso when infused into slices either before or after the zzso The zzso zzso also zzso zzso in an in zzso model of zzso as evidenced by reduction in zzso size and preservation of two different types of zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso selectively protects against zzso since enhancing the zzso did not protect against the zzso slow pathology initiated by zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso communication is important for cellular maintenance and that zzso receptors activate survival signals to zzso their own zzso zzso
