zzso zzso zzso zzso is available for the treatment of zzso stroke in zzso However, adverse effects of zzso have been observed in animal models of zzso brain zzso In the present study, we have used a synthetic zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the role of zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso In mouse cortical cell cultures, we observed that although zzso stop reduced zzso acid zzso zzso zzso death, it failed to zzso zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso stop could prevent the deleterious effects of both zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso At the functional level, zzso stop was found to prevent zzso zzso of zzso zzso calcium zzso The relevance of those findings was strengthened by the observation of a massive reduction of zzso zzso zzso in rats when zzso stop was zzso Altogether, these data demonstrate that the blockade of the zzso zzso activity of zzso in the cerebral zzso could be a powerful zzso strategy raised against brain zzso associated with zzso
