During the last few years, the knowledge of drug, disease zzso and protein has been rapidly accumulated and more and more scientists have been drawn the attention to zzso zzso associations by zzso zzso Development of an integrated approach for systematic discovering zzso associations by those informational data is an important zzso 

We combine three different networks of drug, zzso and disease zzso and assign the weights to the edges from available experimental data and zzso Given a specific disease, we use our network propagation approach to zzso the zzso zzso 

We apply prostate cancer and zzso cancer as our test zzso We use the manually curated zzso associations from comparative zzso database to be our zzso The ranked results show that our proposed method zzso higher specificity and sensitivity and clearly zzso previous zzso Our result also show that our method with zzso information gets higher performance than that with only primary drug targets in both test zzso 

We clearly demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of using network-based analyses of chemical, zzso and zzso data to reveal zzso zzso The potential associations zzso by our method provide new perspectives for zzso and drug zzso zzso
