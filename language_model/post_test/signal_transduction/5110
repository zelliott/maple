To investigate the involvement of the nucleus zzso zzso in cognitive impairment and the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso factor zzso in an animal model of cognitive deficit, we infused zzso into the zzso of cognitively impaired aged zzso zzso was evaluated by Morris water maze zzso zzso synaptic plasticity was measured by zzso zzso Brain tissue homogenization was used to measure the changes in signal zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso receptors were used for zzso stimulation zzso zzso decreases in the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and density of zzso spines on medium zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso infusion of zzso restored zzso synaptic zzso and cell zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso activated zzso signaling through the zzso zzso whereas stimulation of zzso occurred through zzso zzso Our study suggested that the decreased zzso level and its downstream signaling as well as loss of synaptic plasticity in the zzso are associated with cognitive zzso in aged zzso The zzso zzso and zzso signaling play a key role in structural synaptic zzso Our study also suggested that zzso could be a zzso treatment for zzso
