zzso zzso zzso (or zzso systems are common signal zzso mechanisms implicated in a wide variety of cellular responses to environmental stimuli in both zzso and zzso For a model zzso zzso zzso zzso in this study we first compiled a complete list of zzso zzso zzso including 15 genes for zzso zzso four genes for response regulator zzso and only one for zzso zzso intermediate zzso For these zzso zzso a set of deletion zzso was constructed so as to create a zzso zzso for zzso When examined these zzso strains under various conditions stressful for zzso growth and asexual spore development, two of them zzso zzso and zzso showed a marked zzso of hypersensitivity to zzso stresses zzso to hydrogen zzso In this respect, expression of the zzso specific zzso zzso gene was severely impaired in both zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso were hypersensitive not only to treatment with zzso but also to treatment at zzso low (4 degrees zzso and high zzso degrees zzso temperatures, resulting in reduced zzso zzso In this respect, not only the zzso zzso gene specific for asexual development, but also a set of genes zzso the zzso for synthesis of certain stress tolerant compatible zzso such as zzso and zzso were markedly zzso in zzso from zzso These results together are indicative of the zzso importance of the zzso zzso signaling network involving the zzso and zzso response zzso
