zzso expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso in human tumors directly zzso with increased resistance to zzso increased rates of zzso and an overall increased rate of patient zzso It is thought that decreased zzso expression in tumors is caused by increased zzso zzso in particular zzso of the zzso governed by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We have directly tested the importance of the zzso degradation of zzso in zzso by analyzing the tumor zzso of mice that express a form of zzso that cannot be zzso and zzso by this zzso zzso In mouse models of both lung and colon cancer zzso of zzso promotes zzso However, we found that preventing zzso degradation by the zzso zzso had no impact on tumor zzso or overall survival in either tumor zzso Our study unveiled a previously zzso role for the control of zzso zzso abundance in the development of zzso cell lung zzso In the colon cancer model, the frequency of zzso zzso was similarly unaffected by the zzso zzso but, unexpectedly, we found that it inhibited progression of zzso zzso to zzso These studies may guide the choice of clinical settings in which zzso zzso of the zzso zzso might be of therapeutic zzso
