zzso zzso protein zzso except for zzso zzso zzso family, are zzso zzso zzso is a member of the protein zzso C zzso of zzso zzso and is one of the first identified zzso for zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso signaling downstream of activated zzso is largely zzso Here, we present evidence that identifies a novel plasma membrane pool of zzso This integral membrane form of zzso is zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso is required for its integration into zzso This integration is essential for zzso to function as a zzso zzso as only the integral plasma membrane zzso is able to initiate zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in human zzso cells and to mediate zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso signals via the integral membrane pool of its zzso in its immediate vicinity at the plasma zzso thus establishing a new paradigm in zzso cell zzso
