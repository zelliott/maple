The symbiotic association between zzso and zzso bacteria collectively known as zzso results in the formation of a unique plant root organ called the zzso This process is initiated following the perception of zzso zzso factors by the host zzso zzso factor zzso plant responses, including zzso gene zzso is zzso by the zzso signaling zzso Plant zzso in this zzso are unable to zzso We describe here the cloning and characterization of two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and pea zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso undergo excessive root hair zzso but are impaired in infection and fail to form zzso following zzso with zzso zzso Our investigation of early zzso gene expression using the reporter fusion zzso in the zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso is not essential for early zzso signaling but may zzso regulate the spatial pattern of zzso zzso It was recently shown that an zzso form of a zzso zzso protein zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso in the absence of zzso We show here that zzso is essential for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a similar zzso to zzso but we demonstrate that zzso is not required in this zzso Based on our data, we suggest that zzso functions downstream of the early zzso signaling zzso to coordinate and regulate the correct zzso and spatial formation of root zzso
