zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso participate in calcium zzso in isolated zzso zzso We hypothesized that this signaling zzso is activated by ETA and zzso receptors in the zzso zzso to mediate zzso in zzso To test this, we measured acute zzso blood flow zzso responses to zzso in zzso rats and mice in the presence and absence of functional zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso responses to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso Mice lacking the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso had zzso responses to zzso that were zzso weaker than those seen in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Selective ETA zzso stimulation zzso produced decreases in zzso that were attenuated by 43 and zzso by zzso or zzso red, respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also reduced zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 77 and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso stimulation by zzso + the ETA zzso zzso zzso zzso responses that were attenuated by 59 and zzso by zzso and zzso red, respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso attenuated zzso responses to zzso by zzso during zzso of zzso oxide synthesis zzso zzso zzso We conclude that in the zzso zzso in zzso 1) zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso 2) both ETA and zzso receptors activate this zzso and 3) zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso signaling independently of zzso
