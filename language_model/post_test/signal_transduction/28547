More than zzso of the human zzso encodes proteins involved in zzso and zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso A zzso zzso is one of the most common and versatile signal pathways in zzso cells and is involved in regulation of cellular functions in almost all zzso in zzso Various zzso signals zzso on this signal zzso through zzso binding to G zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is therefore tightly regulated at several levels to maintain specificity in the multitude of signal zzso zzso changes in zzso concentration vary in zzso zzso and extension into the cell, and zzso zzso are shaped by zzso zzso that form zzso as well as zzso that degrade zzso Different zzso zzso with distinct zzso properties and zzso expression contribute to cell and organ zzso A zzso zzso proteins zzso target zzso to specific zzso and distinct zzso compartments providing spatial and zzso specificity for mediation of biological effects channeled through the zzso zzso zzso also serve as scaffolding proteins that assemble zzso together with signal zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso as well as components of other signaling pathways into zzso signaling complexes that serve as crossroads for different paths of cell zzso zzso of zzso and integration of a wide repertoire of proteins involved in signal zzso into complex signal networks further increase the specificity required for the precise regulation of numerous cellular and zzso zzso
