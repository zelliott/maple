Recent observations suggest that immune response is involved in the development of zzso However, the exact zzso underlying this zzso response is still under zzso zzso has been known to be an important regulating factor in maintaining immune zzso To determine the role of zzso in the initiation or progression of zzso zzso signaling was zzso in mouse zzso by zzso a zzso zzso form of zzso type II zzso in the zzso under control of the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed marked increases in zzso class II molecules and zzso zzso expression in pancreatic zzso zzso These mice also showed increased zzso to zzso zzso This zzso was characterized by severe pancreatic zzso inflammatory cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso against pancreatic zzso cells, and zzso zzso against pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling seems to be essential either in maintaining the normal immune zzso and suppressing zzso or in preserving the integrity of pancreatic zzso zzso
