zzso signaling is essential for many zzso zzso including zzso To investigate the effects of zzso signaling during zzso we studied the effects of zzso on cultured zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso strongly zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso signaling was responsible for the repression of zzso as evidenced by results showing that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 or expression of zzso caused similar repression of zzso zzso we showed that the zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso strongly inhibited zzso gene expression and short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso transcript levels caused increased expression of the zzso genes zzso and type II zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso with zzso expression of zzso and type II collagen expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and type II collagen zzso These data support the conclusions that zzso contributes to the repression of zzso and zzso gene expression resulting from zzso zzso signaling and that zzso interferes with zzso zzso
