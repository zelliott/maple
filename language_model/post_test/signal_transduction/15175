Human zzso tumor zzso zzso are regulators of cell death and zzso however, little is known about other functions of zzso zzso zzso one of two zzso proteins in zzso appears to play a role in zzso pole body zzso (the equivalent of zzso zzso zzso We therefore investigated the role of human zzso proteins in zzso zzso We also addressed the regulation of human zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso considering that zzso proteins can function together with zzso zzso in zzso 

By studying the six human zzso proteins and five zzso zzso we found that zzso signaling controls zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused zzso zzso whereas zzso depletion of zzso or zzso impaired zzso zzso zzso we delineated an zzso signaling zzso regulating zzso zzso More specifically, analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that a functional zzso complex is critical for zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso motif that in turn is required for human zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso activity is crucial for zzso zzso whereas zzso binding to the zzso and zzso tumor zzso proteins is zzso Finally, by studying the zzso zzso assembly machinery, we also observed that normal daughter zzso formation depends on intact zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso is not zzso 

Our observations propose a novel zzso in control of human zzso zzso after recruitment of zzso to zzso
