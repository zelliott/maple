zzso is regulated by inhibitor proteins zzso which retain zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso complex containing the zzso 1 and 2 zzso or zzso and subsequent degradation of the zzso proteins are zzso for zzso zzso Many signals induce zzso one of them being zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso induction is critical for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso interferes with transformation by the zzso and we characterized the mechanism of zzso induction by activated zzso zzso and the tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso critically depends on the zzso complex, most notably on zzso A major signaling zzso induced by zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, different zzso of this cascade do not affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso does not zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso rather zzso with another membrane shuttle zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is blocked by a dominant negative form of zzso These results suggest that zzso induction of zzso is relayed by zzso but not by the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso
