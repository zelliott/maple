Evidence from several brain regions suggests zzso acid zzso can exert a zzso influence during development, expanding the role of this zzso acid beyond its function as an zzso zzso zzso precursor cells in the zzso zzso zone zzso express functional zzso receptors as do immature zzso zzso in the developing cortical plate zzso however, zzso zzso properties in these distinct cell populations have not been zzso Using zzso techniques in embryonic and early zzso zzso we find that zzso receptors expressed by zzso cells have a higher apparent affinity for zzso and are relatively insensitive to zzso zzso compared with zzso in the zzso zzso current magnitude increases with maturation with the smallest responses found in recordings from precursor cells in the zzso No evidence was found that zzso receptors on zzso cells are activated zzso consistent with previous data suggesting that these receptors are activated in a zzso fashion by zzso released zzso After zzso are born and migrate to the zzso they begin to demonstrate spontaneous synaptic activity, the majority of which is zzso zzso These spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso first were detected at embryonic day 18 zzso At birth, approximately 50% of recordings from cortical zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and this value increased with zzso zzso zzso were action potential dependent and arose from local zzso zzso zzso application could evoke action zzso zzso in zzso cortical zzso suggesting that during the first few zzso days, zzso can act as an zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso were also present in early zzso zzso These events were not observed in cells zzso clamped at negative holding zzso zzso to zzso zzso but were evident when the holding potential was set at positive values zzso to zzso zzso Together these results provide evidence for the early maturation of zzso communication in the zzso and a functional change in zzso properties between precursor cells and early zzso zzso The change in zzso properties may reflect the shift from zzso to synaptic zzso zzso
