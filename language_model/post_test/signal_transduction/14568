zzso expresses several muscle zzso zzso from a single gene by alternatively zzso six of the 19 zzso Here we investigate zzso 7, which codes for a region in the upper 50 zzso domain near the zzso zzso This region is of interest because it is also the place where a large insert is found in zzso VI and where several zzso zzso have been identified in human cardiac zzso We expressed and zzso zzso muscle zzso from zzso each varying at zzso zzso Two zzso exchanged the entire zzso 7 domain between the indirect flight muscle zzso normally containing zzso zzso and embryonic body wall muscle zzso normally containing zzso zzso zzso to create zzso and zzso The second two zzso replaced each half of the zzso zzso domain in zzso with the corresponding portion of zzso zzso to create zzso and zzso zzso kinetic studies of the motor domain from these zzso zzso revealed changes in several kinetic parameters between the zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso Of significance were changes in zzso zzso which differed in the presence and absence of zzso consistent with a model in which the zzso 7 domain is part of the communication zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso models of the structures suggest how the zzso 7 domain might zzso this zzso
