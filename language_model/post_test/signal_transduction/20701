zzso zzso and behavioral responses to artificial zzso natural zzso and zzso zzso were assessed using two zzso An zzso zzso zzso technique recorded action zzso from zzso taste buds and the zzso preference test measured behavioral preferences for the different zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were preferred over water at zzso zzso zzso and zzso were likewise zzso but at zzso zzso zzso zzso of action currents were zzso by zzso at 200 zzso zzso at 20 zzso and zzso at zzso zzso A zzso curve for the zzso zzso zzso revealed a threshold concentration of 1 zzso and a zzso concentration of 100 zzso No responses were zzso by zzso zzso The responses to different zzso adapted rapidly at zzso zzso With zzso adaptation was concentration zzso at threshold the response adapted very slowly if at zzso zzso increased with increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in their ability to elicit a zzso This occurred with high zzso nearly every taste bud that responded to zzso also responded to the zzso and every zzso taste bud was zzso zzso zzso The sweet responses and zzso responses occurred in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and were not enhanced nor diminished by the presence of such zzso zzso had no effect on the sweet zzso
