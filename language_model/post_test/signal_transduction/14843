There is substantial interest in identifying agents that zzso activate zzso differentiation versus zzso zzso acid zzso is a tumor promoter in mouse skin that also stimulates zzso of zzso zzso zzso also enhances human zzso zzso however, the impact of zzso treatment on zzso in these cells has not been zzso We show that zzso promotes normal human zzso zzso as evidenced by increased zzso of cells having zzso DNA content, decreased zzso integrity, increased zzso V zzso increased zzso zzso c level, and increased zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels are zzso These changes are associated with release of the zzso zzso domain and increased zzso of zzso consistent with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso is not zzso The zzso response is enhanced in zzso treated cells in the presence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso treatment selectively activated zzso and zzso zzso is not inhibited by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the idea that the response is zzso by zzso Our data indicate that zzso is an agent that regulates both zzso differentiation and zzso and that this regulation is zzso via zzso of a zzso signaling zzso
