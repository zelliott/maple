In the zzso brain, zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso degradation, form the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although physically zzso both zzso use the pivotal zzso zzso zzso as a zzso We studied the functional consequences of this cellular zzso in zzso using two specific tools, the zzso II inhibitor zzso 122 and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The acute effects of selective zzso II or zzso zzso were studied using a zzso method in which the de zzso synthesis of zzso and of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso acid zzso is monitored following an zzso injection of zzso In zzso rats, zzso zzso 122 decreased newly formed zzso by zzso without influencing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso synthesis (by zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso selective effects of zzso II and zzso zzso were observed when the zzso were applied acutely together with the zzso zzso which zzso local zzso zzso zzso different effects of zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso were obtained in rats that had received an zzso zzso injection 7 days zzso In these zzso zzso zzso zzso not only decreased both zzso and zzso production (by zzso and zzso zzso but also moderately raised zzso synthesis (by zzso These results indicate a remarkable functional segregation of the two zzso branches in the brain, zzso well for the development of selective zzso II or zzso zzso for cognitive enhancement and zzso zzso
