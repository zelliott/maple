The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors related to zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the zzso zzso on the development of acute zzso To address this question, we used two animal models of acute inflammation zzso paw zzso and zzso zzso We report here that when compared with zzso zzso mice, zzso knockout mice zzso mice experienced a higher rate of the extent and severity when subjected to zzso injection in the paw zzso model or to zzso administration in the pleurisy zzso In particular, the absence of a functional zzso gene in zzso mice resulted in a significant zzso of various inflammatory parameters zzso enhancement of paw zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, the absence of a functional zzso gene enhanced the zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the paw and in the lung and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso in the lungs of zzso zzso In conclusion, the increased inflammatory response observed in zzso mice strongly suggests that a zzso zzso zzso the degree of acute inflammation in the zzso
