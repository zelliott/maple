zzso is a zzso zzso zzso channel that, like other zzso channels, converts the chemical energy of zzso binding to the mechanical force of channel zzso The channel's eight zzso zzso the zzso zzso form an zzso gating ring in which zzso binding zzso zzso changes that open the zzso Here we present the crystal structures of the zzso gating ring in closed and partially open states at zzso A, both obtained from the same crystal grown in the absence of zzso Furthermore, our zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso regulates the channel by changing the equilibrium of the gating ring between closed and open states, while pH regulates channel gating by affecting zzso zzso Our findings, along with the previously determined open zzso structure, allow us to zzso the zzso gating mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
