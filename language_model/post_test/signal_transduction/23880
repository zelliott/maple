zzso Growth Factor zzso signaling is known to play an important role during zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso during zzso formation, we examined the expression of zzso in normal developing whiskers and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is first expressed in the zzso process, lateral and zzso zzso zzso then in the zzso cells underneath the future zzso zzso and in the surrounding zzso of developing zzso zzso whiskers exhibit a significant decrease in number and their structure is zzso as revealed by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso marker genes such as Sonic zzso zzso and zzso 2 are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is required for proper zzso development zzso by zzso signaling in the zzso
