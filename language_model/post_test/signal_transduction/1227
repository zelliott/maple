We previously reported that cadmium zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso 2 zzso in primary mouse zzso zzso In the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of zzso production by zzso focusing on the main zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso which is activated by zzso in several kinds of zzso zzso at 2 zzso and above zzso zzso production in zzso cells and its production was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso C also inhibited the production of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a potent zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso production zzso by zzso as well as zzso indicating that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was necessary for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the zzso of these three zzso and zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso C was also zzso On the other hand, zzso was found to zzso zzso and the zzso was inhibited by zzso indicating that zzso was activated by zzso through zzso zzso and released zzso acid zzso a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso From these results, it was suggested that zzso of each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in addition to that of zzso and zzso played an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso zzso
