Fibrosis is a zzso cause of death in systemic sclerosis zzso First zzso modifications have recently been shown to contribute to zzso of zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso of zzso as a novel zzso zzso 

zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso of the Small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for zzso The effects of zzso of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso fibrosis, and in the model of zzso induced by zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso 

Increased zzso for zzso was detected in patients with zzso and in experimental zzso zzso of zzso exerted potent zzso effects and prevented zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso of collagen induced by zzso or by zzso of zzso active zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso in experimental zzso indicating that zzso of zzso may zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso and prevents experimental zzso in different zzso zzso These data provide first evidence that targeting of zzso zzso may be a novel therapeutic approach for zzso zzso
