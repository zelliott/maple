Bone zzso proteins zzso members of the zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso have important functions in many biological zzso They bind to specific zzso zzso zzso which zzso the signal to the nucleus through zzso zzso The question of how zzso can have such diverse effects while using the same zzso zzso zzso has recently come closer to an answer at the molecular zzso Nuclear zzso have been identified that cooperate with the zzso in regulating specific target genes depending on the cellular zzso In addition, the pivotal role zzso signaling plays is underscored by the identification of factors that regulate members of this zzso at the cell surface, in the zzso and in the zzso Many of these factors are zzso and inhibit the zzso pathway, thus establishing negative feedback zzso Members of the zzso zzso can also physically interact with components of other signaling pathways to establish zzso Finally, there is accumulating evidence that an alternative zzso involving zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso The evidence and implications of these findings are discussed with an emphasis on early embryonic development of zzso and zzso
