Many zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected in the cell nucleus, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso activity and function as zzso zzso to activate gene zzso High zzso in tumor zzso zzso with increased tumor proliferation and poor survival in cancer zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso into the cell nucleus remains largely zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso and interacts with zzso zzso carriers that are critical for zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso at the nuclear zzso signal zzso is defective in zzso with zzso and in entering the zzso indicating that zzso zzso is critical for zzso interaction and zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, disruption of zzso zzso process using chemicals and forced expression of zzso zzso II zzso suppressed nuclear entry of zzso Additional zzso suggest an involvement of zzso sorting machinery in zzso nuclear zzso Finally, we found that nuclear export of zzso may involve zzso zzso as we detected zzso interaction and markedly increased nuclear zzso following exposure to zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso these data suggest the importance of zzso zzso zzso sorting machinery, interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Together, our work sheds light into the nature and regulation of the nuclear zzso zzso and provides a plausible mechanism by which cells shuttle zzso zzso and potentially other zzso through the nuclear pore complex and into the nuclear zzso
