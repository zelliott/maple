Although chronic zzso changes in zzso spines on nucleus zzso zzso zzso have been correlated with behavioral zzso the molecular pathways governing these structural changes, and their resulting behavioral effects, are poorly zzso The zzso factor, nuclear factor zzso B zzso is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli and regulates expression of many genes known to maintain cell zzso zzso we evaluated the role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso spine changes on medium zzso zzso of the zzso and the rewarding effects of zzso We show that chronic cocaine zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso transgenic zzso This induction of zzso activity is accompanied by increased expression of several zzso zzso the promoters of which show zzso modifications after chronic cocaine exposure consistent with their zzso zzso To study the functional significance of this zzso we used zzso gene transfer to express either a zzso active or zzso zzso of zzso of zzso B zzso zzso or zzso which normally activates zzso zzso in the zzso We found that zzso of zzso by zzso increases the number of zzso spines on zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso by zzso decreases zzso zzso spine number and blocks the increase in zzso spines after chronic zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso blocks the rewarding effects of cocaine and the ability of previous cocaine exposure to increase an zzso preference for zzso Together, these studies establish a direct role for zzso pathways in the zzso to regulate structural and behavioral plasticity to zzso
