The zzso zzso gray zzso is a neural site for several zzso functions related to cardiovascular regulation, pain zzso and behavioral zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been considered as an important biologically active component of the zzso system in the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine zzso existence of zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso the role for zzso in modulating activity of zzso zzso and zzso the mechanisms by which zzso plays a regulatory zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso appears within the zzso Whole cell zzso recording demonstrated that the discharge rates of zzso zzso were decreased from zzso zzso of control to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 100 zzso of zzso With zzso of zzso a zzso zzso the discharge rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during infusion of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso was largely localized within the zzso among the three zzso The effects of zzso on zzso activity of the zzso were attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso a zzso zzso The discharge rates were zzso zzso in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso was applied with zzso of zzso Those findings suggest that zzso plays an zzso role in the zzso via a NO dependent signaling zzso This offers the basis for the zzso role of zzso and zzso R in the regulation of various functions in the zzso
