Although adoptive transfer of zzso T cells is a plausible approach for cancer zzso the therapeutic application was hampered due to severe side effects caused by administration of high-dose zzso zzso which was used for long-lasting maintenance of zzso T cells in zzso To solve this problem, here we propose to use an zzso zzso zzso which can zzso a growth signal in response to a zzso zzso As a model system, zzso or zzso region of zzso egg zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso beta or gamma zzso When the pairs of zzso receptors zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso T cell line zzso the zzso zzso zzso induced selective expansion of zzso cells in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso Growth zzso revealed that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso a more stringent zzso growth zzso indicating some zzso effects of the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso which are hallmarks for zzso zzso were all activated by the zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the zzso zzso could substantially mimic the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the potential application in expansion of zzso T zzso
