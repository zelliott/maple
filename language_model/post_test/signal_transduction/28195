zzso have been hypothesized to facilitate the organization of functional zzso membrane zzso In B cells the zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso When zzso to the B cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex significantly enhances zzso signaling in part by zzso the association of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso In this study zzso is shown to associate with zzso zzso upon zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso Using B cells from zzso mice we demonstrate that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes fail to partition into zzso zzso and enhance zzso signaling from zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso protein that associates only zzso if at all with zzso fails to promote the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso The requirement for zzso to promote zzso raft association may define a novel mechanism by which zzso function as molecular zzso of signaling zzso
