zzso strains of zzso zzso cause zzso zzso in zzso The released lethal toxin zzso and zzso toxin zzso are regarded as the major zzso zzso zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso proteins of the zzso zzso by zzso In cultured cell lines, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso reorganization zzso zzso and zzso cell death zzso zzso zzso cell death induced by zzso is suggested to be based on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyze the critical role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso acid zzso acid zzso as the pharmacological zzso zzso preserved the zzso decrease of the cellular level of zzso suggesting that zzso activated zzso signaling downstream of inhibited Ras zzso zzso zzso was prevented by zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso showing that the zzso effect depends on zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso protected cells from zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well, an aspect of the zzso effects that most likely did not contribute to its zzso zzso Due to its zzso activity, zzso is under investigation for its potential application as a therapeutic zzso of zzso zzso zzso may represent a new concept for the treatment of disease associated with zzso zzso zzso
