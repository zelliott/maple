In the zzso gut, zzso oxygen species zzso immunity is critical to host zzso This is in contrast to the zzso zzso whose zzso function in the zzso zzso has yet to be convincingly demonstrated despite playing a critical role during systemic zzso We used a novel in zzso approach to reveal the zzso role of gut zzso zzso zzso system, which has been zzso in the presence of the dominant zzso zzso zzso When fed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flies, but not zzso flies, become highly susceptible to gut zzso This high zzso can be significantly reduced by either zzso zzso expression to zzso zzso or by zzso expressing a single zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso These results imply that the local zzso system acts as an essential zzso system, complementary to the zzso gut zzso during gut infection with zzso zzso This system provides the zzso gut immunity the versatility necessary to manage sporadic invasion of virulent pathogens that somehow counteract or evade the zzso zzso
