zzso infection of the kidney is associated with zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso of systemic zzso zzso Whether bacterial molecules directly affect zzso zzso transport is zzso We examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso in the isolated rat and mouse zzso thick ascending limb zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso when added to bath or zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso eliminated zzso by bath zzso but had no effect on zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso eliminated zzso by zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso by bath zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange with zzso eliminated zzso of zzso zzso by zzso but not bath zzso zzso zzso showed expression of zzso in zzso and zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso by bath and zzso zzso was eliminated in zzso from zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso zzso through distinct zzso pathways in zzso and zzso zzso These results establish that bacterial molecules can directly impair the transport function of zzso zzso identifying a new mechanism contributing to zzso dysfunction during bacterial zzso The zzso reduction in zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso by promoting bacterial adherence and growth and zzso correction of zzso systemic zzso zzso
