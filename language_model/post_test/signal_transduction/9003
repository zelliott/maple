We establish a mathematical model for a cellular zzso signaling module in terms of a zzso differential equation zzso The signaling process is carried out by two zzso reaction steps that share common zzso and zzso with saturated zzso zzso The pair of equations is particularly simple in the present mathematical zzso but they are zzso A complete mathematical analysis is developed based on an elementary zzso zzso The dynamics exhibits the zzso competition behavior in addition to zzso Although widely understood in ecological context, we are not aware of a full range of zzso competition in a simple signaling zzso The competition dynamics has broad implications to cellular processes such as cell differentiation and cancer zzso The concepts of homogeneous and zzso zzso zzso are introduced and their corresponding dynamics are zzso there is no zzso in a zzso dual zzso zzso A zzso interpretation is also provided that further gives intuitive understanding of the zzso behavior inside the zzso
