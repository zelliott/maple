zzso little is known about the effects of the physical zzso on zzso stem and zzso zzso To explore the physical effects of zzso elasticity on zzso primitive zzso cells, we made use of a uniquely elastic zzso zzso zzso mouse or human zzso cells on a zzso zzso led to a two- to zzso expansion of zzso cells, including zzso and mouse stem zzso Treatment with zzso in the presence of zzso had an additive effect on this zzso These biological effects required zzso zzso as neither truncated nor zzso zzso reproduced the phenomenon, and zzso of zzso zzso the zzso Our data suggest that zzso elasticity and zzso are important mechanisms influencing zzso stem and zzso cell zzso and could be exploited to facilitate cell zzso
