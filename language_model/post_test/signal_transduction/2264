We have examined the zzso of mouse zzso and Con zzso mature T cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso at different zzso of the cell zzso Signaling through zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso resulted in the preferential zzso of T cells in zzso phase of the cell zzso T cells in S phase were selectively zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso which increases the percentage of cells in S zzso The inverse relationship between DNA synthesis and zzso in zzso T cells was not observed during the spontaneous death of T cells in culture or during zzso zzso due to zzso zzso to which cells in S phase were zzso These results show that in T cells there is no zzso zzso phase of the cell zzso instead, zzso can occur at different zzso of the cycle depending on the zzso zzso
