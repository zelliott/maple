Multiple studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed on several immune cells including activated T zzso However, the expression and the role of zzso on natural killer T zzso cells have not been fully zzso In this study, it was shown that zzso was not expressed on zzso zzso cells but was rapidly induced on activated zzso cells by zzso engagement with zzso zzso Also, zzso signaling provided by zzso an zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso cell zzso resulting in enhanced zzso production of zzso cells driven by zzso When zzso zzso airway immune responses were evaluated by zzso administration of zzso airway zzso zzso and lung inflammation were significantly more aggravated in mice treated with zzso and zzso than in mice treated with zzso zzso These zzso were accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was not developed in zzso mice treated with zzso with or without zzso but was exacerbated in zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso on zzso cells functions as a zzso zzso and zzso the induction of zzso zzso zzso which is dependent on the zzso zzso
