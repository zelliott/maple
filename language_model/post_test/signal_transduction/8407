Although the mechanisms of zzso and long-term zzso of zzso responses are well known in the spinal cord, including central zzso there has been a growing body of information on such events in the cerebral zzso In view of the importance of anterior zzso zzso zzso in chronic pain conditions, this review considers zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that may be the earliest changes associated with such zzso 

A single zzso electrical stimulus to the zzso nerve induced a prominent sink current in the layer zzso of the zzso in zzso while high frequency stimulation zzso the response of this zzso zzso zzso by electrical stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso projection to zzso mediates the zzso short-term zzso The short-term synaptic zzso were evaluated for different zzso in zzso where the zzso zzso and zzso corpus zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso evoked a stronger short-term synaptic plasticity and effectively transferred the bursting zzso activity to zzso zzso that was not true for zzso zzso This short-term enhancement of synaptic transmission was zzso by zzso pathways and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso express a short-term plasticity that involves zzso and zzso calcium influx and is an important mechanism of the short-term zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso activity induced by zzso bursting suggest that short-term synaptic zzso enable the processing of zzso information from the zzso zzso and this zzso response zzso is particularly important in pain because zzso maintenance of the response supports cortical integration and memory formation related to noxious zzso Moreover, these modifications of zzso zzso appear to regulate zzso signals that may be important to the transition from acute to chronic pain conditions associated with persistent peripheral noxious zzso zzso and maintained zzso activities in zzso cortex, therefore, can become adverse and it will be important to learn how to regulate such changes in zzso firing patterns that transmit zzso information to zzso in early stages of chronic zzso
