The most important interactions between cellular molecules have a high zzso are unique and specific, and require a network approach for a detailed zzso After a brief introduction to cellular networks zzso interaction networks, zzso networks, gene regulatory networks, zzso networks and zzso zzso an overview is given on the network aspects of the theories on zzso The most important part of the review summarizes our knowledge on the aging of zzso The effects of aging on the general network models are zzso as well as the initial findings on the effects of aging on the cellular zzso Finally we suggest a zzso link theory of zzso linking the random damage of the network constituents to the overwhelming majority of the low zzso transient interactions zzso zzso in the cellular zzso We show that random damage of weak links may lead to an increase of noise and an increased vulnerability of cellular networks, and make a comparison between these predictions and the observed zzso of the emergent properties of cellular networks in aged zzso
