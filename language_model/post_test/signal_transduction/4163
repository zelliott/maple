The contribution of zzso effects of zzso to the blood zzso activity was reevaluated in zzso and in zzso with several conventional zzso and with the new one zzso In zzso in dogs, after single approximately zzso blood zzso doses, the zzso were tested for a ranking in the ratios of mean plasma zzso and blood zzso zzso Studies were also performed in zzso zzso zzso mice under once daily treatment for 8 zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were tested for the ranking of their zzso activity with respect to the stimulation of zzso transport and zzso zzso processes in normal and zzso fat cells as well as in the isolated zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies were performed, especially with zzso in order to characterize the molecular mechanism for the zzso zzso The dog studies revealed a marked ranking in the ratios of plasma zzso and blood zzso activity between the different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso reduced blood zzso by zzso plasma insulin by 50% and zzso by zzso whereas zzso and zzso had no effect on these zzso In zzso zzso and zzso had zzso effects within the lower zzso range, with zzso exhibiting zzso lower zzso values than zzso In the absence of insulin, both zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the maximum insulin response in the rat zzso and up to zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the rat zzso to zzso of the maximum insulin zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso The studies on the molecular mechanism of zzso activity with rat zzso and zzso suggest that these direct zzso effects rely on the induction of zzso zzso from internal stores to the plasma membrane and on the zzso of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These processes occur within the same drug concentration range and with the same ranking between zzso and zzso as observed for zzso zzso and zzso The direct effects of zzso may ultimately be regulated by a zzso zzso C, shown to be activated by zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso products thereby generated from zzso structures may in turn stimulate specific protein zzso which activate key regulatory zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
