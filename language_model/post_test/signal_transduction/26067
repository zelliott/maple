Plasma cells zzso zzso copious levels of zzso To achieve this, their zzso zzso zzso zzso expansion in a process that requires continuous zzso stress and zzso of the unfolded protein zzso It is important that protein zzso the driver of zzso stress, is regulated in a manner that does not induce zzso We followed protein synthesis in zzso zzso B cells activated in zzso with zzso Total protein synthesis levels increased and then steeply decreased when the cells acquired a zzso zzso We explored the involvement of two mechanisms in controlling protein synthesis levels, namely zzso zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso pathway, which zzso or activate zzso translation, zzso We show that induction of zzso stress in activated B cells zzso led to zzso of zzso Despite the reduction in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso factor 4, an zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition, zzso stress attenuated the zzso pathway, which ultimately reduced protein zzso Finally, B cells engineered to zzso the zzso zzso exhibited higher zzso in the course of zzso zzso We conclude that protein synthesis in PCs is controlled by an zzso zzso zzso regulation, which is needed for optimal cell zzso
