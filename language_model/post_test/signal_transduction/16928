zzso membrane proteins zzso play a central role in cell communication with the zzso Their structures are essential for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of signaling and for drug design, yet they remain badly underrepresented in the protein structure zzso zzso zzso is, aside from X-ray zzso the major tool in structural zzso Here we review recently reported solution zzso structures of zzso zzso and discuss the new approaches, which were developed in the course of these studies to overcome barriers in the zzso Advances in zzso protein zzso zzso isotope zzso resonance assignment, and collection of structural data greatly accelerated zzso structure determination by solution zzso In addition, novel zzso media made possible determination of solution zzso structures of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
