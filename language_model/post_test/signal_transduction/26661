zzso development occurs in complex zzso and is influenced by key signaling zzso Yet how these pathways communicate with master zzso zzso factors to coordinate differentiation remains incompletely zzso The zzso factor zzso plays essential roles in definitive zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is also the most frequent target of genetic zzso in human zzso Here, we report that zzso is zzso by zzso family zzso zzso and that this occurs on multiple zzso zzso located within its negative regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso and genetic studies demonstrate a negative regulatory role of zzso zzso on zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso and contributes to its zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso and enhanced zzso zzso These findings link zzso and zzso signaling pathways to the regulation of zzso activity in zzso via control of zzso zzso complex zzso
