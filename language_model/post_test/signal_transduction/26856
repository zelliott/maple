Procreation is essential for survival of zzso Not surprisingly, complex zzso networks have evolved to mediate the diverse internal and external environmental zzso that regulate reproduction in zzso Ultimately, these regulatory factors zzso directly or zzso on a final common pathway, the zzso producing the zzso hormone zzso which stimulates zzso zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso evidence, accumulated in the last few years, has revealed that zzso a family of zzso zzso by the zzso gene and produced mainly by zzso clusters at discrete zzso zzso are pivotal upstream regulators of zzso zzso As such, zzso have emerged as important zzso of key aspects of zzso maturation and function, from sexual differentiation of the brain and zzso onset to adult regulation of zzso zzso and the zzso control of zzso This review aims to provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in the field of zzso physiology by covering in-depth the consensus knowledge on the major molecular features, biological effects, and mechanisms of action of zzso in zzso and, to a lesser extent, in zzso zzso This review will also address zzso and contentious issues to set the scene for future research challenges in the zzso By doing so, we aim to zzso the reader with a critical and updated view of the zzso roles and potential zzso relevance of zzso in the integral control of zzso zzso
