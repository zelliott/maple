To examine the effects and mechanisms of transient zzso of the zzso zzso on rescuing zzso zzso in survivors of head and neck zzso 

Mouse zzso zzso and cultured human zzso zzso cells were zzso by a single zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso activated in mouse zzso zzso by briefly zzso the Sonic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and in human zzso zzso cells, by infecting with zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso signaling was examined by the expression of the zzso reporter and zzso zzso target zzso The zzso flow rate was measured following zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and expression of related genes were examined by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso 

zzso does not activate zzso signaling in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and, after zzso rescued zzso function in male mice, which is related with preservation of functional zzso and zzso zzso The preservation of zzso was likely zzso by the rescue of signaling activities of the zzso and zzso zzso The preservation of zzso zzso was associated with the rescue of the expression of zzso factors such as zzso and zzso The expression of genes related with maintenance of zzso and zzso zzso in female zzso zzso and cultured human zzso zzso cells was similarly affected by zzso and transient zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that transient zzso of the zzso zzso has the potential to restore zzso zzso function after zzso zzso
