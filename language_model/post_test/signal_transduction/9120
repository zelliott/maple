Although the causes of cancer lie in zzso or zzso changes at the genetic level, their molecular manifestation is the dysfunction of zzso pathways at the protein zzso The 518 protein zzso zzso by the human zzso play a central role in various diseases, a fact that has encouraged extensive investigations on their biological function and three zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important nutritional trace element involved in different zzso functions with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms of action for zzso as zzso agents are not fully zzso but zzso zzso seems to be a possible zzso Various zzso compounds have shown zzso and zzso zzso effects but, in many cases, the replacement of sulfur by zzso improves the zzso effect of zzso Although zzso atom possesses a larger atomic volume and zzso character than zzso zzso can also formed interactions with zzso of the zzso centers of zzso So, we propose a novel chemical library that includes zzso compounds as zzso zzso In this study thirteen zzso have been evaluated at a concentration of 3 or 10 zzso in a 24 zzso panel using a zzso zzso zzso Drug zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been selected, as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in main cancer zzso cell cycle regulation, signal zzso zzso regulation among zzso The obtained results showed that two compounds presented zzso values higher than 50% in at least four zzso and seven derivatives selectively inhibited one or two zzso Furthermore, three compounds selectively activated zzso zzso with values ranging from zzso to zzso In conclusion, we propose that the replacement of sulfur by zzso seems to be a potential and useful strategy in the search of novel chemical compound libraries against cancer as zzso zzso
