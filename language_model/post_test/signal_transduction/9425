Solid tumors encounter a zzso hypoxic zzso as they zzso zzso factors zzso play important roles in zzso tumor development and therapeutic zzso zzso the zzso zzso (especially zzso represents a promising cancer treatment zzso Here, we report a novel class of zzso zzso and the possible molecular basis of zzso 

We analyzed the zzso effects of clinically used zzso II zzso drugs on zzso expression with a primary focus on zzso The potential role of zzso in zzso zzso expression was studied using zzso zzso a zzso approach, and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, involvement of zzso in zzso degradation, transcription, and translation of zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso expression under hypoxic conditions in a zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso of zzso expression was largely independent of two zzso zzso zzso degradation, and zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso expression and function in a similar fashion as zzso suggesting that zzso might inhibit zzso via a zzso at its translation zzso In zzso translation experiments using zzso zzso further confirmed zzso of zzso translation by zzso Interestingly, levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were elevated and decreased after zzso treatment, zzso 

We have identified the zzso compound, zzso as an zzso inhibitor possibly through a translation zzso zzso suggesting the possibility of an additional zzso activity for zzso
