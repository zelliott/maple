zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and opportunistic human pathogen of increasing clinical importance due to the increasing population of zzso zzso To further investigate signal zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso we have identified the gene zzso a zzso zzso in this zzso The zzso gene was disrupted by transformation and zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso strain was viable, but failed to grow at 37 degrees C, and exhibited significant defects in mating and zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain was also zzso in an animal model of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso these zzso zzso zzso and restored zzso in zzso A zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a differentiation zzso known as zzso zzso which involves zzso zzso invasion and zzso in response to nitrogen zzso The zzso zzso mating zzso was suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso elements and partially suppressed by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso also suppressed the zzso adherence zzso of the zzso zzso However, the ability of the zzso zzso strain to grow at elevated temperature was not restored by zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a model in which zzso signals in zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to regulate mating and zzso as well as growth at high temperature which is necessary for maintenance of zzso
