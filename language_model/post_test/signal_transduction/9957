We propose a general theory of evolution based on energy zzso Life represents an emergent property of zzso The earth receives energy from zzso sources such as the zzso zzso life can be characterized by the conversion of available energy into complex zzso zzso energy zzso such as zzso zzso and plants transform light energy into zzso zzso bonds that fuel zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso predominantly feed off the food chain supplied by these direct zzso zzso energy efficiency zzso competitive advantage in the contest among organisms for zzso We introduce a term, return on energy zzso as a measure of energy zzso We define zzso as a ratio of the amount of energy acquired by a system to the amount of energy consumed to generate that zzso zzso cycling represents a tactic to sample the environment for innovations that allow increases in zzso to develop over generations rather than an individual zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso evolution may define a particular tactic rather than an overarching biological zzso A theory of evolution based on competition for energy and driven by improvements in zzso both encompasses prior notions of evolution and zzso zzso zzso Such processes may involve the exchange of zzso traits that improve zzso as exemplified by cognitive adaptations or zzso Under these circumstances, indefinite persistence may become favored over zzso zzso as increases in zzso may then occur more efficiently within a single lifespan rather than over multiple zzso The key to this transition may involve novel methods to address the promotion of health and cognitive zzso We describe the implications of this theory for human zzso
