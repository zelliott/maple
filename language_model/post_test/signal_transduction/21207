zzso significantly suppressed cell growth of the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso binding of zzso with 50% zzso concentration value of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso cells expressed only zzso among the five zzso receptors so far zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso expression zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells cultured in medium containing zzso serum zzso increased zzso expression levels to 282 zzso zzso and then significantly decreased them to 27 zzso zzso of the levels before zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity zzso increased to 656 zzso zzso and decreased thereafter to 39 zzso zzso of the activity before the addition of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression and zzso zzso activity zzso zzso was not altered by zzso toxin zzso whereas the zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression and zzso zzso activity zzso zzso was zzso by zzso These findings suggest that an zzso of zzso expression zzso by cross talk between zzso G protein signaling and zzso zzso zzso signaling is one of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso cell growth in zzso zzso
