zzso in animal models and cell culture techniques have been invaluable in the zzso of the molecular mechanisms that regulate muscle zzso However, few studies have examined muscle zzso in humans using modern experimental zzso The purpose of this study was to examine changes in global gene zzso during zzso muscle zzso in humans and then explore the effects of the most prominent zzso zzso on protein expression and zzso Healthy men and women (N zzso 24) were subjected to two weeks of unilateral limb zzso with muscle zzso obtained before, after 48 hours zzso zzso and 14 days zzso zzso of zzso Muscle cross zzso area zzso zzso and strength zzso were significantly reduced in men and women zzso zzso and zzso zzso after 14 D of zzso zzso analyses of total zzso extracted from biopsy samples at 48 H and 14 D uncovered zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly altered during zzso As a group, genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso metabolism were zzso features at both 48 H and 14 D, with genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation significantly zzso and zzso respectively, at 14 D of muscle zzso There was also a significant decrease in the protein content of zzso zzso c zzso and the zzso activity of zzso c zzso and zzso zzso after 14 D of zzso Furthermore, protein zzso was significantly increased at 48 H but not 14 D of zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso suppression of zzso processes is sustained throughout 14 D of zzso while protein zzso plays an early but transient role in muscle zzso following short-term zzso in zzso
