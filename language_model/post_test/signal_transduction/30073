There is mounting evidence that the established paradigm of zzso oxide zzso zzso from formation through NO zzso over interaction with soluble zzso zzso to eventual disposal as zzso represents only part of a richer chemistry through which NO elicits biological zzso Additional pathways have been suggested that include interaction of zzso zzso with zzso and metals to form zzso zzso and metal zzso Despite the overwhelming attention paid in this regard to zzso little is known about the stability of these species, their significance outside the zzso and whether other zzso products are of equal zzso We here show that zzso and zzso are indeed as ubiquitous as zzso in zzso and that the products of these reactions are zzso present throughout the organ zzso Our study further reveals that all zzso products are highly zzso have fairly short zzso and are linked to tissue zzso and zzso zzso Experimental evidence further suggests that zzso formation occurs substantially by means of zzso zzso rather than NO zzso explaining why zzso can compete effectively with zzso Moreover, tissue zzso can serve as a significant zzso pool of NO during brief periods of zzso and tissue zzso ratios can serve as indicators of the balance between local zzso and zzso zzso These findings vastly expand our understanding of the fate of NO in zzso and provide a framework for further exploration of the significance of zzso events in zzso sensing and zzso The findings also raise the intriguing possibility that zzso is directly involved in the zzso of protein zzso
