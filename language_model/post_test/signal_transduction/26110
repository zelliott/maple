The ability to withstand environmental temperature variation is essential for plant zzso Former studies in zzso revealed that light zzso pathways had a potentially unique role in shielding plant growth and development from seasonal and daily fluctuations in zzso In this paper we describe the molecular zzso through which the light receptors zzso and zzso buffer the impact of warm ambient zzso We show that the light zzso component zzso acts to zzso the potentially devastating effects of elevated temperature on plant zzso Light is known to zzso levels of zzso protein by suppressing zzso destruction of zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso and activity of zzso are highly temperature zzso The increased potency of zzso at warmer temperatures provides an important restraint on zzso that drives zzso zzso We show that warm ambient temperatures promote the zzso of zzso zzso However, repression of zzso activity by zzso and zzso (via zzso is critical for controlling growth and maintaining physiology as temperatures zzso Loss of this zzso restraint has severe consequences for adult plants which have greatly reduced zzso
