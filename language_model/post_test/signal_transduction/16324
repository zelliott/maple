The zzso zzso zzso zzso have been clinically used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso could protect zzso from injury induced by zzso but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this protective effect are still zzso This study was aimed to investigate the protective effect and potential molecular mechanisms of zzso on zzso in zzso cells in zzso and rat zzso zzso injury model in zzso 

zzso cells subjected to serum, zzso and oxygen deprivation zzso were used as in zzso models and zzso rats subjected to left anterior descending zzso coronary artery zzso were used as in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso analysis or zzso zzso zzso membrane potential zzso was detected by zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected by western zzso zzso 

zzso exhibited zzso effect both in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso However, the effect was blocked in zzso by zzso a specific zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso by stabilizing zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the left zzso ejection zzso zzso left zzso fractional zzso zzso left zzso dimensions at end zzso zzso and left zzso dimensions at end zzso zzso suggested that zzso improved rats cardiac zzso zzso significantly increased zzso both in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso and this effect was also blocked by zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso of this study suggested that zzso could protect zzso cells from zzso induced by zzso in both the in zzso and in zzso models through zzso zzso signaling zzso
