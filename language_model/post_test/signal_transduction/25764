zzso communication is critical for tissue and organ zzso In plants, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides function as zzso signaling molecules in various aspects of tissue development including vascular zzso However, little is known about zzso signaling pathways functioning in vascular development downstream of the zzso zzso We show that zzso peptides including zzso which is zzso expressed in the root vascular system, inhibit zzso vessel formation in zzso zzso zzso analysis displayed that zzso peptides zzso specifically the expression of two zzso zzso Response Regulators zzso zzso and zzso whose products act as negative regulators of zzso zzso The zzso zzso roots exhibited defective zzso vessel zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso vessel formation by suppressing the expression of zzso zzso genes including zzso and zzso This was supported by the finding that zzso did not suppress zzso vessel formation in a background of zzso zzso a double zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results revealed zzso between zzso signaling and zzso signaling in zzso vessel formation in zzso Taken together with the indication that zzso signaling functions downstream of the zzso signaling zzso in the shoot zzso zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso signaling pathways may be a common feature in plant zzso
