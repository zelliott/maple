zzso proteins play key roles in zzso signal zzso through complex formation with zzso active signaling zzso In T zzso the role of several different types of adapter proteins in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso is well zzso An exception to this is the family of zzso adapter zzso proteins zzso of zzso adapter protein of unknown function zzso zzso and zzso Only recently has the function of these adapters in zzso signal zzso been zzso Here, we discuss advances in our understanding of the role of this family of adapter proteins in T zzso Their function as regulators of signal zzso in other cell types is also zzso
