zzso zzso factors regulate zzso zzso DNA repair and zzso Tight zzso regulation is crucial for zzso formation and zzso However, virtually nothing is known about the molecular events modulating zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso of these events is essential to understand zzso zzso transformation and zzso Here we show that, in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Further, we have identified zzso delta and zzso as those zzso specifically involved in induction of zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso by novel zzso zzso requires zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso This is the first example of regulation in the zzso zzso factor family by zzso of zzso and zzso in the context of biologically significant differentiation stimuli in zzso
