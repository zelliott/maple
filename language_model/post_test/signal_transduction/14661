zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso for zzso and plays a key role in various inflammatory responses, including zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso zzso a major green tea zzso on the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in a zzso zzso zzso was also found to reduce the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was significantly inhibited by blockade of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso but not by blockade of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obviously attenuated after zzso zzso cells with zzso The zzso media from the zzso zzso cells treated with zzso could remarkably stimulate the migration of zzso zzso and this effect was partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the media from the zzso zzso cells lost the zzso activity for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may exert an zzso effect in zzso cells by controlling zzso zzso at least in part, zzso through the suppression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
