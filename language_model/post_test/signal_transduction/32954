zzso perception is influenced by zzso Here we report that adrenaline can directly affect the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso Application of adrenaline suppressed action zzso near threshold and increased their frequency in response to strong zzso resulting in a zzso dynamic zzso Under zzso conditions, adrenaline enhanced sodium current and reduced zzso calcium zzso Because sodium current is the major component of spike generation and zzso calcium current lowers the threshold in zzso zzso cells, the effects of adrenaline on these currents are consistent with the results obtained under zzso zzso Both effects involved a common zzso pathway, zzso zzso We suggest that adrenaline may enhance contrast in zzso perception by this zzso
