The zzso zzso zzso is a broad specificity zzso that controls several fundamental processes in the heart including the strength and the frequency of contraction, the duration of the cardiac action potential as well as the zzso of signaling pathways associated with the onset of cardiac zzso and heart zzso It is now appreciated that to perform these functions, zzso must be precisely targeted in proximity to its cellular zzso Evidence collected over the last years demonstrates that zzso of the zzso is achieved through the association with zzso zzso proteins zzso This family of functionally related proteins organize zzso signaling complexes that target zzso and other signaling zzso at precise zzso sites within zzso where they can be zzso by zzso and, in turn, zzso and zzso particular zzso
