zzso zzso of genes in the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso system has recently revealed essential roles for these molecules in zzso tissue development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is critical for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso patches and for the structural zzso of the zzso white pulp into distinct B and T cell areas and marginal zzso Moreover, an essential role has been demonstrated for zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso signaling in the formation of zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso cell networks, and zzso zzso In contrast to a previously described essential role for the zzso in zzso patch zzso we show in this report that zzso patches are present in both zzso and zzso knockout mice, demonstrating that these molecules are not essential for the zzso of this zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso segregate normally into T and B cell areas and a normal content and zzso of zzso cells is observed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, although B cells are found to home normally within zzso patches and in the outer zzso area of zzso zzso organized zzso structures and zzso zzso cell networks fail to zzso These results show that in contrast to zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso is not essential for zzso zzso but rather for interactions that determine the cellular and structural organization of B cell zzso in all secondary zzso zzso
