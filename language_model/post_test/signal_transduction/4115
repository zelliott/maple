zzso zzso transport is enhanced by hormonal and other stimuli such as zzso and zzso which induce zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso Whether insulin and zzso share a common signaling mechanism is not yet zzso This study investigated whether zzso zzso zzso a signaling intermediate of the zzso pathway, also zzso in the zzso stimulation of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso rat hearts were subjected to 100 zzso insulin or 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso After zzso relative zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution was assessed by membrane zzso and zzso and compared to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso analog zzso zzso were also studied during zzso of rat zzso 

zzso zzso to the plasma membrane zzso was increased by insulin zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased by insulin zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and increase in zzso zzso zzso However, it did not show any effect on zzso zzso zzso or on zzso increase in zzso zzso A significant correlation was found between relative zzso zzso and zzso zzso in hearts of the insulin series zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and of the zzso series zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso did not inhibit zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis of different signaling pathways for zzso and zzso
