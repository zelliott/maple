The heart at the time of Sir William Harvey originally was thought to be an zzso zzso Today, however, we know that this organ is zzso by sensory nerves that course centrally though mixed nerve pathways that also contain zzso or sympathetic motor zzso zzso or cardiac pain is now well recognized as a zzso pain that occurs during zzso zzso when coronary artery blood flow is zzso zzso (or zzso zzso fibers that are either finely zzso or zzso are responsible for the transmission of information to the brain that ultimately allows the perception of angina as well as zzso of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in zzso hypertension, and sometimes zzso Although early studies defined the importance of the zzso and sympathetic cardiac zzso systems in zzso zzso control, until recently there has been little appreciation of the mechanisms of zzso of the sensory zzso This review examines the role of a number of chemical zzso and their sources that are activated by the zzso zzso In this regard, patients with zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso and unstable zzso are known to have zzso zzso which leads to release of a number of chemical zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which stimulate zzso sensitive cardiac spinal zzso endings in the zzso through specific zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso acid, zzso and zzso oxygen species, especially zzso zzso individually and frequently in zzso stimulate these endings during zzso zzso products appear to sensitize the endings to the action of zzso and zzso These studies of the chemical mechanisms of zzso of cardiac sympathetic zzso endings during zzso have the potential to provide targeted therapies that can modify the angina and the deleterious zzso responses that have the potential to exacerbate zzso and zzso cell zzso
