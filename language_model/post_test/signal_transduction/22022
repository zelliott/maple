The zzso V zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso in men and primary zzso failure in zzso This zzso has previously been associated with zzso retention of the zzso and impaired zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso V zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells provoked zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso V and zzso zzso zzso selectively activated zzso zzso zzso when expressed at low plasma membrane zzso These data indicate that the selective zzso zzso triggered by the zzso V zzso resulted from reduced membrane expression rather than by switching zzso zzso zzso zzso density at the plasma membrane might control the balance between distinct signal zzso zzso Furthermore, our results help to clarify why zzso of zzso are more deleterious to human fertility than the zzso zzso V zzso which preserves parts of zzso zzso zzso
