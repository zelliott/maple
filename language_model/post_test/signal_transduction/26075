zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso are effective zzso indicated for zzso and inflammatory zzso However, they often promote osteoporosis and bone zzso Here, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso did not affect cell cycle progression in zzso zzso zzso or early zzso zzso Starting on day 5, however, zzso strongly inhibited the zzso cell cycle zzso Day 5 also marked the beginning of a zzso commitment stage, during which cultures acquired resistance to the zzso effect of zzso on zzso Considering the importance of zzso signaling in zzso development, we analyzed the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso treatment did not inhibit the zzso zzso reporter before, but only during and after the commitment zzso However, this zzso was not associated with repression of neither zzso D1 nor zzso zzso well-established zzso targets regulating cell cycle zzso On the other hand, acute zzso and chronic (7 zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced both the zzso and protein levels of zzso A, another cell cycle zzso Moreover, zzso A repression by zzso was not observed before, but only during and after the commitment zzso Using gel shift and reporter zzso we identified an zzso site critical for the zzso repression of zzso A zzso Furthermore, and similar to zzso A, zzso expression was zzso by zzso only during and after zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso cell cycle progression in zzso in a zzso zzso manner by zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso
