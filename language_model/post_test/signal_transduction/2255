Taking into account that the zzso of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso regulate gut functions such as tone, zzso and zzso zzso we characterized the expression of zzso in zzso zzso We also studied zzso signals triggered by zzso zzso zzso parameters obtained from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso number of binding sites zzso 30 zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The competitive zzso of zzso specific binding by various zzso zzso zzso was measured and the rank order of potency was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 116 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso order of potency to zzso zzso curve of zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso on zzso strips increased zzso turnover and zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso due to zzso zzso zzso We can conclude that the zzso of different zzso zzso triggers different zzso signals that could regulate zzso tone and zzso
