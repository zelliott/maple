A conceptual framework is developed for the quantitative analysis of signal transfer through cellular signal zzso pathways and zzso This approach is referred to as signal transfer analysis and is based on zzso that were first developed for the analysis of zzso zzso Signal zzso is zzso as the sensitivity, known as the response zzso of a target zzso an zzso channel or zzso zzso to a signal zzso a hormone, growth factor or zzso This response zzso is defined in terms of the fractional change in the activated target brought about by a small fractional change in the zzso zzso the signal zzso in this way makes it possible to prove that for an idealized signaling cascade without feedback zzso the total response equals the product of all the local response zzso one for each level of the zzso We show under which conditions merely having more levels in a cascade can boost the sensitivity of a target to a zzso If a signal zzso to a target through two different routes, these routes contribute independently to the total response, provided there is no feedback from the zzso This independence makes the behavior of signaling zzso different from that of zzso zzso where different branches are connected through zzso zzso The relations between the total response and the local zzso at each level are given for a number of network structures, such as zzso signaling pathways and pathways with zzso The zzso introduced here may provide a general approach to zzso cellular information zzso
