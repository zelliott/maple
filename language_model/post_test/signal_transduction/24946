Despite intensive interest in the zzso process of vascular smooth muscle cells, very little data are available on zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate the evolution of the zzso zzso pools when rat zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso and to define the mechanisms involved in the functional zzso zzso were cultured in different conditions, and zzso was measured by use of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pumps zzso and zzso zzso channels, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso specific for zzso heavy chain zzso were used as indicators of the differentiation state of the cell, whereas an zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso was a marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mainly were present in the zzso in zzso and in freshly isolated zzso These cells used the 2 types of zzso channels to release zzso from a common zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by serum or by zzso growth zzso resulted in the disappearance of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins and in the loss of the zzso and zzso zzso The differentiated zzso zzso was maintained in low serum or in cells cultured at high zzso In these conditions, zzso and zzso were also present in zzso Thus, expression of zzso and zzso is zzso by cell zzso inducing loss of the corresponding zzso zzso In zzso smooth muscle, zzso release through zzso is involved in zzso and suppression of the zzso pool might thus alter the control of vascular zzso
