The zzso zzso zzso zzso channel in zzso is tightly regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Watras, and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Turner, and zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Marshall, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In previous single channel studies, the zzso dependence of channel activity, monitored at 2 zzso zzso was described by a zzso curve zzso zzso zzso Watras, and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso We report here that, when we used lower zzso zzso the peak of the zzso curve shifted to lower zzso zzso zzso when we used high zzso zzso channel activity persisted at zzso zzso as high as 30 zzso To explore this unexpected response of the channel, we measured zzso binding over a broad range of zzso zzso We found the zzso high affinity zzso binding sites (with zzso zzso 1 and 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso De zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Ross, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso and a low affinity zzso binding site zzso zzso 10 zzso Using these zzso binding sites, we developed a new model that accounts for the shift in the zzso curve at low zzso levels and the maintained channel activity at high zzso and zzso zzso The observed zzso dependence of the zzso zzso channel allows the cell to zzso the rise of zzso zzso in the presence of low levels of zzso but also provides a means of maintaining high zzso zzso during periods of prolonged zzso
