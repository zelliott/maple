This paper introduces the application of linear zzso statistical techniques, including partial least squares zzso zzso correlation analysis zzso and reduced rank zzso zzso into the area of Systems zzso This new approach aims to extract the important proteins embedded in complex signal zzso zzso zzso The analysis is performed on a model of zzso zzso along the zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso which produce signal zzso and zzso of zzso factor 3 zzso A region of zzso within the zzso zzso that does not affect the zzso zzso was identified using zzso This is the core finding of this analysis and cannot be obtained by inspecting the model by zzso In addition, zzso was found to isolate terms that do not significantly contribute to changes in protein zzso while the application of zzso does not provide such a detailed picture by virtue of its zzso This analysis has a similar objective to conventional model reduction techniques with the advantage of maintaining the meaning of the states prior to and after the reduction zzso A significant model reduction is performed, with a marginal loss in zzso offering a more concise model while maintaining the main influencing factors on the zzso zzso The findings offer a deeper understanding of the reaction terms involved, confirm the relevance of several proteins to the production of Acute Phase zzso and complement existing findings regarding zzso between the two zzso zzso
