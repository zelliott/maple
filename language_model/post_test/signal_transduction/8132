The mechanisms and consequences of zzso among zzso zzso are poorly understood in biological zzso We present a zzso molecular model of the zzso zzso clock that incorporates recent data implicating the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso zzso as the key zzso zzso The model zzso that zzso arises among zzso zzso because they release zzso rhythmically on a daily basis and in response to ambient zzso Two basic cell types, zzso rhythmic zzso and zzso zzso are assumed to arise from a distribution of Period gene zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso dependent responses to zzso binding through a signaling cascade that activates Period zzso zzso The zzso cell ensemble model zzso zzso to ambient zzso cycles, and zzso in constant bright light or upon removal of zzso zzso The degree of zzso observed depends on zzso features zzso mean and zzso of parameters within the zzso zzso in addition to the more commonly studied effect of zzso zzso zzso These simulations closely replicate experimental data and predict that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso arise from small differences in the molecular parameters between cells, that zzso zzso participate in zzso and zzso of the ensemble of cells, and that constant light zzso zzso by maximizing zzso zzso
