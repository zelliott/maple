The production of leukemia zzso factor zzso is suggested to be critical for the successful zzso of zzso into zzso because zzso expression is essential for the zzso of mouse zzso We investigated the regulation of zzso production by zzso zzso and steroid zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso or transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso production in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a steroid hormone that increases during zzso and early pregnancy, also enhanced zzso production in a zzso zzso These responses were blocked by protein zzso C zzso inhibitor but not by other zzso zzso suggesting an important role of zzso in zzso zzso production zzso by zzso and zzso We also showed that stimulating zzso cells with zzso failed to stimulate DNA synthesis and zzso production in these zzso In zzso zzso was mainly localized in the zzso zzso and zzso and its production was increased by zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso but stimulation of zzso cells by zzso did not influence their proliferation or their zzso zzso
