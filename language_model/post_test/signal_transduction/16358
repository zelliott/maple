We previously reported that the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso was attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso Here, we further examined the underlying zzso involved in the modulating effect of zzso zzso by looking specifically at its impact on the nuclear zzso B zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso either alone or in zzso zzso of zzso protein was measured by zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso while zzso activity was zzso using zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to determine whether the zzso effect of zzso zzso is related to the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso significantly enhanced the nuclear zzso of zzso Exposure to zzso zzso alone did not cause zzso zzso zzso and was able to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso The zzso zzso further confirmed that zzso zzso blocked the nuclear zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the nearly complete degradation of zzso induced by zzso zzso alone, the presence of zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso however, did not affect the zzso response to either species alone or in zzso 

The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses in oral zzso cells appears to involve blockade of zzso nuclear zzso at the level of zzso zzso
