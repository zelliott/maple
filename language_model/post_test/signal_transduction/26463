Many aging changes seem similar to those zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Further, sleep architecture changes with age suggest an age-related loss of zzso Here, we hypothesized that sleep deprivation in young subjects would elicit both stress and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso rats were divided into control and sleep deprivation zzso Body weight, adrenal weight, zzso level and zzso zzso zzso profiles were zzso A second group of animals was exposed to novel environment stress zzso and their zzso zzso profiles zzso A third cohort exposed to control or zzso was used to validate zzso results with Western zzso zzso results were statistically contrasted with prior zzso zzso zzso results pointed to sleep pressure signaling and zzso synthesis disruptions in the zzso zzso zzso Animals exposed to zzso zzso nearly one third of the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso relationship was more zzso Compared to aging, zzso profiles influenced a significant subset of zzso zzso associated with zzso and energy pathways showed agreement between aging and zzso while zzso zzso and zzso synthesis pathways showed zzso profiles that opposed those seen in zzso 

We conclude that although zzso and zzso exert similar zzso changes, selective zzso release machinery and zzso expression changes are seen in zzso Among other changes, the marked decrease in zzso expression with age may represent an important divergence between young and aged brain response to zzso Based on this, it seems reasonable to conclude that therapeutic strategies designed to promote sleep in young subjects may have zzso effects in the zzso Finally, this work identifies zzso zzso release and zzso zzso molecular signatures as novel therapeutic targets to counter effects of zzso in young zzso
