The study of zzso tumor syndromes has laid a solid foundation toward understanding the genetic basis of zzso One of the latest examples comes from the study of zzso sclerosis complex zzso As a member of the zzso zzso is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, zzso heart, zzso and zzso While classically described as zzso the pathology of the zzso has features suggestive of abnormal cellular zzso size, zzso and zzso Occasionally, tumors progress to become zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to zzso in one of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso undergo zzso zzso of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor zzso zzso zzso The functions of the zzso and zzso gene products, zzso and zzso respectively, have remained ill defined until zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the zzso signaling zzso zzso serving as a zzso of zzso and zzso mediates zzso activity by zzso zzso from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, zzso and zzso Emerging evidence also suggests that the zzso 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of zzso and zzso These findings provide novel functional links between the zzso genes and other tumor zzso responsible for zzso disease zzso zzso syndrome zzso and familial zzso zzso Common sporadic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast have ties to these zzso highlighting the potential role of the zzso proteins in human zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso has potent zzso activities in zzso models of zzso and is currently undergoing phase zzso clinical zzso
