Heat shock and chemical stress induce zzso of heat shock zzso genes and synthesis of heat shock zzso It is not yet fully understood which molecular mechanism leads to zzso Probably zzso proteins play an important role in zzso the zzso factor zzso but on the other hand there are many hints that a zzso event is involved, zzso During a search for a possible signal zzso system in zzso Schneider 2 cells we zzso the response of the zzso protein zzso zzso after stress and its regulation by zzso We show here that stress activates a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
