Our aim was to investigate the protective effects of a zzso zzso analogue zzso in the early phase of acute zzso in zzso 

Severe acute zzso zzso was induced by injection of zzso sodium zzso into the pancreatic zzso zzso with zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso after the zzso sodium zzso injection, after which zzso was zzso every 8 hours, three times zzso zzso The sham group was only given the vehicle after zzso Plasma zzso activity, serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso were measured at 4, 12, and 24 h after induction of zzso The pancreatic index and zzso observations were evaluated and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and the expression of zzso in the lungs were detected by zzso 

zzso treated rats had lower serum levels of zzso zzso and zzso at all time points measured zzso zzso zzso but significantly differed in plasma zzso activity only at 24 h as compared with the zzso zzso The pancreatic index and the scores of zzso zzso evaluations were lower in the zzso group as compared to the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso attenuated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso as well as the expression of zzso in the lungs in animals with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso has protective effects in experimental zzso which may be achieved by zzso the zzso zzso pathway, thereby reducing the production of zzso zzso
