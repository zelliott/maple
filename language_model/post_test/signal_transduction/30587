zzso simulation has been widely used in biomedical and biological zzso In the case of the surface zzso zzso activity, some models have been proposed aiming to study muscle contraction strategies that are used during different tasks and zzso Most of zzso zzso are based on energy zzso of a zzso zzso This work proposes a novel simulator in which the zzso parameters are associated with the motor units zzso recruitment and their firing zzso zzso between the mean spectrum of real zzso signals collected in zzso contraction of the muscle biceps zzso and the mean spectrum obtained from simulated zzso signals showed a good agreement, pointing the proposed simulator seems to be capable to generate consistent zzso signals in time and frequency zzso and that can be used in many studies, in particular in the evaluation of automatic methods aimed to detect muscular zzso
