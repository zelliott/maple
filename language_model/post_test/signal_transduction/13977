zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is required for zzso zzso during zzso and mice lacking the gene develop fetal skin zzso and a range of other zzso zzso zzso in members of the zzso gene family cause diseases of the Fraser syndrome zzso zzso zzso blistering is also observed in mice lacking zzso and its zzso zzso In this article, we show that zzso binds to zzso and that this interaction regulates zzso downstream of zzso zzso from zzso mice respond to zzso zzso but with a shorter duration and zzso than do zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso is reduced in cells with zzso zzso leading to reduced basement membrane collagen I zzso These results show that the physical interaction of zzso with zzso can regulate zzso of the zzso zzso downstream of zzso We propose that loss of zzso function promotes zzso blistering in Fraser syndrome as a consequence of reduced zzso activity, in addition to its zzso role in the basement zzso
