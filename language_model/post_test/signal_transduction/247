The zzso factor zzso by the zzso zzso integration site 1 gene zzso is a partner of zzso and zzso zzso It has been implicated in embryonic patterning and zzso and zzso linked to restless legs zzso The zzso C zzso harbors a zzso zzso domain that is zzso by protein zzso A zzso in a manner dependent on the zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso We explored the involvement of another zzso of zzso transcription, namely the zzso zzso zzso of regulated zzso activity zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso by zzso zzso experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between zzso and zzso that is dependent on the zzso C zzso whereas zzso zzso revealed zzso recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso target genes zzso and zzso The zzso interaction domain on zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso region, and zzso zzso lacking this domain attenuated the response to zzso on a natural zzso target zzso Thus, zzso physically cooperate with zzso to achieve zzso zzso through the zzso C zzso suggesting a concerted action in zzso and zzso zzso
