zzso are used to demonstrate a zzso relationship between zzso zzso of a zzso zzso plant, the level of zzso zzso gene zzso lateral root growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso plants expressing the dominant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso were created by stable zzso zzso zzso Single zzso zzso lines were characterized for symbiotic zzso 

zzso plants were zzso insensitive as judged by the lack of the zzso zzso and their continued ability to grow and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso plants with high zzso to zzso had significantly fewer lateral roots and exhibited increased zzso while showing no altered nitrate sensitivity or lack of systemic zzso Whereas zzso shoot growth and zzso were observed in zzso root growth was inhibited similarly to the wild zzso Increased zzso was caused by increased infection and a zzso increase in zzso developing between zzso zzso zzso numbers per zzso increased about zzso in zzso zzso 

The study further demonstrates multiple roles for zzso in zzso initiation by influencing root cell infections and zzso zzso independent of zzso and nitrate zzso of zzso
