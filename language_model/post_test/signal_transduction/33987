zzso is a zzso isolated from the roots of zzso zzso a Chinese herb with zzso zzso However whether zzso itself displayed an zzso activity remained zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso production in zzso zzso zzso inhibited significantly zzso NO production through suppressing zzso NO zzso zzso expression at both protein and zzso levels but failed to affect sodium zzso NO production, zzso zzso activity, and cell zzso Further investigation of the mechanisms revealed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso (a major component of zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso zzso degradation nor zzso nuclear zzso Cellular signaling analysis using zzso protein zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all participated in zzso zzso expression and NO production, but zzso zzso selectively with zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso was attenuated in the presence of zzso We suggested that interfering with zzso zzso zzso and thus blocking zzso zzso might contribute to the suppression effects of zzso on zzso These findings provided the first molecular basis that zzso is an effective agent for attenuating zzso NO zzso
