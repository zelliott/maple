The zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells zzso leads to peripheral zzso a major concern in zzso zzso infected zzso in zzso zzso nerves show a zzso zzso appearance; but the origin and nature of these zzso as well as their role in zzso have remained zzso The data presented show that zzso has a pronounced effect on zzso zzso zzso through regulation of zzso zzso zzso bodies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso nerves for zzso zzso protein zzso a classical zzso marker, revealed accumulating zzso in close association to zzso in infected zzso The capacity of zzso to induce zzso formation was confirmed in in zzso studies with human zzso Moreover, via zzso and zzso analysis, it was found that zzso are promptly recruited to bacterial zzso and that this process depends on zzso reorganization and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and recruitment were found to be independent of zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso recruitment impairment by zzso drugs decreased zzso bacterial zzso Altogether, our data revealed SC zzso zzso in zzso zzso which may represent a fundamental aspect of bacterial zzso in the zzso
