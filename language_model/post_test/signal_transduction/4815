zzso hormone zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso play a crucial role in female and male zzso zzso new information has emerged about the structure, mechanism of zzso and regulation of expression of these zzso Here we provide an overview of the current information on those aspects with an in-depth discussion of the recent developments in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso expression zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso binding zzso designated as zzso zzso was identified by zzso gel mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso from zzso in the down regulated zzso zzso was zzso its binding site on zzso zzso zzso was identified and zzso During zzso down regulation, zzso expression is increased through the zzso and zzso signaling pathway, is zzso to translating zzso binds zzso zzso zzso and forms an zzso zzso zzso This complex is then routed to the zzso degradation machinery resulting in diminished levels of both zzso zzso and cell surface expression of zzso zzso The studies leading to these conclusions are zzso
