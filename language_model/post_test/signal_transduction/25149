Several signal zzso events induced by zzso II zzso binding to the zzso II type 1 zzso resemble those evoked by zzso growth factor zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso We report here, in agreement with previous data, that zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso of the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso via the binding of zzso zzso to zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso complex was inhibited by antioxidants such as zzso and zzso but not by calcium zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso differed significantly from zzso Evidence to support different mechanisms of zzso zzso includes differences in the time course of zzso zzso differing effects of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso zzso differing results when the zzso was directly zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and cell zzso studies that suggested that the zzso complexes zzso by zzso and zzso were located in separate zzso zzso These studies are the first to suggest that zzso of zzso zzso receptors by G zzso receptors involves a unique zzso that regulates a population of zzso zzso receptors different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso
