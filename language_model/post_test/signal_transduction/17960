To investigate whether free fatty acid impair insulin signaling proteins to inhibit insulin action in rat zzso zzso 

After rat zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 12 hours, 24 hours and 36 hours, western zzso was used to assess the protein abundance of zzso zzso and zzso 

The protein content of zzso were significantly zzso and the protein abundance of zzso and zzso was decreased comparing with control in rat zzso cells after incubated with free fatty zzso 

Free fatty acids may inhibit insulin activity in rat zzso cells through zzso the expression of zzso or zzso the expression of zzso and zzso
