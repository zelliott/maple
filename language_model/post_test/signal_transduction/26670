We present a mathematical model of zzso architecture and cavity formation in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that a proposed disparity in internal friction between the stalk and cap zzso zzso substances zzso leads to spatial variation in zzso expansion sufficient to produce the mushroom zzso The capability of zzso signals to induce the formation of a zzso cavity within the cap is then zzso We assume that conversion of bacteria to the zzso state within the cap occurs in response to the zzso or depletion of some signal zzso We zzso show that neither simple zzso zzso nor signal production by one or more zzso of bacteria is sufficient to trigger localized cavity zzso We then zzso demonstrate various hypothetical scenarios that could result in localized cavity zzso Finally, we zzso model iron availability as a detachment signal and show simulation results demonstrating cavity formation by iron zzso We conclude that iron availability is a plausible mechanism by which zzso cavities form in the cap region of zzso zzso
