Cancer cells frequently exhibit gross zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or gene zzso an important source of zzso instability in zzso zzso One of the zzso examples is the formation of zzso zzso pulled in opposite directions by the zzso zzso zzso bridges are associated with DNA double strand breaks zzso While the majority of zzso are repaired correctly, to restore the original zzso structure, incorrect fusion events also occur leading to zzso To identify the cellular repair pathways used to form these zzso structures, we tested a requirement for either of the two major zzso repair pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso end joining zzso Our observations show that neither zzso is essential, but zzso helps prevent zzso When zzso is compromised, the cell appears to use zzso to repair the break, resulting in increased zzso bridge zzso Moreover, intrinsic zzso activity of different cell lines appears to have a positive trend with induction of bridges from DNA zzso
