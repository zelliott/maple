zzso was originally found by genetic studies on zzso zzso zzso that were resistant to zzso of zzso and reported to act in zzso as a zzso zzso exchange factor for G protein alpha zzso However, the zzso role of a zzso zzso zzso on G zzso zzso signaling in intact cells is largely zzso We isolated zzso using a zzso zzso system with zzso and examined the role of zzso on zzso zzso The small interfering zzso of zzso diminished the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the cell membrane in response to the zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was located in the zzso and shown to enhance the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this enhancement on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso exchange activity of zzso for zzso were inhibited by zzso selective inhibitor zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso zzso signal zzso by acting as a zzso regulator in intact zzso
