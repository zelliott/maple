Cooperative interactions in the binding of multiple signaling molecules is a common mechanism for enhancing the sensitivity of biological signaling zzso It is widely assumed this increase in sensitivity of the mean response implies the ability to detect smaller zzso zzso the classic work of Berg and Purcell zzso zzso 20, 193 zzso on the physical limits of zzso we show that the random arrival of zzso signaling molecules at zzso sites constitutes a noise source that is not reduced by zzso zzso makes reaching this limit easier, but cannot reduce the limit zzso
