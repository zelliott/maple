zzso a stem cell marker, is zzso in several types of human cancer and can induce resistance to chemotherapy and zzso of zzso We previously demonstrated that human zzso stimulating hormone zzso can inhibit zzso cancer cell zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso has not been reported in zzso Here, we zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso cancer zzso with benign zzso borderline tumor and zzso zzso as well as different zzso cancer cell lines and normal zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso on zzso expression and related signaling pathways were zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was confirmed and zzso stimulation induced the expansion of zzso cells with a stem zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso molecules that play critical roles in cancer stem cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and these effects were abolished by knocking down zzso suggesting that several cancer stem cell pathways are involved in zzso zzso We also examined zzso expression in surgical specimens of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso compared with benign zzso and borderline tumors, and zzso expression was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso for zzso was increased in zzso zzso when compared with clear cell zzso In zzso the zzso cancer stem cell signaling zzso may mediate zzso zzso of zzso and could provide a target for treatment of zzso zzso
