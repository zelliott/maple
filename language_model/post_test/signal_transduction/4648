Human zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso is a highly aggressive disease commonly treated with chemotherapy and zzso drugs, including zzso There is currently no way to predict which zzso BC patients will benefit from these zzso Previous zzso signatures for zzso BC were developed irrespective of the zzso or the zzso organization of cancer in which only a fraction of cells, zzso cells zzso can sustain tumor zzso Here, we used serial dilution and zzso transplantation zzso to identify zzso mouse zzso zzso as zzso at a frequency of zzso A zzso zzso signature zzso generated on the basis of zzso expressed genes in zzso versus zzso zzso and trained on one zzso BC zzso predicted clinical outcome on multiple independent zzso zzso zzso included zzso genes involved in zzso transition and zzso genes involved in immune zzso Its zzso power was independent of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso BC into low and high-risk subgroups, and was specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso overall survival of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso Whereas zzso was specific to zzso tumors, a previously reported zzso signature was zzso for zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that patients with zzso zzso tumors resisted chemotherapy but responded to chemotherapy plus zzso zzso is, therefore, a powerful zzso signature for zzso BC that can be used to identify high risk patients that would benefit from zzso zzso
