The zzso of the sea zzso zzso has been a useful system for understanding how regions of a simple zzso are specified during early development, as well as how pattern formation leads to the correct zzso of zzso cells during zzso This study examines zzso signals that regulate precise patterning of zzso within the oral region of zzso of the sea urchin, zzso zzso The oral zzso contains at least two types of patterned zzso zzso the zzso that forms the zzso and zzso zzso expressing pattern information required for formation of parallel oral skeletal rods by primary zzso cells zzso Using zzso zzso and cell zzso we show zzso that zzso signaling is capable of producing new oral zzso structures until immediately prior to the zzso stage, zzso that the zzso oral zzso is not committed to produce oral structures until the early zzso stage, zzso that oral zzso patterning cues for zzso are highly local in character, and zzso that interactions between the tip of the zzso and the zzso oral zzso are not required for the differentiation of cells within either zzso These studies suggest that short-range zzso signals within the zzso are involved in specifying zzso oral zzso zzso immediately prior to zzso and that this patterned zzso then influences the zzso of zzso zzso cells in the oral zzso
