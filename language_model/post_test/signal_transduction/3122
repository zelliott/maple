zzso zzso resulted from symbiotic incorporation of zzso into ancient zzso zzso During evolution, zzso lost most of the zzso bacterial genes and only zzso a small fraction including those zzso 13 proteins of the respiratory zzso In this process, many functions were transferred to the host cells, but zzso gained a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation and zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso defective zzso contribute to cell transformation and cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative zzso Most cell and zzso effects of zzso depend on the zzso of respiratory rate and on the production of hydrogen zzso released into the zzso The zzso zzso rate has to remain depressed for cell zzso even in the presence of zzso energy is zzso obtained from increased zzso zzso zzso In response to stress signals, traffic of zzso and zzso zzso proteins in the zzso space zzso zzso large, zzso death promoter, zzso associated zzso and zzso c) is modulated by the zzso condition determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso In this article, we highlight the traffic of the different zzso signaling pathways to zzso and the contributions of zzso to zzso regulation of zzso Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the zzso population in cell cycle and zzso
