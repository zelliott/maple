zzso zzso and zzso are believed to functionally couple zzso activity and synaptic zzso Our previous results indicated that zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways play an important role in setting synaptic strength, and zzso zzso activity limits synaptic responses during zzso synaptic transmission and long-term zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso or an zzso zzso induced synaptic zzso in zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic zzso was expressed in adult but not young zzso To zzso mechanisms underlying zzso synaptic zzso we zzso certain agents affecting zzso signaling pathways with zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso activity can zzso evoked synaptic transmission by weakening zzso zzso signals and downstream protein zzso zzso
