zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso and survival in mature zzso cells zzso We studied the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso We show that zzso behaves as a zzso regulator in cultured zzso human zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso In keeping with its zzso role, stimulation of zzso induced zzso of zzso which was zzso by the zzso regulator zzso but it was independent of zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso of zzso also induced zzso of two zzso targets of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the nucleus and zzso respectively, resulting in zzso with a zzso more resistant to zzso zzso We analyzed if zzso was able to zzso the zzso of these zzso zzso Using pharmacological zzso small interfering zzso and a construct zzso zzso active zzso we show that active zzso fosters and zzso the zzso to the nucleus of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the degradation of the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating a mechanism zzso zzso can control the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this zzso factor could be a zzso of zzso The results provide a novel mechanism zzso active zzso contributes to regulate zzso in zzso They also suggest that upon stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be required to allow complete zzso of zzso and zzso that zzso zzso an extended zzso
