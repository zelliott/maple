The blood brain barrier zzso is essential for insulation of the nervous system from the surrounding zzso In zzso zzso the zzso is maintained by zzso junctions formed between zzso zzso zzso and requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In this study, we describe novel specialized zzso structures zzso that zzso form along the lateral borders of the zzso zzso zzso formation and association with zzso zzso is regulated by zzso signaling and requires zzso zzso zzso an overlap between zzso zzso elevated zzso levels, and zzso light chain zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso of the zzso regulator zzso complex leads to zzso of the zzso Our results suggest a mechanism by which the zzso zzso is maintained by zzso formation of zzso which is supported by zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso close to the zzso junctions enables efficient zzso of membrane gaps formed during nerve zzso zzso
