zzso acid is a potent zzso inhibitor used to combat resistance to zzso and zzso zzso There is a demand for high-yielding zzso strains for industrial production of this valuable zzso zzso acid zzso is initiated by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso To overcome the limited zzso pool and improve zzso acid production, we genetically engineered the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two genes zzso and zzso whose protein products are distinct zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso by targeted gene zzso A doubled production of zzso acid was consistently obtained when zzso was zzso and reversed by zzso zzso of zzso to the cultured zzso further improved zzso acid production giving a greater than zzso increase over wild type, suggesting that zzso became limiting for zzso This is the first reported application of genetic engineering to channel precursor flux to improve zzso acid zzso
