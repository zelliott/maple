AA zzso zzso which possesses both zzso and zzso activities, has been implicated as a zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of both zzso and zzso application of AA on the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso application of AA inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso wherein the zzso curve shifted to a negative zzso zzso Because this effect could be reproduced by treating the zzso with zzso zzso zzso or a zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso that AA itself exerted the observed zzso effects on zzso In contrast, zzso AA significantly zzso the zzso zzso peak when the same protocol that was used for zzso AA was zzso The observed zzso increase that was induced by zzso AA was zzso by the AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso indicating that the effect of zzso AA on zzso was possibly zzso through AA zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study suggest that zzso AA zzso zzso channel activity in rat zzso zzso without zzso conversion, whereas zzso AA zzso the zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso These observations may explain the dual character of AA in zzso zzso
