Two different zzso pathways have been implicated in sweet taste zzso zzso produce zzso zzso zzso whereas synthetic zzso stimulate production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso taste cells by blocking the same resting zzso zzso but the intermediate steps in the zzso pathways have not been zzso In this study, the zzso recording technique was used to examine the role of protein zzso and other downstream regulatory proteins in the two sweet zzso zzso zzso of action currents were zzso from approximately zzso of zzso taste buds in response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 200 zzso a synthetic zzso To determine whether protein zzso C zzso plays a role in sweet zzso taste buds were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso In all zzso taste buds tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso burst of action zzso In contrast, zzso zzso responses in only 4 of 19 zzso taste zzso zzso of zzso by zzso I zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso response by approximately zzso whereas the response to zzso either increased or remained zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso is required for the zzso of synthetic zzso To determine whether protein zzso A zzso is required for the zzso of zzso sweet responses were examined in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (10 and 19 zzso Surprisingly, zzso did not decrease responses to either zzso or zzso Instead, responses to both compounds were increased in the presence of the zzso These data suggest that zzso is not required for the zzso of zzso but may play a zzso role in both zzso such as adaptation of the zzso We also examined whether zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso plays a role in sweet taste zzso by examining responses to zzso and synthetic zzso in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increase in the response to zzso whereas the response to zzso remained zzso These data suggest that the pathways for zzso and zzso are zzso zzso the zzso that is released from zzso stores during stimulation with synthetic zzso may inhibit the response to zzso by zzso of zzso
