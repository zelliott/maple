We previously reported decreased zzso insulin zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice zzso both in zzso and in zzso The focus of the current study was to gain further insight into the signaling role and regulation of zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso 1 zzso on zzso was also zzso as zzso could augment zzso via protein zzso A zzso of zzso and zzso Freshly isolated zzso from zzso and fed male zzso and zzso zzso mice were studied at ages 4 and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was markedly reduced in zzso from both zzso and zzso male zzso mice, whereas a marked zzso in zzso zzso activity became evident only in the older zzso The deficiencies in zzso activities were associated with higher zzso zzso content and reduced zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by high zzso in zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso Severe deficiencies in zzso were found, but only in zzso from zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso was less affected in zzso zzso male zzso mice and not reduced in female zzso zzso delivery of free fatty acids zzso rescued zzso supporting the view that the lack of zzso zzso supply for zzso processes in zzso mice was responsible for the loss of zzso zzso also rescued zzso in zzso mice, indicating that signaling via zzso is not a major zzso for its zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso mice is gender dependent, increases with age, and is influenced by the nutritional zzso Under most circumstances, the major zzso of zzso flux in the zzso involves an zzso other than zzso that is acutely activated by zzso Our results support the view that the availability of zzso zzso through zzso and an additional zzso is involved in providing zzso zzso for zzso signaling for zzso in response to zzso
