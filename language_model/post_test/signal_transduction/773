The regulatory interactions between zzso factors and their target genes can be zzso as a directed zzso At a global level, these regulatory networks display a zzso zzso indicating the presence of regulatory zzso At a local level, zzso such as motifs and zzso can be discerned in these zzso Despite the general zzso similarity of networks across the zzso spectrum, there are interesting qualitative differences among the network zzso such as the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of the zzso factors zzso by a given zzso are drawn from a small set of ancient zzso zzso their relative abundance often shows dramatic variation among different zzso zzso Large portions of these networks appear to have evolved through extensive zzso of zzso factors and targets, often with inheritance of regulatory interactions from the ancestral zzso zzso are zzso to varying degrees among zzso zzso from the structure and evolution of these networks can be translated into predictions and used for engineering of the regulatory networks of different zzso
