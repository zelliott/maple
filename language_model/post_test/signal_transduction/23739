Although uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a central role in the zzso of acute lung injury zzso the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this disorder remain poorly zzso zzso is an important negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced in lung during zzso lung injury, suggesting that generation of zzso may represent a regulatory product during zzso In the current study, we created mice lacking zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the lung inflammatory response to zzso in both zzso zzso mice and the zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso mice displayed significant increase of the lung zzso index zzso vascular leak of zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso These zzso were consistent with zzso evaluation of zzso which showed enhanced inflammatory cell influx and zzso zzso We further identify the zzso factor, zzso protein zzso zzso as a critical downstream target of zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a protective role in zzso zzso by suppressing zzso activity in the zzso zzso the function of zzso would represent prospective targets for a new generation of drugs needed to treat zzso
