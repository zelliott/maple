zzso zzso are functionally regulated by zzso zzso meaning that zzso signaling pathways act on the zzso zzso tail and induce zzso of the zzso at the zzso Both a change in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of the receptors has been described to zzso This zzso signaling is essential for adequate migration of zzso to inflammatory zzso however, the exact underlying mechanism is not zzso We used two zzso of a mouse acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso a suspension zzso and an adherent zzso zzso that were characterized by zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were compared on protein expression profiles by two-dimensional zzso difference zzso zzso zzso We found 86 protein spots that were more than zzso different between zzso and zzso Only 4 protein spots were more than zzso zzso We identified 29 proteins by mass zzso among which were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These proteins were zzso in the zzso cells versus zzso which was verified by Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso resulted in increased high affinity zzso expression and cell zzso zzso of functionally different cell lines from similar origin by zzso might be a successful approach to identify regulatory proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso
