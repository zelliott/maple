The recently cloned scaffolding zzso zzso can assemble multiple molecules involved in signaling zzso Bone zzso mast cells isolated from zzso mice have defective signaling probably due to the lack of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso using the rat zzso leukemia zzso cell line mast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of a significant fraction of it from the zzso to the plasma zzso As in other cells, zzso was found to associate with several signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso C gamma zzso zzso The association of zzso with Lyn and zzso gamma were enhanced after zzso zzso zzso of zzso in rat zzso leukemia zzso cell line cells inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso and the zzso and/or zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso events such as calcium zzso zzso and induction of zzso and zzso gene transcripts were decreased in zzso zzso cells, although zzso zzso as a measure of zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that in addition to the positive effects zzso by zzso that are apparent in zzso mast cells, zzso by interacting with Lyn and zzso gamma may have negative regulatory effects on zzso zzso zzso mast cell signaling and zzso
