Plants need to accurately adjust their development after zzso in the underground darkness to ensure survival of the zzso both in the dark and in the light upon reaching the soil zzso Recent studies have established that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso interacting factors zzso regulate zzso development to adjust it to the prevailing light environment during zzso zzso However, complete understanding of the downstream regulatory network implementing these zzso responses is still zzso In a recent work, published in The Plant zzso we report a subset of zzso genes in zzso zzso that we have named zzso zzso IN zzso Analysis of their functional relevance using zzso showed that four of them present zzso zzso in the dark, and that each affected a particular facet of zzso development, suggesting zzso branching in the signal that zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results also showed an altered response to light in zzso with an impaired zzso regulatory network, indicating that these factors might also be essential to initiate and zzso the zzso adjustment of the zzso to the light zzso
