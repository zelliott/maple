zzso zzso B or zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which in zzso comprises three highly zzso members known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is activated in cells exposed to diverse stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism remains to be fully zzso but occurs downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso generates zzso zzso a zzso second zzso essential for the zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane where it is zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso and possibly other zzso zzso zzso and regulates the function of many cellular proteins involved in processes that include zzso zzso and zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso is frequently zzso active in many types of human zzso zzso zzso zzso can occur due to amplification of zzso genes or as a result of zzso in components of the zzso zzso that activates zzso Although the mechanisms have not yet been fully zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to promote proliferation and increased cell survival and thereby contributing to cancer zzso This review surveys recent developments in understanding the mechanisms and consequences of zzso zzso in human zzso
