The tissue zzso zzso system, which acts independently of the circulating zzso zzso system, is supposed to play an important role in tissue repair in the heart and zzso In the skin, the role of the system for wound healing has remained to be zzso Our study demonstrated that oral administration of selective zzso zzso zzso zzso blocker suppressed zzso zzso and zzso during skin wound healing in zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis indicated the existence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso and zzso In a zzso incorporation study, induction of zzso signaling enhanced the incorporation into zzso and zzso zzso healing migration zzso revealed that induction of zzso signaling accelerated zzso zzso and zzso zzso In these experiments, induction of zzso signaling acted vice zzso Taken together, our study suggests that skin wound healing is regulated by balance of opposing signals between zzso and zzso
