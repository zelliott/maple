The distinctive function of zzso oxide zzso in biology is to transmit cellular signals through zzso and regulate cellular functions in adjacent zzso NO conveys signals as a second zzso from a cell where NO is generated to zzso cells in two zzso one is as gaseous zzso by free diffusion resulting in an zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso and another form is by binding with a zzso such as zzso or protein zzso through zzso zzso zzso Both pathways transmit much of the biological influence of NO from cell where other zzso molecules but NO are zzso through the plasma membrane to the adjacent zzso Since zzso zzso cannot zzso zzso mechanism to get through the membrane as the molecular size is significantly larger than NO zzso it zzso zzso acid zzso to convey signals as a form of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso is the zzso which act as a zzso of the total zzso level in cell, zzso reaction from zzso to zzso is an initial requirement to pass through signal through the zzso Thus, zzso combination of these steps and the regulatory factors involved in this system conform and modify the outcome from zzso zzso via the zzso zzso
