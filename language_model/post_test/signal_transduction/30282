The zzso zzso zzso proteins mediate the zzso zzso of several protein zzso including zzso precursor zzso zzso family members, and zzso but they have also been suggested to function in diverse cellular zzso including zzso signaling and zzso We carried out an zzso zzso study of multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein interaction, and zzso zzso which implicated zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso To test these zzso predictions, we analyzed mice carrying a conditional zzso of zzso and a germ zzso zzso of zzso together with zzso zzso zzso expression under the influence of zzso control zzso zzso B cells deficient in both zzso and zzso function have an unexpected and substantial deficit in both zzso and B cell zzso zzso proliferation and signal zzso events, including a zzso in zzso calcium zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate a fundamental and unanticipated role for zzso proteins in B cell function and emphasize the potency of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in identifying novel zzso signal zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that zzso zzso of zzso for the treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease may have potential consequences for immune system zzso
