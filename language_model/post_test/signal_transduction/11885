zzso migration of zzso zzso to their target territories is essential for correct zzso circuit assembly in the developing zzso Although a cohort of signaling pathways has been implicated in the regulation of cortical projection zzso migration, the precise molecular mechanisms and how a balanced interplay of zzso and zzso functions of candidate signaling molecules controls the discrete steps in the migration process, are just being zzso In this chapter, I will zzso review recent advances that improved our understanding of the zzso and possible zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso in regulating the sequential steps of cortical projection zzso zzso I will then elaborate on the emerging concept that the zzso signaling pathway, acts exactly at precise stages in the course of cortical projection zzso zzso Lastly, I will discuss how finely tuned zzso programs and downstream zzso govern particular aspects in driving zzso migration at discrete stages and how they regulate the precise positioning of cortical projection zzso in the developing cerebral zzso
