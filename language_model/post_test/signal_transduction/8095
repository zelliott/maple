The bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor production and zzso zzso through a zzso signal factor zzso zzso communication zzso The zzso zzso system plays a key role in zzso signal zzso and appears to zzso downstream zzso zzso by changing zzso content of zzso zzso zzso zzso an unusual zzso second zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso global regulator showing a strong zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli, is essential for zzso regulation of zzso factor production but not for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso changed the zzso expression of 299 genes including a few zzso zzso zzso Further genetic and zzso analysis led to identification of a zzso of the zzso regulator zzso and a novel zzso zzso factor zzso These two regulatory factors regulated different sets of genes within zzso zzso These results outline a zzso zzso network by which zzso zzso different biological functions, and may also provide a clue on how the novel zzso signal can be coupled to its downstream regulatory zzso
