zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is a zzso implicated in the zzso of numerous chronic and acute inflammatory zzso In the present study, we have characterized the ability of zzso in inducing zzso zzso in rat skin and have shown the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso on this zzso The zzso injection of zzso human zzso induced a slowly developing, zzso zzso of zzso in rat skin that was zzso at the dose of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the soluble zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso totally inhibited the zzso zzso induced by the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not affected after zzso of rats with the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the intravenous administration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso greatly inhibited the zzso zzso induced by zzso (the responses detected at zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso These results show that zzso is an effective zzso of zzso zzso in zzso with this response being dependent on an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso
