We investigated the action of zzso on zzso cells using patch clamp recording and zzso calcium zzso Application of 100 zzso zzso zzso the resting membrane potential and increased free zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a decrease in input zzso The effect of zzso was zzso and responses persisted following repeated zzso In zzso clamp experiments zzso zzso an outward current associated with a zzso increase and a reversal potential near the zzso potential for zzso The action of zzso was blocked by zzso but not by zzso or zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso blocked the zzso zzso internal calcium with zzso diminished the zzso of the zzso channel, suggesting a zzso zzso which was also found to be regulated by protein zzso C and zzso The increase in zzso calcium was not dependent on external calcium or sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Both the zzso and the increase in zzso calcium were blocked by zzso or the zzso C inhibitor zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso calcium from internal stores by zzso of zzso C which in turn leads to an increase of zzso zzso and thereby to the zzso of a zzso zzso channel in zzso zzso zzso
