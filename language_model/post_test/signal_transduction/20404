zzso target of zzso zzso an important sensor for growth factors, nutritional deprivation and other stresses in controlling translation, plays a critical role in zzso Several zzso exhibited zzso activity zzso with a modest average response rate, while a small subset of patients exhibited significantly greater clinical zzso A better understanding of cellular mechanisms and the results of clinical studies can help identify an optimal zzso to predict the efficacy of zzso zzso We discuss these potential markers in terms of selection of candidates, baseline zzso zzso zzso and source of targeted zzso
