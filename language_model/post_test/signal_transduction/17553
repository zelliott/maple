In primary cultured mouse zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso which activates protein zzso C zzso induced changes in the zzso levels of 10 zzso termed zzso to zzso in two-dimensional zzso Seven of these proteins were zzso and three were zzso Similar changes were induced by other zzso zzso but not by inactive zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly enhanced by zzso and inhibited by a potent zzso inhibitor zzso In zzso zzso studies and zzso acid analysis, using these proteins as zzso and zzso preparations obtained from zzso cell zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were directly zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso was mainly zzso by zzso in intact zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso in zzso cells have different zzso specificity for zzso proteins and may induce different signal zzso
