The knowledge of molecular control mechanisms underlying the zzso tone in the intact human internal zzso zzso zzso is critical for the zzso and rational therapy for a number of debilitating zzso zzso zzso We determined the role of zzso and zzso pathways by comparing the effects of zzso and zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso respectively, on the zzso tone in the zzso zzso the zzso smooth muscle zzso Western zzso studies were performed to determine the levels of zzso II, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso forms, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic studies validated the membrane distribution of ROCK zzso Finally, to confirm a direct relationship, we examined the zzso activities and changes in the zzso zzso tone and zzso zzso and zzso before and after Y zzso and zzso zzso Data show higher levels of zzso II and related downstream signal zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, data show a significant correlation between the active zzso levels, ROCK zzso activity, downstream zzso and zzso zzso tone, before and after ROCK zzso From these data we conclude 1) zzso and downstream signaling are zzso active in the zzso and this zzso (in contrast with zzso is the critical zzso of the zzso tone in intact human zzso and 2) zzso and ROCK are potential therapeutic targets for a number of zzso zzso disorders for which currently there is no satisfactory zzso
