zzso sensing is a cell zzso signaling phenomenon used by bacteria for coordination of zzso zzso such as expression of zzso zzso zzso resistance and zzso zzso Lately, disruption of bacterial communication has emerged as an zzso strategy with enormous therapeutic potential given the increasing zzso of drug resistance in zzso zzso The zzso zzso therapeutic approach promises a lower risk of resistance development, since interference with zzso generally does not affect the growth and fitness of the bacteria and, zzso does not exert an associated selection pressure for drug-resistant zzso With better understanding of bacterial communication networks and mechanisms, many zzso zzso methods have been developed against various clinically significant bacterial zzso In particular, zzso bacteria are an important group of zzso because, zzso they are responsible for the majority of zzso zzso Here, we discuss the current understanding of existing zzso sensing mechanisms and present important zzso strategies that have been developed against this group of zzso zzso
