The vigorous zzso response of immune cells to zzso bacteria is primarily zzso by a recognition zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso which recognizes zzso zzso and zzso a series of zzso zzso signaling zzso Recently, zzso zzso cells zzso were reported to express zzso and to evoke a vigorous zzso response upon exposure to zzso We examined zzso signaling events in human zzso leading to the production of zzso a major urinary zzso following zzso by zzso coli and isolated zzso We observed that in addition to the classical zzso pathway, zzso triggers a distinct and more rapid signaling response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso factor, zzso response zzso zzso This capacity of zzso to mobilize secondary zzso and evoke a more rapid zzso response might be critical in their role as first zzso to microbial challenge in the urinary zzso
