zzso have evolved a number of strategies to gain entry and replicate in host target cells that, for human zzso virus zzso and the zzso zzso virus, involve appropriating zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso events rapidly ensues following virus zzso to zzso zzso cells and affects the ultimate level of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus zzso the rapid zzso of zzso on zzso zzso the association of zzso with zzso and zzso and their zzso within minutes of virus zzso Additionally, we provide evidence for zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso zzso events are not sensitive to zzso toxin zzso Moreover, in cells that are zzso for zzso virus infection, we provide evidence that zzso virus fails to invoke this zzso zzso zzso zzso with the observation that infection of zzso cells is blocked by zzso A and the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso we zzso that viral zzso may be dependent on zzso signal zzso pathways triggered by the infecting zzso virus zzso This provides a novel zzso mechanism by which viruses can co-opt a cellular zzso to permit productive virus zzso
