zzso is an essential signal zzso of the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso and has been identified as a zzso zzso being zzso in zzso 50% of pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been described recently in the human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso Bicknell, zzso zzso zzso and Tomlinson (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 98, zzso Previous work in zzso suggested that only zzso was required for interaction with zzso zzso zzso Penry and Shi (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigate the functional consequences of these point zzso in zzso We demonstrate that neither of these zzso cancer cells undergo growth arrest in response to zzso which can be explained, at least in part, by their inability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) or zzso ( zzso after zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso are expressed at normal levels in these zzso cancer cells, they cannot interact with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso As a result, these zzso zzso do not accumulate in the nucleus after zzso zzso are not recruited to DNA by relevant zzso zzso factors and cannot generate zzso active zzso zzso Therefore both these zzso zzso cells completely lack functional zzso activity zzso to the zzso zzso Given the location of these zzso in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain, the results also give us significant insights into zzso complex zzso
