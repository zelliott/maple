To better understand the molecular zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the spine, an zzso bone formation disease, we performed zzso zzso analysis on cultured ligament cells from zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso is zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso differentiation of human zzso stem cells induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso suppressed zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso probably by zzso binding of the zzso to the zzso since interaction between zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso has two functional zzso a zzso domain (a zzso binding zzso and a zzso domain implicated in protein zzso The zzso effect on zzso differentiation was completely lost with zzso added zzso zzso zzso while partial zzso was retained by the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso action of zzso and the in zzso interaction of zzso with zzso were abolished by the addition of zzso Thus, zzso identified as a zzso gene during zzso zzso suppresses zzso differentiation induced by both zzso and zzso and is a plausible target for therapeutic intervention in zzso
