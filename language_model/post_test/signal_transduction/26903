The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of acute zzso zzso administration on zzso reduction in coronary vascular resistance zzso using isolated zzso zzso rat zzso A zzso curve to zzso was conducted to determine a threshold concentration of zzso We demonstrate that 30 zzso zzso was sufficient to reduce zzso and zzso zzso was achieved with 1 zzso In subsequent experiments, zzso was administered at zzso of 0 zzso zzso 1 zzso or 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso These zzso zzso were chosen because of the zzso relevance and because the effects of zzso on BK action could be assessed independent of baseline differences in zzso zzso to BK zzso was enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This enhancement remained in the presence of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity to BK in zzso similar to the effects of zzso and zzso + zzso However, the zzso enhancement of zzso observed in the presence of zzso did not occur in the presence of zzso + zzso or in the presence of zzso + zzso zzso and NO zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso enhances zzso zzso and reduction in zzso through an zzso mechanism that involves a NO intermediate but is unrelated to acute production of NO and zzso effects of zzso These results suggest a mechanism zzso zzso relevant levels of zzso zzso the zzso zzso oxygen species and NO control of zzso coronary vascular zzso
