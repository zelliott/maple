Recent studies reported that zzso of zzso pump zzso zzso induced zzso to zzso agents in several cancer zzso The devastating effects of zzso on tumor cells were discovered and raised great zzso therefore we designed the following experiments to fully explain the direct zzso effects of zzso 

We compared the viability of gastric cancer cells and zzso cells in zzso and zzso culture conditions with zzso treatment by zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso of gastric cancer cells zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso calculation and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was detected by zzso Western zzso analysis and real time zzso were used to evaluate the expression and zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso 

zzso selectively exhibited a zzso zzso effect of gastric cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso Low dose of zzso zzso (20 zzso enhanced the sensitivity to zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso induced cell zzso and reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso specifically in gastric cancer cells, but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso not the total amount, was suppressed by zzso in gastric cancer zzso The downstream targets of zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso were also zzso 

zzso causes gastric cancer cell death by induction of zzso and its mechanism of action is zzso in part via the zzso of zzso zzso
