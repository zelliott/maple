A rat model of zzso obesity zzso was used to determine zzso zzso zzso function, zzso and motivation as zzso outcomes and zzso of zzso 

To evaluate zzso zzso following the development of zzso induced by an zzso high-fat diet zzso exposure, zzso zzso density, zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and motivation for zzso and low-fat zzso were zzso To determine zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso motivation for high-fat zzso zzso function and zzso zzso were evaluated before the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso density was determined by in zzso kinetic analysis of zzso zzso zzso function was determined using in zzso kinetic analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso overflow and zzso flux in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was determined using zzso and western zzso zzso and zzso behavior were determined using a delay zzso task and progressive ratio schedule, zzso 

Relative to zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso rats exhibited zzso greater body weight following an zzso zzso exposure, zzso lower zzso zzso density, zzso lower total zzso zzso zzso lower in zzso and in zzso zzso function, zzso greater zzso zzso and twofold greater zzso zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited higher motivation for food, and surprisingly, were less impulsive relative to OR zzso zzso in zzso zzso function and zzso zzso concentration did not predict zzso zzso motivation for high-fat zzso predicted the development of zzso 

Human studies are limited by their ability to determine if zzso motivation and zzso function are causes or consequences of zzso The current animal model shows that motivation for high-fat food, but not impulsive behavior, predicts the development of zzso whereas decreases in zzso zzso function are exhibited only after the development of zzso
