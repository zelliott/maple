Gap junction zzso communication zzso or cell zzso has an important function in maintaining tissue zzso and is thus a critical factor in the life and death balance of zzso While the role of zzso in cell growth regulation has been much zzso its involvement in zzso remains zzso In this study we zzso the possibility that cell death is zzso via gap zzso employing the rat zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso cells zzso quickly, are zzso and are zzso via gap junctions that contain the gap junction protein zzso zzso In addition, these cells are predisposed to spontaneous death by zzso particularly upon achieving zzso We found that many dying zzso cells express zzso just as their zzso counterparts zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso cells could be functionally competent, supporting zzso of these cells with their zzso neighbors, and as a result, clusters of zzso dying cells were zzso The role of zzso and zzso in zzso cell death was shown by zzso clones of zzso cells expressing a zzso of zzso that is a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso and by using zzso acid to inhibit intrinsic cell zzso in zzso zzso in both cases the formation of clusters of dying cells was zzso and the intensity of cell death was considerably zzso These results suggest that zzso spreads zzso signals initially generated by a single cell that spontaneously zzso zzso into healthy surrounding cells, thus increasing the level of cell zzso Treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso which selectively restricts gap junction zzso to zzso zzso did not abrogate coordinated cell death by zzso indicating that zzso zzso are the most probable zzso signals spread through gap zzso
