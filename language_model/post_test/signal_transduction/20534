The zzso zzso are zzso proteins involved in development, immunity and zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso are zzso that enhance responses to several growth factors zzso and other zzso zzso are zzso for the class 3 zzso zzso involved in zzso guidance, and several members of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso However, recent findings reveal they have a much broader spectrum of zzso They bind transforming growth factor zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso derived growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso growth factors zzso and zzso zzso also promote zzso zzso These zzso and pathways are all relevant to zzso and wound zzso In the immune system, the zzso are expressed primarily by zzso cells zzso and regulatory T cells zzso and exert mainly zzso zzso In cancer, zzso have been linked to a poor zzso which is consistent with their numerous interactions with zzso and receptors that promote tumor zzso We zzso that zzso boost responses by capturing zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and recycling, and possibly also by signaling zzso zzso they promote zzso transition zzso and the survival of cancer stem zzso The recent finding that zzso bind and zzso zzso peptides zzso with zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso zzso is of zzso These zzso can be coupled to large drugs for cancer zzso Almost all studies have been zzso but findings suggest zzso are excellent targets for zzso drug zzso
