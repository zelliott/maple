In animals, many cells reach their destinations by zzso toward higher zzso of an zzso However, the nature, generation, and interpretation of zzso zzso are poorly zzso Using a zzso fusion and a signaling zzso we analyzed the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso during migration of the zzso zzso lateral line zzso a cohort of about 200 cells that zzso over a stripe of cells zzso expressing zzso We find that a small fraction of the total zzso pool is available to signal and zzso a linear zzso zzso across the zzso This signaling zzso is initiated at the rear of the zzso zzso across the zzso within 200 zzso and operates near steady zzso The rear of the zzso generates this zzso through continuous zzso of zzso protein by the alternate zzso zzso Modeling shows that this is a physically plausible zzso
