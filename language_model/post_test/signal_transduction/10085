zzso 1 was originally identified as a novel zzso zzso but zzso studies suggest that the major zzso partner for zzso 1 is the zzso class III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 has been proposed to function as a tumor zzso by promoting cellular zzso a process that is known to depend on zzso However, an alternative role for zzso 1 in modulating normal zzso protein trafficking pathways has not been ruled zzso This possibility was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 contained human zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso 1 expression by short interfering zzso gene zzso blunted the zzso response of the cells to zzso deprivation or zzso However, other zzso zzso trafficking zzso such as the zzso sorting of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso or the zzso processing of zzso D en route from the zzso network zzso to zzso were not zzso zzso of zzso 1 did not reduce zzso zzso of a fluid phase marker zzso zzso zzso or cause swelling of late zzso compartments typically seen in cells where the function of zzso is zzso These findings argue against a role for zzso 1 as an essential zzso or zzso for zzso in normal zzso trafficking, and they support the hypothesis that zzso 1 functions mainly to engage zzso in the zzso zzso
