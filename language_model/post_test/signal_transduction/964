The resurgence of malaria is at least partly attributed to the absence of an effective zzso zzso resistance to zzso drugs and resistance to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Novel strategies are needed to combat the disease on three fronts: protection zzso zzso zzso zzso and transmission zzso The latter zzso either killing the mosquitoes zzso preventing zzso biting zzso and zzso blocking zzso development in the zzso zzso blocking zzso genetic manipulation or chemical zzso of the zzso During the past decade, zzso research has been energized by several zzso including the successful transformation of zzso zzso analysis of gene function by zzso zzso expression profiling using DNA zzso and, most importantly, sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso These breakthroughs helped unravel some of the mechanisms underlying the dynamic interactions between the zzso and the zzso and shed light on the zzso innate immune system as a set of potential targets to block zzso zzso In this context, putative pattern recognition receptors of the zzso that act as positive and negative regulators of zzso development have been identified zzso zzso these molecules and others of similar function, and identifying their zzso on the zzso surface, will provide clues on the nature of the interactions that define an efficient zzso system and open up unprecedented opportunities to control the zzso capacity of zzso zzso
