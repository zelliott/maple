Environmental sensing in bacteria often involves the concerted action of sensor zzso and response zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of zzso acid similarity in the response regulators of these zzso zzso The zzso were used in zzso to specifically amplify an internal DNA segment corresponding to the receiver module domain from genes zzso response zzso zzso products of the expected size were obtained from 12 different zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that 22 DNA fragments, which clearly originated from response regulator zzso were amplified from zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In each of these four species the receiver module of putative response regulator zzso which do not seem to be related to any of the already characterized zzso was zzso This simple and powerful method is therefore particularly useful for discovering new signal zzso systems which cannot be revealed by usual genetic zzso
