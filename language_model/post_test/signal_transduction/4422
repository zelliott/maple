In many types of zzso cells, the zzso of surface receptors leads to the production of zzso zzso and calcium release from zzso zzso zzso release can occur in complex spatial patterns, including waves of release that traverse the zzso Fluorescence video zzso was used to view calcium waves in single mouse zzso zzso The propagation of calcium waves was slowed by buffers that bind calcium quickly, such as zzso but not by a buffer with slower zzso zzso This shows that a key feedback event in wave propagation is rapid diffusion of calcium occurring locally on a scale of zzso 1 zzso The zzso product of zzso was used to determine that calcium acting in feedback zzso at nearly the rate expected for free diffusion in zzso zzso In zzso which contains immobile zzso zzso this rate of diffusion occurs only in the first zzso zzso after release, within zzso zzso of a zzso release channel zzso zzso diffusion from an open channel to neighboring release sites is, therefore, a zzso zzso step in calcium wave zzso The theoretical limitations of the wave front analysis are zzso
