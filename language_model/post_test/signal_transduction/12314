zzso hormone zzso zzso are the central regulators of zzso zzso stimulates or zzso zzso zzso activity depending on zzso The mechanisms for these actions remain zzso We hypothesized zzso acts in part by altering fast synaptic transmission to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso currents zzso both of which can zzso these zzso were recorded from zzso zzso in brain slices from adult intact and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the frequency of zzso transmission to zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso transmission were reversed by zzso replacement, suggesting zzso is a zzso of steroid feedback in zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso (20 zzso reduced zzso zzso frequency in zzso zzso from both zzso and intact zzso High zzso (2 zzso had no effect on either zzso or zzso transmission to zzso zzso To investigate mechanisms zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso transmission, zzso zzso were recorded after arresting zzso activity with zzso toxin zzso zzso abolished the zzso effect of low zzso Moreover, zzso uncovered a zzso effect of high zzso on zzso zzso These data suggest zzso zzso suppresses zzso firing rate in part by decreasing zzso transmission to the zzso zzso independent of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso appears to exert the zzso effect by zzso zzso coupled to zzso The zzso effects of zzso may be zzso in part by changes in affinity of zzso to zzso coupled to different zzso zzso
