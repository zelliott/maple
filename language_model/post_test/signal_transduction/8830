zzso zzso is a commonly used drug to treat various types of zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso zzso to zzso peptides zzso represent a valuable strategy to overcome drug resistance in zzso 231 breast cancer zzso In the present study, we evaluated the properties of these zzso zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso were found to induce zzso death in zzso 231 cells at a lower dose than that needed for zzso zzso Cell death induction was associated with zzso zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, whereas zzso zzso was very potent in zzso zzso triggered by zzso this zzso protein was largely inefficient in preventing zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso disruption is the main event in zzso zzso signaling but that zzso are probably able to trigger additional zzso pathways independent of zzso zzso Thus, the higher efficacy of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso induction might not be due exclusively to increased drug zzso but also to the zzso of multiple zzso zzso
