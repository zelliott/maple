The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso is responsible for a wide range of acute and chronic zzso The transition to chronic infections is accompanied by zzso changes in the bacteria favoring formation of zzso zzso Here we report the identification of zzso a hybrid sensor zzso that controls the zzso expression of genes for type III zzso and zzso zzso zzso organization of zzso and the range of zzso genes suggest that it zzso the activities of another sensor zzso zzso These two pathways zzso by controlling the zzso of a small regulatory zzso zzso This work identifies a previously zzso signal zzso network in which the activities of zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate expression of zzso genes associated with acute or chronic infection by zzso and zzso zzso
