The zzso signal zzso system constitutes one of the primary means for zzso communication in the central nervous system, but only recently has this system been studied in human zzso Although some investigations have studied zzso signaling in slices from zzso human brain, due to the limited access to such material a greater number of studies have zzso zzso prepared from zzso human zzso With zzso exposed to zzso labeled zzso zzso of zzso C with zzso with zzso zzso by zzso gamma S or zzso or with several zzso zzso have demonstrated that all of the components of the zzso system are retained in human brain zzso and are responsive to appropriate zzso Investigators have begun to examine the effects of neurological zzso disease, zzso Parkinson's disease) and psychiatric zzso major depression, bipolar affective zzso diseases on the activity of the zzso zzso Alzheimer's disease has been studied to the greatest extent and a severe deficit in zzso signaling has been identified in most zzso In addition, brain regionally selective deficits in zzso function associated with zzso signaling have been reported in subjects with major depression or with bipolar affective disorder, and in the latter an zzso effect of the therapeutic drug zzso was zzso Although significant progress has been achieved in studying the zzso system in human brain, many issues remaining to be addressed are discussed in this zzso With carefully controlled studies, it appears that much will be learned in the near future about the zzso signal zzso system in human brain and the effects of a variety of disorders on its zzso
