In the event of a radiation accident or attack, it will be imperative to quickly assess the amount of radiation exposure to accurately zzso victims for appropriate zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso offer the potential to rapidly screen thousands of individuals in an efficient and cost-effective zzso However, prior to the development of these zzso it will be critical to identify those genes that will be most useful to delineate different radiation zzso Using global expression zzso we examined expression changes in zzso T cells across a wide range of doses zzso zzso Because many radiation responses are highly dependent on time, expression changes were examined at three different times zzso 8, and 24 zzso zzso identified 61, 512 and zzso genes with significant linear zzso expression changes at 3, 8 and 24 zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso a model was developed to estimate in zzso radiation zzso using the expression of three genes zzso zzso and zzso and validated in an independent test set with zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso expression zzso for a small subset of genes can be employed to develop clinical zzso zzso to be used in assessments of radiation exposure and zzso
