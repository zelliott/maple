Plants and animals activate defenses after zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso such as bacterial zzso In zzso perception of zzso increases resistance to the zzso zzso zzso although the molecular mechanisms involved remain zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso a plant zzso zzso that zzso regulates zzso zzso for the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso signaling restricts zzso zzso growth, implicating zzso in disease zzso and zzso suppression of zzso signaling in zzso
