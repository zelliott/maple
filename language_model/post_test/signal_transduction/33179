Many signals that cause zzso cell death operate by inducing zzso and translation of other (presumably death zzso zzso and it is well established that zzso zzso can often be blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulation of zzso however, is incompletely zzso To gain insight into nuclear events associated with zzso zzso during T cell development, we studied zzso zzso of ex zzso isolated immature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing the T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso or its parts (an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso or a stimulus that zzso zzso signaling and zzso in T cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso resulted in massive zzso of zzso zzso At the same time, these stimuli induced zzso similar but zzso unique patterns of zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We focused our attention on the role of zzso zzso complex, which was strongly induced by all of the above stimuli and thus was a candidate for a zzso zzso However, we found that zzso induction was vital in zzso zzso zzso life, as judged by increased spontaneous and induced death of zzso cells in zzso zzso In direct support of this hypothesis, experiments with zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso plays an essential role in protecting normal zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso but not from zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate a zzso role for zzso in maintaining longevity of zzso zzso
