To discuss the mechanisms of zzso at zzso zzso 6) on zzso zzso signaling zzso in rats with cardiac zzso 

Forty zzso rats were randomly divided into four groups: a normal group, a model group, a model plus zzso zzso inhibitor group, a model plus zzso group, ten rats in each zzso The model rats were established by subcutaneous injection 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso model plus zzso zzso inhibitor group were injected zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific inhibitor zzso zzso model plus zzso group was treated by zzso at zzso 6) with zzso 2 zzso and 1 zzso for 20 minutes, once a day for 14 zzso There was no treatment in other two zzso The contents of zzso and zzso in heart tissue were detected by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso by western zzso 

Compared with normal group, the contents of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in model group (all P zzso zzso The contents of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly decreased in model plus zzso zzso inhibitor group and model plus zzso group, compared with model group, all P zzso zzso compared with normal group, P zzso zzso P zzso zzso but no significant difference between model plus zzso zzso inhibitor group and model plus zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso 6) can prevent the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the mechanism maybe adjust zzso zzso signaling zzso by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso
