zzso comprise a group of biologically active compounds whose structural diversity is generated by the coordinate action of zzso zzso and a group of zzso zzso that are specialized for the metabolism of zzso fatty zzso Research on zzso has focused mainly on the zzso of the plant signaling zzso zzso acid, and its role in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Recent genetic studies indicate that zzso precursors of zzso are active as signals in their own right, and that the synthesis and perception of zzso is critical for zzso systemic defense zzso zzso evidence indicates that the collective biological importance of zzso in plants is comparable to that of the zzso family of zzso zzso in zzso
