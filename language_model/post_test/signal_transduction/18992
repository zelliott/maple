In our previous studies, we demonstrated the zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso However, the upstream signals zzso zzso zzso have not yet been zzso zzso mainly generated from the degradation of zzso was hypothesized upstream above zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, nerve growth factor zzso is supposed to be involved zzso zzso was demonstrated previously in zzso zzso In the present study, zzso was shown to activate neutral zzso zzso immediately, with its maximum at 15 zzso The zzso and zzso enhanced by zzso was inhibited when added with zzso the zzso zzso indicating zzso as the downstream signals of zzso To investigate whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso pathway, cells were treated with zzso added with or without zzso It showed that zzso zzso blocked zzso expression and zzso 3 zzso Likewise, zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso 3 zzso The zzso zzso induced by zzso was also eliminated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso To further confirm whether zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso cells were analyzed the zzso rate by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced 40 and zzso by 10 and 20 zzso zzso zzso It indicated that zzso zzso is pivotal in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are suggested to mediate upstream above zzso thus zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
