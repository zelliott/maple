The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso the zzso system would restore insulin signaling and zzso zzso use in hearts from obese zzso zzso Mice were treated for 4 zzso with zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of free fatty zzso zzso and insulin were measured and zzso tolerance tests zzso Rates of zzso zzso and zzso oxygen consumption, and cardiac power were determined in isolated working hearts in the presence and absence of insulin, along with levels of zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso treatment did not correct the zzso or impaired zzso tolerance in zzso zzso Rates of fatty acid zzso were increased and zzso decreased in zzso hearts, and insulin did not zzso zzso use in hearts of zzso mice and did not increase zzso zzso zzso restored the ability of insulin to regulate fatty acid zzso and zzso in hearts of zzso mice, possibly by increasing zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso which was increased in hearts of zzso mice, was zzso by zzso treatment, suggesting that in addition to restoring insulin sensitivity, zzso treatment improved zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso restore the responsiveness of zzso mouse hearts to insulin and zzso zzso activity independently of effects on systemic zzso zzso
