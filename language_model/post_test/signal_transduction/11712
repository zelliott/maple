zzso plant responses to insect attack include the release of volatile zzso These zzso are used as zzso signals by zzso zzso which are natural enemies of insect zzso A plant's response to zzso can be influenced by factors present in insect oral zzso zzso zzso identified in beet zzso zzso zzso oral secretions, stimulates volatile release in corn zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner similar to beet zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to trigger release of induced zzso at least in part, by modulating levels of the wound hormone, zzso acid zzso We compare the zzso volatile release of damaged leaves treated with zzso buffer only or with the same buffer containing zzso or zzso zzso were damaged by scratching with a zzso and test solutions were applied to the scratched zzso The leaves were either excised from the plant or left intact shortly after this zzso Plants were treated at three different times zzso as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were collected in the subsequent zzso zzso and zzso treatments zzso the release of volatile zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso In all cases, zzso zzso significant zzso release above mechanical damage zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso for all zzso zzso and the zzso intact zzso zzso treatments in the zzso and Morning intact plants produced more zzso than the zzso controls, while mechanical damage alone produced an intermediate response that did not differ from either treatment zzso zzso leaves produced a zzso to zzso greater volatile response than similarly treated intact zzso zzso also altered the ratio of zzso zzso zzso release by zzso increasing zzso levels relative to zzso The zzso of volatile release varied with time of zzso On average, zzso release was highest in the zzso excised leaves and lowest in the Morning intact zzso The duration of induced volatile release also differed between zzso On average, zzso produced a sustained release of zzso over time, with over zzso of the combined zzso released in the third and final volatile collection zzso In contrast, less than zzso of the combined zzso induced by zzso were zzso during this zzso The large quantitative differences between intact plants and detached leaves suggest that the results of zzso using excised zzso should be cautiously interpreted when considering zzso zzso
