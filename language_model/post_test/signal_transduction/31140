The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are important components in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso guidance and cell zzso We report the first crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain at zzso zzso The unusual side chain zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso pocket renders the zzso binding pocket shallow and narrow, which contributes toward the low binding zzso Moreover, the opposing zzso charge and the zzso properties of the zzso specificity pocket are consistent with the observed binding characteristics of the zzso zzso domain to its zzso Surface zzso resonance experiments indicate that the zzso zzso domain interacts with its natural zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain can bind to both the zzso and zzso motifs in zzso The zzso two zzso zzso in the zzso motif recognition site are necessary for zzso zzso domain zzso A longer zzso zzso zzso binds with greater affinity than its shorter counterpart, suggesting that the zzso surrounding the zzso core are important for zzso zzso Our study reveals previously unknown properties of the zzso zzso Our data provide a structural basis for the zzso interaction, consistent with the role of the zzso zzso domain in interacting with other downstream signaling molecules and zzso versatile and dynamic responses to zzso guidance and cell migration zzso
