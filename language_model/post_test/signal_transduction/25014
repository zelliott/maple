zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of zzso zzso To investigate the normal function of the zzso gene and the zzso mechanism of zzso death in specific areas of the brain, we isolated and analyzed a gene that shares a notable motif with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The gene isolated, designated zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso of which the zzso portion has zzso zzso to zzso whereas the zzso portion is zzso zzso also contains zzso acid zzso zzso repeats and putative nuclear zzso signal zzso but no zzso zzso zzso is expressed at a low level in most zzso zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso demonstrate that the zzso and zzso proteins bind each other, for which one of the zzso repeats has a primary role, and extended zzso enhances the zzso With engineered zzso fused with a tag, the zzso protein localized predominantly in the zzso Moreover, when zzso is zzso the distribution of zzso zzso protein alters from the diffused to the speckled pattern in the nucleus so as to zzso with zzso More zzso protein is recruited into nuclear zzso of the zzso protein with extended zzso than into those of pure zzso These results reveal a function for the zzso protein in the nucleus and the zzso repeat in the zzso zzso
