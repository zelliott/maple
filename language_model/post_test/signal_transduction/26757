zzso zzso cancer is the most lethal zzso zzso and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the Western zzso zzso zzso factors have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during a variety of zzso processes including cell growth and zzso We recently examined the role of the zzso zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso cancer and described zzso as being zzso in zzso tumor samples as compared with zzso tissue zzso In zzso cancer cells, we showed that zzso regulated the expression of cell zzso zzso enhancing zzso cancer cell survival in zzso conditions and suggesting that it plays a role in zzso cancer cell dissemination and zzso into the zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso zzso factor during zzso cancer cell zzso we analyzed by gene expression zzso technology those genes whose expression was altered in an zzso cancer cell line with a stable zzso of zzso The analysis of the genes and signaling pathways under the control of zzso in zzso cells has unraveled new signaling pathways that interact with zzso among them the zzso progression and the zzso signaling zzso In addition, we found that the zzso of zzso reduced the expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso tumor samples, and its zzso levels increased with zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso Moreover, zzso expression levels increased with tumor grade, suggesting a role in the progression of zzso zzso
