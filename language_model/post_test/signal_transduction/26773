A decade since the availability of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso no promising drug has seen the light of the zzso This not only indicates the challenges in discovering new drugs but also suggests a gap in our current understanding of zzso zzso We attempt to bridge this gap by carrying out extensive zzso and constructing a systems level protein interaction map of zzso with an objective of finding novel drug target zzso zzso this, we zzso crowd sourcing and social networking methods through an initiative zzso to zzso zzso to generate the first and largest manually curated zzso of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso encompassing a total of zzso proteins connected through zzso functional zzso zzso leading to gene regulation, signal zzso zzso structural complex formation have been zzso In the process, we have functionally zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in context of gene zzso We further combine zzso with STRING based network to report central zzso which may be assessed as potential drug targets for development of drugs with least possible side zzso The fact that five of the 17 predicted drug targets are already zzso validated either genetically or zzso lends zzso to our unique zzso
