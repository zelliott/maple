zzso calcium zzso regulate diverse cellular events including zzso zzso gene transcription, and synaptic zzso The calcium signal is zzso in part by the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade that is comprised of zzso zzso zzso and its primary downstream zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cascade also zzso in zzso with other signaling zzso zzso can activate the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso can directly zzso two zzso sites zzso and zzso in zzso Here we report an additional zzso regulation of zzso through its interaction with protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells as well as from rat brain zzso and zzso zzso studies identified zzso in zzso as the primary zzso binding zzso In cultured rat zzso zzso and acute zzso slices this interaction was robustly zzso by zzso of zzso through zzso treatment and was blocked by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso had two regulatory consequences in zzso It directly inhibited zzso activity, and it also blocked zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso In human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso with zzso prevented zzso of zzso to the same extent as did zzso of protein zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that binding of zzso to zzso zzso its zzso by zzso zzso which may have important consequences in the regulation of zzso zzso protein zzso B, and zzso signaling zzso
