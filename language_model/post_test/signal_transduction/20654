The healing of a fracture depends largely on the development of a new blood vessel network zzso in the zzso During zzso tip cells lead the developing zzso in response to zzso signals, amongst which vascular zzso growth factor zzso is zzso In order to ensure a correct development of the zzso the balance between stalk and tip cell zzso must be tightly controlled, which is primarily achieved by the zzso signaling zzso This study presents a novel zzso model of osteogenesis and zzso zzso incorporating lateral zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso and applies it to fracture zzso The zzso model correctly predicted the bone zzso process and zzso many zzso observed aspects of tip cell zzso the salt and pepper pattern seen for cell zzso an increased tip cell density due to the loss of zzso and an excessive number of tip cells in high zzso zzso When zzso concentration was even further increased, the zzso model predicted the absence of a vascular network and fracture healing, thereby leading to a zzso which is a direct consequence of the mutual zzso of neighboring cells through zzso zzso This result was not retrieved for a more zzso model that only considers zzso signals for tip cell migration, which illustrates the importance of implementing the actual signaling zzso rather than zzso zzso Finally, the zzso model demonstrated the importance of a proper criterion for tip cell selection and the need for experimental data to further explore zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the zzso model creates enhanced capabilities for investigating the influence of molecular mechanisms on zzso and its relation to bone formation in a more zzso way and across different time and spatial zzso
