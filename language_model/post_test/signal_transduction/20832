The zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso One is the zzso zzso filaments which fill the zzso and mediate zzso zzso The other is the membrane zzso which coats the plasma membrane and regulates properties of the membrane such as its contours and zzso In the zzso zzso only zzso of the zzso is zzso into zzso the rest is thought to be prevented from zzso by the association of zzso beta 4 with zzso zzso and by the association of zzso with the barbed ends of pre-existing zzso zzso When zzso are zzso there is a rapid increase in zzso zzso new filaments fill the extending zzso and form a network at the periphery of the zzso As a result of zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso causing them to move towards the center of the zzso As zzso aggregate, additional zzso reorganizations zzso zzso zzso associates with adhesive zzso in a zzso zzso this results in the association of zzso zzso membrane skeleton zzso and signaling molecules with zzso zzso Future studies should help to zzso the significance of the zzso in regulating signal zzso events in zzso
