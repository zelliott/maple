zzso and zzso form a family of pore proteins that facilitate the efficient and selective flux of small zzso across biological zzso We studied the selectivity of zzso zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using molecular dynamics simulations, we calculated zzso of mean force for zzso zzso along the zzso channels and compared them with the alternative zzso across the zzso zzso For small zzso zzso through zzso a remarkable zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was observed, whereas the opposite trend was observed for zzso through the zzso This finding renders zzso a selective filter for small polar zzso whereas zzso was found to be highly permeable for small zzso and permeable for larger zzso Surprisingly, not zzso but zzso interactions were found to be the key zzso underlying the selectivity mechanism of zzso zzso a zzso effect, together with zzso zzso determines the selectivity of zzso
