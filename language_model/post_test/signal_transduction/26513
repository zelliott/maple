zzso stress is associated with several major zzso However, it is only recently that the developments in our molecular level understanding of the consequences of zzso stress in zzso the chemical structures of zzso lipids in particular, are beginning to open new emerging insights into the significance of zzso stress in providing zzso insights into the zzso of these zzso In this brief review we will first discuss the role of zzso zzso in controlling the membrane binding of zzso zzso a key protein in the control of zzso We then present an overview of the impact of oxidized zzso on the zzso properties of zzso zzso and continue to discuss, how these altered properties can account for the observed enhancement of formation of intermediate state zzso by zzso zzso forming peptides associated with pathological conditions as well as host defense peptides of innate zzso In the third part, we will discuss how the targeting of oxidized zzso by zzso pathology associated peptides and zzso host defense peptides can readily explain the observed clinical correlations zzso Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases with increased risk for type 2 diabetes and age-related zzso zzso and the apparent protective effect of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases from some zzso as well as the zzso apparent protection by cancer from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso properties and interactions with zzso
