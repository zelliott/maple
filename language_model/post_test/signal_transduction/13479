Our previous studies using molecular dynamics have shown a hinge zzso motion between the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso et zzso zzso The hypothesis that this motion is allowed by zzso zzso and zzso and that this motion may affect the zzso exchange was tested in this zzso zzso of zzso 56 were carried out and the zzso proteins were expressed in zzso cells using the zzso expression zzso The zzso proteins were zzso using zzso affinity zzso The results for the zzso exchange zzso showed that zzso and double zzso zzso proteins differ significantly from the wild type and zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso binding of those zzso have decreased by approximately zzso No difference in the zzso activity was detected for the zzso Thus, the zzso results obtained support the conclusions of the zzso zzso
