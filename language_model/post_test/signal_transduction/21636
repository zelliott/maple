The functional significance of zzso receptors zzso in zzso cells is largely zzso and the zzso consequences of their zzso are poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso protein and zzso expression in human zzso cells without zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was accompanied by sustained production of zzso the stable zzso product of zzso and this was inhibited by zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso stimulation rapidly activated both zzso and zzso and pharmacological blockade of zzso with either zzso or zzso or of zzso by zzso or zzso strongly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased zzso activity in human zzso vein zzso cells infected with an zzso zzso reporter zzso and this, as well as zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso generation were markedly attenuated by the zzso inhibitor zzso and partially inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso or zzso promoted nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso without zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data show that zzso and zzso but not zzso are coupled with zzso expression and sustained zzso production of zzso zzso by mechanisms that depend on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
