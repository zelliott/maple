zzso has multiple functions, diverse cellular locations, and putative zzso It likely maintains zzso zzso by binding alpha zzso zzso tails and is a surface zzso which triggers cell zzso In the present study, we have zzso a cell surface complex from zzso mouse melanoma cells which contains alpha 6 beta 1 zzso two molecular forms of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso One of the zzso zzso a 52 zzso zzso does not become surface zzso and is probably bound to alpha zzso zzso zzso it disappears when zzso cells adhere to zzso and two zzso zzso zzso One zzso species, a 125 zzso zzso is restricted to focal contacts whereas a second species, a 75 zzso zzso is in focal contacts and surrounding plasma zzso it also arises when cells bind zzso zzso The other zzso zzso a 62 zzso zzso becomes surface zzso is probably anchored to surface zzso and zzso with alpha 6 beta 1 zzso triggering cell zzso The present results suggest a model in which zzso surface complex functions as a symbiotic unit, zzso information in both directions across the plasma zzso
