We have previously shown that zzso zzso generation in zzso requires zzso events from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to stimulation of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso of zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso While it is also known that zzso calcium zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso generation, the underlying mechanism remains zzso In the present study we sought to zzso the zzso mechanisms and regulation by zzso calcium of zzso zzso zzso generation in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso occurred when zzso zzso was zzso indicating that it is a downstream event from the zzso zzso However, blockade of either zzso or the zzso receptors with corresponding zzso completely abolished zzso zzso indicating that both zzso receptors are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso family zzso or the zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally zzso or zzso zzso zzso was blocked in the presence of zzso zzso The present studies show that zzso is activated downstream of zzso receptors through a complex mechanism involving zzso zzso and this plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso We also conclude that zzso calcium blocks zzso zzso zzso generation through the zzso of zzso zzso
