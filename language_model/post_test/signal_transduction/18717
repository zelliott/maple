Our previous studies found that nerve growth factor zzso via zzso enhanced the number of action zzso zzso evoked by a ramp of zzso current in zzso sensory zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso It is well established that each of these products of zzso metabolism can act as zzso zzso zzso This raises the question as to whether the enhanced zzso produced by zzso was zzso directly by zzso or required additional metabolism to zzso and/or zzso zzso applied zzso did not affect the zzso zzso whereas internally zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso evoked by the zzso zzso Furthermore, internally zzso zzso enhanced the number of evoked zzso This zzso action of zzso zzso and internally zzso zzso was abolished by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso In contrast, internally zzso zzso enhanced the number of evoked zzso in the presence of zzso These observations support the idea that the metabolism of zzso to zzso is critical for the zzso zzso of zzso Both internally zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the outward zzso current by zzso for the step to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso currents had very similar zzso relations, suggesting that they were likely to be the zzso In addition, the zzso suppression of the zzso current was blocked by zzso with zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso derived from zzso acts as an internal second zzso to regulate membrane zzso however, the zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso
