zzso regulate diverse immune functions through the zzso zzso of hundreds of genes involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed in cells in response to a variety of stress conditions like viral or bacterial infection and is present in its free form or is zzso to cellular zzso In addition, protein zzso plays a regulatory role in the immune zzso Many viruses zzso the zzso zzso zzso to alter cellular signaling and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso precursors and zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso and rabies viruses by zzso family zzso domain zzso zzso is an important step in zzso viral zzso We found that zzso is zzso regulated by zzso Free zzso specifically bound to zzso and blocked its interaction with zzso zzso thus preventing further zzso transfer from zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso diminished the ability of zzso to zzso viral zzso proteins and led to a decrease in the release of Ebola zzso zzso particles from the zzso These results point to a mechanistically novel function of zzso in the enhancement of the innate zzso response through specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first example of a zzso protein with the ability to interfere with zzso and zzso interaction to inhibit protein zzso
