zzso gene zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso is regulated in zzso and zzso manner by alternate use of different zzso Previously, we have reported the cloning and characterization of zzso promoter and transcripts in buffalo zzso and zzso In human and rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso response element binding zzso through zzso zzso which binds to zzso response element like sequence zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso However, in buffalo as well as in zzso in zzso analysis of zzso specific promoter sequence identified a single base pair deletion in CLS site and is designated as zzso zzso To understand if CLS with a point zzso is still a functional zzso and is involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene in buffalo zzso the present study was thus aimed to functionally characterize the role of buffalo CLS in zzso gene zzso We also studied the involvement of zzso having consensus binding sites in zzso gene zzso promoter in the vicinity of CLS during different stages of the buffalo zzso zzso zzso construct analyses and zzso results showed that CLS is playing no significant role in zzso gene regulation in buffalo zzso Real time absolute zzso of zzso showed the differential expression of zzso zzso during zzso and zzso with significantly higher transcript abundance in large zzso in comparison to other zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso cells nuclear protein isolated from different stage of zzso development zzso and large zzso and differentiation zzso zzso showed that abundance of zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cell nuclear protein of large zzso as compared to small zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, binding studies using zzso showed significantly enhanced binding to the zzso gene promoter in large zzso which was seen to be declined in the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in the in zzso experiments as zzso Finally, zzso experiments were performed to validate the involvement of zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso of zzso zzso significantly declined zzso gene zzso as well as zzso zzso In conclusion, result of the present study indicated that that in the absence of consensus zzso zzso response zzso zzso could be a downstream zzso of zzso zzso in regulation of zzso gene during zzso and zzso
