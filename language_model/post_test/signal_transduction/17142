The circle of Willis zzso is a major zzso collateral structure zzso zzso circulation within the brain, and in humans, anatomical variation of the zzso is linked to stroke zzso Our prior studies on adult mice deficient in vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso signaling revealed altered zzso maturation and zzso including an zzso incompetent zzso similar to human zzso However, a zzso dependency on zzso signaling for zzso formation in this model remained zzso Through zzso embryonic zzso we now demonstrate that zzso assembly is a zzso process highly sensitive to zzso zzso signals, whose absence results in delayed nascent vascular zzso formation and zzso of the zzso including the key anterior zzso artery zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso additionally feature reduced zzso coverage, zzso zzso and zzso branching at zzso of the major zzso cerebral zzso At the cellular level, a notable reduction in vascular zzso cell proliferation exists in the region of zzso assembly despite the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso in developing cerebral vessels feature reduced zzso and zzso levels and impaired zzso These collective findings in the embryonic brain support studies in adult animals demonstrating a reliance on intact zzso zzso signaling for optimal zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso the new data provide unique insights into the native formation of the zzso and underscore a pioneering zzso role for zzso zzso signaling in regulating zzso assembly of the clinically relevant zzso
