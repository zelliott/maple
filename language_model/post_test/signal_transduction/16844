The zzso plasticity of the root system represents a key zzso trait enabling plants to cope with zzso stresses such as drought and is therefore important in the current context of global zzso Root branching through lateral root formation is an important component of the zzso of the root system to its zzso Our understanding of the mechanisms controlling lateral root development has progressed tremendously in recent years through research in the model plant zzso zzso zzso These studies have revealed that the zzso zzso acts as a common zzso to many zzso and environmental signals regulating lateral root zzso Here, we review what has been zzso about the myriad roles of zzso during lateral root formation in zzso
