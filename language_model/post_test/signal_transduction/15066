Concerns have been raised about the possible role of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso as zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effects of fetal exposure to zzso and zzso on the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and on zzso cell populations in zzso and adult rat zzso At zzso day zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso and protein increases in zzso mainly in zzso zzso No changes were seen for zzso At zzso zzso protein expression remained robust in zzso cells and in some zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells while zzso was expressed strongly in zzso and they were both expressed in zzso zzso No consistent change was seen in these proteins at zzso zzso effects were observed on germ cell zzso while the only remaining effect on adult zzso cells was an increase in zzso cell zzso zzso exposed in zzso to the two compounds did not present significant changes in circulating testosterone levels, suggesting normally functioning adult zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cell numbers were not affected by exposure to zzso and zzso Finally, around zzso of zzso and zzso exposed rats were zzso whereas all control rats were zzso These data suggest that fetal exposure to zzso and zzso exerts transient effects in rat zzso and that the changes observed at zzso did not correlate with relevant changes in germ cell zzso zzso cell function, or fertility in the zzso
