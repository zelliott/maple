For T cell zzso two signals are required, zzso a T cell zzso zzso main signal and a zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to its zzso zzso or zzso and zzso the most important zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso composed of 41 zzso zzso does not contain any intrinsic zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is remarkably zzso among species and is associated with a number of signaling molecules that affect the main zzso We report here that a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was coupled to the zzso zzso domain in zzso and human peripheral T zzso The zzso was distinguished from other zzso associated molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso was enhanced by zzso stimulation by the specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was attenuated by the prior addition of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein coupled to zzso under continuous control of zzso zzso and might play a role in T cell zzso zzso by a zzso main zzso
