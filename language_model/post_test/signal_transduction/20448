The main pathological consequence of free radical exposure is DNA damage, which is known to induce cell transformation and to facilitate important zzso in cancer zzso It is a matter of intense discussion whether the drug-induced production of free zzso limits the therapeutic efficacy of zzso and enhances their toxicity or whether they may be enhanced to provoke cancer cell zzso This paper reviews essential molecular processes to better understand the controversial role of free zzso in cancer development and zzso and discusses some novel therapeutic strategies based on zzso stress induction and zzso
