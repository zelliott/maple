The invasive potential is increased by zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell zzso We researched whether the signaling zzso activated by zzso zzso with the nuclear zzso zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and whether the zzso of zzso activity is associated with suppression of invasive zzso 

zzso of human pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was examined by dual zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso In addition, to investigate the invasive potential, an in zzso invasion zzso was zzso 

zzso of both cell lines was decreased by a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but proliferation of control and zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso The invasion cell number and the zzso activity were increased by zzso zzso However, in the presence of zzso or zzso which blocks the nuclear zzso of zzso both were significantly zzso Furthermore, reduced activity of both remained unchanged by zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso promotes zzso zzso and that the latter is involved in the invasive potential of human pancreatic cancer zzso
