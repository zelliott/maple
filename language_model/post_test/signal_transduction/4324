zzso gene expression accompanies the emergence of distinct regions and cell classes in the mouse spinal zzso around zzso We asked whether changes in the expression of zzso signaling molecules and zzso genes reflect the establishment of this regional and cellular zzso At zzso zzso acid zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso the zzso X zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso binding protein zzso zzso and cellular zzso binding protein zzso zzso are found throughout the entire zzso (AP) axis of the cord, as is zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta become restricted to the cervical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, are found throughout the zzso zzso zzso and zzso although expanded within the cervical and zzso regions, are also found throughout the zzso zzso Thus, several zzso signaling molecules continue to be expressed beyond distinct regions of the spinal zzso where zzso is available and some zzso genes are either restricted or zzso zzso zzso can activate a more widespread response resulting in zzso zzso and zzso beta expression in the zzso and zzso zzso Not all zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso expression patterns are zzso Finally, not every cell within the normal or zzso induced zzso of zzso gene expression responds to zzso nor does every cell express zzso receptors or binding zzso Thus, regional and cellular differences in the distribution of the known zzso receptors and binding proteins do not predict absolutely where or whether zzso sensitive genes will be expressed or where zzso will be available in the developing spinal zzso Instead, zzso gene expression in the cervical and zzso zzso seems to reflect zzso responses that rely both on the local availability of zzso the identity of the responding zzso and an indeterminate array of zzso signaling zzso
