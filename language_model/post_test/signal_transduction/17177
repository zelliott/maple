It is commonly assumed that all zzso have identical molecular zzso This assumption has remained largely unchallenged due to a paucity of methods to distinguish individual zzso We devised an zzso that extends the utility of zzso blue zzso for detection and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity in individual zzso Implementation of this zzso revealed that in zzso zzso there is zzso in the ability of individual zzso to generate zzso both between and within zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the zzso in zzso zzso we employed genetically zzso fluorescent zzso to evaluate the uniformity in the distribution of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Despite zzso in zzso generation, the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid was nearly identical in all zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was not generated zzso across the zzso population, varying in a manner that directly mirrored zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels suggested that zzso zzso is precluded when zzso fail to reach a critical zzso zzso In particular, forced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso leading to impaired respiratory zzso zzso pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso or expression of an inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso limit the extent of zzso zzso zzso curtailing the production of potentially harmful zzso oxygen zzso The resulting zzso in zzso responsiveness could enable the survival of a fraction of invading zzso
