A detailed model of the zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso system is presented that includes complex regulatory networks of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and damage signal zzso pathways involving zzso and zzso zzso on the kinetic equations of the zzso are made, and computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate how the various zzso operate to delay or arrest cell cycle zzso The detailed model could be used to explain various experiments relevant to zzso reported recently, including the nuclear export of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso B1 expression by zzso the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso levels, and zzso zzso It also is shown that, under certain conditions, zzso is necessary to sustain a zzso zzso
