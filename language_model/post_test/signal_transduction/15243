zzso was initially characterized as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso at the invasive front of zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism remains zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso experiment revealed that zzso zzso with zzso and further, a zzso pull-down zzso and zzso zzso validated the zzso We subsequently showed that the interaction was zzso by the zzso domain of zzso and each death zzso domain of zzso Interestingly, our data demonstrated that zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso by competing zzso and zzso to bind to zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso was confirmed to be relevant to zzso zzso Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso signaling zzso activated by zzso dependent on its zzso activity and zzso signaling zzso activated by zzso independent of its zzso zzso
