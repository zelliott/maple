In zzso cells, the signals initiated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family have been implicated in cell proliferation and survival, membrane and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso respiratory zzso Of the four zzso of human zzso that zzso zzso 4, zzso only zzso (or zzso is associated with the regulatory zzso zzso and is zzso by G protein zzso zzso We performed zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and found that, under resting conditions, zzso was present in a diffuse zzso pattern, but zzso to the cell nucleus after serum zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso toxin and could also be induced by zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso In addition, we found that deletion of the zzso 33 zzso of zzso had no effect on association with zzso or on its zzso zzso but zzso of the zzso 82 zzso yielded a zzso zzso that did not associate with zzso and was zzso localized in the zzso This finding implies that the zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso as well as zzso The effect of zzso in the nucleus is an area of active zzso
