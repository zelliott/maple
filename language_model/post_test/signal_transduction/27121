The effects of insulin, zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared in zzso cells at zzso and after differentiation to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced the expected stimulation of zzso transport and zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso and differentiated zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso failed to stimulate zzso transport or zzso zzso although a marked stimulation of the zzso pathways as shown by zzso response factor zzso or zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso cells to the same extent as insulin zzso zzso zzso but produced only a small portion of the effect of insulin in differentiated zzso Similarly, zzso levels and zzso of zzso receptors were much lower in differentiated cells than in zzso zzso In contrast to insulin and zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso of zzso All effects of insulin, zzso and zzso on zzso transport were inhibited by zzso the zzso zzso concentration zzso of zzso was increased by zzso These data demonstrate distinct zzso zzso of the investigated zzso and indicate that the zzso and zzso controlled zzso pathways lack the potential to stimulate zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be involved in the zzso zzso effects, whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a crucial event in all pathways leading to stimulation of zzso zzso
