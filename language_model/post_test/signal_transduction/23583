Among the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso has attracted increasing attention as a potential target of zzso therapy in zzso cancer zzso To study the function of zzso in zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso cells showing high zzso expression were used for zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso and using the pharmacological inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of zzso using both approaches led to moderate zzso of proliferation and diminished zzso of the downstream zzso zzso in all three cell zzso Surprisingly, incubation with zzso resulted in an arrest of zzso cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, whereas the zzso approach did not result in this zzso To address this difference, we analyzed the involvement of the zzso family member zzso in zzso effectiveness, but zzso and proliferation studies in zzso and zzso cells could not prove the involvement of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso array on zzso cells led us to the identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso after zzso treatment but not after the zzso zzso Further studies using the zzso inhibitor zzso showed that zzso zzso upon treatment with the inhibitor zzso is responsible for the observed effects of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that the zzso of zzso alone using zzso has only moderate cellular effects in zzso cell zzso however, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso represents a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of zzso
