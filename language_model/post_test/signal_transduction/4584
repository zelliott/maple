To investigate the effects of zzso zzso factor zzso on wound healing and zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso 

Fifty zzso rats were divided into control group zzso zzso 25) and treatment group zzso zzso 25) according to the random number zzso All rats were inflicted with 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso skin wound on the zzso zzso human zzso gel (10 zzso was applied onto the wounds in treatment group, and the actual quantity was 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso vehicle (10 zzso without any medicine was applied onto the wounds in control zzso The treatment was conducted once a day up to the day of wound zzso Five rats from two groups were sacrificed on post injury day zzso 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 respectively to observe and determine the wound healing zzso zzso tissue samples were collected at the former 4 time points to observe the zzso changes with HE zzso and to detect the content of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the expression levels of zzso zzso and the zzso signal zzso associated molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with Western zzso Data were processed with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso healing rates in control group and treatment group were close on zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso healing rate in treatment group was obviously higher than that in control group on zzso 3, 5, 7, and 14 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso zzso Compared with those in control group, more abundant zzso tissue was observed in treatment group, in which an increase in the number of zzso and obvious proliferation of zzso zzso cells in wound margin were observed at each time zzso zzso The content and the protein expression level of zzso peaked on zzso 3 in two groups, and they were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control group and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in treatment zzso The content of zzso in treatment group was significantly higher than that in control group at each time point (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P values all equal to zzso The protein expression level of zzso in treatment group was significantly higher than that in control group on zzso 1, 5, and 7 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P values all below zzso zzso The expression level of zzso in treatment group was obviously higher than that in control group on zzso 1, 3, and 7 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P values all below zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso in treatment group were significantly higher than those in control group at each time point (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso In treatment group, the expression level of zzso was obviously higher than that in control group on zzso 3, 5, and 7 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso and the expression level of zzso was significantly higher than that in control group on zzso 1, 3, and 7 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso In treatment group, the expression level of zzso was significantly lower than that in control group on zzso 1, 3, and 5 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso but the expression level of zzso was significantly higher than that in control group on zzso 1, 3, and 7 (with zzso values from zzso to zzso P values all below zzso 

zzso can promote wound healing in rats by zzso zzso signaling zzso through zzso zzso proteins and its downstream signal molecules zzso and zzso
