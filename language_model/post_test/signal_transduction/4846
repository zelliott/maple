zzso factor zzso zzso plays a critical role in both zzso and zzso It is generally believed that most of the tissue factor expressed on cell surfaces is maintained in a zzso zzso zzso inactive state and an zzso step zzso is required for the expression of maximum zzso zzso zzso However, what exactly constitutes cryptic or zzso zzso molecular differences between these two forms and mechanisms that are responsible for transformation from one to the other form are not entirely clear and remain highly controversial, thus are a matter of ongoing zzso This brief review discusses pertinent literature on zzso zzso with specific emphasis on the role of membrane zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso bond in regulating zzso activity at cell zzso
