Many growth factors including zzso growth factor zzso induce zzso zzso of the zzso zzso product, whose function, however, remains zzso Recently, zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to be a negative regulator of zzso zzso induction pathway, suggesting that zzso may zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, by an zzso zzso approach, we examined the effects of expression level of zzso on zzso signaling and showed that zzso of zzso reduces and zzso repression of zzso enhances zzso of zzso receptors and zzso of the zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso zzso the expressed amount of zzso does not affect zzso of the Ras pathway, suggesting that the zzso signaling pathways are differently regulated by zzso among zzso and zzso
