zzso class II molecules have a crucial role in zzso selection and in generating zzso T cell zzso There is extensive evidence for second zzso generation via zzso class II zzso which can lead to zzso of B zzso We have examined zzso class zzso zzso in both normal and zzso human B zzso zzso exposure and DNA fragmentation were observed in B cells within 24 h of stimulation via zzso class zzso In marked comparison with zzso the zzso and irreversible zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso No direct zzso of zzso 3 was zzso and zzso of zzso 3 was not zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected via zzso but not via zzso class zzso Although zzso has been implicated in zzso class zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso affected zzso class zzso zzso zzso cells were used to reveal that death occurred independently of zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data reveal a zzso of zzso zzso that neither requires nor involves zzso Moreover, it is zzso independent and zzso zzso This zzso of zzso class zzso zzso could have an important role in the regulation of zzso populations or in the control of zzso B zzso zzso
