Previously, we showed that deletion of the zzso type II zzso zzso in Type II zzso zzso expressing cells results in defects in the development of the zzso zzso zzso included a reduction in size and zzso in the shape of specific zzso zzso zzso lateral and zzso elements of the zzso were missing or zzso zzso zzso bodies were only mildly affected, but the zzso disc zzso was reduced or zzso In this zzso we show that zzso in the initiation or proliferation of cartilage are not detected in the zzso zzso However, the expression domain of zzso zzso a marker of the zzso was reduced and the area of the future zzso contained peanut zzso zzso zzso zzso Next, we show that the expression zzso of zzso and zzso which are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso are expanded over the entire zzso to zzso length of the zzso zzso zzso patterning was not affected in these mice as zzso by expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was modestly reduced in the loose cells of the zzso The results suggest that signaling through zzso regulates the maintenance of boundaries in the zzso and developing zzso zzso
