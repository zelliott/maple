The bacterial zzso zzso encodes a response to DNA damage that not only functions to relieve the incurred damage but also enhances adaptation through zzso and the lateral spread of zzso zzso Recent papers have demonstrated that certain stimuli can indirectly generate the zzso signal by zzso of zzso DNA damage mechanisms rather than by direct DNA zzso We suggest that these zzso triggers have been recruited by bacteria to enable adaptation to various types of zzso
