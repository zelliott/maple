The tongue is a muscular organ and plays a crucial role in speech, zzso and zzso Despite the important zzso functions of the zzso little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of tongue muscle zzso zzso family members play important roles in regulating zzso but the functional significance of zzso zzso signaling in regulating tongue skeletal muscle development remains zzso In this study, we have investigated zzso zzso signaling in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso during tongue zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso During the initiation of tongue development, zzso neural crest zzso cells occupy the tongue buds before zzso zzso migrate into the tongue zzso suggesting that zzso cells play an zzso role in guiding tongue muscle zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso results in defects in zzso terminal differentiation and zzso zzso Despite compromised muscle zzso zzso formation appears unaffected in the tongue of zzso mice, suggesting that the differentiation and maintenance of zzso zzso cells are independent of zzso signaling in zzso cells in the zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso results in a significant reduction in expression of several members of the zzso family, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso partially zzso the tongue zzso fusion zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates that a zzso signaling cascade plays a crucial role in zzso cell fate determination and lineage progression during tongue zzso
