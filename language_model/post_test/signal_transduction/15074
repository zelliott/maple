zzso particularly zzso and zzso zzso have been identified to possess zzso activities and to induce zzso arrest through zzso zzso II accompanied by zzso zzso The current study was designed to precisely dissect the signaling zzso responsible for the zzso cell cycle arrest in human colon zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 as zzso zzso we first specified the zzso arrest zzso by the zzso and zzso Then, zzso and zzso were revealed to induce zzso of the DNA damage sensor zzso zzso zzso responding to DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso of zzso by both the pharmacological inhibitor caffeine and the specific small interference zzso zzso rescued the zzso arrest zzso by zzso indicating its zzso zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso but not zzso with their corresponding zzso statistically significantly reversed the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso in an zzso manner but induced zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso used zzso as evidenced by the differential zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Thus, a clear signaling zzso can be established, in which zzso zzso the DNA zzso signaling triggered by the zzso to the checkpoint zzso predominantly to zzso finally elicits zzso zzso The zzso zzso not only favors the development of the zzso as zzso agents but also provides an alternative strategy of zzso zzso to zzso the zzso activities of these zzso
