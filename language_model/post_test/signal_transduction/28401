Feeding stimulates protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and liver of zzso and this response can be reproduced in muscle by the infusion of insulin or zzso acids and in liver by the infusion of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of insulin signaling components leading to translation initiation is associated with the zzso stimulation of muscle protein synthesis in zzso In this study, we examined the individual roles of insulin and zzso acids in the zzso of insulin signaling components leading to translation zzso specifically, the insulin zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso in zzso zzso pigs zzso insulin was infused to achieve plasma levels of approximately 0, 17, 52, and 255 zzso zzso 0, 2, 6, 30 zzso and zzso acids were clamped at zzso or fed zzso In skeletal muscle, insulin increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso In liver, insulin increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but had no effect on protein zzso Raising zzso acids from the zzso to the fed level did not alter the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but increased zzso zzso and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and zzso The results suggest that the stimulation of protein synthesis in muscle by insulin involves zzso of insulin signaling zzso and the stimulation of protein synthesis in muscle and liver by zzso acids occurs by mechanisms independent of the early steps of this zzso Furthermore, zzso acids do not alter the zzso zzso of early steps in the insulin signaling zzso
