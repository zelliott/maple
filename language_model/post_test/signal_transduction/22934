The development of the zzso cell types in the zzso zzso provides an excellent model system in which to explore the complex zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso and maintenance of differentiated cell types in zzso zzso zzso development is orchestrated through the zzso actions of a repertoire of zzso zzso factors which, on the basis of their distinct and overlapping expression patterns, and functional zzso ultimately has led to the generation of functionally distinct cell zzso from a common zzso zzso
