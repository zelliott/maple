Identification of factors that play a role in regulating the highly invasive ability of human zzso cells throughout gestation will contribute to a better understanding of this unique zzso zzso The aims of this study were to determine whether the zzso zzso gene zzso is present in the human zzso and plays a putative role in the regulation of zzso invasion during zzso zzso The data showed that the expression of zzso zzso was maximum in term zzso compared to the first and second zzso zzso and absent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso detected by Western zzso analysis, was twofold higher in the second zzso and zzso higher in the third zzso compared to the first zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in zzso with increased and more diffuse zzso in the second and third zzso zzso to the period of maximum zzso zzso zzso isolated from term zzso had significantly lower invasive ability as compared to first and second zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, addition of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso invasion in zzso by zzso per cent in all three trimesters of zzso This study provides the first evidence of the zzso expression of zzso during human gestation and suggests a putative role for zzso in regulating the invasive activity of zzso at zzso The zzso of zzso expression may be critical at the time of zzso and early zzso development, whereas zzso of zzso may serve as a signal for the end of zzso invasion and zzso
