zzso protein zzso zzso is a master regulator of cell proliferation by modulating cell zzso division, survival and migration, thus the mechanisms that regulate zzso function are of great interest to cancer zzso One emerging mode of zzso regulation is its response to zzso oxygen species zzso zzso have historically been viewed as damaging agents in cells under zzso stress, but recent studies establish zzso as a secondary zzso to growth zzso A large number of cellular events respond to zzso and many responses require the activity of zzso suggesting that zzso may be a primary target of zzso How zzso zzso responds to zzso has not been established, as conflicting reports of zzso zzso or zzso in response to increased concentration of zzso in the cells have been zzso To determine how zzso directly responds to zzso we investigated the effect of the zzso environment on zzso zzso zzso in zzso The study reveals that zzso is active in the reducing environment, and retains only zzso of activity in the absence of reducing zzso The zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso which leads to zzso zzso linked by a zzso bond between the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso A similar zzso mechanism appears to be zzso in eight of more than 90 zzso including three zzso family zzso and all four members of the zzso zzso The finding contradicts the view that zzso is activated by zzso and suggests a complex response by zzso to zzso zzso In this Extra View, we examine the conflicting observations in the context of complex mechanisms of zzso zzso
