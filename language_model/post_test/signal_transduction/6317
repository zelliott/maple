Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso activity zzso at least in part, in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso added to the growth medium stimulates zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso Our goal was to explain these conflicting reports and to provide zzso detail on the role of zzso zzso and zzso in regulation of zzso synthesis and zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were added to a solid growth medium and zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso activity, and zzso promoter activity were measured in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso Similar to Tice and Buchanan zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso synthesis (and zzso associated with an zzso increase in zzso promoter zzso However, treatment resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso accompanied by a 40 to 80 fold decrease in total zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso decreased zzso synthesis and zzso increased zzso zzso activity 10 fold, and decreased total zzso activity 2 zzso In zzso zzso zzso increased 2 fold without zzso or zzso zzso treatment did not stimulate zzso or zzso zzso Based on these data, we conclude that: zzso zzso regulate toxin synthesis and zzso via similar mechanisms in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, at least in part, mediate a zzso regulatory influence on zzso and zzso zzso
