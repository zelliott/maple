The zzso factor zzso is zzso in the zzso by a family of zzso zzso Upon cellular stimulation with diverse agents, one of these zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso and subsequently zzso This process triggers nuclear zzso of zzso and the successive zzso of target zzso Independent of its rapid zzso breakdown, zzso alpha is inherently unstable and zzso a continuous zzso To compare the mechanisms and protein zzso involved in zzso and zzso degradation of zzso alpha in intact cells we employed a zzso strategy using zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso We show that tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso induced breakdown of zzso alpha but not its zzso turnover zzso with zzso in the zzso signal response domain zzso of zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso sequence is needed for zzso zzso which instead depends only on the core zzso repeat zzso Despite the differences in the requirements of protein zzso and zzso for both degradation zzso each one is zzso by the zzso This finding is important for understanding alternative modes of controlling zzso zzso
