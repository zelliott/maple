zzso cell zzso in marine sponges is zzso by a new family of modular zzso whose general zzso structure resembles that of zzso However, neither their protein nor their zzso zzso have significant sequence zzso to other zzso despite having protein zzso equivalent to link proteins and to zzso zzso core zzso and zzso zzso equivalent to zzso and to the zzso of zzso In some species, these molecular components are assembled into a structure with a circular core formed by the link zzso and zzso zzso Besides their involvement in cell zzso these sponge zzso for which we propose the term zzso participate in signal zzso processes and are suspected to play a role in sponge zzso zzso Their in zzso roles and the mild methods used to purify large amounts of functionally active zzso make them ideal models to study the functions and possible new applications of zzso in biomedical zzso
