The zzso zzso are a new class of zzso coding small zzso that regulate gene expression at the zzso level in zzso Although thousands of zzso have been identified in many plant species, little studies have been reported about zzso zzso In this study, 28 potential zzso candidates belonging to 20 families were identified from 16 zzso and 12 zzso in zzso using a comparative zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso targets were predicted and some of them zzso zzso factors as well as genes that function in stress response, signal zzso zzso and a variety of other zzso zzso These findings lay the foundation for further understanding of zzso function in the development of zzso
