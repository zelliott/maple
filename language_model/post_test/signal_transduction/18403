zzso growth factor zzso the zzso for the Met zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso transition and zzso of zzso cells, processes that play crucial roles in tumor development, invasion, and zzso Little is known about the zzso zzso signals that regulate these zzso We show that zzso stimulation of zzso cells leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso is dependent on zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso formation and cell spreading require zzso zzso and are inhibited by dominant negative zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to membrane zzso Use of dominant negative and activated zzso reveals an essential role for zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso whereas zzso activity is required for the formation of focal zzso and stress fibers in response to zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso play opposing roles in zzso transition induced by zzso and provide new insight regarding the role of zzso in these zzso
