Upon zzso influx synaptic zzso fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitter cargo into the synaptic zzso Key players during this process are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso It is thought that these membrane proteins gradually assemble into a tight zzso complex between zzso and plasma zzso ultimately leading to membrane zzso zzso is a soluble protein of 130 zzso that contains a zzso zzso motif but lacks a zzso zzso Its zzso motif forms a stable core zzso complex with zzso zzso and zzso Here we present the crystal structure of this core zzso zzso complex at zzso zzso It consists of a zzso bundle very similar to that of the zzso complex containing zzso Most differences are found on the surface, where they prevented tight binding of zzso Both complexes form with similar rates as assessed by CD zzso In addition, zzso cannot zzso the zzso zzso from the tight complex and vice versa, indicating that both zzso complexes represent end zzso Moreover, data bank searches revealed that the zzso motif of zzso is highly zzso throughout all zzso zzso This suggests that the formation of a tight zzso complex is important for the function of zzso
