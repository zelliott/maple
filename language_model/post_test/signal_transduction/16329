zzso an zzso isolated from the root of zzso zzso has been used to alleviate the symptoms of rheumatic zzso Liang zzso San zzso composed of the herbs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is another traditional Chinese medicine formula for zzso arthritis zzso zzso Although numerous studies have demonstrated the potential zzso activities of zzso and zzso the underlying zzso mechanisms regulating the zzso activities of zzso and zzso on human primary zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients and normal control subjects have not been zzso 

We investigated the in zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso on inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of human normal and zzso The underlying zzso signaling molecules were analyzed zzso using flow zzso 

zzso was found to significantly inhibit zzso induced cell surface expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and release of inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from both normal and zzso (all zzso Moreover, the suppression of zzso on zzso induced zzso expression and zzso release of zzso was significantly higher than that of normal zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso release from both normal and zzso with significantly higher suppression on zzso zzso in zzso than that of normal zzso (all zzso Further investigations showed that zzso and zzso could significantly suppress zzso zzso of inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso the central signaling molecules zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso 

Our results therefore provide a new insight into the differential zzso activities of zzso and zzso through the suppression of zzso zzso by modulating distinct zzso signaling pathways in zzso
