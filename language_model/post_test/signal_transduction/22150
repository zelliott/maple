zzso exposure to nicotine affects brain development, leading to numerous zzso and zzso deficits in the offspring during zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, a zzso zzso zzso was used to determine gene expression profiles in five brain regions zzso amygdala, prefrontal cortex, nucleus zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of adolescent rats that received nicotine or saline during zzso Following appropriate statistical and Gene Set zzso zzso 24 cell zzso pathways were found to be significantly modulated by zzso zzso On the basis of their biological functions, these pathways can be classified into three zzso growth factor, death zzso and zzso zzso We employed a quantitative real-time zzso array to verify the findings by measuring the expression of 29 genes involved in cell zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso nicotine exposure has significant effects on gene expression in cell zzso pathways in the brains of adolescent zzso Such effects appear to be brain zzso and are realized through regulation of the expression of growth factors and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we offer a hypothetical model to explain how zzso nicotine exposure may affect cell death and survival in the brains of adolescent offspring by regulating the balance between zzso and zzso zzso
