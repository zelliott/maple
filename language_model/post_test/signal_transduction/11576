The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein for the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso Previous studies have revealed genetic interactions between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso two putative sensors for cell integrity zzso and zzso zzso an zzso and zzso interacting protein involved in polarized zzso To better understand the role of zzso we isolated zzso zzso genes of the cell zzso of the double zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two small zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso in the protein zzso C zzso pathway, and zzso a zzso were shown to suppress the zzso defects strengthening the functional links between zzso and the cell integrity zzso Study of the zzso activity of zzso which is under the control of zzso the last zzso of the zzso pathway, and follow-up of the zzso transcription, which is positively regulated by zzso indicate that the lack of zzso function diminishes the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso at least through the zzso of the small zzso zzso and zzso alters the zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso and decreases activity of the zzso zzso
