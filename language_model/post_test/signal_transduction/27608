zzso proteins zzso their signals through zzso zzso proteins to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso To understand the mechanism by which zzso acts through zzso to regulate zzso we investigated the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso interacts with zzso and with zzso both of which interact with zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso in an interaction that requires zzso We also found that zzso zzso and zzso can form a zzso complex bridged by zzso and that zzso can be recruited into this complex probably by zzso The observation that the zzso domain of either zzso or zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso suggests that the interactions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso may be important for this signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso appeared to promote the disintegration of the zzso complex, resulting in the zzso of zzso from zzso Thus, formation of the zzso complex may be an important step in zzso zzso by which zzso recruits zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso from zzso
