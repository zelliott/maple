zzso of the zzso zzso which are responsible for the conversion of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso products in zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso The zzso promoter zzso was identified and was shown to promote zzso induction by zzso and zzso An zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the region downstream of zzso by using a reporter zzso containing zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of this zzso revealed a set of putative zzso regulatory system zzso which were designated zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso and that both zzso and zzso are required for the elevated zzso zzso of and zzso induction by zzso of zzso These results support the notion that zzso and zzso zzso a sensor zzso and a response regulator, respectively, of a zzso regulatory zzso The zzso and zzso genes promote zzso induction by a variety of aromatic compounds, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A promoter activity zzso and reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed a weak zzso promoter in the adjacent region upstream of zzso zzso analysis indicated that there is induced zzso of zzso through zzso in which zzso is thought to take zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not grow on zzso Growth was restored by introduction of an intact zzso gene into zzso These results indicate that at least zzso is zzso responsible for the growth of zzso on zzso
