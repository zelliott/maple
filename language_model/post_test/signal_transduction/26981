Many zzso zzso including the receptors for hormones such as zzso growth factor zzso nerve growth factor and insulin, transmit zzso signals through Ras zzso zzso binding to such receptors stimulates Ras zzso activity and increases the level of zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso may activate a zzso releasing protein zzso In zzso zzso and zzso genetic studies have shown that Ras zzso by zzso zzso requires the protein zzso which contains a single zzso zzso 2 domain and two zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso protein zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso proteins such as zzso through its zzso zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso are bound to the zzso zzso tail of zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso is required for Ras zzso and contains a central domain related to known zzso zzso stimulation zzso binding of the zzso complex to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore appears to link zzso zzso to a zzso in zzso zzso
