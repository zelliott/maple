zzso form a vital part of the innate immune response, but at the same time their inappropriate zzso contributes to zzso zzso Many molecular components are involved in zzso zzso zzso We report here the first characterization of the role of zzso a zzso and zzso zzso protein for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We show that zzso lacking zzso are zzso in zzso and in zzso exhibiting increased zzso zzso affinity and zzso zzso zzso are zzso in several zzso situations in zzso including the formation of zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells adhere more firmly under flow conditions in zzso and to the vessel wall in zzso Finally, loss of zzso interferes with zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study suggest an important function of zzso downstream of zzso By modulating zzso zzso activity, zzso guards zzso in their zzso state unless zzso
