Small molecules zzso can greatly enhance the efficiency of induced zzso stem zzso cell generation, but the mechanisms by which they act have not been fully zzso We show here that an zzso cocktail zzso zzso and zzso significantly promotes zzso cell generation from human zzso and zzso is more potent than the other two common zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso in promoting cellular zzso Our data indicate that the zzso cocktail substantially zzso the zzso cluster expression by increasing the stability and zzso level of this zzso zzso cluster in a manner dependent on the four defined zzso factors zzso Among the four zzso zzso in particular appears to be required for the induction of the zzso cluster by the zzso zzso We also found that zzso alone can enhance the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Using a promoter reporter zzso we show that the zzso cocktail remarkably enhanced the zzso activity of the four zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso the ability of the zzso cocktail in promoting zzso zzso these findings suggest that the zzso cocktail promotes zzso at least partly through the induction of the zzso cluster zzso Further insights into this process may pave the way for the generation of zzso cells using only zzso zzso
