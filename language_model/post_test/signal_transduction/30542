We previously found that prenatal zzso zzso a significant increase in the levels of active zzso 3 at 60 zzso zzso zzso and in the number of zzso zzso cells, which zzso at zzso zzso The aim of this work was to study zzso in zzso pathways and the effect of specific zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways following acute zzso in chick zzso lobe at embryonic day zzso zzso To this end, zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso expression levels were determined by Western zzso in both their active and inactive forms, evaluated at successive zzso zzso At 10 and 30 zzso zzso the zzso ratio was zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 0 zzso zzso the zzso ratio was zzso Lastly, the zzso ratio proving zzso zzso When zzso for zzso and zzso were used, we observed a decrease in the values of active zzso 3 at 60 zzso zzso which correlated with the control values in the parameters of zzso cells at zzso zzso Analysis for zzso demonstrated an increase in hypoxic zzso compared to control ones which was reverted in a zzso manner with the use of both zzso All these results indicate that at zzso 12, acute zzso might be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without affecting the zzso pathway, which in turn would be zzso zzso 3, thus leading to cell death by zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in time the programmed cell death induced by zzso
