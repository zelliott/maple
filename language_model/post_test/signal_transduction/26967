zzso elicits multiple second zzso signals in target zzso This signaling diversity may reflect zzso of a single species of zzso receptors to multiple zzso the action of different zzso of zzso zzso or zzso We recently reported the expression zzso from rat and zzso cells, of closely related zzso zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine if these cloned zzso receptors can activate multiple zzso zzso when present at zzso levels in intact target cells, we have zzso expressed the rat and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These cells lack zzso zzso zzso but do express abundant zzso receptors and many features of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells exhibited high affinity binding zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso of both zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and increased release of zzso free calcium from zzso stores zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso across a wide range of zzso zzso zzso rat and zzso receptors exhibited similar properties, except for a zzso lower binding affinity of the rat zzso for zzso zzso by zzso of both zzso zzso and elevated zzso free calcium was zzso in cells expressing higher numbers of zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the rate of cell proliferation and zzso the rate of zzso zzso transport after 24 and 5 h of zzso zzso The growth effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, was zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso cells provide a useful model in which to study the function of cloned zzso zzso In these cells, a single species of cloned zzso zzso zzso expressed at zzso numbers, activates multiple second zzso responses and regulates subsequent biological responses, including at least one zzso zzso that is zzso by mechanisms independent of zzso
