zzso of zzso is an zzso mechanism by which living cells adapt to stress and the protection of zzso may interfere with the zzso machinery in a variety of zzso Here, we observed the change of zzso expression in rat zzso under stress and explored the protective effect of zzso on the zzso zzso to zzso zzso The results showed that restraint stress led to cardiac dysfunction and structural damage of the zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso A similar increase in the zzso expression level, zzso activity, and the zzso rate of the zzso also were found, which indicated that zzso zzso of zzso might be one of the mechanisms of zzso injury induced by zzso Changes in zzso levels and distribution occurred during the stress process, which correlated with the severity of zzso zzso Heat zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso which in turn may have zzso subsequent restraint zzso damage, including zzso zzso zzso zzso damage, and cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso induced by heat zzso had no effect on zzso expression in the zzso but could inhibit zzso of zzso induced by the zzso signaling zzso and, as a result, prevent cell zzso These results suggest that zzso is capable of protecting the zzso from zzso injury by zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be considered a target in future drugs to prevent cardiovascular injury caused by zzso
