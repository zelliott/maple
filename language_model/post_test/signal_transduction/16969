The generation of zzso zzso and the development of B cell memory are dependent on the help provided by zzso T zzso Mouse studies indicate that zzso signaling in zzso T cells promotes the acquisition of the B cell help zzso However, the role of zzso in humans has been zzso In this study, we show that zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce the differentiation of zzso T cells promoting zzso production by B zzso The acquisition of B cell stimulating properties by zzso zzso blood zzso T cells required the zzso expression of zzso and zzso Gene reporter and zzso experiments zzso demonstrated that upon zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso gene through direct recruitment to the zzso promoter region indicating that zzso acts in part through the direct zzso of the zzso zzso
