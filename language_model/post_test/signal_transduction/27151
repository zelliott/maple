zzso is a new zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso and therefore structurally unrelated to zzso and other zzso and to zzso zzso The action of zzso is thought to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso We investigated the zzso profile in zzso of zzso compared with zzso and zzso for 28 neurotransmitter zzso zzso several receptors for peptides and zzso factors, zzso zzso sites, and zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso affinity for calf zzso zzso zzso and for cloned zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was more potent than zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed zzso or no affinity for other investigated zzso zzso showed additional binding to zzso zzso zzso had a much broader profile with high affinity for several zzso zzso and zzso zzso In signal zzso zzso using cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso (like zzso was a full zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 74 zzso respectively, for zzso zzso in functional zzso the potency of zzso was much higher at zzso receptors than at zzso zzso We further compared the properties of zzso as a new zzso for zzso zzso with those of zzso in membrane preparations of calf zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso beta zzso zzso revealed very rapid association and zzso binding zzso and showed slightly higher affinity zzso zzso 1-2 zzso than zzso We investigated 25 compounds for zzso of zzso and zzso binding in the three membrane zzso Ki values of the zzso were largely similar, although some subtle differences zzso Most compounds did not differentiate between zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which showed zzso higher affinity for the zzso alpha zzso The Ki values of the compounds obtained with zzso receptors in calf zzso zzso indicated that these receptors are of the zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is a potent zzso at zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso its properties probably zzso its zzso zzso and zzso zzso
