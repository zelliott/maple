The zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso dysfunction and zzso in zzso zzso However, the signal zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso dysfunction remain to be fully zzso A major current unknown is the identity of the protein zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Using zzso display of zzso libraries, we have identified a number of peptides that bind zzso and are zzso to zzso receptors zzso involved in zzso zzso We report here on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso with high affinity and is zzso to the zzso zzso domain of several members of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso Based on this zzso we investigated the interaction between zzso and zzso The results show that zzso binds to the zzso zzso domain at or in close proximity to the zzso site and zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso completely blocks zzso binding to zzso and prevents zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso site in zzso is zzso to zzso and that this is a relevant target for zzso zzso Furthermore, they suggest that blocking the interaction of zzso with zzso might lead to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso
