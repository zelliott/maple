The zzso signaling zzso is an ubiquitous zzso interaction zzso which is essential in controlling processes like cell zzso cell fate decision, differentiation or stem cell zzso Recent data have shown that zzso signaling is zzso in zzso being required for survival of these zzso cells that are responsible for zzso of the skin and hairs in zzso In addition, zzso is believed to function as an zzso in melanoma, whereas it is a tumor zzso in mouse zzso In this study, we addressed the implication of the zzso signaling in the development of another population of zzso cells forming the retinal zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in zzso transgenic mice enhanced zzso cell zzso and the resulting zzso pigmented tumor severely affected the overall eye zzso This zzso cell proliferation is dependent on the presence of the zzso factor zzso as it is rescued in mice lacking zzso in the zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling in the zzso uses the zzso pathway, which is dependent on the zzso factor zzso In addition, it is of importance for zzso development, and zzso zzso activity leads to zzso and benign tumors of these zzso zzso
