The zzso zzso also known as zzso is a member of the type III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has been implicated in the zzso of many tumors, including zzso lung zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso has been zzso for lung cancer, but this zzso can also be activated by zzso of the zzso zzso We examined zzso expression and zzso status in zzso to verify its putative expression and genetic zzso as well as its eventual zzso zzso 

We studied 60 zzso samples to determine the zzso of the coding region of the zzso the zzso 9 and 11 were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso and automated zzso Moreover, zzso expression was evaluated in 55 samples by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was demonstrated in about zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso in zzso 9 and three zzso in zzso 11 were zzso zzso analysis revealed no zzso significance of zzso expression for zzso 

In our series, the expression of zzso and its zzso status failed to appear relevant or to have a significant impact on zzso this makes the therapeutic approach with an inhibitor of zzso zzso more difficult in zzso until a sure demonstration of zzso implication is obtained for this zzso
