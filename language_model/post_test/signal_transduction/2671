A major zzso for zzso is gated via the small zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso couple to Ras through the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain protein zzso The activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso did not bind zzso directly, but zzso through the small zzso protein zzso which was zzso in response to zzso growth zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in which zzso a known zzso site, was changed to zzso zzso less efficient zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells still allowed formation of complexes containing zzso zzso and the zzso exchange factor zzso and mediation of a zzso zzso Another pool of zzso was found in complex with a zzso zzso component after zzso zzso zzso with other growth factors did not lead to zzso zzso of zzso As shown by zzso analysis, zzso bound directly to the zzso zzso domain, and this interaction was inhibited by a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found exclusively in the membrane zzso indicating its role in bringing zzso as well as zzso to the plasma zzso These data support the concept of growth zzso zzso of zzso to the Ras zzso
