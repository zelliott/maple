The zzso zzso agent zzso zzso abrogates the zzso checkpoint in tumor cells and zzso them to the lethal effects of zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the role of the zzso zzso in maintenance of this zzso checkpoint, we hypothesized that zzso zzso a component of the signal zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso Of the three zzso known to zzso zzso on zzso both checkpoint zzso 1 zzso and zzso protein zzso 1 zzso were zzso inhibited by zzso with zzso of 11 and 27 zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso leukemia cells with similar drug zzso resulted in decreased levels of zzso zzso of zzso and complete disruption of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso was zzso more resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that disruption of the DNA zzso zzso checkpoint by zzso is zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso activity is not sufficient to enforce the zzso checkpoint in cells treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of zzso
