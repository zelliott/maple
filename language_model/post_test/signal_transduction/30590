Plant growth is shaped by the dynamic integration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Information from many of these input pathways feeds into the highly connected network of small zzso zzso Signal zzso components for most plant hormones are known and mapping of hormone interactions within the network is well zzso Recent investigations of zzso zzso using well-established zzso and genetic tools in combination with sophisticated application of newer zzso technologies, provide a zzso view of early zzso zzso zzso such as light, the zzso clock, and zzso zzso programs, profoundly influence the hormone zzso The zzso approaches described here clarify the mechanisms of signal integration while revealing the flexibility of such zzso
