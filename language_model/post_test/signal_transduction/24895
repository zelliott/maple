zzso is a unique zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso protein that was initially identified as a 40 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gastric zzso zzso Because zzso is a potent zzso of zzso cell acid zzso we have hypothesized that changes in zzso zzso might be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso activities, perhaps by modulating interactions among zzso and/or zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso sustained rise in zzso cell zzso zzso and this increase in zzso is closely correlated with the acid zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso appear to induce a partial zzso of zzso from the cell cortex, where it zzso along with the zzso of zzso in zzso cells, to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region, which is the site of active zzso transport in the zzso zzso Additional studies demonstrate that although zzso zzso and protein are expressed in a wide range of zzso the expression is specific for certain zzso cell types present within these zzso For example, gastric chief cells, which contain relatively little zzso and zzso the zzso zzso by regulated zzso do not appear to express zzso Similarly, zzso was not detected in pancreatic zzso cells, which zzso zzso by similar mechanisms and also contain relatively low levels of zzso zzso also was not zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso in gastrointestinal smooth muscle, heart or skeletal zzso In contrast, expression was prominent in the cortical regions of zzso duct cells in the zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso as well as in certain zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, moderate levels of expression were also detected in zzso present in zzso zzso and in vascular zzso In primary cultures of gastric zzso zzso was present mainly within the tips of zzso and at the leading edges of membrane zzso Taken together these results support the hypothesis that the zzso plays an important role in the regulation of dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso may also serve to regulate zzso zzso transport activities, not only in the zzso cell but also in certain other zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
