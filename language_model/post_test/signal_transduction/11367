Recently, the zzso zzso zzso has been defined as a central zzso for the induction of cardiac zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if cardiac zzso in animals chronically treated with zzso II zzso could be prevented by blocking this zzso with zzso A zzso Female zzso rats were treated with zzso by subcutaneous infusion and injected twice a day with zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso In the zzso treated group there was a zzso increase in the zzso weight ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in heart weight was blocked with zzso zzso increases in zzso and zzso gene expression were detected in the zzso treated animals, which were either attenuated or blocked with zzso zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that zzso does prevent the development of cardiac zzso in zzso treated rats, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso II induced zzso in zzso
