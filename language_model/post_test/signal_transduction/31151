The effects of zzso in zzso seen in zzso on collagen production and turnover in zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso The zzso effects of zzso in these cells were zzso zzso zzso cells were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression and protein production were measured by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The signal zzso pathways involved were evaluated by specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso The effects on zzso zzso 1 zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso 1 zzso were assessed by their gene transcript levels, zzso activity of cell culture zzso and zzso protein zzso At zzso seen in zzso individuals zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso did not affect collagen zzso At zzso seen in obesity zzso zzso zzso increased collagen I and III zzso zzso zzso transcript levels by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein production by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects were blocked by zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Although zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso I and III zzso levels, there were no significant effects on collagen I and III protein zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effects on zzso or zzso zzso levels, zzso activity, or zzso protein zzso In conclusion, zzso at levels seen in obese individuals, produces an increase in collagen production by zzso acting through the zzso and zzso zzso At these zzso zzso does not affect zzso or zzso expression or zzso activity of zzso
