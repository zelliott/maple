Though zzso of microbes by professional zzso such as zzso is crucial for the survival of the host, it is still unclear how the apparent zzso of the plasma membrane is zzso zzso zzso extension, particulate zzso and zzso closure all require seemingly large expansions of the cell surface zzso Although actual membrane stretching can be ruled out on the basis of physical properties of zzso zzso the addition of new membrane from within the cell, either by zzso or zzso fusion with zzso zzso zzso might provide an zzso However, these events do not seem to have major roles during zzso by zzso Instead, zzso might use a more primitive zzso that is, the unfolding of surface membrane wrinkles, to provide the additional membrane for zzso Here, we briefly discuss why membrane zzso provides a feasible hypothesis for membrane expansion during zzso zzso and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for zzso control over membrane surface wrinkles, and the potential zzso zzso
