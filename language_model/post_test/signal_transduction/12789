Previous studies demonstrating zzso of zzso zzso zzso and generation of zzso zzso in zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso provide indirect evidence that zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso a zzso zzso binding protein which regulates the zzso of a membrane zzso zzso C, is an early event in the zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso zzso with this hypothesis, exposure of a plasma membrane rich preparation isolated from zzso labeled zzso to zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of labeled zzso zzso of other zzso were not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in extracts of zzso plasma zzso exposed to zzso To further explore the involvement of zzso zzso in functional responses of intact zzso triggered by zzso we zzso cells with zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to diminish zzso zzso synthesis and then compared zzso generation induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso h at 37 degrees C with zzso resulted in zzso depletion of zzso and zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso required relatively high levels of zzso zzso to 400 zzso and resulted in a 55 to zzso reduction of zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso levels were not observed when zzso were zzso at 4 degrees zzso AT 37 degrees C, zzso also decreased zzso zzso and zzso levels but zzso zzso depletion was less pronounced than zzso zzso depletion for each concentration of zzso zzso When zzso was removed by washing cells after zzso zzso zzso quickly returned to zzso values but zzso zzso levels remained zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso depletion of zzso zzso but had no influence on zzso zzso zzso zzso released triggered by zzso and zzso was inhibited to an extent similar to that of zzso zzso depletion under different conditions of zzso zzso of zzso release was not observed if cells were zzso at 4 degrees C, was not rapidly zzso and was not observed when zzso was added with zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
