zzso zzso is the primary cause of the high recurrence and poor prognosis of human zzso zzso zzso However, neither its molecular mechanisms nor markers for its prediction before zzso have been zzso We recently revealed zzso of zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso 3 zzso in human zzso Here we examined the clinical and biological significance of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was strongly associated with male gender zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso B zzso zzso zzso microscopic vascular invasion zzso zzso zzso early recurrence zzso zzso zzso and worse prognosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were detected in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso could be induced by zzso media of zzso cells and abolished by the zzso of zzso media with zzso zzso or by the zzso of the zzso zzso expression of the donor zzso zzso Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 was required for zzso zzso The downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso pathways were primarily zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso pathways were zzso by both zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso signaling had potent effects on both the migration and invasion of zzso cells, but neither had significant effects on the proliferation of zzso cells, tumor formation, or tumor growth in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso signaling via the zzso zzso loop plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell zzso and invasion, which contribute to zzso zzso and early recurrence of zzso zzso is a marker for the prediction of zzso zzso and early zzso zzso signaling is a candidate target for the treatment of microscopic vascular invasion and for the prevention of zzso zzso
