We have reported recently that high zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation of zzso but not zzso zzso The selective zzso effect on zzso clones suggested that the two helper T zzso zzso might zzso different zzso signal zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that this distinction was not due to a gross difference in the level of zzso expression by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso proliferation by zzso zzso appeared to depend on calcium for zzso effect, suggesting that a substantial zzso of zzso free calcium concentration zzso might not occur after zzso of the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso proliferation of both subsets, suggesting that zzso systems which stimulate elevated zzso would be expected to inhibit zzso Although elevated zzso and generation of zzso zzso were readily detected in zzso zzso these second zzso were not detected following stimulation of zzso clones via the zzso zzso In addition, zzso production by zzso clones was more sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A than was zzso production by zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso and zzso clones zzso distinct zzso signal zzso mechanisms for zzso gene zzso The difference in signaling mechanisms suggests a potential zzso target for intervention in situations where inappropriate zzso of zzso or zzso cells occurs in zzso
