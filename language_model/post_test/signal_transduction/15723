Recently, a zzso approach has been developed to evaluate the cumulative contribution of the functionally related genes for zzso association studies zzso which may help zzso zzso data to a greater zzso 

In this study, we applied this approach for the zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso We first conducted the zzso zzso among zzso zzso cases and zzso controls in Caucasians with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were grouped into gene transcripts within 20 zzso in distance and then into 174 zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso as well as two positive control gene sets zzso gene set and zzso risk gene zzso The association of each zzso with zzso risk was evaluated using the weighted zzso zzso One thousand permutations were conducted to assess the zzso 

Both of the positive control gene sets reached zzso zzso Four other pathways were also significantly associated with zzso risk: the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso false discovery rate, zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified four pathways associated with zzso risk, which may offer new insights into the zzso of zzso upon further zzso and this approach may help identify potential biological pathways that might be missed by the standard zzso zzso
