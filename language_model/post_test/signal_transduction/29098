The zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso on mast cells zzso zzso zzso that lead to allergic zzso Although it was thought that zzso binding to zzso is a passive zzso recent reports suggest that zzso actively promotes mast cell survival in the absence of zzso However, it is largely unknown how these distinct responses are delivered through the same zzso zzso depending on the types of zzso As an underlying molecular mechanism for the generation of diverse responses through zzso we found that the quantity and the duration of the signal through the zzso gamma chain zzso determine different mast cell zzso Furthermore, zzso sustained zzso zzso is critical for zzso mast cell survival through zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the maintenance of prolonged zzso zzso through membrane retention of the zzso complex, zzso In this review, the signal regulation for the distinct responses of mast cells through zzso are zzso
