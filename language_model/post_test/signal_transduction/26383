zzso is a system used by a host to defend against the presence of bacteria, zzso or zzso zzso receptors zzso in the plasma zzso of zzso are activated when they recognize the molecular structure of a virus or zzso zzso zzso an outer zzso component of zzso bacteria, zzso an inflammatory process via zzso We investigated the effect of the extract of zzso zzso flowers zzso on zzso inflammation in zzso zzso zzso The extract markedly suppressed zzso oxide generation in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso It inhibited zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso such as zzso beta and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso It also inhibited zzso protein levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso an upstream zzso of the nuclear factor zzso B zzso pathway, and thus inhibited zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso exerts an zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso expression and blocking the zzso zzso
