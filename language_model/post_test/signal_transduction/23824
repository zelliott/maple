In addition to zzso zzso zzso stem and zzso cells zzso the human zzso stem cell zzso hierarchy contains a rare zzso population with severe combined zzso zzso However, little is known about the molecular characteristics of these zzso cells or their relationship to the zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso population contains cells that not only function as zzso but can also be placed above the zzso populations in the zzso zzso These cells have an active zzso pathway, in which signaling through zzso is crucial for maintenance of the primitive state, and combined signals from zzso and zzso are important in controlling its zzso They are also zzso to zzso signals and show a zzso zzso zzso pathway, in part regulated by zzso Overall, therefore, zzso cells represent an immature and zzso human zzso population maintained through a distinctive network of cellular signaling zzso
