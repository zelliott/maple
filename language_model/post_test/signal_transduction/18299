The release of zzso A and B through zzso zzso by zzso zzso clone zzso upon T cell zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso 3 zzso whereas a significant zzso release was still zzso even in the presence of excess zzso In contrast, the production of zzso was highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and could be completely blocked by zzso Both zzso and insensitive zzso zzso pathways were involved in the actual zzso killing toward different target zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso was able to mimic zzso stimulation to induce zzso production, although the same treatment triggered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production following zzso zzso were profoundly prevented by zzso zzso Thus, these results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso clone depends on the zzso of protein zzso C, and requires either zzso or independent additional signals downstream of zzso zzso
