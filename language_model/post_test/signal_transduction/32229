The zzso nature of human embryonic stem cells zzso makes them convenient for zzso zzso relevant zzso Here we show using zzso reporter zzso lines that the cells are zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the level of zzso zzso activity in individual cells zzso with differences in zzso potential and zzso differentiation zzso The addition of zzso protein or, conversely, a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduces zzso allowing stable expansion of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso the zzso zzso predominantly form zzso and cardiac cells, whereas the zzso zzso generate primarily zzso zzso Thus, zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso much of the inefficiency in directing zzso towards specific cell zzso The relatively uniform differentiation potential of the zzso and zzso zzso leads to faster and more efficient derivation of targeted cell types from these zzso
