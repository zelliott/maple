zzso is a critical sensory zzso that allows living things to acquire chemical information from the external zzso The zzso system processes two major classes of zzso zzso general zzso small molecules derived from food or the environment that signal the presence of food, fire, or zzso and zzso zzso molecules released from individuals of the same species that convey social or sexual zzso zzso receptors are broadly zzso by the zzso that activate them, into zzso or zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso expressing either zzso or zzso receptors send signals to separate zzso and zzso centers in the brain to elicit distinct behavioral and zzso zzso General zzso activate receptors in a zzso fashion, whereas zzso activate narrowly tuned receptors that activate sexually zzso neural circuits in the zzso We review recent progress on zzso zzso structure, function, and zzso in zzso and zzso from the point of view of the molecular biology and physiology of these sensory zzso
