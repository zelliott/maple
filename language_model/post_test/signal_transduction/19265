zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso stem cell zzso that is driven by the zzso zzso fusion zzso and for which treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has yielded great zzso While this is the case, zzso zzso stem cells can persist despite zzso therapy, and efforts have intensified towards determining the molecular pathways that are critical for the maintenance of such zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a crucial role in the survival of the zzso stem cell zzso The zzso zzso displays crucial roles during embryonic development, tissue zzso and repair in zzso Several mechanisms that lead to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have been identified in various zzso Here we review in detail the discovery that zzso signaling zzso the maintenance of the critical leukemia initiating cells or zzso stem cells zzso in zzso zzso as well as discuss investigations on the role of zzso signaling in normal zzso As zzso that directly target the positive zzso signal zzso zzso zzso have entered clinical trials, these findings offer a unique opportunity to potentially target the zzso population that is not eliminated with zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy in zzso
