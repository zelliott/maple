The work presented here demonstrates that zzso from mice lacking zzso zzso for the zzso of T zzso show zzso zzso in response to zzso of collagen that cause zzso irreversible zzso of control zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was shown to be the result of almost no zzso production and significantly diminished zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso does not affect zzso induced by high zzso of collagen because that zzso is not dependent on zzso and/or zzso Even though zzso and zzso provide amplification signals for zzso zzso in response to low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to low levels of zzso a zzso zzso or zzso Though the zzso of zzso signals by zzso zzso and zzso remains unidentified, it is clear that zzso plays a positive role in zzso zzso zzso and a negative role in zzso or zzso zzso zzso
