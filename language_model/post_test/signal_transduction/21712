zzso for zzso growth factor zzso are abundantly expressed on zzso zzso zzso cells from patients with zzso arthritis zzso and stimulation with zzso enhances both the zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for the excessive growth of zzso cells and to seek a novel zzso therapy for zzso we examined the expression of adapter proteins and the effect of the specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used in the present study after zzso zzso The zzso and zzso growth patterns of the zzso cells were evaluated using a zzso zzso and colony formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and both proteins were rapidly zzso 1 zzso zzso after the stimulation of zzso cells with 10 zzso of zzso and, to a lesser extent, after stimulation with 100 zzso of zzso growth factor zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by 1 zzso or less of zzso zzso specifically suppressed the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of various zzso Moreover, zzso zzso abolished both the zzso and zzso proliferation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso adapter proteins are expressed and likely to be involved in the growth zzso of zzso zzso cells and that zzso zzso a key drug in the treatment of chronic zzso zzso may also be effective for the treatment of zzso
