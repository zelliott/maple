The hypothesis that zzso zzso may interfere with zzso zzso signals evoked by the zzso of receptors linked to zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Single mouse pancreatic zzso cells were used, because there is much information in this system on the mechanism by which zzso zzso evokes zzso zzso zzso zzso and these spikes can be monitored in internally zzso cells by measuring the zzso zzso zzso zzso normally evokes repetitive zzso zzso but when zzso (1 zzso zzso is present in the internal zzso solution the responses are reduced or zzso When zzso is acutely infused into the internal zzso solution the zzso zzso signals quickly zzso zzso also zzso zzso signals evoked by the zzso releasing agent zzso zzso results suggest that zzso acid may protect against the toxic effects of zzso zzso acid and zzso in the absence of added zzso have the effect of enhancing the zzso zzso zzso This could be due to binding of traces of zzso in the zzso We conclude that zzso can disrupt zzso zzso zzso signals when present inside zzso
