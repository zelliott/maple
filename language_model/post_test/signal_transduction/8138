zzso zzso zzso the primary constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso is generated by zzso and zzso sequential zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso The zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the main zzso in brain but the regulation of its activity is largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that both zzso activity and subsequent zzso production are enhanced after stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the receptors for zzso growth factor zzso and nerve growth factor zzso in cultured cells as well as in mouse zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso also zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso This enhancement of zzso activity and zzso production upon zzso zzso could be specifically inhibited by zzso family zzso zzso and by depletion of zzso zzso with zzso and could be zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso by a dominant negative form of zzso also abolished the enhancement of zzso activity and zzso production, indicating the requirement of zzso zzso for the enhanced zzso Taken together, our study presents evidence that zzso activity and zzso production are under the regulation of zzso and this is achieved via zzso zzso zzso and suggests that an aberration of such regulation might contribute to zzso zzso zzso
