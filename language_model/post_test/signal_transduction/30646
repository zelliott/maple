The F box protein zzso is zzso and its frequent amplification and zzso correlate with the grade of zzso of certain zzso zzso depletion of zzso decreases cell growth and increases zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso and suppresses zzso zzso by DNA damage or zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso forms a complex with zzso through the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso to which zzso is thought to bind and zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso in cells and in zzso As zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso in cells zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso controls zzso signaling pathways in cancer cells, making zzso a potential molecular target for cancer zzso
