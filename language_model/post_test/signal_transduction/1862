It has been reported that zzso an zzso agent, may play a role in preventing diabetic zzso However, there is little evidence to show the effect of zzso on the production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the regulation of zzso synthesis induced by high zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso zzso alone markedly increased the zzso zzso Furthermore, high zzso levels and zzso combined had additive effects on zzso zzso and zzso diminished their zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso of zzso induced by high zzso levels and/or zzso Our results suggest that the administration of zzso to diabetic patients may have a beneficial effect for the prevention of diabetic vascular complications by the zzso of zzso synthesis from zzso zzso
