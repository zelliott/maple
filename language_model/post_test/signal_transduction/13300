Plants monitor informational light signals using three sensory zzso families: the zzso zzso and zzso Recent advances suggest that the zzso act zzso by targeting light signals directly to zzso promoters through binding to a zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso appear to act zzso by zzso extant zzso degradation of a key zzso zzso through direct binding to a putative zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso levels of the zzso and consequently of target gene zzso
