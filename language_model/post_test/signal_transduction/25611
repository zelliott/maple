zzso zzso is an zzso drug which causes an array of adverse effects on different zzso and zzso including skeletal zzso In this work we show that zzso behaves as a potent trigger to activate protein zzso in skeletal zzso zzso Within zzso of 50 zzso zzso administration, zzso zzso displayed unchanged cell viability but showed a subset of hallmark signs typically recognized during zzso including severe reduction in body size, repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and loss of zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso activity and formation of zzso were remarkably increased in zzso zzso but forced stimulation of zzso pathway, as obtained through insulin administration or delivery of a zzso activated zzso form, was sufficient to counter the zzso protein breakdown, leading to rescue of zzso zzso Overall, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso systems, suggesting that the zzso zzso represents one sensitive target of zzso molecular action in skeletal zzso
