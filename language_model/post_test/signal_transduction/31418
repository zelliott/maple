zzso zzso has critical roles in development and zzso Although significant progress has been made in understanding the downstream signaling cascade of this pathway, little is known regarding zzso zzso modification of the cellular zzso 

To identify potential genes regulated by zzso zzso and involved in zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso to specific inhibit the expression and the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso Meanwhile, we designed an zzso zzso covering zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso a series of differential expression of genes was identified and further confirmed by zzso 

zzso integrated zzso zzso zzso could effectively suppress zzso expression and the zzso activity of zzso Meanwhile, depletion of zzso in this manner made the cells more sensitive to zzso 130 genes involved in some important zzso zzso such as zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso pathway, showed significant zzso in their expression level after the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso analyses proves to be a versatile strategy for identifying genes regulated by zzso zzso and for a better understanding the role of this zzso in zzso Some of the identified zzso directed or zzso target genes may represent excellent targets to limit tumor zzso
