We have previously zzso using zzso that stabilization of the zzso zzso enhanced zzso induced upon zzso withdrawal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It remained possible, however, that a disruption in the regulation of zzso zzso and not simply zzso stabilization, was required to affect the zzso of an zzso zzso We have now tested the effects of zzso D, a zzso agent that promoted zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso death of zzso T cells in the time course studied but did enhance the commitment to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso The induction of cell death was not the result of direct zzso collapse, since treatment of the cells with zzso D in the presence of zzso did not promote zzso As with zzso the enhancement of commitment to zzso could be delayed by zzso of the zzso protein zzso but, unlike zzso zzso D modestly affected the zzso stage of zzso as zzso Taken together, these results suggest that changes in zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso signal committing zzso withdrawn from required growth factors, to the death zzso
