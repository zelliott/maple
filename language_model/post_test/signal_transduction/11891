zzso cells zzso are professional zzso cells zzso that play a critical role to activate immune zzso They may be targeted for zzso by zzso including zzso In this study, chicken bone zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B10 zzso zzso of zzso + zzso and zzso buffer saline (PBS) as a control group zzso at 3, 6, and 12 h zzso zzso revealed that treatment groups modulated the zzso and biological functions of zzso zzso electron zzso showed attachment of zzso on the surface of zzso zzso transmission electron zzso zzso revealed efficiently engulfing and degradation of zzso Gene expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and chicken specific zzso expressions were improved and downstream associated factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased in all treatment groups as compared to zzso Surprisingly, zzso response was noted significant higher in zzso treatment among all zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production levels were found higher, and lower concentration of zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso and zzso + zzso treatment zzso In contrast, zzso groups showed prominent increase in zzso zzso and zzso concentration levels as compared to control zzso Altogether, these results emphasize a potentially important role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso B10 in modulating zzso functions of zzso by targeting specific toll like receptors zzso and associated zzso The role of zzso on zzso functionality in a zzso species have been presented for the first zzso
