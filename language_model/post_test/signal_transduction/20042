zzso zzso formation from the inner cell mass is one of the earliest known cell fate decisions made in the mouse zzso The mechanisms involved in orchestrating this process are not fully understood and are difficult to study in zzso The zzso zzso cell line is an in zzso model used to circumvent many technical problems surrounding the study of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso acid differentiate to primitive zzso and this is accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species can zzso this zzso pathway, but whether they are sufficient to induce zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso In the present study, a sustained increase in zzso levels was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso activity, a read out of zzso zzso was also seen in response to zzso zzso Analysis from zzso zzso and real time zzso revealed the presence of markers of differentiation and a reduction in the expression of a marker of zzso confirming that zzso zzso cells developed into primitive zzso In contrast, exposing zzso zzso cells to antioxidants zzso zzso Real time zzso was also used to identify candidates responsible for the observed zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso 1, 2, 3 and 4 and zzso genes were zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso primitive zzso zzso Together, these results shed new light on how early mouse zzso might be influenced by the zzso involving zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
