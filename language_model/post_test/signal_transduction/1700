zzso zzso 2 zzso is an zzso of zzso that converts zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso of proliferation of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study aims to unravel the molecular mechanism of the reduced zzso especially the signaling zzso proteins involved in this zzso Thus, we chose zzso zzso that is initiated by growth factors and leads to cell survival and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso showed that: zzso signaling proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all had reduced expression as shown by Western zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and DNA zzso zzso showed that zzso of the zzso cells were undergoing zzso zzso the activity of zzso was decreased as shown by Western zzso using zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, both inhibited zzso activity, indicating that zzso and zzso pathways were merging at zzso in zzso zzso The above results suggest that zzso of zzso strongly zzso the zzso signaling zzso at multiple sites and induced zzso This, at least partly, explains the molecular mechanism of impaired proliferation induced by zzso zzso
