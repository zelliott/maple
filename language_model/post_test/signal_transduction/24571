To investigate a mechanism of diabetic zzso we examined an zzso of cardiac alpha zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso diabetic zzso In diabetes, the cell surface alpha zzso concentration on isolated cardiac zzso decreased by zzso without any change in the zzso constant, and, moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was also decreased by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso activity was elevated in both zzso (by zzso and membrane (by zzso zzso in zzso All of these abnormalities seen in diabetes were reversed by chronic insulin zzso Rapid zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in the normal rat heart revealed decreases in both zzso number (by zzso and zzso zzso production (by zzso These results indicate that the impairment of cardiac alpha zzso signaling is closely associated with the diabetic state and may be linked, at least in part, with the abnormal zzso of cardiac zzso
