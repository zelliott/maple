zzso 1 zzso is produced in zzso cancer cell lines and has been shown to act through zzso receptors as an zzso growth factor to promote tumor cell proliferation in zzso In zzso 433 cells, the efficacy of zzso as a stimulus of zzso incorporation was equivalent to that of zzso growth zzso zzso also zzso the rapid expression of zzso an action zzso by zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso was not zzso by a zzso zzso G zzso An analysis of the effects of zzso and depletion of protein zzso C zzso on zzso responses demonstrated that zzso was necessary but not sufficient for zzso stimulation by zzso In zzso zzso 433 cells, zzso stimulation of zzso incorporation was prevented by two structurally distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso A and zzso These results indicate that both zzso and protein zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso of several cellular zzso among which zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso The zzso between the potent zzso actions of zzso and zzso growth factor is consistent with the independence of their signal zzso pathways in zzso cancer zzso These findings also indicate that zzso signaling between the zzso zzso and a yet unidentified zzso zzso is involved in the zzso response to zzso
