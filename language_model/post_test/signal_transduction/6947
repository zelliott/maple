zzso zzso are zzso compounds that are zzso by plants to communicate with the zzso In addition to their function in zzso zzso and attracting carnivorous predators in green zzso the presumed primary function of zzso zzso released from mature fruits is the attraction of zzso zzso zzso oranges zzso zzso primarily accumulate zzso in peel oil zzso with zzso accounting for approximately zzso of the total volatile zzso In a previous report, we showed that zzso of a zzso zzso gene alters zzso levels in orange zzso zzso zzso leading to resistance against zzso zzso zzso A global gene expression analysis of AS versus empty zzso zzso transgenic fruits revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso genes involved in the innate immune zzso zzso levels of zzso acid were substantially higher in the zzso compared with AS zzso Upon zzso challenge, salicylic acid levels were triggered in zzso samples, while zzso acid metabolism and signaling were drastically increased in AS orange zzso In nature, zzso levels increase in orange fruit once the seeds are fully zzso The inverse correlation between the increase in zzso content and the decrease in the defense response suggests that zzso promotes infection by zzso that are likely involved in zzso access to the pulp for zzso zzso
