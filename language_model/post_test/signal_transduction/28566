We have investigated the role of several protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction of rat urinary zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated in the presence of multiple zzso of zzso of various protein zzso their inactive controls, or their zzso zzso contraction was not significantly inhibited by three protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or its inactive control zzso zzso zzso each), or by two zzso of zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or their negative control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although high zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso contraction, this was not zzso by another inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso was more likely due to direct zzso of zzso light chain zzso by zzso than to an involvement of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and effectively attenuated the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso contraction of rat urinary zzso does not involve protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in contrast, zzso zzso appear to play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso
