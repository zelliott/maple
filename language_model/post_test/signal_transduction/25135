The effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system was studied in zzso zzso were zzso injected with a daily dose of zzso (15 zzso zzso or vehicle for 14 zzso Drug treatment resulted in zzso evidence of zzso zzso and increased plasma membrane fluidity as estimated by zzso zzso The number of zzso receptors and the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso decreased in zzso zzso However, the pattern of zzso stimulation of the zzso activity was not modified by this zzso zzso blockade by zzso also decreased the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as estimated by an zzso zzso Whereas zzso DNA fragmentation was evidenced in prostate from zzso zzso animals, a zzso zzso pattern was observed after zzso zzso Thus, zzso blockade by zzso results in an important impairment of the components of the zzso zzso system in rat prostate as well as in a modification of their zzso extent, which is presumably due to differences observed in plasma membrane zzso These results represent a zzso in the prostate between two mechanisms of signal zzso involved in cell zzso
