The zzso zzso zzso is a central zzso for protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso create a condition termed zzso stress and lead to zzso of the complex signaling cascade called the unfolded protein response zzso Recent studies have documented that the zzso coordinates multiple signaling pathways and controls various zzso in cells and the whole zzso Furthermore, unresolved zzso stress has been implicated in a variety of zzso disorders, such as obesity and type 2 zzso zzso intervening in zzso stress and modulating signaling components of the zzso would provide promising zzso for the treatment of human zzso zzso
