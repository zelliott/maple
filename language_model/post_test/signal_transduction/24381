zzso derived zzso factor is critical in the establishment of the zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms of zzso factor perception and signal zzso in the plant will greatly advance our understanding of this complex zzso Here, we describe the identification of a new zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso that is involved in zzso factor zzso zzso at this locus are blocked for zzso zzso gene expression and show a reduced root hair deformation zzso zzso plants also show a complete absence of infection and cortical cell division following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso one of the earliest responses tested, is still functional in these zzso zzso We conclude that the gene zzso is a component of the zzso factor signal zzso zzso that lies downstream of the zzso zzso
