zzso zzso from zzso tissue are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso However, much less is known about their effect on zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso was previously identified as a target of zzso zzso drugs and zzso zzso Using transgenic mice that mildly zzso zzso in peripheral zzso we show that zzso is an extremely powerful regulator of zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso caused a 50% reduction in zzso tissue weight, partly by stimulating fatty acid zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, zzso zzso increased plasma levels of zzso free fatty zzso zzso total cholesterol, and high density zzso zzso zzso tests indicated that zzso zzso severely impaired plasma zzso clearance but had no effect on very low density zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were amplified by a high fat diet, resulting in markedly elevated plasma and liver zzso plasma free fatty zzso and plasma zzso levels, and impaired zzso tolerance in zzso transgenic mice fed a high fat zzso zzso in mice the full-length form of zzso was physically associated with zzso whereas truncated zzso was associated with low density zzso In human both full-length and truncated zzso were associated with zzso The composite data suggest that via physical association with plasma zzso zzso acts as a powerful signal from fat and other zzso to prevent fat storage and stimulate fat zzso Our data indicate that disturbances in zzso signaling might be involved in zzso
