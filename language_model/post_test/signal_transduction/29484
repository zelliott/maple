Many signaling proteins change their location within cells in response to external zzso In zzso this phenomenon is remarkably zzso The G protein of rod zzso and rod zzso concentrates in the outer segments zzso of these zzso in zzso Within approximately 30 minutes after zzso rod zzso redistributes throughout all of the outer and inner compartments of the zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso from the inner compartments to become zzso primarily within the zzso In the past several years, the question of whether these proteins are actively moved by molecular zzso or whether they are redistributed by simple diffusion has been extensively zzso This review focuses on the most essential works in the area and concludes that the basic principle driving this protein movement is zzso The zzso and light dependence of this movement is achieved by the interactions of zzso and zzso with their zzso restricted binding zzso
