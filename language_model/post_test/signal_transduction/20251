zzso zzso is the most frequently encountered human zzso zzso causing both superficial infections and life-threatening systemic zzso zzso zzso studies performed in this zzso have mainly used zzso zzso and extensive collections of zzso zzso are still zzso Here, we report the development of a first generation zzso zzso zzso the improvement of zzso systems and the construction of two new libraries of zzso zzso strains zzso genes for components of signaling networks, in particular protein zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso As a proof of concept, we screened these collections for genes whose zzso impacts zzso or growth rates in zzso zzso Our screens identified genes previously described for their role in these biological zzso demonstrating the functionality of our strategy, as well as genes that have not been previously associated to these zzso This article emphasizes the potential of systematic zzso strategies to improve our knowledge of regulatory networks in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and strain collections described here are available at the zzso zzso Stock zzso Their extension to a zzso scale will represent important resources for the zzso zzso zzso
