Fast and accurate synaptic transmission requires zzso zzso of neurotransmitter receptors in the zzso zzso During development of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors zzso is one of the first signs of zzso specialization and is induced by zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed that different mechanisms regulate assembly vs stabilization of zzso clusters and of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and component of the zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso play crucial roles in the zzso zzso Once formed, zzso clusters and the zzso membrane are stabilized by components of the zzso zzso complex, some of which also direct aspects of synaptic maturation such as formation of zzso zzso zzso receptors are also expressed across the peripheral and central nervous system zzso These receptors are localized not only at the zzso but also at the zzso sites where they carry out major synaptic zzso In zzso they are found as clusters at synaptic or zzso sites, suggesting that different mechanisms might zzso this specific zzso of zzso zzso This review summarizes the current knowledge about formation and stabilization of the zzso apparatus at the zzso junction and extends this to explore the synaptic structures of zzso zzso zzso
