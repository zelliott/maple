We have studied the zzso signal which directs the complete export of the zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli across both bacterial zzso into the surrounding zzso Isolation and sequencing of zzso zzso genes from the related bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed high primary sequence divergence in the three zzso zzso and highlighted within the extreme terminal 53 zzso acids the conservation of three zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso zzso a cluster of charged zzso and a zzso zzso terminal sequence rich in zzso zzso Fusion of the zzso 53 zzso acid sequence to zzso truncated zzso A directed zzso export but export was radically reduced following independent disruption or progressive zzso of the three zzso features by zzso deletion and the introduction of translation stop zzso within the 3' zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso zzso export signal comprises multiple components and suggest possible analogies with the zzso import zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins and supported the view that export proceeds without a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso forms of an independently exported extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the signal was not removed during zzso
