zzso A zzso is the primary zzso for zzso the zzso high zzso response in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso define two positive regulators in the zzso signaling zzso These two proteins have been reported to be essential for zzso zzso nuclear zzso through direct physical interaction with zzso Here, we report that zzso protein is zzso rapidly after exposure to red zzso zzso exposure to zzso light after the red light pulse reverses zzso zzso Such a phenomenon represents a classical zzso zzso low zzso zzso The zzso of zzso depends on functioning zzso but not on other zzso and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso directly interact with zzso by zzso zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso interact more zzso with the zzso form of zzso in zzso zzso by zzso Finally, in zzso zzso zzso confirmed that a zzso zzso is able to robustly zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso may zzso regulate zzso and zzso activity through direct physical interaction and zzso light zzso zzso to fine-tune their degradation rates and resulting light zzso
