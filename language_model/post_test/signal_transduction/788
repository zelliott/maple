zzso acids zzso with at least 12 carbon atoms increase zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso release from zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso cell line zzso we investigated whether candidate zzso pathways zzso the zzso zzso or whether zzso themselves act within the cell to release zzso directly from the zzso zzso zzso cells loaded with zzso were briefly (3 zzso exposed to saturated zzso above and below the threshold length zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso Various signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso antagonists, all failed to block zzso zzso zzso To identify direct effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso store, zzso was measured in zzso cells loaded with the lower affinity zzso dye zzso zzso by zzso zzso In zzso cells, again zzso but not zzso or zzso induced release of stored zzso Although zzso released zzso in other zzso cell lines, only intact zzso cells responded to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso In addition, 30 zzso exposure to zzso induced a sustained zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso but only a transient response in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest that at least two zzso sensing mechanisms operate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso release from zzso zzso zzso However, they also induce sustained zzso entry from the zzso medium to maintain an elevated zzso
