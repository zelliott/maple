The availability of zinc has a regulatory role in the immune zzso It can have either zzso or zzso effects, which both seem to be a consequence of a direct interaction of zinc with the zzso zzso by zzso In this review, the molecular basis for this effect, the interaction of zinc with the signal zzso of zzso is zzso In particular, zinc seems to activate or inhibit several signaling pathways that interact with the signal zzso of pathogen sensing zzso the so-called zzso receptors zzso which sense zzso molecular structures and, upon zzso lead to zzso of zzso zzso The interaction of zinc with protein zzso zzso and protein zzso C, and a direct zzso of zzso binding to its zzso zzso all result in enhanced zzso zzso On the other hand, a complex interaction between zzso NO and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso associated zzso and inhibitor of zzso B zzso all counteract the production of zzso zzso A role for the zinc binding protein zzso as a regulator for zzso zinc signaling is zzso By acting on all these signaling zzso the zinc status of zzso can have a direct effect on zzso
