The function of the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso and in zzso The zzso protein is a sensor of zzso zzso an intermediate of the zzso acid cycle used by this zzso to convert zzso to zzso zzso was unresponsive to zzso (a close structural analogue of zzso and to zzso suggesting that zzso not zzso is the zzso that signals the presence of zzso in the environment to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with various levels of zzso activity were zzso All zzso causing zzso zzso activity were mapped to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the entire sensing domain resulted in a protein zzso with the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical to zzso zzso since the zzso zzso protein zzso was as active as the zzso protein in the absence of zzso DNA zzso studies identified the site in the region between zzso and the zzso zzso to which the zzso protein zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence revealed two sites with zzso zzso zzso from zzso I zzso zzso suggested that the zzso protein may have higher affinity for the site zzso to the zzso zzso
