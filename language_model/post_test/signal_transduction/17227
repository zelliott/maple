The convergence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso obligatory event triggering the zzso zzso key step in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso However, as both zzso are highly expressed in brain, mechanisms zzso their unabated convergence are zzso zzso dynamic zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso we found that after synthesis via the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso in zzso zzso While zzso is sorted into zzso recycling zzso zzso is conveyed in zzso zzso However, upon activity zzso known trigger of the zzso zzso is routed into zzso recycling zzso via a zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso is also apparent in zzso zzso zzso Considering zzso is zzso active in an zzso environment, our experiments suggest that zzso have evolved trafficking strategies that normally limit zzso proximity and also uncover a zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso triggering zzso
