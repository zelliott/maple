The human zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso that specifically binds the zzso with intermediate zzso and a beta zzso that associates with the zzso alpha complex, leading to a zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that modification of the putative beta zzso binding site in zzso zzso zzso converted the zzso into an zzso However, analysis of the effect of this zzso zzso on zzso cells zzso with both zzso zzso did not show reduced interaction with the beta c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van der zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 89, zzso To gain more insight into the mechanism of zzso antagonism by zzso we tested its biological activity on two zzso zzso that express clearly different numbers of zzso yet an almost constant number of zzso beta zzso Here we show that zzso has a biological activity comparable to zzso zzso only when a high number of zzso is present on the zzso zzso the critical role of the zzso alpha zzso expression level, treatment with zzso doses of a zzso zzso alpha zzso results in reduced activity of the zzso but not of zzso zzso
