zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain zzso In this study, we addressed the role of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso and evaluated the protective effect of the zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso 

Pig kidney zzso cells zzso cells were exposed to Gen for variable times and zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed by Western zzso 

Exposure to zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner was assessed by DNA content analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gen caused increased zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso This was accompanied by a significant zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso and zzso not only attenuated the zzso effect of zzso but also significantly reversed its effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects on zzso zzso and zzso expression were also reversed by zzso zzso and zzso 

In conclusion, zzso can zzso zzso zzso injury in zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
