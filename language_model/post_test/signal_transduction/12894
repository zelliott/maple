Previously we reported that type V collagen zzso by zzso cells zzso the outgrowth of zzso from rat zzso zzso root zzso zzso but promotes zzso cell migration zzso zzso zzso Stahl, zzso zzso and Carey, zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso 21, zzso Analysis of zzso cell zzso and spreading on dishes coated with various type V collagen zzso revealed that zzso cells zzso effectively only to the zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso collagen zzso zzso cell zzso to zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso is cell zzso because rat zzso failed to adhere to dishes coated with this zzso zzso cell zzso and spreading on zzso was strongly inhibited by soluble zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso but not by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso binding activities of a series of zzso zzso fragments and deletion zzso identified a highly basic region (not present in other type V collagen zzso as the site responsible for high affinity zzso zzso zzso cells zzso poorly to dishes coated with zzso that lacked the zzso binding site and failed to spread or assemble organized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained the zzso binding site inhibited spreading of zzso cells on dishes coated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso extracts on a column of immobilized zzso resulted in the isolation of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso cells bind to collagen type V via zzso binding to a novel high affinity zzso binding site in the zzso
