zzso zzso is an inflammatory mediator, and shows elevated levels in regions of severe injury and inflammatory zzso It has been shown to induce zzso zzso expression in inflammatory responses in zzso zzso We investigated the signaling zzso involved in zzso production caused by BK in zzso zzso BK caused zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso By using pharmacological zzso or genetic zzso of the BK zzso zzso revealed that B2 but not B1 BK receptors are involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso production was attenuated by zzso C inhibitor zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso with BK activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus and zzso zzso BK zzso an increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso and zzso binding to the zzso element was inhibited by B2 BK zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that BK increased zzso production in zzso zzso via the B2 BK zzso zzso signaling zzso
