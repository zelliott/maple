The zzso factor zzso factor zzso plays a central zzso role in oxygen and energy zzso and is activated during zzso by stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is one of the most zzso zzso factors in zzso which is under the regulation of zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the upstream signaling pathways involved in regulating zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso rat zzso 

A well-established rat model of zzso and cultured human retinal zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the role of zzso and zzso pathways in regulating zzso and zzso expression in zzso in rat and zzso under zzso by zzso Western zzso analysis, real-time zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased zzso activity and zzso and zzso expression in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso zzso and the expression of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso and zzso severely inhibited the formation of zzso 

The zzso zzso was required for zzso expression of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso was required only for zzso in zzso rat zzso
