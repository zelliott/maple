The zzso zzso zzso complex is the signal integration hub for zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the regulatory zzso zzso (also known as zzso the zzso complex zzso signals from all zzso zzso stimuli to catalyze the zzso of various zzso and zzso zzso as well as of other zzso Since the discovery of the zzso complex components about zzso ago, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of the zzso architecture and its integration into signaling zzso In addition to the control of zzso zzso zzso mediate the zzso with other zzso thereby extending the complexity of their biological zzso This review summarizes recent advances in zzso biology and focuses on emerging aspects of zzso structure, regulation and zzso
