The purpose of this study was to characterize the zzso receptors coupled to zzso calcium in human zzso zzso cells, a cell line with zzso zzso Both zzso E1 zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, but modulated zzso by different zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso but greatly zzso the increase in zzso produced by zzso This effect was zzso by zzso toxin and other zzso zzso and involved calcium influx since zzso had no effect on zzso in cells incubated in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso did not increase the generation of baseline or zzso zzso zzso at these zzso In contrast, zzso zzso to zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso zzso through a zzso zzso mechanism that involved stimulation of zzso zzso generation and zzso of zzso zzso The order of zzso of other zzso that increased zzso was not consistent with known zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most potent of the zzso tested zzso zzso 28 zzso In zzso at least two zzso receptors are functionally coupled to zzso calcium in zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso coupled to zzso proteins that increases zzso and enhances calcium influx, and a novel zzso zzso that evokes calcium zzso through stimulation of zzso C by a zzso zzso zzso
