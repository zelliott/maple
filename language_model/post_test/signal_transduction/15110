The zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso is a cell surface zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso with zzso zzso This protein is expressed in various tumors and thought to participate in various cellular zzso In this study, we established zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso to zzso its zzso zzso Using this cell system, we examined the biological roles of zzso and its downstream target zzso The zzso expressing cells showed an increased survival rate through increased zzso zzso expression by zzso which were completely suppressed by zzso zzso Moreover, the combination of zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso partially reduced both the cell survival rate and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of these zzso could not affect cell survival nor zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso could play a role in zzso cell survival through both zzso and zzso zzso It is conceivable that zzso of zzso has a significant impact on zzso and zzso
