To explore the role of zzso in zzso development, we recently targeted expression of a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of transgenic mice and observed an unexpected loss of barrier zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing the zzso zzso zzso show attenuated responsiveness to topical application of zzso zzso acid, in agreement with our previous in zzso zzso We also show that the vitamin D3 zzso is unaffected in its ability to zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is unlikely to be functioning through a global zzso of zzso X zzso Additionally, we show that the disruption of zzso barrier function results in a dramatic 4 C drop in mean body surface temperature, probably accounting for the extremely high zzso of zzso mortality in severely zzso zzso Some severely affected zzso do survive and show a pronounced zzso at zzso day 4, consistent with previously documented effects of vitamin A zzso zzso analysis of the severely zzso zzso indicates elevated zzso and zzso in the stratum zzso which results from altered zzso zzso Taken together with previous studies, these data provide strong evidence linking the zzso zzso with zzso of zzso processing required for formation of zzso barrier zzso
