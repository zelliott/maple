zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells have a long survival zzso to an zzso in the normal pathways of zzso zzso cells have been found to produce and zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso In addition to its major role in zzso zzso affects cell survival by interfering with zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of the zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso cells were isolated from peripheral blood drawn from patients with zzso Total zzso zzso examined in 13 samples by flow zzso was present in all cases with mean zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examined in 27 samples by zzso methods, was positive for zzso in all 27 patients and for zzso and zzso in 26 zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be very active in zzso cells, and both its zzso and zzso pathways may contribute to their enhanced zzso
