zzso is a previously zzso protein of zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso proteins whose members are involved in zzso function in both zzso and zzso We show here that zzso specifically associates with translating zzso In addition, in this study proteins were identified that interact with zzso by zzso zzso screening and include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso and zzso domain similar to that of zzso an essential factor of the general zzso acid control zzso required for overcoming zzso acid zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso like zzso interacts with zzso through its zzso domain, and zzso of zzso under conditions mimicking zzso acid zzso resulted in zzso of growth that could be reversed by zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso also zzso with zzso and this zzso pattern was partially dependent on the presence of zzso Based on these findings, we conclude that zzso and its interacting partner zzso associate with zzso and their possible biological roles are zzso
