zzso zzso is clinically important in the development of cardiovascular zzso It is reported that zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited vascular zzso in several clinical zzso However, the mechanism is poorly zzso Recently, it has been suggested that zzso is one of the important processes regulating vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of statins on zzso zzso by testing their effect on zzso focusing in particular on regulation of the survival zzso zzso by growth zzso gene 6 zzso a member of the vitamin zzso protein family, and its zzso zzso In human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso statins significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso by zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of statins was zzso by preventing zzso which was increased by zzso in a zzso manner, and not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, another mechanism regulating zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of statins was dependent on restoration of zzso whose expression was zzso by zzso Restoration of zzso zzso by statins was zzso by zzso stabilization, and not by an increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso and the zzso domain abolished the preventive effect of statins on zzso zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that statins protected zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso via restoration of the zzso zzso
