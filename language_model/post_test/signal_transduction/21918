zzso signaling acts in part through the low density zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso to regulate embryonic development and stem cell zzso zzso signaling is associated with many forms of zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso is a known component of the zzso signaling zzso We find that zzso binds to zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso and identify three zzso zzso sites in zzso Two of the identified zzso sites, zzso and zzso influence zzso signaling in zzso since zzso with zzso of these sites is a more potent zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso Whereas zzso regulates zzso zzso activity, zzso does not, placing zzso upstream of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso strengthens its interaction with zzso suggesting a mechanism by which zzso may zzso regulate zzso zzso The role of zzso is therefore more complex than was previously zzso Generation of active zzso may induce a negative feedback loop by zzso of sites on zzso that zzso zzso binding and hence zzso zzso
