The life span of zzso zzso is extended by zzso that inhibit the function of sensory zzso In this study, we show that specific zzso of sensory zzso influence zzso We find that certain zzso zzso inhibit zzso whereas others promote zzso most likely by influencing zzso zzso zzso zzso also influence life span, and they act in a distinct zzso that involves the zzso zzso In addition, we find that a putative zzso G zzso zzso that is expressed in some of these sensory zzso zzso zzso Together our findings imply that the life span of zzso zzso is regulated by environmental cues and that these cues are perceived and integrated in a complex and sophisticated fashion by specific zzso zzso
