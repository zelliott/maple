Maintenance of zzso zzso is essential for survival of all living organisms in their biological zzso It is also important for the survival of human zzso zzso in the host, where zzso zzso and pH will vary depending on different anatomical zzso However, the exact role of diverse zzso zzso and zzso channels in zzso of zzso pathogens remains zzso In this study we functionally characterized zzso and zzso zzso a putative zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso zzso a zzso zzso pathogen which causes fatal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is induced in response to salt and zzso shock mainly in a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso controls cellular levels of toxic zzso such as zzso and zzso whereas both zzso and zzso are important for controlling less toxic zzso zzso Under alkaline conditions, zzso was highly induced and required for growth in the presence of low levels of zzso or zzso salt and zzso played a role in survival under zzso zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso was essential for survival at zzso conditions zzso zzso under high zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were required for maintenance of plasma membrane potential and stability, which appeared to zzso zzso drug zzso zzso of zzso and zzso enhanced capsule production and zzso zzso However, zzso was zzso for zzso of zzso zzso although zzso was zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso play redundant and discrete roles in zzso zzso pH regulation, membrane potential, and zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso could be novel zzso drug targets for treatment of zzso
