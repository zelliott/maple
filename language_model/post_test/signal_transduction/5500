Many cancer zzso agents have been associated with lower cancer risk by suppressing nuclear zzso zzso signaling zzso which subsequently leads to attenuated zzso zzso and zzso Of the natural compounds, the zzso zzso found in zzso vegetables have received particular attention because of their potential zzso zzso However, limited studies regarding the influence of zzso structure on zzso zzso and zzso action are zzso In the present study, the zzso potential of ten structurally divergent synthetic zzso were evaluated in zzso human colon cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the inflammatory response to bacterial zzso zzso were zzso The synthetic zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso gene zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed stronger zzso zzso as compared to the parent compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that several of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso and correlated with the zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso showed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso and degradation of zzso alpha and decreased nuclear zzso of zzso In zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our findings provide the possibility that synthetic zzso zzso might have promising cancer zzso potential, based on their stronger zzso and zzso activities, than the natural zzso
