Recent data indicate that stimulation of zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso supports zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso express several zzso It has been demonstrated that repeated exposure to zzso zzso causes zzso to become zzso zzso of zzso cell surface expression and the induction of zzso zzso signaling molecules have been proposed to mediate this state of tolerance to zzso zzso and/or their zzso zzso In this review, we zzso our recent observations that uncover the essential role of zzso polarization in the zzso response of zzso to zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso stimulation delivers negative signals that curtail inflammatory responses induced by zzso stimulation by other zzso This zzso ability of zzso represents a unique mechanism that zzso inflammatory responses in a zzso zzso Thus, interventions that enhance zzso polarization could prevent or inhibit human inflammatory zzso diseases and other types of zzso zzso
