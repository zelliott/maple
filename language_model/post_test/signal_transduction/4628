zzso cancer zzso has one of the highest zzso among all zzso The majority of zzso are sporadic zzso that occur in individuals without family histories of zzso or inherited zzso Unfortunately, zzso expression studies of sporadic zzso are zzso A recent study used zzso techniques to identify a predictor gene set indicative of zzso to zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of the predictor gene set were not fully investigated in the previous zzso To understand the functional roles of the predictor gene set, in the present study we applied a zzso statistical model to the zzso data from the previous study and identified mechanisms that are reasonably associated with the predictor gene zzso Interestingly, significant zzso belonging to 2 zzso pathways zzso zzso natural killer zzso zzso were found to be involved in the zzso zzso zzso We also showed that the 2 pathways were functionally involved in the predictor gene set using a zzso zzso zzso of a single member of the predictor gene set triggered a focal zzso pathway, which zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, intensive inspection of the predictor gene set in terms of the 2 pathways suggested that some entries of the predictor gene set were implicated in zzso along with zzso transition zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we compared our zzso statistical model with a gene zzso statistical model, zzso Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso Our method showed better performance than zzso in the sense that our method was more consistent with a well-known zzso zzso zzso Thus, the biological suggestion generated by our zzso approach seems quite reasonable and warrants a further experimental study on zzso zzso in terms of zzso or zzso which is underscored in zzso and zzso
