When alpha factor binds to the zzso alpha factor zzso a signal is transmitted via a zzso G protein that prepares the cell for zzso As a result of alpha factor binding the zzso also zzso a regulated zzso and zzso Using cells that lack activity of this zzso G zzso we show that G zzso zzso signal zzso is not necessary for regulation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso the processes of signal zzso and down regulation can be zzso We propose that binding of alpha factor to its zzso results in a zzso zzso change that permits zzso zzso and interaction with the zzso zzso
