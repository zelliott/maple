We have shown previously that zzso zzso of zzso using the zzso analog zzso zzso failed to promote zzso zzso of zzso adult retinal zzso cells zzso into peripheral nerve zzso zzso but significantly zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso graft model, we now examine the mechanisms underlying spontaneous and zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso We found that blockade of the zzso zzso executor protein zzso A zzso using the zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect spontaneous survival and zzso zzso but essentially abolished the zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways such as zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso also blocked the zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and Western blots showed that zzso zzso and zzso almost completely inhibited zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso respectively, whereas zzso substantially decreased zzso signal zzso zzso injection of zzso resulted in a small zzso increase in zzso zzso alpha zzso expression in the zzso an effect that may facilitate zzso action on survival and zzso zzso Surprisingly, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso significantly enhanced spontaneous zzso survival, suggesting differential roles of these pathways in zzso survival under different zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso are a result of multiple zzso actions, with zzso as an essential zzso but that these pathways can function in an zzso manner under different zzso
