zzso analysis in zzso has led to the identification of several proteins that mediate zzso interactions controlling the fate and proliferation of zzso zzso These proteins are localized or enriched in the zzso and zzso junctions at the zzso end of the lateral zzso between zzso The proteins localized or enriched at zzso junctions include zzso which is important for the cell interactions controlling zzso and bristle zzso zzso and zzso which are required for the cell interaction that establishes the zzso zzso zzso and zzso required for the zzso cell interactions that control segment polarity and zzso disc zzso zzso localized at zzso junctions include the product of the tumor zzso gene zzso which is required for zzso junction formation, zzso zzso cell zzso and the cell interactions that control zzso The results suggest that the cell zzso events important for cell fate determination and for cell proliferation control in zzso occur at the zzso zzso The migration of the nucleus to the zzso surface of the zzso for zzso may enable it to interact directly with the zzso zzso zzso
