Human birth defects involving the zzso body wall are common, yet little is known about the mechanism of body wall closure in zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso mouse provides an exceptional tool to understand this particular pathology, since it has one of the most severe zzso body wall closure zzso zzso To gain insight into the complex zzso events responsible for body wall closure, we have studied this zzso process in zzso zzso zzso Several zzso involved in normal zzso body wall closure are defective in the absence of zzso including those associated with the primary body wall, the zzso ring, and the zzso of the secondary body zzso These zzso coupled with the expression pattern of zzso suggest that zzso is involved in multiple zzso mechanisms directing the zzso of the zzso body wall, including cell migration, zzso and zzso There is a failure of migration and fusion of the body folds at the zzso ring, as well as in the formation and migration of the abdominal bands and zzso zzso Furthermore, the mechanism of cell deposition at the zzso ring is zzso zzso the zzso compartment of the body wall is zzso We also suggest that zzso is required for signaling from the surface zzso to the underlying zzso for proper development and closure of the zzso body zzso These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how zzso functions in the closure of the zzso body wall, as well as offer insight into related human birth zzso
