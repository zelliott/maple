zzso zzso of the zzso family have been implicated in key biological zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso a zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were completely resistant to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sensitivity to death receptors was not altered, indicating a specific interference of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso restored sensitivity to drug-induced zzso and triggered zzso zzso c release and zzso zzso Further analysis identified that the zzso by zzso was independent of classical zzso of zzso zzso but essentially involved the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso was completely absent in zzso cells, while zzso of zzso zzso triggered zzso expression and zzso sensitivity to zzso associated with a zzso zzso change of zzso Furthermore, in zzso the truncated zzso of Bid specifically activated zzso and zzso c release only from zzso of zzso zzso These results do not only demonstrate a zzso role of zzso in drug resistance but also delineate a zzso unknown zzso of zzso zzso in regulation of zzso zzso
