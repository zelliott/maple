We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated in zzso restricted regions of the lateral zzso zzso following zzso fear conditioning and that blockade of zzso zzso in the LA zzso both fear memory consolidation and long-term zzso zzso in the amygdala, in zzso The present experiments evaluated the role of the zzso signaling cascade in zzso at zzso input zzso in zzso We first show that zzso is zzso zzso in the LA at 5 zzso but not 15 or 60 zzso after zzso but not zzso stimulation of the auditory zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso stimulation was zzso restricted to the same regions of the LA previously shown to exhibit zzso regulation following fear zzso We next show that zzso infusion of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso input zzso zzso results demonstrate that zzso zzso is necessary for synaptic plasticity in zzso defined regions of the zzso in zzso
