Multiple myeloma zzso is an incurable zzso zzso characterized by zzso of zzso plasma cells in the bone zzso and by zzso or persistent zzso zzso receptors zzso are essential in the host defense against zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso initiated responses in zzso cells including zzso zzso and immune zzso zzso cell lines gene transcription, cell cycle and protein expression were detected by zzso real-time zzso western zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso was used for measuring cell zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso for the detection of cell zzso We show that human myeloma cell lines expressed zzso zzso induced the proliferation and partially protected zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso appears to induce proliferation via zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment zzso myeloma cell zzso of zzso zzso and expression of zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso and helped myeloma cells to escape immune zzso Our results show that zzso are functional on myeloma tumor cells, and the zzso to these zzso have a functional role in affecting myeloma cell zzso survival, and response to chemotherapy and immune zzso
