zzso (target of zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to human, which functions as a fundamental controller of cell zzso The moderate clinical benefit of zzso in zzso therapy of many zzso favors the development of new zzso zzso Here we report a zzso flow zzso zzso screen using five zzso zzso clones that represent the zzso of four branches of the zzso signaling zzso in budding zzso Each zzso clone was zzso zzso and the zzso signal of each clone was measured simultaneously by flow zzso which allows rapid zzso of compounds that likely act through direct zzso of zzso or zzso signaling zzso A total of 255 compounds were confirmed in zzso analysis to alter zzso expression in one or more zzso To validate the concept of the zzso screen, we have characterized zzso zzso a small zzso most likely to act on zzso as it alters zzso expression in all five zzso clones in a manner analogous to that of zzso We have shown that zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell growth and that zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso with zzso of 150 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso analysis and zzso zzso collection screen further support the notion that zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar cellular zzso Together, these results indicate that the zzso has identified a potentially useful small zzso for further development of zzso zzso
