zzso zzso is a bone zzso zzso derived zzso with a wide spectrum of activities in different biological zzso It has been shown that zzso supports the growth of certain types of zzso and zzso cells, enhances zzso zzso responses, zzso with zzso in supporting zzso colony formation, acts zzso with zzso in zzso the zzso period of early zzso zzso the synthesis of acute phase zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso The human zzso zzso which is localized at zzso consists of five zzso and four zzso zzso zzso characterization has identified a 151 zzso protein as the potential zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso Because of the overlapping biological activities between zzso and zzso we compared the signal zzso pathways zzso by zzso or zzso in cell lines responsive to both zzso zzso from protein zzso zzso and immediate response gene expression suggest that there are zzso and divergent points along the signal zzso pathways zzso by zzso or zzso The zzso signal zzso zzso appears to be involved in the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso such as leukemia zzso factor, zzso M and zzso zzso factor have also been shown to zzso zzso as a signal zzso The significance of growth factor sharing common biological activities and signaling pathways will be zzso
