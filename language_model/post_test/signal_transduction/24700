The mechanism of action of zzso an zzso zzso was studied in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso affected both zzso zzso and zzso zzso A repeated treatment of zzso cells zzso a day, for 3 zzso with zzso zzso in a zzso manner, zzso zzso zzso This effect was also achieved after single addition of high zzso of zzso or 100 zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso zzso When repeatedly added to zzso cells, 17 zzso produced a marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso an effect which appeared significant only at a concentration of 1 zzso and which was accompanied by a reduced incorporation of zzso into membrane zzso A repeated treatment with zzso reduced zzso zzso as zzso This effect was observed also after a single addition of zzso but not following single or repeated treatment with 17 zzso The present data indicate the zzso as a direct and specific target for zzso and suggest that this compound may share zzso zzso mechanisms with other zzso hormones such as zzso and zzso
