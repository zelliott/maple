Mechanical stress rapidly zzso zzso expression in zzso which binds to zzso zzso gene promoter to enhance zzso zzso and zzso enhances zzso zzso Because bone zzso proteins zzso also stimulate zzso expression in zzso there is a possibility that zzso signaling is involved in the enhancement of zzso differentiation by mechanical zzso The present study was undertaken to clarify whether mechanical stress affects zzso zzso and if so, to zzso the role of zzso signaling in mechanical zzso enhancement of zzso gene zzso 

Mechanical loading by fluid zzso stress zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso primary zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppressed zzso gene zzso enhanced by zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso element zzso of zzso gene promoter and formed complex with zzso zzso via binding to the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso site revealed that both zzso and zzso sites were required for full zzso of zzso gene promoter by zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso signaling in response to mechanical stress, and that a zzso between zzso and zzso pathways zzso stimulates zzso gene zzso in response to mechanical zzso
