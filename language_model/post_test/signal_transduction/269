Pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is a significant disease process characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leading to increased right zzso zzso and ultimately progressing to right zzso dysfunction and often zzso zzso zzso of the pulmonary zzso is the hallmark of pulmonary hypertension and frequently leads to progressive functional decline in patients with zzso despite treatment with currently available zzso zzso of the zzso acid cascade play an important zzso role in the pulmonary zzso and zzso of pathways downstream of zzso acid plays a central role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso and inflammatory cells during zzso and plays a protective role in the zzso response to zzso We recently demonstrated that absence of zzso was zzso in a mouse model of zzso pulmonary zzso Exposure of zzso zzso mice to zzso resulted in severe pulmonary hypertension characterized by enhanced pulmonary vascular zzso and significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the lung after zzso zzso of zzso in zzso led to enhanced zzso of zzso after exposure to zzso which could be attenuated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that selective zzso of zzso may have zzso pulmonary vascular consequences in patients with zzso pulmonary hypertension or underlying zzso lung zzso Here, we discuss our recent data demonstrating the adverse consequences of zzso zzso on pulmonary vascular zzso and zzso zzso
