The dwarf zzso zzso zzso of zzso display zzso leaves that are zzso rolled zzso and show reduced expansion along the zzso zzso We have previously determined that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that zzso in the signaling pathways of zzso and zzso Here, we describe four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whose zzso display zzso rotation of several zzso in addition to other zzso traits shared with zzso zzso Following a zzso strategy, we identified the zzso zzso which was found to zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso protein family, whose zzso in zzso are involved in cell signaling and protein zzso zzso and double zzso analyses suggest that zzso is required for growth and development and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
