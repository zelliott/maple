zzso with zzso requires expression of zzso and the zzso receptors zzso or zzso at the target cell zzso zzso of these receptors by the zzso envelope zzso is essential for membrane fusion, but may additionally activate zzso signaling zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso envelope zzso from both zzso and zzso strains rapidly induce zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso The response requires zzso and zzso to be accessible on the cell zzso The results presented here provide the first evidence for zzso of an zzso signaling event that can initiate multiple signaling pathways as a consequence of contact between zzso and zzso zzso
