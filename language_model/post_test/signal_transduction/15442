zzso is a dietary zzso which has been shown to inhibit lens zzso in a number of models of zzso The objectives of this study were to determine gene expression changes in human lens zzso cells in response to zzso and to investigate in detail the mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso (10 zzso and changes in gene expression were measured by zzso It was found that zzso of the genes with increased expression were regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 and 30 zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso protein zzso zzso (30 zzso was also responsible for a rapid and long-lasting zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso was confirmed by zzso which showed zzso of the zzso regulated genes EPO, zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of medium taken from zzso cells showed a sustained zzso increase in zzso zzso following zzso zzso The zzso increase and nuclear zzso of zzso was reversed by addition of excess iron zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso in human lens zzso zzso
