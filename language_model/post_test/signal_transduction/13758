zzso zzso has been implicated during zzso development in zzso and in the differentiation of zzso cells from zzso cells in zzso However interpretation of data from many of these studies has been complicated by the zzso nature of cell populations under study and by the fact that the zzso zzso is active during zzso prior to the development of the zzso zzso To define the role of zzso zzso in more precise cell populations during the early stages of zzso development within the zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso on a zzso cell line derived from this region of the zzso Our zzso system had no effect on the production of zzso zzso zzso cells but promoted their subsequent zzso zzso We assessed the role of zzso zzso on zzso differentiation of isolated zzso zzso zzso activity is dynamic and drops to zzso levels as zzso cells commit to a zzso zzso Further reduction of zzso activity by the zzso expression of dominant negative zzso had no functional zzso In contrast, induction of zzso activity using an zzso zzso expression system had an zzso effect on zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso strategy zzso zzso cells were marked with the zzso zzso and observed a reduction in the number of zzso and zzso colonies derived from zzso compared to zzso zzso cells isolated from the same zzso We believe that our culture system represents a good model for zzso development within the zzso zzso and our data suggest that zzso commitment of zzso cells in this setting occurs when zzso activity is below a specific zzso
