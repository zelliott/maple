It has been revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling enhances the expression of Down syndrome critical region 1 zzso known to be duplicated in Down syndrome, and suppresses tumor zzso in in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate whether gene expression of zzso signaling system is correlated with that of zzso and consequently affect prognosis of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction in 102 zzso zzso cancer surgical zzso 

Patients were zzso into two groups having low and high expressions by using the median value as the zzso A good agreement was noticed between zzso and zzso gene expression levels zzso zzso zzso however, the gene expression of zzso signaling system was not significantly correlated with that of zzso By zzso Cox zzso analysis, the prognosis of the patients with low zzso and low zzso gene expression was significantly worse than that of those with high zzso and high zzso gene zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso Combination of zzso and zzso gene expression also had significant impact on patient prognosis zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso gene expressions did not significantly affect the zzso 

The precise mechanism of zzso zzso signaling for suppression of the invasive zzso in zzso especially in zzso zzso cancer, is still zzso Genes such as zzso that are duplicated in Down syndrome might not play an important role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso
