Technical limitations have prevented zzso analyses of events occurring less than 30 s after signal zzso We developed an zzso continuous zzso system allowing quantitative zzso assessment of very early cellular signaling events zzso with a time resolution of 1 zzso Using this technique, we determined that zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso occurs within 1 s after zzso stimulation and is followed rapidly by zzso of the downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein and zzso C gamma zzso
