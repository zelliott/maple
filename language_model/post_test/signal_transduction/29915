zzso is a short chain, zzso zzso zzso that shares some biological function with zzso One striking difference between zzso and zzso is the ability of zzso to express zzso on their cell surface after zzso In the current study we have investigated the ability of human zzso cell surface zzso to participate in reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as a surrogate zzso for surface zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso induced zzso zzso that required the activity of small zzso zzso zzso signals through surface zzso activated the zzso zzso In addition, engagement of cell surface zzso was found to activate a number of signaling zzso including both zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso and resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso production required zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, the current study has established that cell surface zzso is more than just a zzso it can function as a zzso and participate in reverse signaling that results in cellular zzso and production of inflammatory zzso
