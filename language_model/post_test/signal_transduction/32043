zzso zzso are zzso of the red (R zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso light, and they control a wide range of responses affecting crucial aspects of plant zzso There are five genes zzso zzso for zzso of different but overlapping zzso One of these, zzso has the unique function controlling specific responses in high zzso zzso as well as in very weak zzso zzso zzso functioning requires not only the zzso of zzso but also the proper nuclear zzso and degradation of zzso Recently, we identified and described a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which showed reduced binding affinity to zzso the proteins regulating its nuclear zzso resulting in impaired nuclear zzso and altered signaling under certain zzso We present here a hypothesis to explain how the identified zzso acid substitution may lead to structural changes zzso as altered signaling and zzso displayed by the zzso zzso
