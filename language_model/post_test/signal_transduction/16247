zzso III zzso promotes the formation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A zzso contributes to the synthesis of zzso which helps regulate zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and role of zzso in human zzso zzso We used zzso analysis to examine 87 zzso tumors, and we identified correlations between zzso expression and zzso factors, including patient zzso zzso of zzso zzso on cell behavior and signaling were studied in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso in zzso tumors correlated with a favorable zzso profile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and early clinical staging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was a favorable zzso factor for survival as evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells suppressed cell zzso colony formation, migration, and zzso Moreover, zzso increased the zzso modification of zzso zzso leading to decreased zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppression of cell migration and invasion were substantially reversed by zzso expression of zzso active zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso predicts a favorable prognosis for zzso and suppresses the zzso zzso via decreasing zzso zzso zzso
