zzso hypertension in zzso is zzso in part by increased zzso resistance, reflecting an increased sensitivity of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is essential for contraction of vascular smooth zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso zzso regulation of the zzso vascular tone in zzso zzso 

zzso was induced by zzso duct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions were studied by real time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in rat and human zzso was assessed as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso pressure was measured in zzso zzso at constant zzso The in zzso effect of intravenous application of zzso was studied by zzso zzso 

zzso expressions of zzso and zzso were increased at zzso and protein level in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in zzso from zzso rats and patients with alcohol induced zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso pressure of in zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats but not in sham operated zzso zzso reduced the sensitivity to zzso in isolated zzso zzso in sham operated rats more than in zzso zzso In zzso zzso reduced portal pressure to a greater extent in zzso rats than in sham operated zzso zzso vascular resistance was decreased in response to zzso injection of zzso in zzso rats but not in sham operated zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso contributes to increased zzso resistance in zzso rats and to an increased sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso
