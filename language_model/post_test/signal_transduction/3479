zzso of invasive zzso involves the deregulation of molecular signaling pathways that results in the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso enrichment analysis allows for the identification of zzso pathways from zzso scale expression zzso Given the importance of zzso regulatory mechanisms on protein expression and function, identification of zzso pathways on the basis of protein expression data is likely to provide new zzso In this study, we have developed methods for zzso mass zzso in a large number of samples and applied these methods toward identification and zzso of protein expression in samples of zzso zzso zzso benign breast zzso and normal adjacent zzso We identified 265 proteins with differential expression patterns in zzso zzso zzso relative to benign zzso or normal breast zzso Analysis of the zzso expressed proteins indicated the deregulation of signaling pathways related to zzso invasion and zzso and immune zzso Our approach provides complementary information to gene expression zzso data and identifies a number of zzso molecular signaling pathways indicative of breast cancer progression that may enable more accurate, biologically relevant diagnoses and provide a stepping stone to personalized zzso
