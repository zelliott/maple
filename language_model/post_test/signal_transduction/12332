The zzso energy state, defined by zzso zzso levels, couples zzso pathways with energy zzso This zzso is fundamental in the zzso response to many conditions and is impaired in zzso zzso We have found that the zzso energy state is substantially reduced following exercise, zzso and exposure to other zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling was hypothesized to mediate this reduction because increased plasma levels of zzso are characteristic of zzso stress and because this hormone stimulates energy consumption linked to increased zzso flux through zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso We developed what we believe to be a novel zzso clamp to isolate an zzso in zzso levels while maintaining zzso zzso and zzso zzso stress and a zzso rise in zzso lowered the zzso energy state and amplified zzso protein zzso signaling in control mice, but these changes were abolished in zzso zzso zzso mice and mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, which do not mount a zzso response to zzso displayed an increased zzso energy state compared with zzso mice in which zzso was zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate in zzso that the zzso energy state is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and requires zzso thus providing new insights into liver zzso
