Cellular signaling networks are complex and appear to include many zzso zzso Recently, it was suggested that zzso interactions of proteins cause signaling noise, which, perhaps, shapes the signal zzso zzso However, the conditions under which molecular noise influences cellular information processing remain zzso Here, we explore a large number of simple biological models of varying network sizes to understand the architectural conditions under which the interactions of signaling proteins can exhibit specific zzso zzso zzso zzso which the average behavior of a biological system is substantially altered in the presence of molecular zzso We find that a small fraction of these networks does exhibit zzso effects and shares a common architectural feature whereas most of the networks show only insignificant levels of zzso Interestingly, addition of seemingly zzso interactions into protein networks gives rise to zzso zzso
