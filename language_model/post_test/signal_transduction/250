zzso zzso promoted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso C zzso stimulation of the small zzso zzso 

To analyze the mechanism of zzso zzso downstream of zzso that is required for regulation of zzso and zzso 

Human and zzso zzso were allowed to adhere to immobilized type I zzso collagen through zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso binding were measured and zzso 

zzso zzso recruitment induced an evident zzso zzso that was zzso with robust zzso zzso of zzso and was suppressed in zzso from zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were unable to accumulate active zzso and to activate zzso upon zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso completely prevented zzso zzso of zzso in adherent zzso but did not affect its zzso and both zzso and zzso stimulation occurred zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as well as zzso of active zzso were totally suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment triggered the zzso zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was not required for zzso zzso However, when zzso of zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso prevention of zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and the zzso zzso mediate independent pathways for zzso zzso downstream of zzso
