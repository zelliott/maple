The zzso nucleus is now widely accepted as playing a vital role in maintaining long-term changes in synaptic zzso To act, however, the nucleus must be appropriately relayed with information regarding the latest round of synaptic zzso Several constraints of doing so in a zzso pertain to the often significant spatial distance of zzso from the nucleus and the number of zzso required for such a signal to reach functional levels in the zzso Largely based on the sensitivity of zzso responses to zzso zzso antagonists, it has been zzso that the signals are physically relayed by zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso a second, less often considered but equally viable method of signal zzso may be initiated by action zzso generated zzso to the nucleus, zzso the signal can be relayed directly by calcium or indirectly by zzso second zzso We consider action zzso signaling to the nucleus to have its own zzso advantages over the zzso signal for some zzso This zzso summarizes the logic and experimental support for these two modes of signaling and attempts to validate the action potential model as playing an important role in zzso regulation relating specifically to long-term synaptic zzso
