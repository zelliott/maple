zzso growth factors zzso have been shown to control formation and differentiation of multiple organ systems in the developing zzso zzso The analysis of differential gene expression during zzso is, therefore, a potent tool to identify novel target genes regulated by zzso zzso Here, we have applied zzso analysis to identify zzso regulated genes in zzso zzso mouse zzso Surprisingly, transcripts corresponding to zzso receptors zzso which so far have been only detected in the zzso organ zzso were found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in the developing zzso pit and the zzso of the zzso Interestingly, several zzso can be detected in the developing zzso pit during mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of members of the zzso family and their receptors during zzso zzso zzso zzso 100, zzso zzso zzso may thus control expression of zzso in the zzso pit and formation of the zzso Moreover, zzso expression was detected in unexpected locations within the developing zzso including zzso zzso root zzso and neural zzso The relevance of zzso expression in these structures and for formation of the zzso is zzso
