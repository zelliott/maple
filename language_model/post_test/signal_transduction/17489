zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso are neural crest zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells are located adjacent to zzso zzso cells within the basement membrane of zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso serves an zzso zzso function in the zzso and that F cells are its zzso This proposal was tested by using cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and F zzso cells to study the mechanisms that mediate the zzso and action of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso cells was evoked by zzso stimulating hormone, zzso zzso elevated zzso calcium zzso zzso or by agents that increase zzso zzso zzso zzso When protein zzso C zzso was zzso by prolonged treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso was zzso however, interference with zzso function did not affect zzso zzso evoked by increases zzso or increases zzso In the putative targets, zzso cells, zzso increased the turnover of zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso increases zzso and zzso modified the effect of zzso on zzso All of these zzso effects were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by zzso toxin zzso suggesting that the actions of zzso are zzso by zzso zzso which are coupled to a G zzso This suggestion was supported by the following additional zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which recognize zzso zzso zzso binding was inhibited by zzso zzso and the zzso were displaced by zzso Data are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso serves as a zzso to F cell zzso
