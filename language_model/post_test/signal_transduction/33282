Here we describe a new segment polarity gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a dominant zzso of Bar zzso zzso is also zzso embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso show variable substitution of naked zzso with zzso These patterns are distinctly similar to those of zzso zzso and wingless zzso zzso which indicates that zzso functions in determining embryonic segment zzso Evidence that zzso function is involved in zzso signal zzso during zzso is provided by its genetic interactions with the segment polarity genes patched zzso and fused zzso Furthermore, zzso is a dominant zzso of the zzso embryonic lethal zzso suggesting a close and zzso relationship between zzso and zzso in zzso signal zzso zzso function is also required in zzso zzso The zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso zzso but not zzso expression in the eye zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso enhances the zzso wing zzso in a dominant zzso Based upon the interactions of zzso with zzso zzso and fu, we propose that the zzso gene plays important roles in zzso signal zzso
