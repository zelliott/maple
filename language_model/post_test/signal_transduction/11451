Here, we show that zzso growth zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso small cell lung cancer zzso zzso However, the optimal response to zzso was obtained at zzso lower zzso in zzso zzso This correlated with the selective zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso with zzso blocked zzso proliferation in zzso cells zzso Similarly, zzso protein zzso zzso 2 zzso a recently identified zzso of zzso was activated by zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso This zzso was independent of zzso zzso but was sensitive to zzso of the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a novel downstream target of zzso The potency of zzso in zzso cells might reflect this additional zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was activated in both zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso target of zzso with 10 zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and proliferation of both zzso However, even at 100 zzso zzso only partially inhibited zzso zzso this correlated with zzso of zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso and possibly zzso are involved in zzso zzso cell growth, a notion supported by the zzso and higher baseline activity of both zzso in zzso lines, as compared to normal human zzso zzso
