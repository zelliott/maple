zzso is a cell suicide mechanism that enables zzso organisms to maintain zzso and to eliminate individual cells that threaten the zzso zzso zzso on the type of zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso or intrinsic zzso The comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso signaling allows for development of mathematical models, aiming to zzso zzso and systems properties of zzso signaling zzso There have been extensive efforts in modeling deterministic zzso network accounting for average behavior of a population of zzso Cellular networks, however, are inherently zzso and significant zzso zzso in zzso response has been observed at single cell zzso 

To address the inevitable randomness in the intrinsic zzso zzso we develop a theoretical and zzso modeling framework of intrinsic zzso zzso at zzso level, accounting for both deterministic and zzso zzso Our deterministic model, adapted from the zzso zzso model, shows that an additional positive feedback between the executioner zzso and the zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in yielding the desired property of zzso We then examine the impact of intrinsic fluctuations of zzso zzso viewed as intrinsic noise, and natural variation of protein zzso viewed as zzso noise, on behavior of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso output at varying input levels show that the intrinsic noise could elicit a wider region of zzso over that of the deterministic zzso However, the system zzso due to intrinsic zzso such as the noise of zzso response and the randomness of response zzso shows that the intrinsic noise in general is insufficient to produce significant zzso variations at zzso relevant level of molecular zzso Furthermore, the zzso noise represented by random variations of two key zzso zzso namely zzso C and inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso is modeled separately or in combination with intrinsic zzso The zzso zzso in the timing of intrinsic zzso response shows that the fluctuating protein variations can induce zzso zzso zzso at a quantitative level agreeing with zzso Finally, simulations illustrate that the mean abundance of fluctuating zzso protein is positively correlated with the degree of cellular zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso 

Our theoretical and zzso study shows that the pronounced zzso zzso in intrinsic zzso responses among individual cells zzso arises from zzso rather than intrinsic origin of zzso In addition, it predicts that the zzso protein could serve as a potential therapeutic target for suppression of the zzso variation in the intrinsic zzso zzso
