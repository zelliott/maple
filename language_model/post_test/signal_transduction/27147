The zzso beta R fusion protein is the product of the zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso zzso The zzso beta R is an unusual fusion of a putative zzso factor, zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso domain, to the zzso and zzso domain of the zzso beta zzso We hypothesized that zzso beta R zzso zzso by the zzso domain of zzso would lead to zzso zzso of the zzso beta R zzso zzso domain and cellular zzso Analysis of in zzso zzso zzso beta R confirmed that the protein zzso and that zzso was zzso by deletion of 51 zzso within the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso beta R was detected as a zzso protein that was zzso zzso on zzso and transformed the zzso zzso cell line zzso to zzso 3 growth factor zzso Transformation of zzso cells required the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso activity of the zzso beta R portion of the fusion zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso beta R associated with multiple signaling molecules known to associate with the activated zzso beta zzso including zzso C gamma 1, zzso and zzso zzso beta R is a novel transforming protein that zzso and activates zzso beta zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso beta R that is dependent on the zzso zzso domain provides further evidence that the zzso domain, highly zzso among zzso family members, is a zzso zzso
