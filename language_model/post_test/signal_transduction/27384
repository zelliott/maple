zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic beta cells and stimulate insulin zzso in the presence of zzso zzso occurs through at least two distinct zzso zzso closure of zzso zzso channels, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso Under zzso conditions the zzso carry a predominantly zzso zzso The current may also have a zzso zzso but this remains to be zzso Acting together, these two signaling systems reinforce each other and serve to promote membrane zzso a rise of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso in beta cells are zzso regulated by zzso zzso and zzso In view of this dual regulation, it appears likely that zzso channel zzso results from signaling events occurring not only at the plasma membrane zzso of channels by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso but also at zzso sites zzso of calcium stores by an as yet to be determined zzso It is noteworthy that zzso of zzso has also been reported following stimulation of zzso with zzso or after depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso the possibility arises that zzso zzso and zzso all act on the same types of zzso channels in these cells, and that these channels are sensitive to zzso in the content of zzso zzso zzso 6 summarizes our current knowledge concerning the properties of the zzso and zzso signaling systems as they pertain to the regulation of zzso and zzso calcium zzso in the beta zzso Given that zzso and zzso are proven to be exceptionally potent insulin zzso it is of considerable interest to determine their usefulness as blood zzso zzso zzso evaluations of the therapeutic effectiveness of zzso indicate a role for this zzso in the treatment of zzso and also possibly zzso diabetes zzso zzso A very attractive feature of such a strategy is the demonstrated lack of zzso side effects attendant to administration of zzso to diabetic zzso These observations reinforce the notion that peptides of the zzso family represent important pharmacological tools for use in experimental zzso
