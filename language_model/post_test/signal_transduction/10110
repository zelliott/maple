zzso zzso is an approximately 280 zzso protein having tumor zzso function, presumably by virtue of its zzso zzso domain, but little is known regarding molecular aspects of its zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates diverse signaling molecules and has itself been implicated as a tumor zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso scaffolding domain and zzso with zzso Analysis of zzso primary structure reveals four potential zzso binding zzso and interestingly, in individuals with zzso I, zzso zzso occur with high frequency in 3 of the 4 putative zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso thereby affecting zzso zzso moreover, zzso effects on signaling are altered when zzso zzso and zzso are disrupted by cholesterol zzso These novel findings provide insight into possible signaling mechanisms of zzso and suggest that together zzso and zzso may zzso regulate cell growth and zzso
