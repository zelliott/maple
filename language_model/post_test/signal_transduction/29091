The formation of a complex between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso is one of the first documented cases of a direct interaction between a small zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso studies have begun to zzso the role of this interaction for the signal zzso mechanism of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso surface that contacts the zzso zzso binding domain of zzso by solution zzso zzso confirms the zzso domain as a zzso zzso zzso zzso neighboring the zzso switch I and II regions are also involved in the interaction and there is considerable interest to examine the changes in protein dynamics that take place upon complex zzso Here we present zzso zzso relaxation zzso for the zzso proteins as well as for the zzso zzso binding domain and zzso proteins in their zzso zzso zzso order zzso zzso show that considerable motions are maintained in the bound state of zzso In fact, some of the changes in zzso on binding appear zzso exhibiting decreased as well as increased zzso zzso in zzso already a largely rigid protein on the zzso zzso are overall diminished, but zzso dynamics in the switch I and II regions of the zzso are retained in the complex and appear to be zzso to the bound zzso zzso zzso fluctuations in the zzso are attenuated at sites, including zzso zzso (the zzso insert zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso distant from the interaction region with zzso This effect of binding on long-range dynamics appears to be communicated by hinge sites and by subtle zzso changes in the zzso Similar to recent studies on other systems, we suggest that zzso protein features are affected by zzso zzso zzso protein fluctuations are likely to prime the zzso zzso complex for interactions with additional binding zzso
