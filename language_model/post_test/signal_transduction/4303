We show here that the zzso response element zzso in the bacterial zzso promoter can also function as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Fusion of ORE to an zzso zzso promoter driving zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso to expression of the cat gene in mouse zzso zzso zzso Nuclear extracts from these cells contain zzso proteins that specifically interact with ORE DNA, cannot be completed by zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso B, and are zzso zzso since treatment with zzso causes no zzso changes in binding activity or zzso zzso zzso zzso clones that express zzso proteins were isolated from a mouse zzso expression library and found to be representatives of two different members of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and ORE zzso compete with each other for binding to zzso proteins in gel shift zzso and zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and ORE zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso abolish induction of zzso cat expression by zzso and zzso reporter zzso containing zzso or the zzso from the human zzso class II zzso zzso exhibit identical zzso zzso zzso which can be abolished by addition of zzso to the culture zzso These results suggest that the zzso proteins may be an integral component of a zzso zzso signaling zzso
