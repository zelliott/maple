In the zzso visual zzso the transient zzso potential zzso calcium channel, zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso comprise a zzso signaling complex via their interaction with the scaffold protein zzso Previously, we showed that the interaction between zzso and zzso is a prerequisite for zzso of a light response, suggesting zzso zzso proteins in the zzso To identify zzso of zzso we zzso the complex from head zzso using zzso zzso and performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso zzso missing zzso displayed no zzso of zzso or zzso We also investigated protein zzso that may be involved in the zzso of proteins in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was partially suppressed by the protein zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and protein zzso zzso These zzso activities were enriched in the zzso of zzso heads, but drastically reduced in extracts prepared from glass zzso which lack zzso Our findings indicate that zzso functions as zzso zzso for activated zzso allowing zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso
