The origin, roles and fate of zzso cells forming zzso zzso during limb zzso remain largely zzso Here we produced prenatal and zzso genetic cell zzso by mating zzso mice with mice expressing zzso at prospective joint sites under the control of zzso regulatory sequences zzso zzso cells initially constituted the zzso a compact zzso structure representing the first overt sign of joint formation, and displayed a zzso distribution along the zzso zzso The cells expressed genes such as zzso zzso and collagen zzso remained zzso in the zzso sites over time, gave rise to zzso cartilage, zzso lining and other joint zzso but contributed little if any to underlying growth plate cartilage and zzso To study their zzso properties more directly, we isolated the zzso cells from prospective zzso joint sites using a novel zzso procedure and tested them in zzso The cells displayed a propensity to undergo zzso that was enhanced by treatment with zzso zzso but blocked by zzso zzso To test roles for such zzso zzso capacity in zzso we created conditional zzso deficient in zzso signaling using zzso or zzso zzso zzso did form in both zzso however, the zzso displayed a defective flat cell layer normally abutting the zzso cavity and expressed markedly reduced levels of zzso In sum, our data indicate that cells present at prospective joint sites and expressing zzso constitute a distinct cohort of zzso cells responsible for limb joint zzso The cells appear to be patterned along specific limb symmetry axes and rely on local signaling tools to make distinct contributions to joint zzso
