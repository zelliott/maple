It is well known that zzso zzso and zzso zzso can induce zzso although some cancer cells are resistant to their zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate the survival signal and allow the cells to escape from zzso in various human zzso Thus, we zzso that zzso a zzso K zzso should zzso zzso consequently zzso cell proliferation and increase zzso in the human gastric zzso cell line, zzso Previously, we reported that zzso was resistant against the zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso in zzso zzso caused a decrease of zzso and an zzso of cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase by zzso zzso but there was no obvious induction of zzso The simultaneous treatment of zzso and zzso significantly induced zzso confirmed by zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment led to a zzso of zzso and zzso Bad zzso which are zzso factors and belong to the zzso zzso On the other hand, expression levels of the other zzso factors, such as zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso which are associated with the zzso zzso signal pathway, did not change after zzso zzso We concluded that: 1) the zzso zzso plays an important role in preventing zzso zzso and 2) a zzso K zzso such as zzso might be a useful zzso agent for gastric zzso
