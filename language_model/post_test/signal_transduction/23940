Plant defenses against pathogens and insects are regulated zzso by zzso signal zzso pathways in which salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso play key zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso plants unable to accumulate zzso produced zzso higher levels of zzso and showed enhanced expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in response to infection by zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso indicating that in zzso plants, zzso zzso zzso is associated with the suppression of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso which is impaired in zzso signal zzso revealed that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso signaling requires the regulatory protein zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso which is essential for zzso defense gene zzso is not required for the suppression of zzso zzso indicating that zzso between zzso and zzso is modulated through a novel function of zzso in the zzso
