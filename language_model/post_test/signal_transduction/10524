In zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delay and lifespan zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cooperate during conditions of reduced zzso zzso to establish cell cycle zzso in the zzso stem cell population, in addition to zzso zzso The zzso of either protein causes zzso zzso proliferation during zzso zzso development, whereas the loss of zzso zzso zzso arrest from lifespan zzso zzso zzso activity also triggers zzso zzso independent of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that these two zzso pathways zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso to coordinate zzso proliferation with zzso development during zzso formation, via the regulation of zzso and its upstream zzso zzso rather than through the zzso zzso zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso in zzso family members, zzso or zzso result in related zzso zzso Our findings establish a zzso relationship that may underscore their shared, characteristic zzso
