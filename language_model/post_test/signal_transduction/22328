zzso environmental conditions is an essential aspect of bacterial physiology and zzso In zzso zzso the zzso agent of anthrax, zzso of the two major zzso factors, toxin and zzso is triggered by zzso a major compound in the zzso zzso Here it is shown that zzso is an additional signaling zzso recognized by zzso zzso for toxin zzso The presence of zzso increased the expression of the protective zzso toxin zzso gene zzso by stimulating induction of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso required the carbon zzso protein zzso via an indirect zzso zzso did not bind specifically to any region of the extended zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso strain from which the zzso gene was deleted was significantly attenuated in a mouse model of zzso The data demonstrated that zzso is an important host zzso signaling zzso and that zzso is a molecular link between environmental sensing and zzso zzso zzso
