zzso zzso zzso are among the most commonly used viral zzso in gene therapy clinical zzso However, the application of Ad zzso has been limited to local injection in many cases, because the systemic administration of Ad zzso triggers innate immune responses such as inflammatory zzso production and tissue zzso To overcome this zzso it will be necessary to develop safer Ad zzso less likely to induce the innate immune zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Ad zzso zzso reduces the innate immune response induced by Ad zzso zzso a zzso cell line that zzso expresses zzso was shown to produce lower levels of inflammatory zzso after the zzso of Ad zzso The systemic administration of zzso into mice zzso the reduced production of inflammatory zzso as compared with that zzso by control Ad zzso zzso zzso Ad zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso with zzso attenuated inflammatory zzso production and liver toxicity as compared with injection with zzso alone, and this was achieved without the suppression of zzso production in various zzso The zzso zzso was involved in Ad zzso zzso production, which was impaired by the zzso of zzso These findings indicate that zzso could be useful for reducing Ad zzso innate zzso
