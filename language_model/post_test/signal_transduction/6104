zzso is unique among zzso growth factors because it zzso zzso barrier zzso zzso we considered whether this property of zzso might contribute to tumor cell zzso and zzso To test this, mice lacking the zzso family zzso zzso or Yes, which maintain zzso barrier function in the presence of zzso were injected zzso with zzso tumor zzso We found a dramatic reduction in tumor cell zzso in lungs or zzso of mice lacking zzso or zzso At the molecular level, zzso compromises the zzso barrier by zzso a zzso complex in lung zzso from zzso but not zzso zzso zzso the zzso barrier directly with zzso both zzso zzso in normal mice and overcomes the genetic resistance in zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso barrier function and suppresses tumor cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling preserves host zzso barrier function providing a novel zzso approach to control zzso zzso
