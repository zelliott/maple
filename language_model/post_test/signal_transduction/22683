zzso are a highly zzso family of proteins first identified as zzso genes in early onset familial Alzheimer's zzso Recent studies have suggested a role for zzso in the zzso pathway, but their specific function within this zzso remains zzso Here, we have characterized the zzso zzso gene and protein and studied their interaction with zzso in both zzso and zzso We find that the zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso and broadly expressed during development with the highest levels in zzso within the zzso zzso We also show that zzso in zzso zzso zzso genetically interact with zzso and result in an early zzso zzso characterized by defects in eye and wing development and incomplete zzso differentiation within the zzso zzso Moreover, we find that processing of zzso in the zzso by the zzso zzso is unaffected in zzso zzso and that zzso is present and may even accumulate on the plasma membrane of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso causes zzso to accumulate in the zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso is required for proper zzso differentiation and may regulate the zzso zzso of zzso proteins within cells, necessary for their zzso and subsequent signaling zzso
