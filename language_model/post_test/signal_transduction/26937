zzso zzso region 2 zzso zzso are present in many proteins involved in signal zzso In zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso domain has been implicated in regulation of zzso zzso activity and in zzso interactions involved in downstream zzso Different zzso zzso exhibit distinct binding zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso We show that different zzso zzso are not functionally equivalent within the context of the zzso zzso zzso altered by replacement of its zzso domain with the zzso zzso domain of Ras zzso zzso exhibited activated transforming zzso caused zzso zzso zzso of zzso and was zzso from nucleus to zzso This en bloc substitution apparently zzso two distinct functions of the zzso domain so that zzso escapes normal regulatory control while it retains the capability to elicit signals that promote zzso The zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso zzso which shares high zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso was less effective in zzso the zzso potential of zzso The effects that the zzso zzso domain of Ras zzso protein has in the context of zzso resemble the effects of deleting the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso zzso may have coordinate roles as regulatory control elements within the context of zzso
