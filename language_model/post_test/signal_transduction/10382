zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso well known for generating zzso has been demonstrated to induce zzso zzso zzso gene expression and protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, exactly how zzso zzso its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is zzso This study investigated the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to induce zzso expression in rat kidney zzso zzso zzso indicating that the actions of zzso are independent of its zzso zzso zzso bound to the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and this binding was competitively zzso by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso In mouse embryonic zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced rapid zzso zzso on the beta zzso of zzso which was followed by the zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor abolished zzso induction by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso induced in the zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that besides its classical zzso activity, zzso acts as a zzso that binds to the cell membrane zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso and triggers zzso signal zzso thereby inducing specific gene expression in zzso zzso zzso
