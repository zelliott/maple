The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cascade as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso have both been associated with zzso zzso We observed that the specific zzso of the zzso protein zzso either a chemical inhibitor or a zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso activity and zzso toxicity in several zzso cell lines, including primary cortical zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso results in the zzso of the zzso protein and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso - bearing a targeted substitution within a putative zzso consensus motif - is neither active nor zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not associate with zzso and is both very active and very zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or Ala does not affect the zzso activity of the corresponding zzso zzso These combined in zzso data strongly suggest a direct zzso zzso of zzso zzso Based on published zzso this zzso means of selectively regulating zzso function could provide for an zzso response to zzso stress associated with disorders as diverse as depression, zzso and the early stages of Alzheimer's zzso
