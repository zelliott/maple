The barrier function of the zzso is controlled by the second zzso zzso and zzso that zzso regulate the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso has been demonstrated to increase zzso zzso and to decrease zzso levels as detected via zzso zzso To study the effects of zzso on zzso with high zzso resolution, we zzso the zzso zzso sensor zzso in single intact human zzso vein zzso cells zzso In these cells, zzso induced a delayed increase in zzso initiating after about 40 zzso with maximum zzso levels after 130 s of zzso zzso This increase of zzso levels was zzso but did not require zzso zzso zzso approaches revealed that zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso synthesis of zzso was required for the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso increase in zzso We conclude that zzso causes the synthesis of zzso in zzso cells and that the subsequent stimulation of zzso zzso receptors then results in an increase in zzso
