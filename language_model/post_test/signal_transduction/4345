zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have been proposed to play roles in pattern formation based on their distribution during embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) are zzso zzso highly expressed in the chicken embryonic zzso To assess their potential roles in the development of the visual pathway, we examined their distribution by zzso zzso zzso is expressed throughout the zzso of the retinal zzso cell zzso including the nerve fiber layer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stratum zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is highly concentrated in only a portion of the zzso nerve and zzso zzso and in retinal cultures, zzso is detected in zzso This prompted us to examine the regional distribution of zzso in the developing zzso and led to the observation that zzso is most concentrated in the zzso zzso zzso established that the differential regulation of zzso expression in different portions of the zzso occurs at the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this unusual expression pattern is distinctive for zzso as three other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are evenly expressed across the zzso axis of the zzso Both zzso and zzso are distributed in manners which are consistent with their regulating the outgrowth of retinal zzso cell zzso to the zzso Furthermore, zzso represents the first signal zzso zzso found to exhibit the polarized pattern of expression predicted for proteins that control the specificity of the zzso zzso
