zzso unrelated neural zzso in zzso and zzso zzso have been proposed to function by binding to zzso or zzso respectively, and preventing these zzso signals from zzso their zzso In this study, we investigate the functions of various forms of the zzso zzso protein using the discriminating zzso of zzso wing zzso We find that zzso of zzso zzso or its zzso counterpart zzso generates a very limited zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is very similar to that of viable zzso of zzso boat zzso which encodes a zzso family zzso zzso with zzso selectively interfering with zzso zzso zzso can block the effect of zzso zzso but not zzso in the zzso In contrast to the limited zzso zzso activity of zzso we have identified zzso forms of zzso referred to as zzso which when zzso cause a broad range of zzso zzso zzso In line with its zzso effects, zzso can block the effects of both zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, acts as a general inhibitor of zzso zzso which can interfere with the effect of zzso zzso but not zzso We present evidence that zzso processing occurs in zzso and is biologically zzso zzso of intact zzso in zzso and adult wing zzso leads to the zzso regulated processing of zzso This in zzso processing of zzso can be duplicated in zzso by treating zzso with a combination of the zzso zzso zzso plus Twisted zzso zzso another zzso factor involved in zzso zzso In zzso with this result, zzso of intact zzso and zzso in developing wings generates a zzso very similar to that of zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso functions in the zzso to generate a zzso activity, since zzso can partially rescue zzso zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit similar zzso patterning defects during early zzso These results indicate that differential processing of zzso generates a novel zzso zzso activity during development and, more generally, that zzso zzso play distinct roles in regulating the quality as well as the magnitude of zzso zzso
