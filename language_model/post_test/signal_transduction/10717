Immediate early gene zzso upon zzso zzso occurs through the serum response element zzso which makes the zzso of the upstream pathways a powerful means to engineer cellular zzso The malfunctioning of this system leads to a variety of disorders, ranging from neurological disorders such as zzso syndrome zzso zzso to cancer zzso zzso We therefore investigated the zzso zzso mechanism in a typical zzso zzso zzso signaling uses the zzso protein zzso zzso module through increased binding of the zzso complex factor zzso such as zzso to the promoter DNA (the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso as well as through zzso of a zzso zzso such as the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso model uses the zzso simulation environment zzso zzso to investigate three major models of interaction for zzso and zzso and to study the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment in each of these models on the local zzso modifications in the presence and absence of zzso zzso We show that the zzso response on the zzso can be achieved in the presence of a zzso complex of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being activated upon zzso from the complex upon zzso of the zzso zzso This study presents critical components in the zzso that can be targeted for engineering of specific zzso or zzso of the zzso
