In zzso models of Crohn's disease, zzso arthritis and colon cancer, zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso has been shown to promote the pathology associated with these zzso These zzso activities can, however, be selectively blocked by soluble forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a viable therapeutic zzso for the treatment of these conditions, the mass manufacture of such zzso is often zzso The advent of molecular farming has, however, provided an extremely cost-effective strategy for the engineering of zzso zzso Here, we describe the expression and production of a biologically active zzso zzso that is expressed in transgenic tobacco plants as an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso consists of the first three zzso of zzso zzso domain and zzso binding zzso fused to 100 repeats of zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the growth rate or zzso of the transgenic plants, and zzso was achieved using inverse transition zzso This approach led to an overall yield of 141 zzso of zzso protein per g of fresh leaf zzso The zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso zzso as measured by binding to the zzso complex and through its ability to block zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3) zzso and proliferation in human zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso the present study zzso the potential application of molecular farming in transgenic tobacco plants as a strategy for the expression and zzso of zzso advantageous zzso such as zzso
