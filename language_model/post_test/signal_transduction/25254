The mechanism by which zzso II stimulates the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells was investigated by measuring the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have effects practically analogous to zzso zzso We found that the signaling zzso involves the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the small zzso zzso Although the mechanism of zzso (or zzso zzso of zzso is not yet clear, we have found that zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso are involved in this zzso These studies indicate a zzso mechanism that zzso zzso as a bridge between a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
