All known zzso genes of zzso zzso are under positive regulation by the zzso factor zzso Previous work employing the zzso zzso strain zzso suggested that the zzso zzso might serve as a specific zzso zzso which functions to prevent zzso of the zzso zzso in a soil zzso We have examined three other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all commonly regarded as zzso zzso and find that zzso is anomalous with respect to the effect of carbohydrates on the expression of zzso gene zzso In the case of zzso zzso and zzso several other readily zzso zzso and zzso are as effective as zzso in zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso indicating that the zzso effect is not specific, and suggesting that zzso may be a partially zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and other zzso required for repression of zzso expression zzso 1 zzso were found to significantly enhance growth of zzso zzso cultures, suggesting that the repression phenomenon probably results from a zzso effect of sugar zzso rather than a zzso zzso Thus the previously reported zzso effect may reflect an aspect of a more global mechanism of zzso repression in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso at the level of transcript zzso quantitative Western zzso analysis indicates that zzso has no effect on zzso zzso These results are consistent with a model in which zzso activity is controlled by interaction with a hypothetical zzso the synthesis or depletion of which is responsive to the presence of readily zzso zzso
