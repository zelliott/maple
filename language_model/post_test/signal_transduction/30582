An essential oil from a lemon grass variety of zzso zzso zzso and its major chemical constituent zzso zzso zzso were investigated for their ability to induce zzso in human zzso zzso cells because zzso of zzso is the hallmark of cancer zzso zzso and zzso inhibited cell proliferation with 48 h zzso of approximately 30 and 20 zzso zzso Both induced concentration dependent strong and early zzso as measured by various zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso bodies formation and an increase in zzso zzso zzso DNA content during the early zzso period of zzso This could be because of early surge in zzso formation with concurrent loss of zzso membrane potential zzso Both zzso and zzso activated zzso death receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both increased the expression of zzso zzso c protein with its zzso release to zzso leading to zzso zzso suggesting thereby the involvement of both the intrinsic and zzso pathways of zzso Further, zzso zzso and decrease in nuclear zzso expression predict zzso effects of the essential oil and zzso while both appeared to follow similar signaling zzso zzso The easy and abundant availability of the oil combined with its suggested mechanism of zzso make zzso highly useful in the development of zzso zzso
