zzso has been implicated in the zzso of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic zzso pulmonary zzso In zzso studies suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso and zzso effects relevant to the progression of lung diseases; however, in zzso data supporting these observations are zzso zzso zzso zzso mice develop pulmonary inflammation and injury that are dependent on increased lung zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso in zzso zzso mice were treated with the selective zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso fibrosis, and zzso integrity were zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice developed pulmonary zzso fibrosis, and enlargement of zzso zzso conversely, zzso zzso mice showed less pulmonary zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonism significantly reduced zzso in zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso and airway zzso In addition, treatment with zzso attenuated pulmonary inflammation and zzso in zzso mice subjected to zzso lung zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling influences pathways critical for pulmonary inflammation and injury in zzso Thus in chronic lung diseases associated with increased zzso antagonism of zzso responses may prove to be a beneficial zzso
