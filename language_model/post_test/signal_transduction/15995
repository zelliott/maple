The bone zzso zzso zzso zzso play key roles in zzso zzso formation, by converting precursors into mature functional proteins involved in forming the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also play roles in zzso growth factors, such as zzso myostatin, growth differentiation factor 11, and transforming growth factor zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso growth zzso proteins zzso are involved in regulating the effects of zzso growth factors zzso on growth, development, and zzso Of the six zzso zzso has the greatest interaction with the large pool of circulating zzso It is also produced locally in zzso and is itself regulated by zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso human and mouse zzso at a single zzso site, resulting in markedly reduced ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso or to block zzso cell zzso In contrast, such zzso is shown to result in enhanced zzso ability of zzso zzso to block zzso proliferation and to induce zzso zzso zzso with in zzso roles for such zzso it is shown that, whereas wild type mouse zzso zzso zzso produce zzso zzso zzso doubly zzso for the zzso gene and for the zzso zzso which encodes the related zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso produce only zzso zzso thus demonstrating zzso zzso zzso to be responsible for zzso activity in zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is shown to reverse an zzso zzso consistent with the ability of zzso zzso to cleave zzso in zzso
