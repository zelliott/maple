zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso Recent studies showed that zzso and zzso calcium could cross talk to each other and positively regulate zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism of this feedback regulation remains to be further zzso Here we found that treatments of both zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso could inhibit zzso zzso in zzso Additionally, when zzso adherent zzso were treated with the zzso scavenger zzso to zzso the zzso zzso their attachments in engaging with zzso became looser and the frequency of calcium zzso zzso Since it is known that zzso stimulates the zzso and calcium signal primarily through zzso and zzso receptors respectively, our data indicated that zzso zzso downstream zzso and calcium zzso might be not completely coupled to zzso associated signaling complex, but in part through feedback stimulation by zzso released zzso Our data indicates the important roles of zzso and zzso released zzso in zzso the feedback regulations in zzso zzso zzso zzso
