During acute zzso of inflammatory zzso diseases, zzso are generated through the interactions of bacteria in the zzso activated zzso and cells of the colon zzso In this study we explored the ability of one such class of zzso represented by zzso zzso to serve as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso Individual colon zzso prepared from zzso rats were mounted in zzso chambers after loading with fluorescent reporters zzso zzso and zzso zzso These reporters were zzso in zzso for responsiveness to zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso to different zzso of zzso zzso 100, and 200 zzso were zzso zzso studies were designed to identify the sources and mechanisms of zzso increases in zzso and zzso in the zzso Exposure to zzso led to zzso increases in zzso zzso concentration zzso in the range of zzso zzso above baseline zzso Further studies indicated that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso is the result of release from zzso stores and zzso entry of zzso zzso through zzso zzso In addition, exposure to zzso resulted in zzso and sustained increases in zzso zzso concentration zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso were neutralized by zzso which shields zzso zzso groups from zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso proteins are susceptible to zzso by zzso leading to zzso but not necessarily toxic, increases in zzso and zzso Under certain conditions, zzso may act not as a toxin but as an agent that activates zzso signaling zzso
