We previously reported that zzso acid zzso zzso mechanical zzso zzso free zzso concentration response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the signal zzso zzso of the zzso effect of zzso was investigated in cultured zzso muscle cells from guinea pig zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso did not affect the response in the presence of 30 zzso zzso suggesting that the response is induced via zzso of zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso toxin nor zzso inhibited the zzso response, indicating that zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways are not involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the response, whereas formation of zzso fiber in the presence of zzso was completely zzso suggesting zzso zzso change is not involved in the zzso In contrast, a zzso C zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited the response, but broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso partially inhibited the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the mechanical zzso response via zzso of zzso but not protein zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso which is related to other zzso than zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso
