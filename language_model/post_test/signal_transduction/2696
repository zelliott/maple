The five known zzso receptors serve unique biological roles by virtue of their zzso expression and particular zzso zzso However, the function of any individual zzso in its normal zzso milieu is not zzso Studies to address this problem have been difficult because zzso and cell lines often express multiple zzso receptors and, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso the actions of individual receptors cannot be zzso Moreover, the biological and zzso actions of zzso receptors depend on their cellular environment, so that the zzso of a zzso expressed in zzso cells does not necessarily mimic that of zzso zzso We have developed two approaches to examine zzso receptors which circumvent these zzso Using a zzso zzso analogue for affinity zzso we isolated zzso receptors together with associated G zzso zzso analysis of the zzso complex with G zzso zzso showed that the zzso receptors in zzso cells zzso couple with two zzso zzso G zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha zzso To examine individual zzso types, we developed zzso zzso and used them to show that both zzso and zzso proteins were present in the zzso zzso cell line whereas zzso cells contained zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso protein complexes with zzso cells showed that zzso and zzso are both coupled to zzso zzso G zzso in contrast to the results observed when these receptors are zzso in some zzso zzso We also showed that the zzso receptors in zzso cells are subject to both zzso and zzso hormonal zzso The mechanisms involved in the regulation of different zzso types are now being characterized using the zzso zzso to isolate the individual zzso zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso zzso receptors as well as their hormonal regulation will be critical for understanding the functions of these receptors in the different zzso targets of zzso
