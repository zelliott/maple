Selective resistance to the effects of insulin on zzso metabolism in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue is a key feature of zzso zzso syndrome zzso The zzso of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in zzso involves interaction of in zzso environmental factors with intrinsic defects in insulin zzso We aimed to determine whether zzso intrinsic defects in insulin zzso and zzso zzso were present in zzso cells in zzso and zzso insulin resistance can be induced in control zzso cells by culture in medium zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso from obese women with zzso zzso zzso 7) and zzso and body mass zzso controls zzso zzso 5) were cultured for several generations in zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso transport did not differ in the zzso from women with zzso and zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso beta zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso of tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso 6 did not zzso zzso action on zzso synthesis in control zzso was not altered by zzso with or growth in media zzso by zzso skin zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso cells do not zzso an insulin zzso zzso We conclude that in contrast to skeletal muscle and skin zzso there is no evidence for intrinsic defects in insulin signaling in the zzso zzso cell zzso indicating that insulin resistance in these cells is likely due to factors in the in zzso zzso
