zzso are movement disorders whose zzso is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a model of primary zzso where zzso of zzso zzso density and sodium channel function in projection zzso were zzso Here, using zzso zzso we explore whether also the communication between zzso and zzso is altered in zzso zzso Field and zzso recordings were done in zzso zzso zzso stimulation was used to mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic connections, zzso relations and zzso and long-term plasticity were zzso Regarding cellular properties, zzso zzso of affected animals showed no zzso zzso network properties, evoked responses at threshold stimulation were zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso In zzso zzso field responses, zzso zzso and zzso were larger than in control, possibly by an increase in zzso release probability at zzso zzso In zzso the study indicates that a change of zzso communication is involved in the manifestation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
