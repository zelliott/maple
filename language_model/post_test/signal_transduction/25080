It is now clear that zzso which play a major role in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes in the zzso are found within the zzso Their role in this zzso compartment is still zzso however, data has suggested that nuclear zzso generate zzso such as zzso zzso by a number of nuclear zzso zzso for example, nuclear zzso C and the zzso zzso zzso There is also evidence that zzso may play a role in the zzso and regulation of a number of nuclear proteins such as the zzso complex, which is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso Although the presence of nuclear zzso has been demonstrated in a number of different cell types, suggesting that it is zzso there are many inconsistencies within the literature concerning the locations and zzso of zzso that are involved in their regulation and in the potential second zzso which are generated by zzso This review aims to highlight some of these inconsistencies in order to focus on areas that need further zzso
