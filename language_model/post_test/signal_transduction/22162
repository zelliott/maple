zzso evidence suggests a link between elevated inflammation and development of insulin zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso a large number of zzso molecules and zzso inflammatory zzso in a variety of cell types, including zzso zzso Considering the contribution of the fatty acid composition in zzso zzso we zzso that the inflammatory signals zzso by zzso contribute to insulin zzso 

Mice deficient in zzso were used to investigate the in zzso roles of zzso in initiating and maintaining zzso insulin resistance and energy zzso 

We first zzso the observation with elevated expression of zzso and inflammatory zzso in white zzso tissue and liver of zzso zzso Aged or zzso zzso mice were protected from obesity and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, mice lacking zzso exhibited improved zzso tolerance and insulin sensitivity regardless of feeding them regular zzso or a high-fat zzso This is accompanied by reductions in expression of inflammatory zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The attenuated zzso inflammatory zzso expression and related zzso are correlated with increased insulin action specifically in the liver in zzso mice, reflected by increased zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The absence of zzso zzso local inflammatory zzso expression and related zzso and increases insulin action specifically in the zzso Thus, our work has identified zzso as a key zzso of zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso
