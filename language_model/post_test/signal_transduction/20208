Human dental pulp stem cells zzso have potential applications in tissue zzso because of their convenient cell harvesting procedures and zzso zzso However, the tissue zzso potential of zzso is known to be zzso regulated by aging in long-term culture and under zzso zzso With an aim of reducing cellular zzso and zzso stress in zzso an zzso delivery system for zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso We zzso zzso with a zzso zzso known as zzso weight zzso zzso and investigated the effect of zzso zzso on hydrogen zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso significantly attenuated enlarged and flattened cell zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso Under the same conditions, zzso abolished zzso of the cell cycle regulator zzso zzso and zzso induced by hydrogen zzso In addition, zzso reversed the zzso of zzso differentiation and zzso of zzso gene markers induced by hydrogen zzso However, zzso could not reverse the decrease in zzso caused by hydrogen zzso 

Overall, zzso zzso zzso are effective for zzso of cellular zzso and reversal of zzso differentiation of zzso caused by zzso stress zzso This result suggests potential application in the field of zzso and tissue engineering to overcome the limitations of zzso stem zzso
