This study was designed to investigate whether zzso administration zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso signaling zzso in oxidized LDL induced human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso The zzso were isolated from healthy human volunteers and the cells were cultured in collagen coated plates at zzso with zzso CO2 and zzso as culture medium and were grouped as zzso Group I - control, group II - zzso treated and group III - zzso zzso We measured zzso expression of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and western zzso studies were done for knowing expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso 1 zzso The result indicates that zzso that zzso zzso showed an zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso induced zzso and zzso expression at zzso level and inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso by modulating the zzso signaling zzso thereby zzso zzso production and down regulated inflammatory zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso thus having protective effect against the zzso induced inflammation stress in zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso
