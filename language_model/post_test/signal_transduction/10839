Exposure of mice to zzso or zzso growth factor zzso in zzso during the zzso period results in zzso persistent proliferation and zzso of the zzso zzso when the animals become zzso Here, whether and how zzso is involved in the effects of zzso on the zzso mouse zzso were studied with an in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso were cultured for 3 days in zzso medium containing various combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and then transplanted into zzso host mice for 35 zzso The zzso cultured with 5 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso had a zzso thick zzso while the zzso of the zzso controls stayed zzso The zzso effect was blocked by concurrent treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment alone at doses less than 500 zzso did not induce permanent zzso changes but such changes did occur in zzso treated with zzso plus as little as 10 zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso inhibited the permanent zzso changes induced by zzso These results suggest that irreversible zzso changes are induced by the direct action of zzso on the developing zzso and that the zzso zzso syndrome of mouse zzso is caused by zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso
