Because of high zzso machine learning zzso typically rely on feature selection techniques in order to perform effective zzso in zzso gene expression data zzso However, the large number of features compared to the number of samples makes the task of feature selection zzso hard and prone to zzso This paper zzso feature selection as a task of zzso zzso where the goal is to select among an exponential number of alternative gene zzso the one expected to return the highest zzso in zzso zzso is an experimental design strategy which produces similar experimental conditions to compare alternative zzso zzso in order to be confident that observed differences in accuracy are due to actual differences rather than to fluctuations and noise zzso We propose an original blocking strategy for improving feature selection which zzso in a paired way the validation outcomes of several learning zzso to assess a gene subset and compare it to zzso This is a novelty with respect to conventional zzso which commonly adopt a sole learning zzso to evaluate the relevance of a given set of zzso The rationale of the approach is that, by increasing the amount of experimental conditions under which we validate a feature zzso we can zzso the problems related to the zzso of samples and consequently come up with a better zzso The paper shows that the blocking strategy significantly improves the performance of a conventional forward selection for a set of 16 publicly available cancer expression data zzso The experiments involve six different zzso and show that improvements take place independent of the zzso zzso used after the selection zzso Two further zzso based on available biological zzso support the claim that blocking strategies in feature selection may improve the accuracy and the quality of the zzso The first validation is based on retrieving zzso abstracts associated to the selected genes and matching them to regular expressions describing the biological phenomenon underlying the expression data zzso The biological validation that follows is based on the use of the zzso package zzso in order to perform Gene zzso statistical zzso
