zzso belongs to the family of zzso cassette proteins which zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of their zzso through zzso This protein zzso a large range of components out of cells, especially therapeutic agents causing a phenomenon known as zzso zzso Because of its clinical interest, its activity and transport function have been largely characterized by various zzso zzso In the absence of a high-resolution structure of zzso zzso modeling is a useful tool to help interpretation of experimental data and potentially guide experimental zzso 

We present here three-dimensional models of two different zzso states of zzso that were developed based on the crystal structures of two bacterial zzso zzso Our models are supported by a large body of zzso zzso Measured zzso distances correlate well with distances derived from zzso zzso The zzso model features a large cavity detected in the protein core into which zzso of different size were successfully zzso The locations of zzso zzso compare favorably with those suggested by drug binding site zzso 

Our models can interpret the effects of several zzso in the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso or at the zzso zzso The zzso results suggest that the protein has multiple binding sites in agreement with experimental zzso The zzso models are exploited to propose different pathways of signal transmission upon zzso zzso which could lead to the zzso of zzso changes needed for zzso zzso We identified a cluster of aromatic zzso located at the interface between the zzso and the zzso in opposite halves of the zzso which may contribute to this signal zzso Our models may characterize different steps in the zzso cycle and may be important tools to understand the zzso relationship of zzso
