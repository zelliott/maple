Although evidence exists that zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso affects zzso development, its specific roles within a growth cone are not well zzso To evaluate the model that zzso zzso regulates growth cone navigation by promoting zzso activity, we adopted a live analysis strategy that uses transgenic zzso lines in which zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso and zzso green fluorescent zzso We found that growth cones that displayed zzso defects exhibited little change in their zzso activity, whereas others without zzso defects exhibited an zzso increase in their zzso zzso Moreover, zzso loop zzso that were added to the zzso active zzso zzso and zzso exerted little influence over zzso activity caused by zzso zzso but suppressed the zzso defects of the growth zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso controls zzso activity in zzso growth cones independently of its effects on their zzso
