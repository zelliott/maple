The zzso zzso factor zzso possesses features typical of both zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso inducing zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was exploited to investigate the events triggered by zzso zzso to zzso zzso that lead to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso organization, formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and recruitment of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso in the zzso plasma membrane of adherent zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer demonstrated that zzso zzso occurs at the zzso aspect of zzso zzso Cell membrane zzso showed that a limited fraction of zzso zzso and zzso does zzso in zzso zzso at the zzso aspect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and triggers zzso zzso The use of zzso raft zzso agents and second zzso zzso demonstrated that intact zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are both required for zzso organization and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso causes zzso complex formation and polarization at the zzso aspect of adherent zzso zzso zzso zzso organization, and zzso zzso These results provide novel insights in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
