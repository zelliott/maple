zzso zzso D1 receptors zzso are coupled to zzso zzso through zzso Although this zzso is involved in important brain functions, the consequences of quantitative zzso of its components are not zzso We explored the zzso and behavioral responses to cocaine and zzso zzso in mice with zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which express decreased levels of the corresponding proteins in the zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso in zzso were decreased in zzso but not zzso zzso Acute locomotor responses to D1 zzso zzso zzso and cocaine were altered in zzso mice, and not in zzso zzso This zzso showed that zzso but not zzso protein levels are limiting for zzso zzso and behavioral zzso zzso mice developed pronounced locomotor zzso and zzso locomotor responses after repeated injections of zzso (2 zzso or cocaine (20 zzso They also developed normal zzso place zzso The zzso zzso remained blunted in repeatedly treated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was normal in the zzso of these mice, possibly accounting for the normal development of long-lasting behavioral responses to zzso Our results clearly zzso zzso mechanisms involved in acute and delayed behavioral effects of zzso They identify zzso levels of zzso as a key factor for acute responses to zzso and suggest that quantitative zzso of its expression may alter specific responses to drugs of abuse, or possibly other behavioral responses linked to zzso zzso
