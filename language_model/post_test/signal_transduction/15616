zzso adapter proteins zzso are critical components of signaling pathways in zzso linking zzso zzso engagement to downstream cellular zzso While these proteins lack intrinsic zzso activity, their zzso following zzso zzso allows them to function as scaffolds for the assembly of zzso signaling zzso Many zzso have recently been discovered, and numerous studies demonstrate their roles in the positive and negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso One such example is the zzso for zzso of T cells zzso family of adapter zzso While zzso has been shown to play an indispensable role in zzso and mast cell function, the other family members, zzso for zzso of B cells zzso and zzso for zzso of X cells zzso are necessary to fine-tune immune zzso In addition to its well-established role in the positive regulation of zzso zzso zzso exerts an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso along with zzso and zzso plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining zzso Here, we review recent data concerning the regulation of zzso development and zzso by the zzso family of zzso
