zzso zzso is characteristic of chronic zzso but the mechanisms regulating zzso numbers and their roles in liver disease progression are poorly zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso development and zzso during zzso and is activated in zzso liver disease in zzso Our objective was to determine if zzso zzso regulate the viability and zzso of zzso cells, which comprise a substantial zzso of resident zzso in healthy adult zzso and often accumulate during liver zzso The results demonstrate that a mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso mouse primary liver zzso cells, and human peripheral blood zzso cells are all responsive to sonic zzso zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stimulates expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of transgenic mice with an overly active zzso zzso harbor increased numbers of zzso zzso zzso cells also express zzso These results demonstrate that zzso cells produce and respond to zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso regulates the size and zzso production of liver zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the local expansion of zzso zzso cell populations during certain types of zzso liver zzso
