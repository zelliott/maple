The zzso zzso zzso is commonly activated by survival factors following plasma membrane zzso attributable to the interaction of its zzso zzso zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Once zzso zzso can prevent or delay zzso by zzso zzso or zzso of multiple signaling molecules involved in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso family zzso zzso Here, we describe and characterize a novel, conditional zzso controlled by chemically induced zzso zzso In this approach, the zzso zzso domain has been replaced with the zzso (and zzso domain, zzso to make zzso To effect membrane zzso a zzso zzso domain from zzso called zzso binds to zzso permeable zzso (and zzso synthetic zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso with zzso Like zzso zzso we show that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso strongly with zzso at zzso and zzso however, unlike zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso and contributes to zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, in zzso T cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued cells from zzso triggered by multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the DNA damaging agent, zzso This novel zzso zzso should be useful for identifying new zzso zzso and for zzso protecting tissue from zzso due to zzso injury or zzso zzso
