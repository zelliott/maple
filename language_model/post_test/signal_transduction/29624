To date, several classes of hormones have been described that influence plant development, including zzso zzso zzso and, more recently, zzso However, it is known that many zzso and bacterial species produce substances that alter plant growth that, if naturally present in plants, might represent novel classes of plant growth zzso zzso are zzso widely distributed in plants with a broad range of biological zzso In this work, we investigated the effects of zzso an zzso naturally occurring in plants, and its zzso zzso and zzso on plant growth and early root development in zzso We found that treatments with zzso in the range of zzso to zzso m alter shoot and root biomass zzso This effect correlated with zzso on primary root growth, lateral root formation, and root hair zzso Low zzso of zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced primary root growth and root hair zzso whereas higher zzso inhibited primary root growth that related with a reduction in cell zzso activity and cell zzso zzso and zzso were found to stimulate root hair zzso at zzso between zzso to zzso zzso Although the effects of zzso were similar to those produced by zzso on root growth and cell zzso the ability of the root system to respond to zzso was found to be independent of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may represent a new group of plant growth promoting substances with significant impact on root development and opens the possibility of using these compounds for improved plant zzso
