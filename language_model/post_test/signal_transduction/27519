zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso contained DNA binding activity of the zzso factor zzso zzso with profiles different from those reported in nuclear extracts in zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso DNA binding was almost zzso at 25 degrees C in the presence of both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso binding occurred at three different zzso on the gel when determined at 2 degrees C in the absence of zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso led to marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding detected as slow bands in the zzso zzso without markedly affecting that as a fast zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed much higher expression of both zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso in response to the administration of zzso than zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may be zzso expressed in the zzso with DNA binding activity and responsiveness to zzso zzso signals in a manner different from that in the nucleus in the zzso zzso
