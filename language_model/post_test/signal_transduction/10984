zzso or programmed cell death is a key regulator of zzso growth control and regulation of tissue zzso Tipping the balance between cell death and proliferation in favor of cell survival may result in tumor zzso Moreover, current cancer therapies, zzso chemotherapy, zzso zzso or suicide gene therapy, primarily exert their zzso effect by triggering an evolutionary zzso zzso program in cancer zzso For example, death zzso signaling has been implied to contribute to the efficacy of cancer zzso Thus, failure to undergo zzso in response to zzso therapy because of defects in death zzso pathways may result in zzso Further insights into the mechanisms regulating zzso in response to zzso therapy and how cancer cells evade cell death may provide novel opportunities for targeted zzso Thus, agents designed to selectively activate death zzso pathways may enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies and may even overcome some forms of cancer zzso
