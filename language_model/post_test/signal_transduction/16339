In zzso zzso sensors zzso zzso gene I zzso receptors zzso activate multiple signaling zzso initiating zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso is required for the zzso of zzso which, in turn, zzso the expression of most zzso genes by zzso zzso through the zzso zzso In fish, zzso zzso zzso virus infection by induction of zzso zzso however, the subtle signaling cascade mechanism remains to be zzso In this study, we clone an zzso of zzso a recently identified zzso responsible for zzso pathway, from zzso carp zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate its ability to suppress viral replication through zzso zzso zzso The pivotal signaling molecules of zzso pathway, including zzso melanoma zzso gene 5, laboratory of zzso and physiology 2, and zzso zzso 1, are also cloned and zzso confirming that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso from fish to zzso Further characterization of distinct zzso gene zzso reveals that zzso zzso and zzso are induced by the zzso zzso but are dependent on distinct zzso zzso Whereas fish zzso genes cannot be classified into zzso or zzso zzso zzso is primarily regulated by zzso thereby resembling that of zzso and zzso zzso is regulated by zzso thereby resembling of those of zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are induced by the zzso expressed zzso or zzso both of which are zzso by zzso and virus zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso genes in fish and zzso have evolved independently to acquire a similar mechanism triggering their zzso
