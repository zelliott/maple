The zzso and zzso proteins are zzso by the same gene and both members of the zzso family of zzso zzso exchange zzso These proteins can be activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is located at the plasma zzso whereas zzso is confined to the zzso zzso imaging studies yielded quantitative information on diffusion zzso association rates and encounter times of zzso and zzso zzso signaling was examined as a measure of the signal transmission, revealing more efficient signaling through the zzso zzso A zzso dependent recruitment system was used to zzso alter the zzso location and concentration of zzso showing efficient signaling through zzso only upon membrane zzso Together, our results show efficient signal transmission through membrane located zzso and highlight a role for increased concentration rather than increased encounter times due to membrane zzso in the zzso zzso pathways to zzso and zzso
