zzso is a novel zzso drug derived from a zzso from zzso zzso that is known to induce zzso of rat zzso T zzso In this study, we examined the zzso signaling zzso triggered by zzso Treatment of human zzso T zzso with zzso zzso characterized by DNA zzso The same treatment induced zzso of protein zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso blocked zzso DNA fragmentation as well as the zzso of zzso However, zzso treatment failed to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso completely suppressed the zzso zzso process including zzso of zzso 3 and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, transient expression of zzso active zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protected the cells from zzso cell zzso The effect of zzso was canceled by zzso of a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso pathways are zzso regulated during zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso alone is sufficient to cancel the zzso death zzso
