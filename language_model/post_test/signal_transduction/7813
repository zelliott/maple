Loss of zzso T cells is the hallmark of zzso zzso However, type I zzso zzso zzso cells may also be zzso This results in zzso to an opportunistic infection such as zzso zzso In addition, zzso bone zzso failure resulting in zzso is another common problem in advanced stage zzso This may be linked to both the failing immune system and zzso opportunistic zzso We generated zzso type I zzso zzso mice zzso to study the effects on zzso infection of the zzso When zzso animals were infected with zzso they died between days 16 and 21 zzso with minimal pneumonia but severe anemia due to complete bone zzso zzso This included the loss of zzso zzso precursor zzso Bone zzso failure was prevented by the zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso especially B zzso T and B cells lacking type I zzso zzso signaling could only partially prevent bone zzso failure in response to zzso zzso However, the presence of T and B cells lacking type I zzso signaling resulted in zzso zzso zzso in the liver and zzso zzso support of the zzso capacity of the bone zzso was provided by both type I zzso and zzso mechanisms that acted zzso Our findings point to the requirement of both type I zzso and zzso in the zzso capabilities of the zzso system under the pressure of zzso infection, but not during zzso zzso This may have implications in the management of zzso in zzso
