zzso of breast cancer cells is the leading cause of death in breast cancer zzso Why do breast cancer cells with high zzso potential always keep in high proliferation and zzso The zzso signaling pathways associated with tumor zzso remain zzso In the present study, we address whether a link between zzso and the zzso associated with zzso acid zzso metabolism contributes to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer zzso To identify zzso signaling pathways involved in sustaining proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, we performed parallel studies of human breast cancer cell lines that differ in their zzso zzso Our data showed that cell lines with high zzso potential, including zzso and zzso exhibited significantly high, sustained levels of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 relative to zzso zzso Our findings showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso serve downstream zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso C, and protein zzso C serve upstream zzso of zzso In addition, AA zzso were able to activate zzso zzso zzso C, protein zzso C, and zzso zzso through zzso and zzso In contrast, activated zzso promoted AA metabolism through a positive feedback loop, which zzso to a high zzso potential and the migration of the breast cancer zzso Together, our data provide new zzso insights into possible zzso signaling zzso signaling pathways involved in maintaining proliferation and migration of breast cancer zzso
