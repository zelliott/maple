zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso is an integral membrane protein which has transforming potential and is necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso by zzso zzso molecules zzso in the plasma membrane and recruit zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso factors zzso which are presumably involved in the zzso cascade leading to zzso zzso by zzso zzso activities are zzso by zzso and other members of the zzso family, which implies that zzso could function as a zzso zzso lacks extended zzso zzso similar to zzso receptors but, in contrast, it also lacks any motifs involved in zzso zzso By using zzso zzso which can be zzso at will, we show that the function of zzso in zzso cells and B cells is solely dependent on zzso of its zzso zzso zzso is an intrinsic property of the zzso domain of zzso zzso and causes a zzso zzso which can be zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso zzso In zzso immortalized B cells zzso in conjunction with membrane targeting of the zzso zzso domain of zzso is sufficient for its biological zzso Thus, zzso acts like a zzso activated zzso whose biological activities are zzso
