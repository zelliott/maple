zzso is an zzso related to obesity and insulin zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso by the treatment of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which zzso inhibit the zzso gene zzso zzso gene expression was decreased by zzso in fully differentiated zzso zzso which was abolished after treatment of zzso (a protein synthesis zzso zzso could not repress the expression of the zzso gene in the presence of zzso A (an zzso binding zzso zzso binding site of the zzso promoter zzso was necessary for the zzso Further investigation of the effect of zzso on the modification of zzso showed that the level of zzso of zzso was decreased in this zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso gene by modulating zzso zzso
