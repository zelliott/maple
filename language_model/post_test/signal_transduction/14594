G zzso receptors represent the most diverse group of proteins involved in zzso zzso that participate in the regulation of a wide range of zzso zzso through the interaction with zzso G zzso In addition, zzso stimulation also triggers a negative feedback zzso known as zzso that prevents the potentially harmful effects caused by persistent zzso zzso In this zzso response, G zzso zzso zzso zzso play a key role and zzso in their function are related to diverse zzso zzso Based on the scarce knowledge about the regulation of zzso by other zzso of the same family, the aim of the present work was to investigate the regulation of zzso levels in systems where other zzso are diminished by zzso zzso Present findings show that in zzso cells zzso levels are regulated by zzso and not by zzso through a mechanism involving zzso zzso This work reports a novel zzso zzso regulatory mechanism and further suggests that zzso may also act as a zzso zzso tending to counterbalance the reduction in zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence for the existence of zzso zzso
