Multiple zzso zzso of the zzso extract of the roots of zzso zzso led to the isolation of 19 zzso Four natural products, three zzso and zzso zzso were identified, and five further compounds were detected for the first time in this zzso Additionally, 10 known zzso zzso zzso were zzso The structures were determined by mass zzso and advanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the isolated compounds was studied in zzso experiments performed on rat brain membrane zzso Both partial and inverse zzso compounds for zzso zzso receptors were identified among the zzso characterized by weak to moderate interactions with the zzso signaling zzso The zzso activities of the zzso compounds are rather far from the full zzso effects seen with the zzso zzso zzso reference compound zzso zzso However, upon zzso with zzso a number of them proved capable of zzso the stimulation of the pure zzso thereby demonstrating zzso zzso zzso zzso
