zzso growth zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso and regulates a variety of zzso zzso These studies examined the signal zzso pathways zzso in zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to zzso were assessed in zzso and zzso cells and in mice where zzso was zzso silenced in the zzso by a zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells or zzso mice led to a significant reduction in zzso protein expression and enhanced zzso of zzso signaling zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells led to a reduction in activity of the human zzso promoter and this repression could be blocked by treatment with a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or by zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, zzso or zzso Site directed zzso of a zzso binding element in the zzso promoter blocked zzso repression in zzso reporter zzso zzso promoter activity was zzso by zzso in zzso cells and this repression could be reduced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso protein expression was zzso in mice where zzso was zzso silenced in the zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso in the zzso expressing zzso of the same zzso The studies demonstrate that zzso zzso the expression of zzso in the zzso and gallbladder via a signal zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
