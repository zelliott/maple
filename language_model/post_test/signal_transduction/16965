zzso acids and zzso can be zzso attached to a variety of zzso These zzso modifications regulate protein structure, zzso and zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso approach based on the zzso recruitment system that is useful for identifying sequence motifs those influence zzso modification to recruit proteins to the plasma zzso Our approach zzso the isolation of zzso cells expressing zzso proteins via a simple and easy growth selection zzso utilizing zzso signaling that zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we selected the zzso sequence of zzso zzso as a model case to investigate dual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a modification that is widely zzso from zzso to higher zzso Our results suggest that both zzso modifications are required for restoration of zzso zzso Although we could not differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso position 7 and 8 play some critical zzso Moreover, we tested the preference for specific zzso zzso at position 7 and 8 using zzso zzso This new approach will be useful to explore zzso associations and to determine the corresponding sequence zzso
