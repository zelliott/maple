zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso receptors mediate multiple distinct cellular events during zzso zzso However, their precise roles in zzso zzso and zzso are poorly delineated because of overlapping functions and expression zzso Here, we have explored the role of two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse retinal zzso We previously showed that zzso mice exhibit mild zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso expression zzso with zzso in the neural zzso and zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso show minimal eye and retinal zzso The zzso lacking both zzso and zzso die early in development, but a majority of zzso zzso zzso survive until zzso The zzso zzso develops severe retinal zzso and zzso with full zzso At the cellular level, impaired zzso is indicated by increased zzso retinal zzso that result from accelerated cell cycle exit of zzso zzso of zzso retinal zzso is indicated by altered zzso of zzso junction zzso such as zzso protein zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is critical for retinal zzso expansion, is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking zzso receptors in cultured retinal zzso led to zzso shifted divisions of retinal zzso Together, our studies suggest a zzso regulation of signaling by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso
