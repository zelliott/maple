zzso among the vascular beds, loss of zzso integrity in the pulmonary zzso due to injury can lead to rapidly fatal zzso The ability to regain zzso and re-establish barrier function is central to restoring proper gas zzso The adult respiratory distress syndrome zzso is a zzso disease, however, meaning that zzso cells within different regions of the lung do not likely see the same oxygen tension as they attempt to zzso and re-establish an intact zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the integrity of this newly formed zzso zzso is not zzso zzso human pulmonary zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were sparsely zzso and grown to zzso over 4 days in either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso attained in a hypoxic environment resulted in a zzso less permeable zzso zzso (as determined by an increase in zzso electrical resistance, decreased zzso to zzso labeled zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso grown to zzso under zzso had decreased zzso zzso consistent with this finding, zzso of zzso zzso a zzso downstream target of zzso markedly increased electrical resistance in zzso but not zzso zzso These results were confirmed in primary human and rat zzso These data suggest that zzso grown to zzso under zzso form a tighter zzso than similar cells grown under zzso This tighter barrier appears to be due, in part, to the zzso of zzso activity in hypoxic zzso
