In zzso zzso a number of response regulators are presumably involved in zzso zzso signal zzso in response to environmental zzso such as zzso Previously, it was shown that expression of a certain set of genes for response regulators are zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso under certain growth conditions zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plant Cell zzso zzso To answer the critical question of whether or not other response regulator zzso so far identified in zzso zzso are also zzso here an extended comparative examination was carried zzso It was demonstrated that not all of response regulator genes are necessarily zzso in their zzso Rather, the members of a certain zzso zzso are zzso but those belonging to the other zzso are zzso The presumed zzso was also assessed for the same set of response regulators, and the analogous view was zzso These results suggest that the two zzso of response regulators differ from each other, as judged from not only their structural designs, but also the expression profiles of their transcripts in response to plant zzso
