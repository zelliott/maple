The understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso communication is fundamental for system zzso Up to now, the main objectives of zzso have been zzso modeling and analysis of zzso regulatory and signaling zzso based on data generated from zzso zzso zzso communication or zzso sensing zzso the use of small zzso signals to coordinate complex patterns of behavior in bacteria, has been the focus of many reports over the past zzso Based on the zzso sensing process of the zzso zzso zzso we aim at developing a functional zzso net, which will allow modeling and simulating zzso communication zzso Using a new zzso information system called zzso zzso we present how to combine different fields of studies such as zzso database consulting, zzso zzso and simulation for a zzso reconstruction of the complex signaling zzso sensing zzso We show how zzso communication processes and zzso within a cell and across cell colonies can be modeled using zzso and how those models can be simulated with zzso net network structures in a sophisticated zzso
