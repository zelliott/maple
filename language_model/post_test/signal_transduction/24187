The role of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism was investigated in rat zzso Treatment with NO donors, which are known to activate soluble zzso zzso inhibited in parallel fatty acid synthesis de zzso and zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso by zzso and abolished by zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso Furthermore, specific and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso release from zzso zzso were also effective in zzso both fatty zzso zzso These results suggest that this biological action of NO is regulated by a signaling cascade involving soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso and may be zzso at least in part, by zzso of zzso release from zzso zzso In addition, zzso was able to stimulate fatty acid zzso by two different zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by lowering levels of this product of zzso zzso and a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, results of this study suggest that zzso signaling zzso is endowed with regulatory properties in fatty acid zzso and may have a zzso role in the control of this metabolism in zzso
