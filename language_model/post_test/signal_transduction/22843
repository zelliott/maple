The identification of molecular events relevant in the biology of cancer cells and the possibility of defining the molecular profile of cancer cell lines have radically changed the process of zzso zzso Cancer drug discovery relies now mainly on the National Cancer Institute cell line screening program; this screening system allows the selection of compounds with zzso molecular mechanisms of action by screening them on cell lines zzso at the molecular level and by comparing their zzso through a computer-based analysis of the response zzso zzso targeted drugs, which should hit specific molecular or zzso targets, can be classified by a specific target, such as zzso zzso or by general mechanism of zzso The clinical development of these new zzso agents presents a significant challenge because clinical studies should comply with the molecular zzso and be devised in order to provide the zzso of zzso that is the ability of the drug to interact with and activate or block the molecular zzso After a summary of the main features and problems faced in the clinical development of biologically targeted zzso therapies, the zzso and clinical data available for some zzso zzso signal zzso zzso drugs acting on the zzso and zzso zzso will be zzso
