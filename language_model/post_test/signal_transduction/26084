The innate immune responses zzso by zzso receptors zzso provide an zzso zzso first line of defense against microbial zzso In the zzso zzso we previously integrated zzso of human zzso molecular functions with those of over zzso other human proteins involved in processes such as zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso and have linked these zzso to external resources, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Gene zzso to generate a resource suitable for data mining, zzso analysis, and other systems biology zzso We have now used a combination of manual expert zzso and computer-based zzso analysis to generate a set of zzso for zzso molecular function in the chicken zzso zzso zzso and avian lineages zzso approximately 300 million years ago, and the avian zzso repertoire consists of both zzso and distinct new zzso The work described here centers on the molecular biology of zzso the host zzso that mediates responses to viral and other zzso zzso as a paradigm for our approach to integrated manual and zzso based zzso and data zzso It tests the quality of zzso generated zzso projected from human onto other species and supports a systems biology approach to analysis of zzso signaling pathways and identification of clinically useful zzso zzso
