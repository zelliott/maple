zzso activated zzso signaling occurs in several zzso promoting the development of zzso zzso In this study, we found that eight of eight zzso cancer cell lines (including six zzso zzso cell zzso have prominent expression of zzso zzso Fifty percent of the zzso cancer cell lines (four of zzso were growth inhibited by two small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not inhibit 50% proliferation of zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso at a concentration at which the drug completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was less potent than zzso at zzso zzso zzso but was more potent than zzso at decreasing cell zzso zzso zzso protein expression and zzso using zzso targeting zzso did not induce zzso arrest and zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso have zzso activity, contributing to their zzso zzso In zzso study showed that zzso markedly inhibited the growth of zzso cancer cells zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppress the growth of aggressive zzso cancer cells, and this potential therapeutic benefit results from their zzso zzso
