zzso to zzso shock in zzso zzso is brought about by the zzso of two independent signaling zzso zzso and zzso which in turn trigger the high zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso thereby activates the zzso of zzso an zzso necessary to zzso zzso The production of zzso brings about a change in the zzso zzso leading to zzso We present a detailed zzso model for the response of the zzso to zzso zzso The model zzso the two zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and also includes the zzso protein zzso zzso gene regulation and zzso Model simulations are consistent with known experimental results for zzso strain, and zzso and zzso zzso strains subjected to zzso zzso zzso results predict that both the branches contribute to the overall zzso response for moderate zzso zzso while under severe zzso zzso the cell responds mainly through the zzso zzso The analysis shows that the zzso branch helps the cell in preventing zzso to other signaling pathways by zzso zzso zzso and also by increasing the zzso of zzso We show that the negative zzso to the zzso branch must be faster than those to the zzso branch to simultaneously achieve zzso specificity and adaptation during zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the presence of both branches zzso robust behavior to the cell under zzso to zzso
