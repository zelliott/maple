zzso zzso is an oral zzso that has direct effects on the zzso to inhibit cell growth and zzso In vascular smooth muscle cells zzso insulin zzso a zzso signal that is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso on this zzso and found that it zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso insulin (1 zzso induced a zzso increase in DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso DNA synthesis by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso at I and 10 zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso At 20 zzso however, zzso modestly enhanced zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso a zzso signal by zzso zzso factors such as zzso which regulate critical zzso zzso We used zzso expression plasmids to detect zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Neither early steps in insulin signaling nor the zzso zzso zzso branch of this zzso were affected by zzso because it had no effect on zzso zzso zzso association, or zzso zzso Because zzso is a known zzso for the nuclear zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso we tested two other zzso for this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both also inhibited zzso DNA zzso In zzso these data show that zzso zzso zzso signaling by insulin at a point zzso of zzso zzso potentially by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso factors that regulate cell zzso
