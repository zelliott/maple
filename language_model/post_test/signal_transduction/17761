zzso zzso is a soil zzso capable of invading and establishing a symbiotic relationship with alfalfa zzso This invasion process requires the zzso by zzso zzso of at least one of the two zzso important zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso locus of zzso zzso encodes a zzso system that plays a role in the symbiotic zzso Here we show that the zzso locus exerts one level of control through regulation of zzso II zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso II production as well as the expression of several genes in the zzso zzso that are responsible for zzso II zzso This zzso was zzso by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts from the zzso strain but not from a zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso are required for zzso gene zzso This was further confirmed by the observation that synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the previously identified zzso zzso specifically restored zzso gene zzso Most importantly, the absence of zzso active zzso II in a zzso zzso was confirmed in plant zzso zzso emphasizing the role of zzso sensing in zzso
