In the bone zzso zzso and committed zzso zzso have to closely regulate their balance between sustained proliferation without differentiation zzso zzso and entering a terminal differentiation zzso A useful model to analyze this regulation at the molecular level is committed avian zzso zzso These are induced to undergo long-term self renewal by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cooperation with steroid hormone zzso This zzso induction by zzso even occurs in the presence of differentiation factors zzso and zzso Under the same conditions, the zzso zzso is unable to sustain zzso zzso self renewal, stimulating cell proliferation without arresting terminal zzso Two mechanisms are involved in these differential activities of zzso and zzso The first one, differential regulation of zzso zzso proved to be of minor importance, because zzso was unable to induce self renewal, even if zzso expressed from a zzso at high zzso Rather our results support the second zzso zzso that zzso signal zzso is responsible for the differential biological activity of zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso were found which selectively inhibited the biological function of either zzso or zzso in zzso but did not affect zzso zzso of either zzso and zzso zzso selectively induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso The Ras zzso was similarly activated by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso specifically blocked zzso zzso implicating this signal zzso in zzso self zzso
