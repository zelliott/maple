A major event in the maturation of zzso zzso transmission is the qualitative change in zzso responses from zzso to zzso In cortical regions, this is attributed to the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the main zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso factor early growth response 4 zzso can activate the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that in immature zzso zzso zzso robustly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The subsequent increase in zzso zzso contributes to the expression of total zzso protein zzso These results indicate that zzso is an important component in the mechanism of zzso zzso gene regulation via the zzso zzso in immature zzso
