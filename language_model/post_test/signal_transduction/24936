zzso of zzso in the mother cell compartment of zzso zzso zzso involves zzso and is governed by a signal from the zzso zzso has an zzso motif characteristic of zzso embedded in one of its zzso zzso Several conservative single zzso acid changes in the zzso motif abolished zzso However, changing the zzso acid zzso to zzso acid, or changing the zzso zzso that precedes the motif to zzso permitted zzso zzso Only one other putative zzso site 2 zzso has been shown to tolerate zzso acid rather than zzso acid in its zzso zzso Site 2 zzso and zzso share a second region of similarity with a family of putative membrane zzso A conservative change in this region of zzso abolished zzso Interestingly, zzso increased the zzso of certain zzso zzso proteins but was unnecessary for zzso of zzso zzso
