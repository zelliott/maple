Members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso play critical roles in both zzso and zzso In light of their zzso effects, these molecules are implicated in the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso signals through the zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso type I zzso and triggers zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Because targeting of zzso signaling represents a potential approach to the treatment of systemic sclerosis zzso and other zzso disorders, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso the first zzso inhibitor of zzso to be zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso zzso was examined by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was investigated using Northern zzso analysis, transient zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso production was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso and zzso gene zzso Treatment with zzso prevented zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1, and zzso tissue growth factor gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and it could reverse stimulation even when added to the cultures after zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of collagen gene expression induced by zzso was not prevented by zzso indicating the specificity of blockade for zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to its effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to prevent zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso signaling in normal zzso through selective interference with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is useful as a novel experimental tool for gaining a detailed understanding of normal and zzso zzso signaling in zzso Furthermore, as an zzso agent, zzso may represent a potential new approach to the treatment of zzso
