zzso comprise a major family of cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind and zzso a wide variety of biological molecules through their zzso zzso zzso zzso Although all zzso contain the zzso binding HS zzso they likely perform specific functions in zzso because their zzso and spatial expression patterns are zzso However, how zzso expression is regulated has yet to be clearly zzso In this study, we examined how zzso expression is regulated in zzso zzso Our results showed that among several zzso agents tested, only zzso and three zzso of zzso zzso significantly induced zzso but not zzso expression on various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not increased by zzso treatment and zzso did not inhibit zzso induction by zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso induction of zzso was inhibited by transient expression of a zzso construct of protein zzso A zzso and by specific zzso of zzso Further zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso when cells were treated with zzso and this was inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso expression of a zzso construct with its zzso zzso replaced with a zzso was not induced by zzso Together, these findings define a regulatory mechanism where zzso signals through zzso to zzso the zzso zzso domain and increases zzso expression on zzso zzso
