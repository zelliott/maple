The zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso and their transformation to zzso are the key steps in the pathological progress of liver zzso The transforming growth zzso zzso zzso is involved in the proliferation and collagen synthesis of zzso This study aimed to examine the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on the signaling zzso of zzso in zzso cells and seek a novel therapeutic approach for liver zzso The zzso cells were treated with zzso at different zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were determined in zzso cells by real-time zzso and Western zzso respectively, after treatment with zzso at different zzso zzso 2, 3 zzso or zzso alone (serving as zzso The results showed that zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso manner, and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso After treatment with zzso at 1, 2 or 3 zzso for 24 zzso the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were significantly decreased zzso but the zzso zzso expression had no significant change zzso There was also a significant decrease in the protein expression level of zzso and zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso protein was substantially increased when compared with the control group zzso It was concluded that the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso can reduce the production of zzso factors zzso zzso and promote the expression of zzso factor zzso suggesting that zzso may become a potential therapeutic alternative for liver zzso
