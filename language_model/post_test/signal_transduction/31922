Heat shock protein 90 zzso is an essential, abundant and ubiquitous zzso zzso that has crucial roles in protein folding and zzso the activities of key zzso The zzso zzso zzso which includes numerous client proteins such as zzso protein zzso and zzso factors, displays a surprisingly high degree of plasticity that depends on environmental zzso Furthermore, although zzso zzso levels increase following environmental challenges, zzso activity is tightly controlled via zzso regulation and an zzso loop involving heat shock zzso factor 1 zzso In this Review, we discuss the roles and regulation of zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as a biological transistor that zzso the activity of zzso zzso networks in response to environmental cues via this zzso zzso zzso
