There is much discussion in the cancer drug development community about how to incorporate molecular tools into zzso clinical trials to assess target zzso measure zzso activity, and enrich the clinical trial population for patients who are more likely to zzso zzso zzso focused clinical studies offer the promise of the early definition of optimal zzso dose and patient zzso 

Based on zzso evidence that zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso loss zzso tumors to the zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso we conducted a zzso Phase I zzso trial of zzso in patients with zzso glioblastoma, whose tumors lacked expression of the tumor zzso zzso We aimed to assess the safety profile of daily zzso in patients with zzso define the dose of zzso required for zzso zzso in tumor zzso and evaluate the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso that were sufficient to inhibit zzso in zzso were achieved in all patients, the magnitude of zzso zzso in tumor cells zzso by reduced zzso zzso protein zzso varied zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso by zzso zzso was dramatically reduced in seven of 14 patients after 1 zzso of zzso treatment and was associated with the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells harvested from the zzso zzso retained sensitivity to zzso ex zzso indicating that clinical resistance to zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso treatment led to zzso zzso in seven patients, presumably due to loss of negative feedback, and this zzso was associated with shorter zzso during zzso maintenance zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has zzso activity in zzso zzso and warrants further clinical study alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso The short-term treatment zzso used in this zzso trial design identified the importance of monitoring target zzso and negative feedback to guide future clinical zzso
