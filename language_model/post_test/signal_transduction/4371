In animals, plants and zzso zzso toxin zzso can activate zzso pathways dependent on zzso zzso binding proteins zzso We transformed tobacco plants with a zzso gene zzso the A1 zzso of zzso regulated by a zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso of transgenic plants expressing zzso showed greatly reduced zzso to the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso accumulated high levels of salicylic acid zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso protein genes zzso zzso and the class II zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, the class I zzso of zzso and zzso known to be induced in tobacco by stress, by zzso treatment and as part of the hypersensitive response to infection, were not induced and displayed normal zzso In good agreement with these results, zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso or zzso induced the expression of a zzso reporter gene but not that of a zzso reporter gene containing the promoter region of a gene zzso the class I zzso of zzso zzso and zzso experiments strongly suggest that zzso zzso are important in inducing the expression of a subset of zzso genes and that these zzso act locally rather than zzso upstream of zzso zzso
