zzso functional knowledge from zzso interaction studies often zzso the production of zzso zzso and the study of their effects in biological zzso In many cases, multiple zzso compete for binding to the same protein domain and it becomes useful to produce specific zzso that prevent binding to one zzso but not to the zzso We have combined zzso zzso and a two hybrid mating zzso to produce a screening strategy that has already proven useful in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
