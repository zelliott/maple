Advanced prostate cancer is treated initially by central suppression of zzso production by zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso even zzso zzso often show some, if only slight, growth zzso when these zzso are delivered in pharmacological zzso Previous studies have shown in cell lines and animal zzso models that zzso of peripheral zzso receptors on prostate zzso cells lead to growth zzso In zzso there is a decrease of zzso growth factor receptors zzso and zzso Because zzso zzso stimulation exists in most, if not all, prostate zzso and is required for cell zzso we asked whether zzso signaling zzso zzso to limit tumor zzso One possible mechanism was suggested by zzso receptors triggering zzso zzso to activate protein zzso C zzso because zzso zzso limits zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

To determine the role of this zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid to an zzso zzso to abrogate this zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso were grown as zzso in the zzso space of zzso zzso 

zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso formed tumors in zzso mice that were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso were resistant to this growth zzso These results paralleled in zzso studies in which zzso zzso blocked proliferation of the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 

These data support the model of zzso zzso preventing zzso tumor growth through a zzso zzso This suggests new targets of zzso intervention to limit the growth of zzso prostate zzso
