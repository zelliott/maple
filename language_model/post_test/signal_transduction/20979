An interaction with the Ras zzso product is a requirement for zzso zzso in many signaling zzso The significance of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that a zzso preventing the zzso interaction severely zzso the function of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso however, dominant zzso zzso have been identified that suppress the effect of the zzso site zzso zzso To address the mechanism by which these zzso restore zzso zzso we have introduced the zzso zzso into the analogous zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show that rather than zzso for the zzso zzso by restoring the zzso interaction, the zzso zzso increase the zzso and biological activity of zzso allowing zzso to signal in the absence of Ras zzso Surprisingly, we find that while one of the zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso zzso activity of zzso it also zzso the ability of zzso zzso to become activated by zzso This zzso occurs in the zzso domain zzso of zzso and demonstrates the importance of this region for a productive zzso zzso Finally, we present evidence that the most zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity by introducing a novel zzso site into the zzso zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso
