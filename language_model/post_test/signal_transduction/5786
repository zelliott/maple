It has long been stated that the zzso zzso zzso are activated during cell swelling through zzso of their zzso zzso by a protein zzso zzso but that other zzso are involved by targeting this zzso or the zzso zzso To date, however, the role of signaling zzso in zzso regulation has been deduced from indirect evidence rather than in zzso zzso studies, and examined after simulation of zzso transport through cell swelling or zzso zzso In this study, the zzso expression system was used to examine the effects of changes in cell volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the activity and zzso levels zzso of zzso and determine whether these effects are zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso low zzso or low zzso leads to decreased activity but increased zzso zzso high zzso leads to increased activity but no decrease in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso treatment leads to decreased activity but no increase in zzso Thus, we have shown for the first time that one of the zzso can be regulated through direct zzso that changes in zzso or zzso modify the activity of signaling zzso at carrier sites, and that the zzso directly involved do not include a Cal zzso zzso in contrast to the widely held zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
