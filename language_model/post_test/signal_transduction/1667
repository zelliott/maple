The zzso gene zzso cell zzso was discovered zzso about a decade ago and proved to be a member of the emerging zzso gene zzso zzso studies of this gene provide an interesting perspective on the role of the zzso family in transitions in cell zzso Specifically, gene products that influence cell viability as a major effect zzso zzso zzso and other family zzso can act as key zzso in cell zzso differentiation and zzso Although they do not have a direct role in zzso programs, these genes can either permit these programs to proceed or prevent zzso Through such effects, the zzso family regulates the normal flow of cells through cycles of proliferation and along various pathways of zzso A model is presented suggesting that this is accomplished by sustaining or zzso viability at critical points in the cell zzso These critical points represent windows of time during which cell fate transitions are zzso They can also be zzso as windows that open or close to promote or prevent continued progression along various cell fate zzso The pattern of zzso family expression at these points allows for the proliferation zzso and continued viability of cell types that are needed, while zzso these processes for cells that are zzso or no longer zzso The combined action of the various family members can therefore control the fate of cells, zzso and even the zzso This mechanism involving zzso genes is readily zzso and is poised to respond to external signals through the differential regulation of zzso family zzso As such, it plays an important role in the maintenance of tissue zzso and zzso zzso that affect the zzso family impair the capacity to control the flow of cells through these critical points, and thereby zzso the window zzso for cell zzso and zzso zzso this family may thus provide a means of zzso cancer development and inducing zzso in tumor zzso
