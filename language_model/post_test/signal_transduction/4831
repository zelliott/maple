The great interest in zzso zzso zzso zzso as molecular zzso for clinical applications, and as zzso molecules for zzso communication highlights the need to reveal their physical zzso Here this issue was explored in human zzso seminal zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by quantitative real-time zzso in all zzso While the stability of zzso assessed by zzso analysis (up to 24 h at room zzso was similar with zzso the reductive changes between zzso and zzso after zzso and zzso zzso treatment on seminal plasma were very different, zzso their different physical zzso zzso zzso zzso were then recovered and proportions of zzso and zzso within zzso were zzso The amounts of zzso zzso zzso almost were the same as total zzso and were highly variable depending on the different sizes of zzso But most of zzso was independent of zzso and existed in the zzso The possible form of zzso in the zzso was further explored by zzso and zzso K zzso It passed through the zzso zzso but was zzso dramatically after intense zzso K zzso 

The zzso zzso is contained in zzso while most zzso is bound with protein zzso Our data explained the stability of zzso zzso in human zzso and shed light on their origins and potential functions in male zzso and strategy of developing them as zzso of male zzso zzso
