zzso zzso a common food-borne zzso zzso regulates the expression of multiple genes during the infection zzso These genes zzso systems related to zzso zzso invasion, and zzso zzso Key among them is a type three zzso system zzso zzso within zzso zzso island 1 zzso In addition to the zzso zzso other systems, including zzso and type 1 zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the dynamic expression of the zzso zzso and type 1 zzso zzso We demonstrate that these genes are expressed in a zzso zzso beginning with the zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso and ending with the type 1 zzso zzso This hierarchy could mirror the roles of these three systems during the infection zzso As multiple studies have shown that extensive regulatory cross talk exists between these three systems, we also tested how removing different regulatory links between them affects gene expression zzso These results indicate that cross talk is critical for regulating gene expression during transitional zzso in the gene expression zzso In addition, we identified a novel regulatory link between zzso and type 1 zzso gene expression zzso where we found that the zzso regulator, zzso zzso type 1 zzso gene expression through the zzso regulation of zzso The significance of these results is that they provide the first systematic study of the effect of regulatory cross talk on the expression dynamics of zzso zzso and type 1 zzso zzso
