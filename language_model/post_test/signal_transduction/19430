zzso pharmacological and genetic studies in dogs, mice and rats have established that the zzso zzso zzso brown zzso tissue system has an important role in the regulation of body zzso Although it may be possible to create laboratory conditions in which mice with zzso zzso can survive in a modestly cooled environment, data overwhelmingly support the conclusion that the zzso system has evolved to maintain body temperature at zzso The zzso to this conclusion is that any influence zzso might have on body weight regulation is a secondary zzso The idea that BAT prevents obesity by burning off excess energy to maintain energy balance seems incompatible with evolutionary zzso zzso humans spent an enormous amount of energy either running to catch their meal or avoiding becoming a meal zzso consequently, there was no zzso Nevertheless, although secondary to body temperature regulation, zzso is extraordinarily effective at reducing zzso and insulin resistance in mice and zzso Variation among mice in zzso to zzso obesity is correlated with the induction of brown zzso in traditional white fat zzso zzso Both genetic and cell zzso zzso have shown that the cellular origins of zzso are different from those of zzso brown zzso zzso Do they have different zzso We have analyzed the effects of the early nutritional environment on the induction of brown zzso in zzso fat to test the hypothesis that zzso is primarily involved in body weight zzso Although zzso during zzso severely suppresses zzso at 21 days of age, undernourished mice fed a normal zzso diet ad zzso at weaning recovered their normal zzso and zzso systems as young zzso The function of zzso does not seem to be uniquely devoted to body weight zzso
