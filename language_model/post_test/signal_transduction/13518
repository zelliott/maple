zzso of zzso receptors on zzso B zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso M zzso causes irreversible growth zzso This may be a model for zzso tolerance to self components in the immune zzso zzso zzso stimulation also causes zzso zzso zzso producing zzso which activates protein zzso C, and zzso zzso which causes release of calcium from zzso zzso To better understand the nature of the zzso zzso growth arrest of zzso cells, we have examined the basis for zzso zzso cells in various zzso of the cell cycle were isolated by zzso zzso and their response was evaluated following treatment with either zzso or zzso agents that raise zzso free calcium levels and activate protein zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or the zzso agents did not zzso the cell zzso Instead, growth zzso was solely the result of arrest in the zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso arrest increased with the length of time during which the cells received signaling before reaching the zzso phase arrest zzso zzso efficiency of arrest was achieved after approximately one cell cycle of zzso zzso These results imply that zzso causes zzso arrest of zzso cells by slowly affecting components required for S phase zzso rather than by rapidly zzso such components or by rapidly zzso a suicide zzso zzso zzso stimulation was twice as effective as stimulation via the mimicking zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, although the zzso second zzso zzso and calcium probably play roles in zzso the effects of zzso on zzso cells, other second zzso may also be zzso
