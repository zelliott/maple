In cell signaling systems, the zzso of signaling molecules are generally thought to determine the response to zzso However, the zzso of molecular zzso for example zzso trafficking and protein zzso may also play an important zzso Few studies have systematically examined this relationship between the resting state and zzso Fewer still have investigated the relative contribution of zzso zzso and reaction zzso Here we describe a mathematical framework for modeling the resting state of signaling zzso Among other things, this framework allows zzso concentration zzso to be used in zzso kinetic models, and enables comprehensive characterization of the relationship between the resting state and the cellular response to zzso
