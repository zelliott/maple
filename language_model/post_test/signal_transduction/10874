zzso analysis identified zzso factor family 3 zzso as a gene expressed in zzso zzso cells zzso regulated by zzso zzso and potentially involved in zzso zzso We therefore studied the regulation and function of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso in zzso and zzso mice subjected to chronic zzso duct zzso for 12 zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed higher zzso zzso and protein levels than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is dependent primarily on signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso but the zzso negative regulation known to exist between the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso activity with a zzso zzso or treatment with a growth factor such as zzso growth factor, which increases zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso In contrast, specifically blocking zzso activity with zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso were associated with significantly better migration than zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and defective zzso zzso migration was reversed with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression was limited to zzso and dependent significantly on zzso zzso but was influenced by other factors present after zzso duct zzso zzso results were obtained in normal and diseased human tissue zzso In conclusion the regulation and function of zzso zzso expression is similar to the zzso zzso zzso expression depends primarily on zzso and contributes to zzso migration and wound zzso zzso use of zzso zzso or zzso peptides should exert a therapeutic role in preventing zzso strictures in liver zzso
