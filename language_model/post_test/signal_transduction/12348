In patients with coronary artery disease zzso number and function of zzso zzso cells zzso are zzso The relevant zzso zzso mechanisms responsible for dysfunction of zzso in zzso remain poorly zzso Our goal was to examine the regulation of zzso by zzso and the role of zzso for zzso in zzso Western analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso mediates zzso of zzso after 90 s with a maximum after zzso s in zzso isolated from healthy control subjects, while zzso from patients with zzso are characterized by a temporally delayed and zzso markedly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from patients with zzso display reduced zzso zzso under flow conditions, while zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso construct restores zzso to control levels and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso These data indicate that defects in zzso zzso contribute to the functional impairment of zzso in zzso and that zzso represents a new therapeutic target for functional improvement of zzso zzso in zzso
