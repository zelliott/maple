zzso zzso spore zzso is a process in which zzso zzso spores become competent for zzso cell zzso Using a novel zzso for spore zzso we found that spore zzso was a zzso process whose nutritional requirements differed from those for zzso zzso Although both processes were controlled by zzso zzso efficient spore zzso occurred in conditions that did not support cell zzso In addition, zzso did not require many key regulators of cell cycle progression including the zzso zzso zzso However, two processes essential for cell growth, protein synthesis and signaling through the Ras protein pathway, were required for spore zzso Moreover, increasing Ras protein activity in spores resulted in an accelerated rate of zzso and suggested that zzso of the Ras zzso was zzso for entry into the zzso zzso An early step in zzso commitment, was identified as the point at which spores became zzso destined to complete the zzso process even if the original stimulus for zzso was zzso zzso commitment to zzso required protein synthesis and Ras protein zzso in contrast, zzso events did not require ongoing protein zzso Altogether, these data suggested a model for Ras function during transitions between periods of zzso and cell cycle zzso
