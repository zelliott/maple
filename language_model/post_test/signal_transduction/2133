To date most of the studies involving the maintenance of zzso cell viability have focused on the zzso zzso and zzso factors that inhibit these cells from undergoing programmed cell death or zzso Recently, studies have demonstrated that cell contact also prevents zzso cells from dying via an zzso zzso In this commentary, the role that zzso binding of the cell zzso zzso zzso plays in maintaining zzso cell viability is zzso These studies showed that zzso zzso binding zzso is part of the mechanism through which cell contact maintains cell zzso zzso results in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso prevents a sustained zzso in zzso free calcium zzso which triggers zzso These studies also revealed that zzso growth factor zzso also known as scatter factor zzso zzso cell zzso which leads to a sustained increase in zzso levels and ultimately to cell zzso Based on these studies, this commentary presents a putative mechanism that relates the cellular and molecular mechanism through which basic zzso zzso and zzso interact to regulate zzso levels and ultimately zzso cell zzso
