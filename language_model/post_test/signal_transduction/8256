zzso zzso zzso is an zzso disorder of the hair zzso characterized by inflammatory cell infiltrates around actively growing zzso hair zzso zzso P zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso network and influences immune cell functions through the zzso zzso zzso To better understand the role of SP as an zzso zzso in zzso we studied its expression and effects on immune cells in a zzso mouse model for zzso During early stages of AA development, the number of zzso nerve fibers in skin is increased, compared to zzso zzso However, during advanced stages of zzso the number of zzso nerves and SP protein levels in skin are zzso whereas the expression of the zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso is increased, compared to control zzso In zzso zzso is expressed on zzso zzso and zzso accumulating around affected hair zzso Additional SP supply to the skin of zzso mice leads to a significant increase of mast cell zzso and to accelerated hair zzso zzso zzso accompanied by an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that SP, zzso and zzso serve as important regulators in the molecular signaling network modulating inflammatory response in zzso hair zzso
