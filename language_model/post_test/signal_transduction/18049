It is well accepted that zzso is a human zzso yet its mechanism of action is not zzso zzso cannot be classified as an initiating agent or as a promoter, although altered zzso responsiveness has been proposed as a mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso zzso Based on the hypothesis that zzso exposure results in zzso of both positive and negative regulators of cell zzso this study examined zzso and zzso changes in the zzso response of zzso zzso grown long-term in the maximum tolerated concentration of sodium zzso In response to zzso zzso DNA synthesis and the proportion of cells entering S phase of the cell cycle both were increased in cells grown long-term in zzso compared to control zzso Analysis of positive zzso regulators revealed an increase in the expression of zzso and zzso thereby supporting the hypothesis that zzso increases activity of positive growth zzso In contrast, the activity and expression of zzso were zzso as was the expression of zzso and zzso When negative regulators of proliferation were zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be lower in zzso cells compared to control zzso this result supports a model in which zzso zzso normal regulation of cell zzso Taken together, these data indicate that long-term exposure to sodium zzso creates conditions within the cell consistent with zzso to zzso zzso It is further zzso that the observed changes in zzso signaling proteins contribute to the zzso property of zzso
