Proper zzso channel function often requires specific combinations of zzso alpha and regulatory beta zzso but little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the surface expression of different channel zzso Our studies of zzso zzso channel zzso trafficking reveal an essential quality control function for a trafficking motif present in each of the alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We show that this novel motif for zzso zzso zzso zzso is required at multiple stages of zzso assembly to restrict surface expression to fully assembled and correctly regulated zzso zzso We conclude that exposure of a three zzso acid motif zzso can explain how assembly of an zzso channel complex is coupled to zzso zzso
