zzso zzso is primarily controlled by the zzso influx across the cell membrane during the action zzso zzso and hormones are known to play an important role in controlling the availability of cardiac zzso slow channels and zzso through the zzso signaling systems, such as the zzso zzso system and the zzso zzso zzso This article has reviewed some of the important properties of the zzso signaling systems for the control of zzso channels and how they changed during development, especially in the rat zzso Since the zzso hypothesis was first proposed over 15 years ago, considerable advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms for regulation of zzso slow channels at the molecular zzso During development, the properties of the cardiac zzso channels, as well as the zzso signaling systems, change zzso zzso and zzso Because conflicting data have been reported on the zzso changes in these properties, it is still not clear how the complex zzso function of the zzso channels is gradually integrated during zzso To answer this question, more data, new concepts, and new approaches are zzso
