zzso of gene expression is essential for normal development and cellular zzso zzso events are tightly controlled both zzso and temporally by specific zzso zzso In this study we finely map the zzso targets of the zzso protein across all known and predicted human zzso and characterize the functional consequences of a subset of these binding events using zzso reporter zzso To measure zzso zzso we used zzso an zzso alternative to the zzso method that zzso the zzso fusion zzso and also zzso zzso reporter zzso which provide rapid and quantitative screening of promoters for zzso zzso or repression in living zzso 

In analysis of zzso zzso binding events using a comprehensive DNA zzso of human zzso we observe for the first time that zzso has a strong preference for binding at zzso promoters and unlike zzso zzso these binding events often occur downstream of zzso start zzso zzso between zzso and zzso data reveal this to be true for both zzso indicating it is not a bias of the technology zzso zzso data obtained from zzso reporter zzso also show an unprecedented, high level of zzso of zzso promoters in the presence of the zzso protein zzso 

These data suggest for the first time that zzso provides directional information when zzso is bound at zzso promoters and possible pausing of the zzso protein after initial zzso zzso Also, this combined approach demonstrates the ability to more broadly characterize zzso zzso interactions wherein not only DNA binding sites are discovered, but also the potential of the promoter sequence to respond to zzso is zzso
