The zzso zzso lineage functions as a zzso signaling center in early zzso of sea zzso The zzso lineage releases signals that regulate the zzso of cell fates along the zzso and zzso zzso We tested whether the zzso lineage might also be responsible for differentiation of the zzso zzso axis by observing of the placement of the adult zzso which normally forms only on the left side of the larvae, after removal of the zzso zzso When all of the zzso lineage were removed from zzso of the regular sea zzso zzso zzso between the 16- and zzso zzso the zzso placement of the zzso became zzso However, the immediate zzso of the zzso rescued the normal zzso placement of the zzso indicating that the zzso lineage releases a signal that specifies zzso zzso Additionally, we investigated whether the zzso of zzso polarity of whole zzso in the zzso sea zzso zzso zzso is affected by zzso exposure, which zzso the establishment of zzso asymmetry in a zzso sea zzso zzso derived from normal animal caps combined with zzso zzso descendants were defective in normal zzso placement of the zzso suggesting that zzso interferes with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of two sand dollar species zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso of zzso placement of the zzso by either removal of the zzso lineage or zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso lineage is involved in zzso of zzso polarity in the regular sea zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso the normal zzso patterning by affecting zzso zzso
