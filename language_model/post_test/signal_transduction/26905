The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are known to induce zzso zzso competence for genetic zzso For both zzso direct identification of the native peptides has not been zzso The fact that zzso zzso activity was recently observed in a chemically defined medium devoid of zzso as mentioned in an accompanying paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Morrison, zzso zzso zzso zzso provided ideal conditions for native zzso zzso To search for the zzso identity, culture zzso were filtered to select for peptides of less than 3 zzso followed by zzso zzso One zzso not detected in the zzso of a zzso deletion zzso was identified by tandem mass zzso zzso fragmentation as identical to the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso processing did not require zzso a zzso involved in processing or import of bacterial small zzso zzso since zzso deletion had no zzso effect on zzso production or on synthetic zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso was also zzso A reporter zzso for zzso activity zzso as well as zzso analysis of zzso revealed that zzso was not present at zzso zzso In addition, a zzso with deletion of the zzso gene zzso produced zzso zzso levels similar to those of a zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso production is a natural phenomenon that may occur in the absence of natural zzso zzso activity and that the zzso zzso is an zzso processed form of zzso possibly the active zzso zzso This is the first report of direct identification of a zzso zzso
