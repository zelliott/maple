Both zzso zzso zzso and low intensity zzso ultrasound zzso exposure have been reported to accelerate fracture zzso We hypothesized that these two pathways are zzso To verify this hypothesis, we examined the regulation of zzso production by zzso exposure zzso wave of zzso repeating at zzso zzso 20 minutes) in mouse zzso cell line, zzso The production of zzso in zzso was zzso by zzso which was zzso at 60 zzso in comparison with zzso zzso Then we evaluated the expression of zzso zzso zzso which is a critical zzso for zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso the expression of zzso zzso in a time dependent zzso In addition, zzso production by zzso was drastically suppressed by a selective inhibitor of zzso These results provide strong evidence that zzso production in zzso is dependent upon the induction of zzso zzso expression by zzso and offer a zzso insight into how zzso zzso fracture zzso
