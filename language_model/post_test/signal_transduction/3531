The expression of the cell recognition zzso zzso zzso is generally associated with the functions of zzso zzso In the embryonic cortex, however, we find it expressed by zzso zzso zone zzso zzso In contrast to previous findings in the developing zzso zzso transgenic zzso in the early cortical zzso promotes proliferation and expands the precursor pool at the expense of zzso At later zzso when zzso levels zzso however, zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression in the zzso is zzso related to zzso and plays a role in a feedback control zzso regulating the orderly progression of cortical zzso The modified zzso profile therefore results in delayed zzso as judged by zzso in upper and lower layer marker expression and by zzso birth dating, indicating that, in this transgenic model, increased zzso levels counteract zzso precursor zzso These effects also occur in primary cultures and are reproduced by addition of an zzso fusion protein to wild type zzso Together, these data indicate a completely novel function for zzso Parallel changes in the generation of the zzso zzso zzso and in the expression of the zzso zzso factor indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso plays a role in this zzso consistent with previous in zzso reports that zzso is a zzso zzso
