zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins represent key elements of the zzso zzso zzso is the most recently characterized member of the zzso family with an undefined in zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso exhibits a limited tissue zzso and zzso protein has not been detected in any mouse or primary human tissue so zzso The purpose of the present study was to analyze the expression of zzso in rat muscle and human skeletal muscle cells and assess involvement of zzso in initial insulin zzso Using zzso and zzso the specific expression of zzso protein could be demonstrated in rat zzso and cardiac muscle and human skeletal muscle cells, but it was not significantly zzso in zzso and zzso A prominent zzso of zzso was observed in heart and zzso muscle of zzso rats, an animal model of the zzso zzso In human skeletal muscle cells, both zzso and zzso are rapidly zzso on zzso in response to insulin, whereas essentially no zzso zzso of zzso was observed in response to both insulin and zzso Instead, a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso subjected to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso protein is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle in a fiber type specific zzso Our data suggest that zzso does not function as a zzso of the insulin and the zzso zzso in primary muscle cells but may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
