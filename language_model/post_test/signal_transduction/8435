Plants contain a large number of zzso with different zzso These channels generally conduct water, but some additionally conduct zzso zzso and/or zzso The experimental evidence and molecular basis for the transport of a given zzso the validation with molecular dynamics simulations and the zzso impact of the selectivity are reviewed zzso The zzso zzso zzso is most important for zzso selection, but the exact pore requirements for efficient zzso of small zzso remain difficult to zzso zzso growth zzso are valuable for screening zzso selectivity and are explicitly shown for hydrogen zzso and zzso a transport analog of zzso Independent zzso need to address the relevance of different zzso for each channel in its zzso zzso This is emphasized by the fact that several plant NIP channels, which conduct several zzso are specifically involved in the transport of zzso such as zzso acid, zzso or zzso acid in zzso
