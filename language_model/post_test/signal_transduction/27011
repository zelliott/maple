The binding of zzso 2 zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso zzso of cellular zzso In a previous study, we have shown that zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso physically and functionally associates with the zzso beta chain zzso zzso To further investigate a role of zzso in zzso zzso we analyzed a mouse zzso line, in which zzso is not expressed zzso We observed that in this cell line, zzso zzso zzso of at least two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, stimulation of this cell line with zzso also zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso seems to be selective for stimulation with zzso or zzso since stimulation with zzso fails to activate zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence for the physical association of zzso with zzso zzso Taken together with previous results, our current study suggests that different zzso each of which is expressed in a zzso manner, can participate in the zzso signal zzso
