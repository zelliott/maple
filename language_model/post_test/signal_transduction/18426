zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to determine whether these compounds could behave as zzso binding zzso for the zzso zzso zzso in rat brain zzso zzso displacement of zzso indicated that the apparent affinity of these compounds for the zzso zzso was similar to that of the parent compound, zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso which showed a zzso loss of zzso The zzso and zzso compounds behaved as zzso against the zzso zzso zzso in zzso of G proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulation of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were poor zzso for zzso zzso and both compounds failed to antagonize the zzso regulation of zzso zzso After incubation with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso formed zzso bonds with the zzso zzso as evidenced by the loss of specific binding of zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the log zzso curve for zzso zzso binding was shifted to the right, indicating that loss of receptors compromised signal zzso zzso These zzso binding zzso might be useful tools for the investigation of tolerance and zzso zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso
