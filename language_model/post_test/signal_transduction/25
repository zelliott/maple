The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a bacterial zzso zzso product of zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of a number of zzso signaling zzso From our previous experiments, it was found that zzso was expressed slightly in zzso cells zzso zzso these experiments were designed to determine the function of zzso in zzso and zzso during the inflammatory response caused by infections and zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to 100 zzso zzso coli zzso and artificial wounds were induced in the right first zzso of the zzso of zzso In addition, a zzso change in the zzso cells was observed after zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with the nuclear factor zzso zzso promoter binding zzso 

The level of zzso expression increased strongly 30 minutes after the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed many extensions of the zzso processes after zzso zzso zzso was expressed along the zzso zzso and zzso layer in rat teeth after an artificial zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso 

We report for the first time that zzso is expressed temporally in infected zzso and may participate in the zzso response through zzso signaling in zzso zzso
