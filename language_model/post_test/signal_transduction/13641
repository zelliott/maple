zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agents zzso are clinically used to treat anemia in patients with cancer receiving zzso After clinical trials reporting increased adverse events and/or reduced survival in zzso patients, concerns have been raised about the potential role of zzso in promoting tumor zzso possibly through tumor cell zzso However, evidence is lacking on the ability of EPO to directly affect cancer zzso cells, which are thought to be responsible for tumor progression and zzso We found that breast cancer zzso cells zzso isolated from patient tumors express the EPO zzso and respond to EPO treatment with increased proliferation and zzso zzso EPO stimulation increased zzso resistance to zzso agents and activated cellular pathways responsible for survival and drug zzso Specifically, the zzso and zzso pathways were activated in zzso at early time points following EPO treatment, whereas zzso levels increased at later zzso In zzso EPO administration zzso the effects of zzso agents on zzso zzso tumor zzso and promoted zzso progression both in the presence and in the absence of chemotherapy zzso Altogether, these results indicate that EPO acts directly on zzso by zzso specific survival zzso resulting in zzso protection from chemotherapy and enhanced tumor zzso
