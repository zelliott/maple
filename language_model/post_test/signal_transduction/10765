Many different zzso signaling pathways are known but, for most, it is unclear whether they can generate zzso cell zzso Here we use zzso analysis of zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso from the zzso in discrete bursts of zzso This zzso process has a 1 hour period, occurs without cell division, and requires a localized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets are zzso activated in rings of three cells, zzso the zzso pattern of zzso Surprisingly, widespread zzso of the relevant zzso zzso zzso is compatible with robust zzso zzso Moreover, although zzso zzso becomes limiting after only two zzso artificially zzso its zzso generates up to six additional cycles, revealing a rhythmic underlying zzso These findings illustrate how zzso signaling and cell movements can generate multiple cycles of a cell behavior, despite individual cells experiencing only one cycle of zzso zzso
