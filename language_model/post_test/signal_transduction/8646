While premature zzso fusion, or zzso is a relatively common condition, the cause is often zzso zzso are associated with growth plate fusion of zzso zzso In the following study, we explore the previously unknown significance of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was examined in zzso fusing zzso and patent zzso mouse zzso zzso by quantitative zzso Next, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta knockout zzso zzso mice was zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso the effects of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso on gene zzso zzso and zzso differentiation were examined in zzso Finally, in zzso experiments were performed in which zzso was administered zzso to the mouse zzso zzso showed that increased zzso but not zzso transcript abundance temporally coincided with zzso zzso zzso The zzso but not zzso mouse exhibited delayed zzso zzso zzso In zzso addition of zzso zzso enhanced both zzso and zzso differentiation in zzso zzso cells, effects zzso by zzso Finally, in zzso application of zzso significantly diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso signaling through zzso but not zzso is associated with and necessary for normal mouse zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso and/or zzso differentiation within the zzso zzso zzso
