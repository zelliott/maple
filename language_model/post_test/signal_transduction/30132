Cell death by zzso is characterized by specific zzso changes, including the exposure of multiple zzso expected to tag the dying cell for prompt recognition by zzso In zzso conditions, an efficient clearance is assured by the redundant interaction between zzso cell zzso and multiple zzso molecules present on the engulfing cell zzso This review concentrates on the molecular interactions operating in zzso and zzso systems for zzso cell recognition, as well as on the consequences of their zzso Furthermore, some cellular models where the exposure of the zzso zzso zzso a classical hallmark of the zzso zzso is not followed by cell death will be zzso
