Current models of affective disorders zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso however treatments targeted at these zzso or hormones have led to imperfect resolution of symptoms, suggesting that the zzso of affective disorders is incompletely zzso Until now zzso have not been considered as possible contributors to affective zzso zzso represent a family of compounds derived from vitamin A that perform a large number of functions, many via the vitamin A product, zzso zzso This signaling zzso binds to specific zzso acid receptors in the brain which, like the zzso and zzso hormone zzso are part of the nuclear zzso zzso and regulate gene zzso Research in the field of zzso acid in the zzso has focused on the developing brain, in part zzso by the observation that zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso acid used in the treatment of zzso is highly zzso for the zzso More recent work has suggested that zzso acid may influence the adult zzso animal studies indicated that the administration of zzso is associated with zzso in behavior as well as zzso of zzso in the zzso Clinical evidence for an association between zzso and depression includes case reports in the literature, studies of health care databases, and other zzso A preliminary PET study in human subjects showed that zzso was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso Several studies have shown that the molecular components required for zzso acid signaling are expressed in the adult zzso the overlap of brain areas implicated in zzso acid function and stress and depression suggest that zzso could play a role in affective zzso This report reviews the evidence in this area and describes several systems that may be targets of zzso acid and which contribute to the zzso of zzso
