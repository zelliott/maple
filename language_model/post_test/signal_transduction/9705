Dynamic changes in gene expression are tightly controlled during development, as a single zzso zzso gives rise to distinct cell zzso The establishment and maintenance of these diverse zzso programs rely on changes of zzso state, mainly through zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes participate in setting apart active and inactive genes by respectively zzso and zzso key zzso regulators in different cell zzso Over the last decade, our understanding of the zzso mechanisms underlying their activities has greatly improved, but the signals targeting these proteins to specific regions of the zzso are still poorly zzso particularly in zzso Recent findings highlight the highly dynamic activities of zzso and zzso complexes in zzso Surprisingly, although their role in zzso regulation is deeply zzso during evolution, the time sequence in which they act seems to vary across zzso
