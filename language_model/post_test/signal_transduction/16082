Despite the long-established presence of zzso zzso receptors at zzso sites zzso their functional roles remain poorly zzso zzso influencing the concentration and time course of zzso in the zzso space, such as the topography of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso are expected to affect zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used in zzso and in zzso zzso recordings to assess the properties, functional relevance and zzso of a persistent zzso current zzso by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso We found that ambient zzso of a zzso origin activates zzso to mediate a persistent zzso current zzso zzso zzso which zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso acid, enhanced zzso zzso and zzso activity, supporting an zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso challenge known to increase zzso firing activity and to induce zzso zzso including reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso resulted in blunted zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso strength, and increased zzso zzso Taken together, our studies support the view that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso contributes to regulation of zzso zzso activity, contributing in turn to zzso zzso responses during a zzso zzso
