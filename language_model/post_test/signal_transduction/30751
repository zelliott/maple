zzso growth factor zzso induction of zzso transition of retinal zzso zzso zzso cells has been implicated to be an important event during the development of zzso zzso The present study was conducted to examine whether zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mechanism of the zzso effect was also investigated by studying major zzso signaling including zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso were exposed to various zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso effects of zzso on collagen type I zzso and zzso zzso expression induced by zzso was evaluated by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso synthesis was evaluated by the concentration of the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso The protein levels of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell migration was evaluated by an in zzso zzso zzso The influence of zzso on cell viability was evaluated by the zzso conversion of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the levels of zzso and protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also apparent in zzso cell zzso cell viability was zzso zzso induced sequential zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso early zzso and zzso and late zzso zzso but had no influence on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can significantly prevent zzso zzso zzso transition of zzso cells, and zzso cell zzso This may be achieved through the prevention of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent nuclear zzso On the other hand, zzso does not alter the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso is unlikely to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso
