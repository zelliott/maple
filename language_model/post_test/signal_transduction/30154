zzso zzso zzso play a key role in gut zzso and are critical zzso cells preventing the inflammatory zzso zzso induced in mice following oral infection with zzso zzso In this zzso inflammatory model, zzso T zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the infected zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we assessed the mechanisms accounting for the ability of zzso to zzso the inflammatory activity of these zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso from zzso mice, or zzso or zzso mice infected with zzso zzso completely zzso the development of the lethal zzso in recipient mice orally infected with zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice, the zzso alpha beta zzso alpha beta subset of primed zzso isolated from zzso zzso mice, zzso increased amount of zzso zzso interact with the LP zzso T zzso zzso their production of inflammatory zzso such as zzso and reduce their zzso zzso These effects are linked to the zzso of zzso and are correlated with a shift in the balance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in LP zzso T zzso
