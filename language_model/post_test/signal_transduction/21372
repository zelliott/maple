Critical roles for zzso oxide zzso in regulating cell and tissue physiology are broadly zzso but aspects remain to be zzso In the zzso zzso NO zzso activity is high in zzso zzso containing motor networks for feeding and zzso where a zzso zzso current zzso is also prominent in many zzso We examined effects of NO on zzso using zzso methods developed to analyze zzso signaling in the live zzso focusing on the identified zzso giant zzso of the feeding zzso NO donors enhanced the zzso response to injected zzso by an averaged zzso In zzso measures, NO increased the current zzso by zzso injection without altering either apparent zzso binding affinity or zzso of current zzso NO did not zzso alter levels of native zzso or synthesis or degradation rates as zzso in both current zzso and zzso rate of zzso responses to zzso zzso NO actions were not exerted by zzso zzso as they were not zzso by zzso analogue nor blocked by zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso NO zzso of zzso was broadly distributed among many other zzso of the feeding motor network in the zzso zzso However, NO did not affect a second type of zzso found in locomotor zzso of the pedal zzso These results suggest that NO acts through a novel mechanism to regulate the gain of zzso zzso pathways that activate zzso and may thereby affect the set points of feeding network zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
