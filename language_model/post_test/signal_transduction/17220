The mechanism underlying the zzso between multiple G zzso receptors remains poorly zzso We previously reported that zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso signaling in zzso slices and promotes behavioral responses induced by D1 zzso zzso Here, using human embryonic kidney zzso cells expressing D1 and zzso we have analyzed the mechanism underlying zzso zzso of D1 zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso showed that zzso and D1 receptors are partly zzso in the cells, and zzso experiments revealed a molecular complex of zzso and D1 zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso an zzso zzso enhanced zzso production induced by D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although this zzso effect of zzso stimulation was not affected by zzso blockade of zzso zzso increase, it was blocked by zzso of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso 7, a zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso neither zzso zzso nor zzso depletion affected zzso production induced by D1 stimulation zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso another zzso zzso reduced zzso production induced by D1 stimulation alone, but spared its zzso by zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that, through complex formation with zzso zzso signaling directs the D1 zzso through zzso to be coupled to zzso an zzso zzso distinct from those used by the D1 zzso alone, in zzso zzso
