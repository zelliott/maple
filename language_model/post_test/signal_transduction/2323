zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso linked to the development of zzso zzso and a rare B cell lymphoma, primary zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso encodes zzso which is a protein with low but significant zzso to members of the zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso family responsible for regulating zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso C, Weiss zzso and Chang zzso zzso Science, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso as measured using an zzso zzso reporter construct zzso with zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso also suppresses genes under zzso regulatory control as shown by zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso however, no direct zzso or zzso interactions characteristic for zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso clones expressing zzso grew in soft zzso and at low serum zzso lost contact zzso and formed tumors after injection into nude mice indicating that zzso has the properties of a viral zzso Since zzso is primarily expressed in zzso B cells, not zzso zzso cells, this study suggests that zzso is a transforming zzso active in B cell zzso that may provide a unique immune escape mechanism for infected zzso This data is consistent with tumor zzso pathways serving a dual function as host cell zzso zzso
