Complex cell zzso are triggered by chemical zzso that bind to membrane receptors and alter zzso signal zzso However, future zzso medical devices and other zzso that incorporate living cells as system components will require zzso mechanisms that are much more zzso zzso zzso and easily integrated with solid-state zzso Here we describe a magnetic zzso that activates a zzso zzso mechanism normally switched on by binding of zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso and bound to zzso zzso zzso when exposed to magnetic fields, and zzso zzso to zzso attraction in the plane of the zzso Associated zzso of the bound receptors acts as a zzso cellular switch that directly zzso magnetic zzso into zzso cellular zzso with rapid system responsiveness and zzso dynamic zzso This technique may represent a new zzso mechanism for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
