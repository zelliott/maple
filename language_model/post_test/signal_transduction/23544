There is a widening recognition that cancer cells are products of complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation are increasingly described as zzso network zzso Here we propose that zzso transformation is a zzso process, where an initial increase of system plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of zzso as a model of cellular zzso We describe the hallmarks of increased system plasticity of early, tumor initiating cells, such as increased noise, zzso zzso and zzso zzso physical zzso cell zzso and network zzso Finally, we argue that the large structural changes of molecular networks during cancer development zzso a rather different targeting strategy in early and late phase of zzso Plastic networks of early phase cancer development need a central hit, while rigid networks of late stage primary tumors or established zzso should be attacked by the network influence strategy, such as by zzso zzso or zzso zzso Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis and zzso since their dormant and rapidly zzso forms may have more zzso or more plastic networks, zzso The extremely high ability of cancer stem cells to change the zzso of their networks may be their key zzso The application of early zzso zzso drugs to late-stage patients may be a reason of many failures in zzso zzso Our hypotheses presented here zzso the need for zzso zzso therapies applying the correct ratio of central hits and network influences - in an zzso zzso
