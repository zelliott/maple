zzso transfer protein alpha zzso zzso in the supply of zzso zzso required for many cellular events including zzso C zzso beta and gamma signaling by zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C has been known to zzso zzso signaling by zzso receptors and zzso zzso although the molecular target has not been identified in most zzso In each case zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso stimulation by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor, zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso at zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized in a small pocket between the zzso loop and the rest of the protein and was not zzso in either the zzso or zzso structures of zzso To allow zzso at zzso a distinct structural form is zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso shifted the equilibrium to this form, which could be resolved on native zzso The zzso profile observed by size exclusion zzso of zzso zzso from rat brain or in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is structurally distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to deliver its zzso zzso although it could deliver zzso We conclude that the zzso structure has to relax to allow access to the zzso site, and this may occur at the membrane surface where zzso delivery is required for zzso zzso zzso
