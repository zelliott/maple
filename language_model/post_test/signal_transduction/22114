zzso was identified as one of the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso cells compared with those in the parental zzso zzso Exposure to zzso at 30 zzso activated zzso zzso zzso signaling markedly from zzso up to 48 h in the zzso cells compared with that in the parental cells and resulted in an overt difference in growth at those zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso in the zzso cells was sustained at a zzso whereas it was zzso in the parental cells after the zzso zzso zzso which is one of the target genes for zzso and related to zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in the zzso cells inhibited growth, as in the parental cells, and attenuated the resistance to zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso significantly canceled the resistance to zzso in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso targeting the zzso and zzso genes could zzso zzso at least in part, the resistance to zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso
