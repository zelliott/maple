In this review, we address some recent developments in the field of bacterial protein zzso focusing specifically on zzso and zzso zzso We present an overview of recent studies outlining the scope of zzso processes that are regulated by zzso ranging from cell cycle, growth, cell zzso to zzso zzso phenomena, and zzso zzso emphasis is placed on zzso tuberculosis as a showcase zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso to illustrate the importance of protein zzso in zzso zzso We argue that bacterial zzso and zzso zzso have a distinctive feature of zzso multiple zzso and might thus represent integration zzso in the signaling zzso Some open questions regarding the evolutionary benefits of relaxed zzso selectivity of these zzso are treated, as well as the notion of zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso We also argue that zzso events for which an immediate regulatory effect is not clearly established should not be dismissed as unimportant, as they may have a role in zzso with other zzso zzso Finally, recently developed methods for studying protein zzso networks in bacteria are briefly zzso
