zzso increased expression of zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso that is zzso inhibited by zzso zzso drugs, is a major early zzso event in the genesis of human colon zzso We report that, in addition to inducing expression of zzso colon zzso further target the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso transcript and protein are both highly expressed by normal zzso zzso but are nearly zzso in colon zzso Using gene zzso to restore zzso expression in colon cancer cells strongly zzso the ability of these cells to form tumors in zzso mice and demonstrates zzso to have functional colon cancer tumor zzso zzso In interrogating the mechanism for zzso expression loss in colon cancer, we determined that zzso zzso expression is directly controlled and strongly induced by zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso These findings thus delineate an zzso zzso that zzso colon cancer suppression, a zzso that is activated by zzso and zzso by zzso
