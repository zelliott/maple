The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its selective type I zzso zzso are expressed in the embryonic mouse neural tube, where they may be involved in zzso and neural tube zzso We examined here the early expression and potential actions of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were first detected by zzso in stage zzso zzso (18 hours after zzso Two distinct zzso precursor zzso were zzso One zzso both growth zzso hormone and zzso whereas the other zzso only full-length zzso Unlike that in the adult, the latter represented the zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso were restricted to neural zzso zzso gene expression was observed mainly in the zzso zone in the zzso parts of the zzso zzso zzso and anterior spinal zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was localized exclusively in zzso cells in the zzso parts of the zzso and entire spinal zzso Most zzso zzso cells were characterized as zzso zzso Exposure of early zzso to zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso neural zzso reduced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in the early development of the embryonic zzso neural zzso
