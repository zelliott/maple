zzso zzso transplantation may successfully restore zzso in type 1 diabetic zzso However, successful zzso requires transplantation of a sufficient number of zzso usually requiring two or more zzso During the isolation process and following clinical zzso zzso are subjected to severe adverse conditions that impair survival and ultimately contribute to graft zzso Here, we have mapped the major zzso zzso pathways that may mediate human zzso loss during isolation and following zzso zzso We found that the isolation procedure zzso recruits two pathways consisting of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways without recruitment of zzso zzso the zzso for 48 h after isolation allows for the activated pathways to return to background levels, with expression of zzso becoming zzso These data indicate that isolation and zzso recruit different death zzso zzso strategies might be rationally developed to avoid possible synergistic zzso of these pathways in zzso zzso loss during isolation and following zzso
