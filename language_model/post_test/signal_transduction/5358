The clinical efficacy of exercise training in individuals with heart failure is well established, but the mechanism underlying such efficacy has remained zzso An imbalance between cardiac zzso and zzso is implicated in the transition to heart zzso We investigated the effects of exercise training on cardiac zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats fed a zzso diet from 6 weeks of age were assigned to sedentary or exercise zzso groups at 9 zzso Exercise training attenuated the development of heart failure and increased survival, without affecting blood pressure, at 18 zzso It also attenuated left zzso zzso without a reduction in left zzso mass or impairment of cardiac zzso zzso zzso was increased and zzso zzso density was decreased in the heart of sedentary rats, and these effects were attenuated by zzso Exercise zzso increases in the zzso of zzso and zzso target of zzso observed in the heart of sedentary rats, whereas it inhibited the zzso of zzso gene expression apparent in these zzso The abundance of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso whereas those of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso were increased, in the heart of sedentary rats, and all of these effects were prevented by zzso Thus, exercise training had a beneficial effect on cardiac zzso and attenuated heart failure in zzso rats, with these effects likely being attributable to the zzso of left zzso zzso and restoration of coronary zzso through zzso of zzso zzso target of zzso zzso
