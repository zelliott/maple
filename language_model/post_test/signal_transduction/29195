Multiple signaling pathways are engaged by the type I and II zzso zzso but their specific roles and possible coordination in the generation of zzso biological responses remain zzso We provide evidence that zzso of zzso zzso is required for zzso engagement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data establish that zzso activity is essential for zzso of key zzso and zzso zzso which have important functional consequences in the induction of zzso zzso Such effects of the zzso zzso are unrelated to regulatory activities on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso By contrast, they reflect regulatory activities on zzso translation via direct control of the zzso zzso In studies using zzso and zzso double knockout cells, we found that the absence of zzso zzso results in dramatic reduction in zzso zzso responses, establishing a critical role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso receptors zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso by allowing zzso translation of zzso genes and, ultimately, the induction of the biological effects of zzso
