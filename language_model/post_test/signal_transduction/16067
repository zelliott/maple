Studies in zzso have shown that the zzso domain zzso domain zzso zzso zzso is essential for proper neural development via zzso of bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso In contrast, the zzso budding zzso zzso and human zzso have been shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso and the relationship between zzso metabolism and zzso signaling remain zzso Here we report evidence that the zzso zzso cascade in zzso can regulate zzso zzso most likely by affecting the function of the nuclear zzso zzso expression levels of either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso affected wing vein formation in a manner suggesting a negative effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, both genes exhibit genetic interaction with zzso signaling zzso zzso and can affect the levels of zzso against zzso zzso Although changing zzso expression levels did not have an obvious effect on overall nuclear envelope zzso as has been shown for zzso zzso the nuclear import machinery components zzso and zzso were zzso and membrane zzso zzso was altered in cells zzso zzso Considering the known genetic interaction between zzso complex zzso and zzso in zzso and the recently reported requirement for components from the zzso zzso complex in the nuclear zzso of zzso Mad zzso & Xu zzso it is likely that the role of zzso zzso in regulating membrane zzso zzso is zzso and is critical for normal zzso zzso
