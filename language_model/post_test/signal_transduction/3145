zzso zzso zzso via the key signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors, is essential for embryonic development and zzso While the biological relevance of zzso signaling to cancer is well established, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which signaling zzso of this zzso zzso zzso was discovered as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso through a mouse genetic zzso Here we report that zzso directly associates with zzso and zzso zzso function in a zzso zzso By zzso microscope and zzso we detected interaction between zzso and zzso Using zzso reporter gene analysis, we found that zzso can suppress zzso zzso activity in wild type but not zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso expression reduced the nuclear zzso of zzso in wild type but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso motif in the zzso we showed that zzso has zzso zzso The dominant negative form of zzso was unable to suppress zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide evidence to support that zzso zzso regulates zzso activity in a zzso zzso
