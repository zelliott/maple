The cell cycle is exquisitely controlled by multiple sequential regulatory zzso to ensure zzso Here we demonstrate that the final step in division, the physical separation of daughter cells, is controlled by a member of the zzso gene zzso Specifically, we have identified three zzso sites within zzso that control its association with zzso These zzso are executed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso itself zzso zzso zzso of these signals is essential during zzso because zzso that prevent zzso of zzso and/or zzso binding to zzso also cause defects in the completion of zzso Using chemical genetic and zzso approaches it is shown that selective zzso of zzso zzso cells at the final stages of zzso This arrest is associated with persistent zzso zzso at the zzso and a delay in zzso ring zzso This study therefore identifies a new regulatory mechanism that controls exit from zzso which has implications for zzso
