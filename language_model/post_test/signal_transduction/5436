The roles played by signaling pathways and neural activity during the development of circuits have been studied in several different zzso However, the mechanisms involved in maintaining zzso integrity once circuits are established are less well zzso despite their potential relevance to zzso We demonstrate that maintenance of adult zzso zzso sensory zzso requires zzso zzso zzso When activity is zzso development occurs zzso but zzso zzso in zzso These zzso effects can be compensated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of activated zzso or zzso of zzso zzso also affect zzso stability, demonstrating a role for zzso signaling in zzso This is supported by our observation that activated adult zzso are capable of increased zzso release, and its targeted expression can protect zzso against zzso The role of zzso signaling in this process is zzso and may act on cellular mechanisms that regulate zzso or synaptic zzso Together, we provide evidence that zzso is a key sensor involved in neural circuit integrity, maintaining zzso stability through neural activity and the zzso zzso
