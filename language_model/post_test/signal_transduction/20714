zzso free calcium concentration zzso of zzso from zzso zzso was measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fluorescent dye zzso Low zzso of the zzso occurred at pH zzso and its subsequent zzso was zzso zzso was promoted by an external pH of zzso and significant zzso to zzso achieved by adjustment of the internal pH to zzso which was near the optimum of the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso with the average cell calcium concentration of zzso increasing from an initial value of 2 zzso to 50 zzso zzso cell zzso during zzso of the steady state after 30 zzso at which time zzso was unchanged at 20 zzso but increased to 182 zzso at 2-6 h exposure to zzso zzso zzso similar changes in zzso were found in zzso derived from zzso samples exposed to zzso over the same period of zzso The location of zzso was determined in zzso zzso and characterized using zzso markers and electron zzso In 32 h zzso preloaded with zzso for 6 zzso zzso was located principally in the zzso with lower zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso was not released by zzso zzso or the calcium zzso zzso from any zzso zzso obtained from zzso on zzso zzso nor from preparations of zzso or zzso zzso except in the case of zzso where rapid release of the zzso was achieved by the addition of zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso zzso greatly reduced zzso when addition preceded that of zzso zzso cultures showed massive novel protein zzso 2 h after addition of the zzso which was virtually eliminated by zzso whilst 1 h and 4-6 h protein zzso which were also present to some degree in zzso controls, were substantially zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso confirmed that zzso zzso had enhanced capacity for zzso zzso relative to corresponding zzso cells and that complex differential changes in such zzso occurred during zzso of the zzso zzso
