zzso interference zzso pathways regulate zzso and differentiation of embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a vital component of zzso zzso complex zzso and the only zzso protein with zzso zzso We generated zzso zzso cells by conditional gene zzso zzso zzso cells are defective in the zzso gene zzso and are significantly compromised in zzso of mature zzso The zzso rate of zzso zzso cells is affected due to failure of zzso of zzso by zzso specific zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Interestingly, unlike zzso and zzso zzso cells, they differentiate to all three germ layers both in zzso and in zzso However, early differentiation of zzso zzso cells is delayed by 2-4 days as indicated by persistence of higher levels of zzso zzso markers during zzso Further, appearance of zzso and differentiation markers is also delayed during the zzso In this study we show that zzso is essential for normal zzso and zzso Also, our data suggest that zzso and differentiation of zzso cells are regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso
