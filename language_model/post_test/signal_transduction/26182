zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a structurally related group of hormones that also includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an zzso known to zzso zzso insulin zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is necessary for early zzso zzso and a similar role for zzso in regulating embryonic zzso differentiation seems zzso Here we studied the role of zzso signaling in zzso differentiation in the embryonic mouse zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso was investigated by zzso and zzso zzso signaling was inhibited in cultured embryonic zzso using zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso or small interfering zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells and their zzso were studied by zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both detected in the embryonic zzso by embryonic day zzso and then persisted throughout zzso zzso was generally zzso with zzso by zzso The zzso zzso was typically zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso against either zzso zzso or zzso zzso both inhibited the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or its zzso also led to a decrease in the number of zzso and zzso cells in the cultured embryonic zzso The number of zzso and zzso cells, representative of developing pancreatic zzso cells and zzso respectively, was also zzso 

zzso signaling may play a role in early embryonic zzso differentiation to form zzso cells or zzso
