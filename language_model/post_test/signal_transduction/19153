zzso is an adapter protein regulating signaling and focal zzso assembly that has been linked to zzso potential in many zzso zzso of zzso has been noted in aggressive zzso zzso binding through the focal zzso complex is important in zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso pressure in zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso Neither head and neck zzso nor zzso have been studied in this zzso We hypothesized that zzso would play a role in modulating zzso cancer zzso both at baseline and under conditions of increased zzso zzso Using zzso tongue zzso cancer cells zzso zzso with either an empty selection zzso or zzso expression and selection zzso we studied zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso in cells maintained for 30 zzso under ambient or 15 zzso increased pressure zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso 121 zzso zzso of that observed in zzso cells zzso zzso 6, P zzso zzso under ambient zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 118 zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, P zzso zzso of baseline in zzso cells, similar to its effect in the parental line, and induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, increased pressure did not stimulate zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso further in zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell zzso may be increased by zzso or by zzso zzso by zzso pressure during surgical manipulation or growth within a constraining zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso and minimal tumor manipulation during surgical zzso may be important therapeutic zzso
