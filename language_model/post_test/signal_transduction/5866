zzso scaffold complexes are a key mechanism by which a common signaling zzso can serve many different zzso zzso a signaling zzso to a specific zzso environment not only ensures that the zzso is near its relevant targets, but also zzso this activity to prevent indiscriminate zzso of other zzso One family of diverse, well-studied scaffolding proteins are the zzso zzso proteins zzso These zzso proteins form zzso complexes that integrate zzso signaling with other pathways and signaling zzso In this review, we focus on recent advances in the zzso of zzso zzso
