zzso trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors is critical to zzso signaling and zzso synaptic zzso Although the importance of zzso zzso in zzso trafficking in zzso is well established, the contribution of the zzso raft zzso has been little zzso Here, we show that zzso an zzso protein that associates with zzso zzso and the main coat protein of zzso binds to and zzso with zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso The interaction with zzso controls the rate of zzso zzso zzso thereby regulating expression of the zzso at the cell zzso zzso with a role for zzso in zzso trafficking, we show that zzso associate with zzso zzso in the brain and that their zzso zzso is zzso in both zzso cells and zzso by zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso an effect that is abolished in cells expressing zzso zzso lacking intact zzso binding zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice show enhanced zzso zzso zzso and prolonged zzso zzso in response to stimulation with zzso zzso a group I zzso zzso Together, these findings underscore the importance of zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that this zzso might play an important role in zzso formation and zzso
