zzso immunity was formerly thought to be a zzso immune response characterized by zzso However, innate immunity has considerable specificity and is capable of discriminating between pathogens and zzso zzso of pathogens is zzso by a set of pattern recognition zzso which recognize zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso shared by broad classes of zzso thereby successfully defending zzso and zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in innate immunity by recognizing a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso composed of a zzso domain attached to zzso zzso However, they use a different zzso zzso a zzso recognition domain zzso is responsible for zzso and a zzso domain for zzso These two zzso zzso are pattern recognition zzso and upon recognition of the infectious agent, they trigger the zzso of the zzso zzso through attached zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso complement system, consisting of the zzso complex and zzso is present in zzso our closest zzso relatives, and functions in an zzso zzso We isolated several zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and several zzso in zzso and lower zzso and zzso we discuss the molecular evolution of these zzso Based on these findings, it seems likely that the complement system played a pivotal role in innate immunity before the evolution of an acquired immune system in zzso zzso
