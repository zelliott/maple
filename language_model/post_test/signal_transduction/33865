The present study investigated the ability of zzso associated protein A1 zzso a major component of lung zzso to bind and serve as a signal in human cultured zzso zzso By using zzso zzso analysis with zzso we consistently identified two zzso zzso interacting proteins (55 and 200 zzso We found that the zzso zzso protein was present in zzso zzso We also showed by indirect zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso after zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso of zzso did not reverse this zzso Moreover, zzso rapidly activated zzso protein zzso 1/3 zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso The prolonged treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We next evaluated whether zzso affected the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso markedly enhanced the intensity of the zzso pool stained with zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso containing protein zzso 1 zzso reduced the zzso stress fiber zzso Our data support the hypothesis that human zzso cells express functional zzso binding sites and respond to zzso to initiate zzso of signaling events related to human zzso
