zzso could zzso transforming growth zzso zzso via zzso zzso and induce zzso zzso disease in the rat in zzso and zzso zzso was related to cardiac dysfunction in diabetic zzso We explored the role of zzso signal pathways in the development of diabetic zzso zzso 

Male zzso rats were fed with high cholesterol diet for 17 weeks, zzso (30 zzso zzso was given at the 28th day, rats with zzso blood zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by the end of the 5th week were assigned to zzso group zzso zzso zzso Control rats zzso zzso 8) were fed with regular zzso zzso blood zzso zzso was monitored throughout the zzso After zzso zzso by the end of the study, zzso collagen content was zzso in zzso samples and the zzso expressions of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso real-time zzso The protein levels of zzso active and zzso zzso were detected by Western zzso 

Compared with control group, cardiac function was decreased as shown by significantly reduced left zzso zzso pressure, zzso and zzso while the zzso collagen content was significantly increased in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso and protein expressions of zzso active and zzso zzso in the zzso group were also significantly higher than those of the control zzso Moreover, zzso collagen was positively correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso and zzso protein expressions of zzso and active zzso were positively correlated to zzso and zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso However, there were no correlations between the protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso might play an important role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso It may be the basis of novel therapeutic approaches for zzso zzso
