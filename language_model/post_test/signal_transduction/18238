zzso stimulation has been used to promote wound zzso The mechanisms by which such stimulation could interact with biological systems to accelerate healing have not been zzso One potential mechanism could involve stimulation of zzso migration to the site of a zzso Here we report that zzso electric fields induce human zzso zzso zzso exposed to a 1 zzso 2 zzso field show an induced migration zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a random zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on a glass zzso Electric field exposure zzso reorganization of zzso from zzso structures at the cell periphery to zzso that are confined to the contact sites between cell and zzso suggesting that the cells are crawling on zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso directed against zzso prior to field exposure prevents cell migration, indicating that zzso signaling pathways are zzso Electric fields cause zzso migration on zzso or zzso coated zzso without inducing zzso formation or changes in cellular zzso The migration zzso is not significantly altered but the random movement is zzso suggesting that cell movements on a zzso or zzso surface are not zzso by cell zzso It is suggested that electric zzso zzso migration zzso several modes of cell movement, including cell crawling and possibly cell zzso
