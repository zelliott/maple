The role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in high zzso zzso signal zzso has yet to be zzso We investigated whether zzso is implicated in high zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso in cultured human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso High zzso increased zzso gene expression through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso High zzso zzso DNA binding activity was decreased by zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed high zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had no effect on zzso zzso High zzso zzso DNA binding activity was also decreased by zzso zzso High zzso increased nuclear zzso of zzso without zzso zzso of zzso and without degradation of zzso but with an increase in zzso zzso of zzso that may account for the zzso of zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso attenuated high zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso by zzso of zzso abolished high zzso zzso zzso In zzso high zzso zzso gene zzso occurred through zzso zzso and subsequent zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that zzso might be implicated in the diabetic kidney zzso
