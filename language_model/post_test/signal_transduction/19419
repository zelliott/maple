zzso muscle is highly zzso to environmental stimuli and can alter its mass zzso This tissue is almost unique in that it can increase its size through two distinct zzso It can grow through a cellular process zzso by cell fusion, or it can increase its size simply by increasing its protein zzso zzso how these processes are regulated is crucial for the development of potential therapies against debilitating skeletal muscle wasting zzso Two key zzso zzso zzso like Growth Factor zzso and zzso have emerged in recent years to be potent regulators of skeletal muscle zzso In this review we bring together recent data highlighting the important and novel aspects of both molecules and their zzso zzso culminating in a discussion of the cellular and tissue zzso outcomes of their stimulation or zzso We zzso the complex regulatory mechanisms and discuss the zzso and spatial differences that control their action, understanding of which is crucial to further their use as potential therapeutic zzso
