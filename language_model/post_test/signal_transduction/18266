We report the identities of the members of a group of proteins that associate with zzso to form a large complex that we have named zzso zzso zzso surveillance zzso This complex includes tumor zzso and DNA damage repair proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso In addition, DNA replication factor C zzso a protein complex that zzso the loading of zzso onto DNA, is also part of zzso We find that zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso complex zzso to large nuclear zzso that contain zzso when cells are treated with agents that interfere with DNA zzso The association of zzso with zzso and zzso which are required for zzso repair, provides a possible explanation for the role of zzso in this zzso zzso all members of this complex have roles in recognition of abnormal DNA structures or damaged DNA, suggesting that zzso may serve as a sensor for DNA zzso Several of these proteins also have roles in DNA zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso may function as a coordinator of multiple activities required for maintenance of zzso integrity during the process of DNA replication and point to a central role for zzso in DNA zzso
