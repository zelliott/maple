zzso proteins are zzso zzso guidance cues that control growth cone zzso However, the zzso signaling mechanisms that mediate growth cone turning in response to zzso are zzso We previously showed that zzso signaling directs spinal zzso zzso zzso to turn zzso after zzso crossing through an attractive zzso Here we show that zzso protein zzso C zzso is required for zzso attraction of zzso zzso and proper zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso a specific blocker of zzso activity, and expression of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also required for zzso guidance, because zzso zzso zzso and expression of a zzso zzso construct all resulted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso caused precocious anterior turning of zzso zzso before zzso crossing in zzso zzso and caused zzso zzso zzso zzso which are normally insensitive to zzso attraction, to turn toward zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso zzso guidance and that zzso can act as a switch to activate zzso responsiveness during zzso zzso
