zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso blocks terminal zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso a component of the zzso complex, but not zzso of zzso a component of the zzso complex, prevented terminal differentiation zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso and zzso treatment of zzso zzso disrupted the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso signaling without zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso by zzso may not be the cause of arrested zzso In support of this, expression of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells rescued zzso fusion even in the presence of zzso zzso signaling to zzso appears necessary for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that occurs during zzso zzso zzso treatment prevented zzso zzso during zzso while suppression of zzso activity during differentiation and zzso fusion was restored through expression of zzso even in the presence of zzso Further, the ROCK inhibitor zzso restored terminal differentiation in zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence of a specific role for zzso signaling in terminal zzso zzso
