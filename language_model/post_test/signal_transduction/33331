zzso the cellular zzso of the transforming gene of the avian zzso virus, is zzso expressed in all zzso zzso including T and B zzso zzso In T zzso zzso expression appears to be required for cell cycle progression and zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in T cell proliferation and survival, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso active zzso or with a zzso zzso construct able to zzso zzso zzso levels, and the zzso were assessed for proliferation and survival in low zzso of zzso and for zzso to zzso zzso Compared with control cells, zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso in low zzso of zzso and are less susceptible to zzso induced by zzso deprivation or treatment with zzso In contrast, cells zzso with an zzso zzso construct do not zzso in low zzso of zzso and undergo zzso upon zzso deprivation or zzso treatment more rapidly than parental zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter was efficiently zzso by zzso but such effect was observed also in cells zzso with a DNA zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in gel zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the shortest zzso promoter segment regulated by zzso formed a specific complex with nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso Thus, these results strongly suggest that zzso in addition to regulating T cell zzso protects T zzso from zzso by induction of zzso zzso which involves a zzso mechanism of promoter zzso
