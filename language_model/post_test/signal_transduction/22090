zzso are dynamic zzso structures at the cell surface that degrade zzso zzso and act as sites of signal zzso The zzso of zzso including the mechanisms regulating their formation, zzso and turnover is not entirely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso and zzso resulted in the rapid zzso of zzso with zzso zzso capacity in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso and active zzso zzso The induction of zzso clusters required an intact zzso interaction site in the zzso zzso domain, but was independent of the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both present in the zzso clusters of zzso and cholesterol depletion prevented their formation, suggesting that zzso zzso are involved in the zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso zzso shedding of zzso growth factor zzso zzso can occur within these zzso Such localized growth factor zzso offers an interesting novel biological concept highly relevant to the properties of zzso cells, which often show zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together with high levels of zzso zzso zzso
