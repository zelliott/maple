Like their normal zzso stem cell counterparts, leukemia stem cells zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso are presumed to reside in specific niches in the bone zzso zzso zzso and may be the cause of zzso following zzso zzso the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5) have been implicated previously in the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso is released during bone zzso and plays a part in maintenance of zzso zzso but a role for zzso from the zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but enhances zzso zzso zzso in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased zzso on the respective zzso zzso treatment caused a zzso decrease in zzso in zzso mice with zzso zzso and reduced zzso of zzso mice with primary human zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso niches in zzso and zzso are distinct and suggest that zzso of the zzso by zzso may be a feasible strategy to reduce zzso a prerequisite for the cure of zzso
