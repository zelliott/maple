Although the mechanisms underlying the causes of heavy zzso blood loss zzso remain to be zzso zzso have been previously zzso This study was initiated to zzso a pattern of expression of the various components of the zzso zzso zzso pathways present in the zzso of women with normal and heavy zzso 

zzso zzso were collected at different stages of the zzso cycle from women who underwent measurement of zzso zzso was divided for either examination of gene expression by quantitative zzso analysis or in zzso culture zzso 

Analysis of gene expression demonstrated a significant zzso in expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso obtained from women with heavy zzso when compared with zzso obtained from women with normal zzso zzso culture with zzso stimulation caused a significantly elevated production of zzso zzso zzso by zzso of women with heavy zzso when compared with normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso breakdown, was reduced in these same zzso samples obtained from women with heavy zzso 

These data identify the E series zzso receptors and their zzso pathways as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of heavy zzso
