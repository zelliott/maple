zzso smooth muscle proliferation plays an important role in airway zzso in zzso But little is known about the zzso signal zzso in the airway smooth muscle cell proliferation in zzso The objective of this paper is to investigate the contribution of protein zzso C zzso and its alpha zzso to passively zzso human airway smooth muscle cells zzso zzso 

zzso in culture were passively zzso with zzso serum from zzso patients, with zzso human serum treated zzso used as the zzso The proliferation of zzso was examined by cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso on the proliferation of zzso exposed to human zzso serum and zzso control serum was also examined by the same zzso The protein and zzso expression of zzso in passively zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso 

The percentage of S phase, zzso zzso zzso and the positive percentage of zzso protein expression in zzso passively zzso with zzso serum were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly increased compared with zzso treated with control serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso were passively zzso with zzso serum, they were treated with zzso the percentage of S phase, value A and the positive percentage of zzso protein expression were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly increased compared with zzso serum zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso After zzso passively zzso with zzso serum were treated with zzso the percentage of S phase, value A and the positive percentage of zzso protein expression were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly decreased compared with zzso serum zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative ratio of value A of zzso zzso and the positive percentage of zzso protein expression in passively zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly increased compared with zzso treated with control serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The proliferation of zzso passively zzso with human zzso serum is zzso zzso and its alpha zzso may contribute to this zzso
