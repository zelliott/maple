The study of zzso stress response of plants is important because they have to cope with environmental changes to zzso The plant zzso have evolved to meet environmental zzso zzso temperature, and drought are the main zzso zzso The tolerance and response to stress vary differently in zzso The idea was to analyze the genes showing differential expression under zzso zzso There are many pathways connecting the perception of external stimuli to cellular zzso In plants, these pathways play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, the gene expression data have been analyzed for their involvement in different steps of signaling zzso The zzso genes were analyzed for their role in each zzso The functional zzso of these genes and their response under zzso stresses in other plant species were also zzso The zzso of signal zzso showing similarity with zzso zzso were analyzed for their role in different zzso zzso Our findings will help to understand the expression of genes in response to various zzso zzso These genes may be used to study the response of different zzso stresses in other plant species and the molecular basis of stress zzso
