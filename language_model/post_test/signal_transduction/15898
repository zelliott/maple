The molecular mechanisms of signal zzso of plants in response to infection by zzso zzso zzso are not well zzso We previously showed that NO may act as an upstream zzso zzso to trigger the zzso of cortical zzso in zzso In the present study, we used the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to explore the mechanisms of action of zzso signals and the dynamic zzso zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso may also act as an upstream zzso zzso to regulate cortical zzso zzso The zzso of the cortical zzso played a functional role in the zzso zzso to mediate the expression of zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso the dynamic zzso zzso to trigger the expression of zzso genes against zzso zzso toxins zzso in zzso
