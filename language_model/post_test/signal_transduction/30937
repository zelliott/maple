During muscle zzso a population of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso emerges among mature muscle zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such cell segregation and the characterization of this zzso of zzso remain to be zzso zzso is known to control the behavior and fate of zzso muscle stem zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso in zzso zzso We showed that zzso of zzso activity by either zzso zzso or by using a pharmacological zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced differentiation of zzso and human zzso This effect was not restricted to in zzso culture systems since zzso zzso zzso also showed increased zzso Using zzso zzso as a model, we showed that zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso by recruiting reserve cells that do not normally zzso We further showed that zzso zzso components were zzso expressed and activated in reserve cells with respect to zzso 1 and zzso zzso We identified zzso negative reserve cells as the zzso of zzso recruited to fuse into zzso during differentiation in response to zzso zzso zzso we showed here that the zzso of zzso 1 is important to maintain a zzso of zzso negative reserve cells in an zzso zzso
