zzso zzso are zzso short zzso that mediate vast networks of zzso gene zzso Although zzso searches and experimental profiling provide evidence for hundreds of functional targets for individual zzso such data rarely provide clear insight into the zzso consequences of manipulating zzso in zzso We describe a zzso collection of 165 zzso zzso zzso and find that a majority induced specific zzso zzso including zzso of zzso in myriad zzso and patterning zzso Such connections allowed us to validate several likely targets for zzso zzso zzso few of these zzso could be predicted from zzso predicted target lists, thus highlighting the value of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we provide an example of the relevance of these data to zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso of several K box zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity, zzso genetic interaction tests with zzso sponges demonstrated zzso roles of the K box zzso family in restricting zzso zzso In zzso we provide extensive evidence that zzso of individual zzso often zzso specific zzso zzso that can guide their functional zzso By extension, these data suggest that the deregulation of individual zzso in other animals may frequently yield relatively specific zzso during disease zzso
