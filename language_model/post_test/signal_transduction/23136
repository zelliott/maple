Human memory T cells present in zzso tumor zzso zzso fail to respond normally to stimulation via the T cell zzso zzso This zzso is zzso by decreases in zzso and zzso zzso zzso production, and cell proliferation in response to zzso stimulation with immobilized zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso T cells zzso is zzso by soluble factors present in zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso of the T cells is quickly reversed when the cells are zzso in the absence of the zzso fluid, and is rapidly zzso when a zzso zzso fluid is added back to the T zzso Based upon the observed normal zzso patterns of the zzso zzso signaling zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso as well as the ability of the zzso analog zzso and the zzso zzso to bypass the zzso zzso zzso signaling arrest, the site of the arrest in the zzso cascade appears to be at or just upstream of zzso An identical zzso signaling arrest pattern was observed when T cells derived from normal donor peripheral blood were incubated with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso reported here suggests that soluble factors acting directly or indirectly upon T cells present within tumors contribute to the zzso that has previously been observed in T cells derived from zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso The soluble zzso factors represent potential therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
