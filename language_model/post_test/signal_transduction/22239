The zzso protein Brother of zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso guidance, and can both positively and zzso regulate zzso zzso target gene transcription, however, little is known about in zzso requirements for zzso during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by defects in zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso locus encodes zzso and that zzso function is zzso required for zzso neural zzso Our zzso analysis suggests that zzso is required as a positive regulator of zzso signaling in the spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso and upper zzso but that zzso might zzso regulate zzso signals in the lower zzso This study reveals a role for zzso in zzso zzso cells that receive high levels of zzso and zzso previously unknown roles for zzso in zzso zzso
