zzso B light zzso zzso zzso perception and signaling are well-known phenomena in plants, although no specific zzso zzso have yet been zzso We previously reported on the root zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which display a block to development under zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after the zzso emerges from the zzso Here, we report the analysis and cloning of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is virtually indistinguishable from the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso approach was used to clone zzso zzso encodes a domain of unknown function zzso protein that is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso have the same zzso as both zzso and zzso single zzso suggesting that the two genes work in the same zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso shows a similar expression pattern as that of zzso Fluorescent zzso and zzso and zzso proteins interact physically in zzso This zzso interaction depends on the zzso domain, and zzso zzso identified specific zzso in zzso that are required for both zzso interaction and zzso zzso Six zzso genes are found in zzso rice zzso zzso and moss zzso zzso and one zzso member, zzso is zzso in plants and zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso works with zzso in a root zzso zzso that plays a vital role in zzso early zzso zzso and zzso
