Previous works have established a unique function of zzso in the control of muscle gene expression during DNA damage response in zzso zzso by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso We show here that zzso signaling is also an essential component of the DNA repair machinery in zzso exposed to zzso zzso DNA damage promoted the recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso repair zzso and this effect was zzso by either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Upon DNA damage, zzso and zzso were detected on the zzso to zzso target genes without zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso recruitment to target zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to bind the zzso following DNA damage, while retaining the ability to activate zzso in response to differentiation zzso Moreover, zzso zzso exhibited an impaired ability to promote repair in a zzso system, as compared with zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso satellite cells zzso displayed impaired DNA repair that was rescued by zzso of zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso rescue of DNA repair in zzso zzso These results identify an unprecedented contribution of zzso to DNA repair and suggest that zzso signaling coordinates DNA repair and zzso in zzso
