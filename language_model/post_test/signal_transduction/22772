The process of signal transmission to the cell interior is very zzso The cell reads external stimuli through the system of specific zzso zzso suitable pathways of secondary cell zzso Recent studies have yielded a number of essential data concerned with the complex functioning of the system of secondary cell zzso pathways in the zzso and their role in the molecular base of zzso zzso The causes of many zzso diseases are now known to be associated with zzso of membrane and nuclear receptors and proteins of signal transmission systems in the zzso Moreover, species specific differences and zzso zzso changes have been revealed in the regulation of main pathways of secondary cell zzso and interaction between zzso The present paper intends to characterize the main systems of secondary signal zzso in the zzso cell and their role in the zzso of zzso zzso
