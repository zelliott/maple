Recently, major advances have occurred in our understanding of the biology of chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso cells were once assumed to originate from zzso zzso incompetent B zzso and to passively accumulate due to increased life zzso In 1999, two research groups demonstrated that zzso which is a zzso uniform but clinically zzso disease, can be classified into two major zzso on the basis of the zzso status of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso It was also suggested that these two groups both originate from mature cells that have passed the zzso selection zzso This hypothesis was confirmed by gene expression studies indicating a uniform pattern characteristic to memory cells, as well as specific zzso zzso zzso structures supporting the existence of a functional zzso zzso The differences in the zzso signal zzso mechanisms may zzso the different clinical behavior in which zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a pivotal role, since elevated zzso expression is likely to be an zzso zzso factor in zzso The diagnostic testing for zzso expression plays an important role in the therapeutic zzso
