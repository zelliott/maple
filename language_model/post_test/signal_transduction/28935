zzso zzso of the direct zzso interactions that mediate many important biological processes is an emerging and challenging area in drug zzso Conventional drug design has mainly focused on the zzso of a single zzso usually an zzso or zzso since these proteins often contain a clearly defined zzso site with which a zzso drug can be designed to zzso zzso a small zzso to bind to a zzso interface and subsequently inhibit the interaction poses several challenges, including the initial identification of suitable zzso zzso the surface area of the interface (it is often zzso and the location of zzso zzso zzso regions suitable for drug zzso This article reviews the general approach to designing zzso of zzso zzso and then focuses on recent advances in the use of small molecules targeted against a variety of zzso interactions that have therapeutic potential for zzso
