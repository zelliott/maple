The zzso nucleus zzso daily variations of physiology and behavior in zzso Within single zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso generate zzso rhythms on the molecular zzso We present a mathematical model that reflects the essential features of the zzso zzso zzso to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback zzso The zzso that are obtained have a zzso period and are robust toward zzso variations even when the positive feedback is replaced by a constantly expressed zzso This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm zzso Moreover, it explains the rhythmic zzso of zzso zzso mice, where a positive feedback is zzso The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex zzso In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso mice are zzso Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the zzso gene is compensated by the zzso zzso that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback zzso Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral zzso zzso zzso should be rescued when zzso zzso zzso mice are crossed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
