zzso of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells leads to passage through the cell zzso zzso shift experiments show that zzso is needed to leave zzso to pass a relatively stable zzso zzso point, and to pass a later zzso point committing cells to S zzso Classic immediate early responses that activate both zzso DNA binding and zzso protein zzso zzso are induced at zzso exit, but unexpectedly they rise again in zzso and before the onset of S phase, fluctuations that parallel the need for zzso An zzso zzso zzso renders these cells susceptible to zzso stimulation by zzso without zzso activity, but greatly zzso the ability of zzso to induce DNA synthesis and zzso zzso probably because zzso physically associates with inactive zzso at zzso but not restrictive zzso This implicates zzso association with zzso active zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, temperature shift experiments indicate that the zzso peak of zzso zzso activity is associated with cells reaching the zzso pause point, while the zzso phase peak is needed for DNA zzso In contrast, cell transformation by zzso does not require enhanced zzso zzso activity at any stage of the cell zzso
