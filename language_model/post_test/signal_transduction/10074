Cell polarity must be integrated with tissue polarity for proper zzso The zzso embryonic central nervous system zzso is a highly polarized zzso zzso occupy the most zzso layer of cells within the zzso and lie just zzso to the neural zzso zzso are the zzso zzso cells and undergo multiple rounds of zzso cell division, zzso zzso smaller daughter cells zzso from the side opposite the zzso thereby positioning zzso progeny towards the zzso zzso It is unknown whether this highly stereotypical orientation of zzso divisions is controlled by an intrinsic cue zzso cortical zzso or an zzso cue zzso zzso zzso Using live imaging and in zzso culture, we find that zzso in contact with zzso cells always zzso zzso zzso in the same direction, opposite from the zzso contact site, identical to what is observed in zzso By contrast, isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso at random zzso Imaging of zzso dynamics and cortical polarity shows that in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso remained anchored and cortical polarity proteins zzso at the same zzso contact site over subsequent cell zzso In isolated zzso zzso drifted between cell cycles and cortical polarity proteins showed a delay in polarization and random zzso We conclude that embryonic zzso require an zzso signal from the zzso zzso to anchor the zzso pair at the site of zzso contact and for proper zzso and spatial zzso of cortical Par zzso This ensures the proper coordination between zzso cell polarity and zzso tissue zzso
