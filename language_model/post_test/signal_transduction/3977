We recently zzso using human zzso T cell zzso lacking the T cell zzso zzso complex, that the zzso zzso is able to trigger zzso calcium increase provided that zzso is expressed on the cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso biological effects was zzso demonstrated in differentiated zzso zzso cells expressing or not expressing zzso and is confirmed here in human zzso mouse zzso zzso In the present paper, we analyze the zzso calcium response triggered by zzso independently of the zzso zzso We show that the observed calcium rise results from a direct long-lasting calcium influx from the outside without release of calcium from zzso zzso We demonstrate that it is independent of the zzso zzso C zzso zzso Moreover, we show that this peculiar calcium response can be blocked by protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso giving evidence of the involvement of a protein zzso zzso the best candidate of which is the zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that, independently of the zzso complex, zzso may be involved in the triggering of a calcium signal dependent on a protein zzso zzso and independent of the zzso zzso zzso
