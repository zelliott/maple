The process of programmed cell death (or zzso occurs widely in tissue maintenance and embryonic development, and is under tight regulatory zzso It is now clear that one of the important regulators of zzso are zzso zzso In the present study, we investigate the regulatory mechanism employed by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso an zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso cell model, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso response is independent of zzso C zzso This response can, however, be inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso D at a concentration that zzso the rapid increase in gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso cells induced by the zzso agent, zzso is associated with a fall in the levels of the zzso zzso zzso This fall in zzso protein concentration can be attenuated by zzso zzso zzso We zzso therefore, that the zzso zzso signals to the zzso zzso via a mechanism that is independent of zzso C zzso but in a manner that involves both gene zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso
