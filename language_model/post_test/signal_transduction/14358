Based on zzso studies demonstrating that tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts a potent and cancer zzso zzso activity, zzso TRAIL as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso recently entered clinical zzso Additionally, gene therapy approaches using zzso zzso zzso are currently being developed to overcome the limitations inherent to TRAIL zzso zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso pattern of zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso To zzso gene therapy approaches, zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso have been investigated as cellular vehicles for TRAIL zzso zzso cells exhibit a potent tumor killing activity on a variety of tumor cell types both in zzso and in zzso and are also zzso against tumor cells resistant to soluble zzso Studies in zzso zzso zzso combined zzso mice suggest that the zzso effect of zzso cells is zzso by both direct tumor cell killing due to zzso and indirect tumor cell killing due to zzso zzso The clinical translation of cell and gene therapy approaches represent a challenging strategy that might achieve systemic tumor targeting and increased zzso delivery of the therapeutic zzso
