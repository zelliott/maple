zzso administration zzso cardiac zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso As zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso target we evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso is a functional requirement in zzso cell survival program during zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells were subjected to zzso of simulated zzso and zzso of zzso treatment zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the initiation zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and scrambled zzso were used as zzso Cell viability was measured using zzso zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso enhanced cell viability with attenuated zzso release zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The protection afforded by insulin was abolished by zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso but not by the sense or scrambled zzso In zzso insulin administration at zzso significantly increased zzso zzso levels and activity compared with zzso zzso zzso activity was abolished by zzso with zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is a functional target of zzso following zzso zzso during zzso zzso
