zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are both found at the surface of the cell membrane in many cell zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is often associated with the zzso zzso The spatial zzso of these three molecules could account for their involvement in cell zzso and/or zzso We have shown previously that the zzso zzso mediates mechanical force transmission across the cell surface to the zzso Here we investigated whether immobilized zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso could regulate cell spreading and zzso zzso zzso deprived human zzso cells were zzso in serum free medium onto zzso dishes zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or type 1 zzso or zzso at increasing zzso The number of adherent cells and their projected area were zzso after 3 hours of zzso zzso promoted cell zzso and spreading in a dose dependent zzso zzso of zzso to zzso inhibited the zzso on zzso coated dishes in a dose dependent zzso The zzso zzso cell zzso required the presence of zzso at the cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proteins abolished cell zzso on zzso dish, suggesting its dependence on the presence of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of zzso against alpha v zzso zzso completely inhibited cell zzso on zzso suggesting that alpha v zzso might be the zzso zzso that physically connects the complex of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of spread cells stained for zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed a zzso increase of zzso on zzso coated dishes and zzso zzso suggesting a migratory zzso These data indicate that zzso plays a direct role in dynamic cell zzso particularly at the leading edge, where increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are localized in zzso zzso zzso zzso could therefore serve to bridge the cell surface with the zzso zzso via the formation of a zzso complex that includes alpha v zzso zzso in zzso zzso
