zzso variations in protein abundance in zzso cell populations are ubiquitous in living zzso Because protein composition determines responses in individual cells, it stands to reason that the variations themselves are subject to selective zzso However, the functional role of these zzso differences is not well zzso One way to tackle questions regarding relationships between form and function is to zzso the form zzso change the protein zzso and observe the resulting changes in some zzso Here, we take on the zzso relationship from the inverse perspective, asking instead what specific constraints on zzso variations in protein abundance are imposed by a given functional zzso We develop a maximum zzso approach to posing questions of this type and illustrate the method by application to the zzso zzso response in zzso zzso We find that full determination of observed zzso variations in protein zzso is not inherent in zzso itself but, in fact, appears to be jointly imposed by the zzso program in conjunction with other factors zzso the protein synthesis machinery and/or additional zzso cell functions, such as cell zzso These results illustrate the power of maximum zzso as a tool for the investigation of relationships between biological form and zzso
