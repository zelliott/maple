The initiation of zzso is in part dependent on the zzso zzso stress environment promoting a zzso zzso of the zzso Previous studies demonstrated increased expression of zzso stress protein and unfolded protein response zzso regulator, zzso within all vascular cells in zzso zzso and its regulation in the zzso by several zzso zzso however, regulation of zzso by zzso stress directly has not been zzso 

Using an in zzso model to simulate human zzso zzso stress zzso zzso or zzso flow was applied to human zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly zzso zzso in a sustained manner under zzso but not zzso flow up to 24 zzso This response was dependent on both sustained zzso of zzso as well zzso zzso Increased zzso correlated with the zzso of the zzso stress sensing element zzso promoter by zzso flow as a marker of the zzso zzso stress regulated zzso through increased protein stability when compared to other flow regulated zzso such as zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso expression of zzso was also observed in zzso versus zzso regions of zzso zzso 

This study supports a role of the zzso environment in zzso inducing zzso and the zzso in zzso regions, before zzso development, and suggests a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso effect in response to zzso stress within zzso zzso
