zzso zzso zzso zzso has a key signaling role in all zzso zzso In zzso zzso it is the second zzso in the zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso stress responses, growth, cell cycle zzso zzso and cell wall zzso A zzso model of the zzso has been zzso 

We have created deterministic mathematical models of the zzso module of the pathway, as well as the complete zzso zzso First, a simplified conceptual model was created which reproduced the dynamics of changes in zzso levels in response to zzso addition in zzso as well as zzso zzso deletion zzso This model was used to investigate the role of the regulatory zzso proteins that had not been included zzso The zzso conceptual model reproduced very well the experimental evidence supporting the role of zzso as a direct inhibitor of zzso These results were used to develop the Complete zzso zzso Upon simulation it illustrated several important features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is more important than is zzso for controlling the zzso levels following zzso zzso the proportion of active zzso is not directly zzso to the zzso level, allowing zzso to exert negative zzso negative feedback mechanisms include zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso of zzso The Complete zzso model is easier to zzso and although significantly simpler than the existing zzso one, it recreates zzso levels and patterns of changes in zzso levels observed zzso in zzso in response to zzso addition in zzso as well as representative zzso strains such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The complete model is made available in zzso zzso 

We suggest that the lower number of reactions and parameters makes these models suitable for zzso them with models of metabolism or of the cell cycle in zzso zzso Similar models could be also useful for studies in the human pathogen zzso zzso as well as other less zzso zzso zzso
