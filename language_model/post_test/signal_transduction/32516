We have investigated the dynamics between free zzso receptors and clusters of them organized into zzso plaques on zzso cells using the ability of these free zzso to be zzso and recycled to the plasma zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cycle by zzso resulted in the subsequent zzso of free zzso which we followed by indirect zzso and zzso zzso zzso all the adhesive structures that were in equilibrium with free zzso became progressively zzso The cellular zzso changes were analyzed and correlated with the distribution of zzso contacts viewed by zzso images obtained after zzso with zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso After cell zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso cycle induced disruption of the zzso plaques that were mainly localized at the cell zzso and disappearance of the stress zzso However, the cells remained firmly attached to the zzso through focal contacts localized in the central part of the zzso These central focal zzso but not the peripheral zzso zzso could form when the zzso traffic was blocked prior to zzso and they allowed the cells to attach and zzso onto the zzso Whereas both adhesive structures contained the same receptors linked to zzso and zzso the central adhesive structures were attached to a short stretch of zzso but never permitted the organization of stress zzso
