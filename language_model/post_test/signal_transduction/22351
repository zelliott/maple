zzso cause about zzso of the zzso that are still the leading causes of human zzso The discovery of viral zzso has enhanced our understanding of viral zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso are complex and require further zzso The present study has attempted to investigate the effects of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso disease virus 1 zzso a chicken zzso causing acute zzso zzso and solid visceral tumors in zzso on zzso drug-induced zzso and identify the targets of the zzso The results showed that of the total 14 zzso zzso by zzso zzso significantly promoted cell survival under treatment with zzso a widely used chemotherapy zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso by directly zzso expression at the protein but not the zzso level of zzso a critical component in the transforming growth factor zzso signal zzso Our data suggest that zzso viruses may zzso zzso to directly target cellular factors involved in zzso processes including zzso thus zzso creating a cellular environment beneficial to viral zzso and zzso Furthermore, the knowledge of the zzso resistance zzso by viral zzso has great practical implications for improving the efficacy of zzso for treating zzso especially those induced by zzso zzso
