Previous studies of zzso activated zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso were carried out in crude cell zzso because such zzso could not be recovered in a zzso form in the active zzso We employed a strategy in which a stabilizing zzso bond allowed for successful zzso of a zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso is able to activate zzso to a higher degree than zzso and may prove useful for future structural studies of the active state of zzso
