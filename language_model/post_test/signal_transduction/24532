zzso describes single and zzso signal zzso networks zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso notation to represent zzso reactions and zzso zzso zzso systems are represented as zzso with zzso embedded in each zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are translated into differential equations and can be solved zzso to generate zzso time courses or output as systems of equations that can be read by other zzso zzso simulations are fully zzso and portable to any operating system that supports zzso and can be indefinitely zzso within larger data structures to produce highly zzso zzso
