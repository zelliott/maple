The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates its zzso functions through zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the ubiquitous zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso The immediate early response gene zzso is a well-known marker of zzso zzso so we used a human zzso cell line zzso to explore the role of zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso We observed both short-term and prolonged altered zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso cells were shown to express zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of both receptors displayed a zzso with zzso in the absence of zzso Our findings indicate a novel mechanism of zzso in regulating zzso signaling by possible interaction with the inactive state of zzso and zzso zzso
