By zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in maintaining zzso tissue zzso but the mechanisms are not zzso In addition to zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso was recently shown to regulate gene expression via the zzso protein beta zzso as zzso Because zzso is a crucial zzso of immune and inflammatory responses, and has been implicated in regulation of collagen synthesis by tumor necrosis zzso we examined its role in the zzso effects of zzso The results demonstrated that zzso caused increased zzso expression in zzso zzso and enhanced its binding to zzso DNA sequences in the zzso zzso gene zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso binding by deletion or zzso zzso zzso the zzso of collagen promoter activity in transient zzso zzso as did zzso with dominant negative zzso indicating a functional role of cellular zzso in zzso the zzso zzso Rapid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso was accompanied by zzso and nuclear zzso of cellular zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor blocked zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso promoter activity, zzso by zzso These results provide compelling evidence for a novel zzso zzso signaling zzso responsible for zzso of collagen gene zzso Taken together with recent reports, the findings indicate that zzso pathways zzso negative regulation of collagen synthesis in response to distinct inflammatory signals that zzso on zzso
