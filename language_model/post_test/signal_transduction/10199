zzso function has been shown to be regulated by an increasing number of zzso factors, including zzso Here we show that the important zzso zzso activates zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso under control of 5 zzso of the human zzso zzso Similar regulation of the zzso rat zzso gene by zzso in zzso cells was confirmed using real-time zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso dynamic response patterns of promoter activity in individual zzso In zzso cells treated with zzso Western zzso analysis showed rapid zzso protein zzso zzso degradation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso fusion proteins showed transient zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso zzso and confirmed zzso zzso This was associated with increased nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso signaling by expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or truncated zzso abolished zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, suggesting that this effect was zzso by zzso zzso signaling was found to interact with other zzso signals to regulate zzso gene expression and is likely to be a major zzso zzso of zzso zzso
