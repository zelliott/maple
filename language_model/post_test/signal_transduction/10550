zzso 1 beta zzso a potent zzso zzso is directly zzso by radiation and is known to regulate other zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso However, the nature of the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso skin zzso is zzso We examined the response of primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells to zzso radiation (10 zzso and compared the results to a zzso sequence of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso knockout zzso These studies showed that zzso are the major zzso cells in zzso and that radiation zzso an immediate and chronic zzso in the expression of zzso zzso in the skin of zzso zzso This zzso was principally early and was less pronounced in the zzso knockout strain, which also demonstrated reduced late radiation zzso zzso also increased expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso protein induced robust zzso zzso zzso zzso along with a brisk increase in zzso and collagen III, but only in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso and that the increased zzso fail to block the zzso collagen zzso
