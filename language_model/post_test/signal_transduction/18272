While it has been long appreciated that zzso proteins coat the cell surface, their functions are poorly zzso Here, I describe recent genetic studies that demonstrate that one class of zzso zzso zzso zzso play crucial roles in zzso growth regulation and tumor zzso zzso that affect individual zzso or the zzso required for zzso synthesis regulate zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and body size in mice and zzso zzso zzso function is also associated with the development of zzso tumors and zzso multiple zzso In this review, these biological findings are placed in the context of zzso zzso and molecular zzso
