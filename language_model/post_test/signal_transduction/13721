Pulmonary zzso hypertension and zzso chronic heart failure are highly prevalent diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to chronic vascular injury and extensive zzso responses at the level of the vessel zzso zzso play a central role in this setting, through a complex signaling system that mainly affects zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso ETA and zzso zzso receptors are thought to mediate zzso responses, while zzso zzso activity could account for the overall protective effect of zzso signaling in zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso system has mainly focused on the dual zzso blockade of ETA and zzso zzso receptors or to the selective blockade of zzso pathways to zzso Good clinical results were achieved in the setting of pulmonary hypertension but no advantage has been demonstrated for heart zzso zzso and enhancing the zzso protective role of zzso with zzso blockade of zzso could possibly improve the efficacy of current therapies in the setting of pulmonary zzso hypertension and zzso chronic heart zzso
