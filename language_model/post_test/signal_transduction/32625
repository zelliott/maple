zzso is the oldest and one of the most important zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shape change, exposure of zzso binding sites, zzso and influx and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for maintaining normal zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso itself zzso in zzso zzso stroke, and zzso Another important aspect of zzso zzso zzso is the ability of zzso to antagonize zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity does not appear to play a role in zzso zzso zzso in zzso or in zzso It is believed that a single zzso zzso mediates the above two zzso zzso responses in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity has not been zzso zzso the nature of molecular mechanisms underlying the two seemingly unrelated zzso zzso responses remains either unclear or less well zzso The purpose of this commentary is to examine and make suggestions concerning the role of zzso and zzso in the molecular mechanisms of signal zzso underlying the two zzso zzso zzso It is hoped that such discussion would stimulate thinking and invite future debates on this subject, and zzso investigators in their efforts to advance our knowledge of the details of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
