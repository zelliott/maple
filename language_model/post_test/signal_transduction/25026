We have reported that zzso of rat zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso markedly zzso the zzso response to zzso growth zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether the zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of known zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of DNA synthesis induced by zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso but did not affect the amount of zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso of 66 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly increased by zzso zzso and that this change was mainly due to an increase in the levels of 66 zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso significantly increased binding of zzso zzso protein 2) to zzso in response to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso induced by zzso was also enhanced by zzso The presence of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso during treatment with zzso partially inhibited the zzso zzso of DNA synthesis in response to zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso increased binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which was reflected in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso strongly depressed zzso DNA synthesis after zzso with and without zzso or zzso zzso Our results suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso pathways leads to an zzso of cell zzso which is zzso at least in part, through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects are zzso by changes in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso
