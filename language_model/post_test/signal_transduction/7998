During zzso differentiation and zzso it is critical that the 3 components of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are made in proper zzso to form stable zzso zzso translation zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso provides one major mechanism that ensures balanced synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso initiation factor 2 zzso in zzso zzso thereby zzso protein synthesis zzso In this manner, zzso serves as a feedback inhibitor of zzso synthesis by sensing the zzso concentration of zzso through its zzso zzso zzso is essential not only for the zzso regulation of zzso but also for the survival of zzso precursors in iron zzso Recently, the protective function of zzso has also been demonstrated in zzso models of zzso zzso and zzso In these 3 zzso zzso is essential in determining red blood cell size, number, and zzso content per zzso zzso regulation by zzso is critical to reduce excess synthesis of zzso proteins or zzso under zzso disease states, and thus reduces the severity of these zzso The protective role of zzso may be more common among red cell zzso
