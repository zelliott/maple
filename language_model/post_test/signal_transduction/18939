The zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed mainly during plant zzso development, where they play important roles in controlling floral organ initiation and zzso Few previous reports have investigated the functions of zzso zzso factors expressed in zzso zzso Here we describe the functional characterization of a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A partial zzso zzso a zzso domain was identified via zzso screening of rice zzso zzso and the full-length zzso was subsequently isolated via screening of a zzso library constructed from rice materials at zzso zzso zzso pattern analyses indicated that zzso is transcribed mainly in zzso zzso including the mature zzso zzso zzso zone, zzso zzso and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and zzso Further studies revealed that zzso of zzso is zzso by darkness and suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in shortened primary roots, zzso zzso and enhanced zzso joint zzso Moreover, transgenic plants showed zzso to zzso zzso in terms of zzso joint inclination and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced expression of zzso which encodes zzso zzso the zzso loosening zzso necessary for cell zzso and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell zzso and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of zzso in zzso zzso
