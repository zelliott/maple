zzso zzso inflicted by the zzso of zzso zzso links zzso dysfunction to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso that underscore accelerated synthesis of zzso zzso in response to nutritional zzso are not clearly zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso gene 1 zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso in cultured zzso treated with free fatty acid or zzso and in zzso in animal models of zzso Occupancy of zzso and zzso on the promoter regions of zzso genes was increased in zzso in cells and ex zzso in liver zzso zzso suppressed the induction and recruitment of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso relied on nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributed to the stabilization of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso in zzso challenged with excessive zzso zzso zzso and zzso were involved in the maintenance of a zzso zzso marked by active zzso modifications and friendly to the access of the general zzso zzso Finally, depletion of zzso by short hairpin zzso attenuated the release of zzso zzso in the liver and significantly ameliorated zzso pathology in NASH zzso 

Our data illustrate a zzso zzso that connects the zzso regulation of zzso genes to the zzso of NASH and point to a potential zzso target in the therapeutic intervention of zzso
