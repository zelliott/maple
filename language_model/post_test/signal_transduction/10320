The activity of zzso an zzso zzso is required for T zzso zzso with regard to formation of the zzso zzso zzso production, and zzso In zzso T zzso zzso zzso is present in its zzso inactive zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and, thus, zzso of zzso In this study we characterized the signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso in zzso human zzso We show that a zzso cascade regulates zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso Ras is a central zzso of this zzso transient expression of an activated form of zzso in zzso triggered the zzso of zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso blocked both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso showing that the combined activities of both signaling proteins are required to activate zzso That Ras functions as a central regulator of zzso zzso after zzso through zzso zzso zzso was finally proven by transient expression of a dominant negative form of zzso in primary human zzso It clearly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and likewise, zzso of zzso was zzso Our data, in addition, demonstrate that regarding the downstream zzso of zzso a clear difference exists between zzso human zzso and the T zzso line zzso Thus, in zzso the Ras signaling cascade is able to activate zzso whereas in zzso cells this is not the zzso In addition to the insights into the regulation of zzso this finding zzso a to date zzso possibility of zzso zzso in T zzso
