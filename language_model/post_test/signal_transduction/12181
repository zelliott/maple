zzso protect zzso ends from fusion and zzso In the absence of a specific zzso zzso zzso their DNA shortens progressively with every round of zzso leading to zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso cells bearing a single, very short zzso zzso earlier, demonstrating that the length of the shortest zzso is a major zzso of the onset of zzso We further show that zzso specifically recognizes the single, very short zzso causing the accelerated zzso zzso before entering zzso cells divide for several generations despite complete erosion of their shortened zzso This zzso growth requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso methane zzso zzso and there is no evidence for major zzso zzso We propose that, in the absence of zzso a very short zzso is first maintained in a zzso state by a zzso zzso and then switches to a zzso state leading to zzso through a zzso zzso
