We show that in the zzso the major gene of zzso zzso zzso is expressed long before zzso in the neural zzso zzso cell zzso and embryonic zzso cells irrespective of whether they will zzso or zzso This zzso zzso expression is zzso and likely to serve as a specific marker for the zzso cell zzso The much higher zzso expression accompanying zzso is therefore not new gene expression but strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso We provide new evidence that the zzso to zzso levels depends on positive zzso signals and therefore does not represent a zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso in mature zzso zzso cells of the sympathetic zzso but is zzso after zzso indicating that there is a zzso signal associated with mature zzso zzso Thus, the regulation of the zzso gene is complex, encompassing zzso signaled amplification superimposed on a highly zzso and zzso zzso zzso
