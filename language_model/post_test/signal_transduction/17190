The sweet taste is of immense interest to scientists and has been zzso studied during the last two zzso However, the sweet preference modification and the related mechanisms are still zzso In this study, we try to establish a mice model with manipulated sweet taste preference and explore the involved possible molecular zzso The animals were exposed to zzso via maternal milk during zzso and the sweet preference tests were carried out when they grew to zzso Our results showed that the preference thresholds for sweet taste were increased in adults by early zzso exposure and the preference ratios for sweet zzso at low or preferred zzso were zzso Moreover, by means of zzso and Western zzso we observed the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein in the soft zzso zzso the sweet taste sensitivity may be modified by early zzso experience during zzso Along the peripheral sweet sensory pathway, the sweet regulator receptors zzso zzso and components of sweet zzso signal zzso and zzso in both the soft zzso and tongue may be zzso involved in the plastic development of sweet zzso
