Although it is desirable to identify the interactions between zzso and the innate immune zzso it is often not possible to isolate these interactions from other cell zzso structures of protein or zzso zzso There is no universally accepted method to extract different zzso from different bacteria, and their natural state will be influenced by their interactions with the associated molecules in the bacterial outer zzso It is now believed that zzso zzso zzso 4 is the main signal zzso of classical zzso zzso zzso coli zzso while zzso is used by certain zzso zzso There are contradictory reports as to whether zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso signals primarily through zzso or zzso This study was designed to address this zzso Different zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso extracted by different methods together with different zzso zzso populations of zzso zzso were used to zzso the zzso zzso All of these zzso zzso preparations showed a significant zzso specificity for zzso but not for zzso This indicates that changing the extraction methods, with or without applying a zzso zzso and varying the cell populations do not alter the zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso
