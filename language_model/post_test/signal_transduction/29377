zzso of zzso resistant zzso was recently shown to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso treatment of insulin resistant zzso can induce improvements in zzso and whole body insulin zzso Treatment with 10 zzso zzso for 10 days significantly reduced zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso Following an zzso zzso zzso challenge, zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso clearance compared to zzso zzso maintained on the zzso diet zzso under curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly improved sensitivity to an zzso insulin challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the molecular level, significant increases in zzso of the zzso insulin zzso and zzso were observed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso controls following an intravenous zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso in insulin zzso and zzso zzso were also observed in muscle and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso and mass revealed a small zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso with no significant change in zzso mass, although zzso and mass of zzso were significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso a key negative regulator of insulin zzso showed a zzso trend toward reduction in liver and was significantly reduced in zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso increases whole body and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity via improved cellular insulin signal zzso
