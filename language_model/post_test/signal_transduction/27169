In the brain as in any other open physical systems, noise is zzso We present an explicit model of an active physical system that is borrowed from laser physics and allows us to establish the properties of the fluctuating forces that cause noise in the zzso It is shown how the cooperation of the individual parts of a system zzso or zzso can considerably reduce the noise zzso In particular we determine the correlation function between the individual zzso The basic equations can be transformed in such a way that a close zzso with typical equations of neural nets are zzso In particular, the zzso properties of zzso described by the zzso function are well zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso is represented by a linear zzso where we consider both a bandwidth filter and more or less free zzso In the latter case, a close zzso with an equation for neural activity in the sense of Nunez and established by zzso and zzso is pointed zzso
