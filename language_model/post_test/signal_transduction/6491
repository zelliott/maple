zzso zzso is a key component in visual zzso Rod and cone zzso each produce their unique zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are believed to be zzso In this study, we report that zzso of the zzso to zzso sequence in the upstream region of the human zzso gene fused to zzso zzso gives the highest level of reporter gene zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying this sequence fused to green fluorescent protein zzso expressed zzso in cones, suggesting a zzso regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso in both human and zzso
