zzso zzso is critical to help direct zzso lineage commitment in early zzso zzso and in the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell populations in the zzso express the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, and induce zzso zzso in zzso that express the zzso zzso At present there is nothing known about the role of the zzso 3 zzso zzso in the immune zzso Here we describe a novel cell autonomous role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso cannot activate zzso when expressed in trans but like other zzso zzso it can inhibit zzso zzso when expressed in zzso with the zzso The loss of zzso leads to an increase in zzso expression in double positive zzso and their increased production of mature zzso and zzso T zzso Studies using competitive zzso zzso proved that zzso acts in a cell autonomous manner to regulate positive selection but not negative selection of zzso T zzso Our results indicate that zzso has a unique function during zzso development that is distinct from the role played by the other zzso zzso of zzso and is in keeping with other recent studies indicating that zzso and zzso zzso have zzso roles during embryonic zzso
