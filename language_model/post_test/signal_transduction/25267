Human zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso do not express the zzso molecules zzso or zzso in zzso or in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso 1 and zzso genes resulted in the expression of high levels of the zzso in these tumor zzso When zzso zzso cells were used as zzso of zzso or zzso zzso in mixed zzso cultures zzso zzso proliferation and generation of zzso zzso T cells as well as levels of their zzso activity were significantly zzso At the same time, a proportion of activated T cells seen to undergo zzso was found to be significantly higher upon zzso with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso cells were found to express zzso on the cell surface and in the zzso as well as zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso However, expression of the zzso zzso did not lead to increased expression of zzso protein on tumor zzso Yet, up to 50% of activated zzso zzso T cells, which were zzso showed evidence of DNA fragmentation in zzso and zzso zzso upon incubation with an excess of zzso zzso for 24 zzso zzso zzso death was equally and only in part blocked by zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso While surface expression of zzso molecules on zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso via zzso zzso it did not rescue activated T cells from zzso zzso The outcome of zzso under these conditions was dependent on the ratio of tumor to T zzso Thus, in the presence of an excess of zzso tumor cells, activated T cells showed increased sensitivity to zzso which did not appear to be zzso zzso These data are important for the development of zzso gene therapy and efforts directed at the generation of zzso cells in zzso
