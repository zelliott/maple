For a zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso channel to enter its open state, zzso zzso in the R domain must be zzso by zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso must bind to the zzso folds and subsequently be zzso zzso with its R domain partially removed, zzso forms a zzso channel that opens independently of protein zzso A zzso with open probability approximately one-third that of the wild type zzso zzso zzso of this portion of the R domain from zzso alters the response of the channel to zzso zzso and zzso compounds that prolong burst duration of the wild type zzso channel but fail to do so in the zzso In addition, the addition of zzso zzso R domain zzso which blocks the wild type zzso channel, has no effect on the zzso zzso However, when the zzso R domain is zzso significant stimulation of the zzso channel results; zzso increases from zzso to zzso These data are consistent with a model for zzso function in which the R domain in the zzso state interacts with the first zzso binding fold to inhibit either binding or zzso of zzso or zzso of the effect to open the zzso but when the R domain is zzso it zzso zzso change and interacts at a separate site in the first zzso binding fold to stimulate either binding or zzso of zzso or zzso of the effect to open the zzso
