zzso zzso remains an unresolved therapeutic challenge because of its zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso due to the complexity of signaling and the zzso of survival pathways in cancer zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of some drugs, targeting most of zzso pathways crucial for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells may be a valid zzso strategy for this zzso Type I zzso zzso may have a role in the zzso and progression of pancreatic zzso but the limit of their clinical use is due to the zzso of tumor resistance mechanisms, including zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins has been frequently detected in pancreatic zzso The selective targeting of these cell survival zzso could be a promising strategy in order to enhance the zzso effects of type I zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, has a zzso activity on zzso In fact, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through direct and/or indirect mechanisms in several normal and cancer zzso This review provides an overview on the current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and zzso activity of these two promising classes of drugs for pancreatic cancer zzso Finally, the synergistic zzso activity of combined zzso and zzso treatment on pancreatic cancer cell lines, evaluated in zzso and the zzso potential clinical applications will be zzso
