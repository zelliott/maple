The zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso environmental signals relayed through zzso zzso and actively zzso zzso formation during zzso zzso growth zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso external stimuli through regulated zzso zzso nuclear zzso and gene expression , but its importance for zzso commitment, particularly in conjunction with zzso remains largely zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso of five head zzso pairs, three of which are zzso zzso involved in zzso formation zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed a synthetic zzso zzso with selected zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso with zzso zzso but not with a zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling involves the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso pair to regulate the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso functioned in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso but it required zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso expression was induced by zzso in a zzso manner, demonstrating a zzso negative feedback zzso These results highlight a role for activated zzso proteins in repression of zzso zzso They also raise the possibility of an unexpected function for zzso and zzso that is independent of their normal upstream zzso zzso
