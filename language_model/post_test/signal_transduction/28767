As zzso zzso establish an infection, they must be able to sense zzso signals and respond by zzso zzso that allow for survival in these hostile zzso zzso cell surface proteins detect these signals and activate signal zzso zzso that ultimately alter gene expression resulting in an zzso cellular zzso Here we review the mechanisms by which a zzso fungus uses the highly zzso zzso signal zzso zzso to regulate cellular differentiation as well as its zzso zzso
