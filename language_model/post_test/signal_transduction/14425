zzso acid zzso has been shown to be associated with zzso in cases such as zzso zzso Crohn's disease of the zzso and radiation zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso are not fully zzso Although the induction of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso acids has been extensively investigated, to date the direct effect of zzso acids on zzso zzso zzso has not been well zzso zzso the current studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of zzso acids on the zzso zzso exchange process utilizing zzso zzso as an in zzso cellular zzso zzso exchange activity was measured as zzso pH zzso zzso zzso The results are summarized as zzso zzso short-term exposure (20 zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso 200 zzso and zzso zzso 200 zzso acids significantly inhibited zzso zzso exchange (by approximately zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso by zzso zzso the reduction in zzso exchange by zzso was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functional and inhibitor studies indicated that zzso induced zzso of zzso exchange was zzso via the zzso of the zzso beta I zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso exchange was completely blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (5 zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, our studies provide direct evidence for zzso of human zzso zzso zzso exchange activity by zzso acids via zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso pathways in zzso zzso
