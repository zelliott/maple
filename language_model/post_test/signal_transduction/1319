The signaling pathways activated by nerve growth factor zzso that account for its ability to promote the survival of zzso are not completely zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical for the survival of several cell types, including zzso To determine whether additional signaling pathways cooperate with zzso to promote survival, we examined other pathways known to be activated by zzso zzso activated protein zzso C zzso in sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso from zzso induced by the withdrawal of zzso zzso of zzso did not inhibit the survival of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso caused only a modest attrition of zzso in the presence of zzso In contrast, the simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso induced the zzso death of zzso sympathetic zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso promoted the expression and zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso indicating that these pathways inhibit programmed cell death at the stage of zzso gene zzso In culture conditions under which zzso zzso alone kills zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to a significant loss of zzso indicating that both pathways are zzso zzso zzso and zzso regardless of the culture conditions, cooperate to promote the zzso survival of sympathetic zzso
