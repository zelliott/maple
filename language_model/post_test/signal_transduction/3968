zzso is a ubiquitous zzso proposed to be a relay zzso various zzso signaling zzso Its high zzso conservation and the identification of the related zzso zzso in rat and zzso in zzso suggested the existence of a zzso zzso A systematic zzso approach allowed the identification of several novel zzso sequences of which two coded for expressed members of the zzso family; the translated zzso sequence shares zzso zzso identity with that of zzso and is thus its rat zzso and zzso zzso to an alternatively spliced product of the same zzso zzso a truncated zzso Within their zzso domain, the alpha zzso probably responsible for zzso zzso zzso is zzso as well as are two consensus zzso zzso in their zzso extension domain, two zzso zzso most likely responsible for membrane attachment through zzso are present in zzso as in zzso The novel identification and characterization of the corresponding proteins showed that all three are associated with the zzso zzso zzso They zzso display several spots of decreasing zzso on two-dimensional zzso suggesting that they are zzso in zzso As for zzso zzso zzso is zzso only in the nervous system by in zzso zzso but at similar levels in the newborn and the adult brain as revealed by Northern zzso whereas zzso expression decreases in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso increases after treatment with nerve growth factor, inducing zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate here the existence of a highly zzso zzso family in zzso of which each member seems to play specific roles, related to the control of cell proliferation and activities for zzso and to that of zzso differentiation for zzso the novel zzso proteins being rather related to the expression of differentiated zzso zzso
