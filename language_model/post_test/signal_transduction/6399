The effects of zzso zzso on gap junction zzso communication zzso were assessed by zzso yellow dye zzso in cultured zzso rat zzso after zzso zzso zzso using zzso cyanide and sodium zzso zzso significantly reduced dye zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of control levels, and zzso with zzso but not its inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the dye zzso up to zzso zzso zzso of control zzso The effect of zzso on zzso dye zzso was abolished by zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso labeled the zzso surface, whereas zzso did not, suggesting the presence of zzso zzso zzso Double zzso zzso showed that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso at the gap junction and that this was prevented by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso confirmed that zzso reduced the zzso zzso of dye zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the reappearance of zzso at the gap zzso zzso caused a decrease in zzso protein levels, and zzso with zzso significantly increased the levels of zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso with zzso blocked the zzso increase of zzso levels in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso in zzso by affecting the zzso of zzso possibly zzso by zzso of zzso via a zzso signaling zzso
