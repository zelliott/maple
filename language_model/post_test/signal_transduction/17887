zzso zzso zzso from the zzso into the zzso nerve involves the growth promoting zzso guidance molecules zzso zzso and zzso 1, each of which zzso zzso behavior at specific regions along the retinal zzso In identifying additional molecules regulating this process during embryonic mouse development, we found that zzso zzso zzso and protein was specifically expressed in zzso cells surrounding retinal zzso at the zzso disc and along the zzso zzso Given that growth cone responses to a specific guidance zzso can be altered by zzso to a second guidance zzso we examined whether retinal zzso responses to zzso were modulated by other guidance signals zzso encountered along the retinal zzso In growth cone collapse, zzso choice and zzso outgrowth zzso zzso triggered an zzso zzso response in the context of zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso suggesting that zzso inhibited retinal zzso throughout their course at the zzso disc and zzso zzso studies in living zzso preparations showed that blocking of zzso function led to retinal zzso zzso out of the zzso nerve zzso indicating that zzso normally helped zzso the retinal zzso Thus, development of some zzso nerves requires zzso zzso to maintain zzso Furthermore, this function is accomplished using molecules such as zzso that exhibit zzso zzso responses in the presence of zzso signals from multiple families of guidance zzso
