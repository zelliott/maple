In adherent cells, zzso interactions are essential for the propagation of some growth factor signaling zzso However, it has not been resolved to what extent different types of zzso zzso regulate the signals zzso by different soluble zzso Our previous work has shown that zzso signaling in zzso zzso requires a specific cell interaction with the basement membrane and does not occur in cells zzso on collagen zzso We have now investigated whether the zzso signaling pathways triggered by insulin, zzso growth factor zzso and zzso are zzso regulated in primary zzso zzso cell cultures established on basement membrane and collagen zzso Two distinct signaling pathways triggered by insulin exhibited a differential requirement for zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was restricted to cells zzso basement zzso whereas the zzso of zzso occurred equally in cells on both zzso The zzso and duration of zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso were strongly enhanced by zzso membrane zzso The mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso in cells cultured on collagen I may in part be zzso by zzso zzso activity since zzso treatment somewhat alleviated this zzso In contrast to the results with insulin, cell zzso to collagen I zzso greater response to zzso leading to higher levels of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso The mechanism for increased zzso signaling in cells adhering to collagen I was partly through an increase in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was independent of the zzso zzso It is well recognized that the cellular environment determines cell zzso We now suggest that this may occur through a selective zzso of growth factor signal zzso resulting from different zzso zzso
