Information zzso has long been suggested as the underlying coding strategy of the primary visual zzso zzso zzso image sequences into blocks has been shown by others to improve agreement between experiments and zzso We have studied the effect of zzso zzso on the formation of zzso zzso is, the zzso of receptive zzso this zzso feature is characteristic to the response function of lagged and zzso cells of the lateral zzso zzso zzso input sequences were used to learn the linear transformation that zzso the information zzso Learning was accomplished by means of principal component analysis and independent component zzso Properties of the emerging zzso filters closely resemble the three major types of zzso zzso simple cells with zzso receptive field, simple cells with zzso receptive field, and complex zzso
