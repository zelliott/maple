Proper zzso function in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the kidney depends upon the acquisition of selective zzso zzso zzso polarity and the expression of key zzso including those involved in zzso toxin and drug zzso Particularly important are the zzso family of zzso including the organic zzso zzso zzso zzso identified as zzso and zzso as well as the organic zzso zzso zzso In ex zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso the embryonic zzso tissue of the zzso zzso function was evident before completion of zzso zzso and corresponded with the maturation of tight junctions as measured zzso by zzso zzso of the tight junction zzso zzso zzso of available time series zzso data sets in the context of development and differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso from both in zzso and in zzso zzso developing zzso allowed for correlation of gene expression data to zzso and functionally defined states of zzso This zzso analysis yielded a network of genes with connectivity biased toward zzso (but including zzso zzso zzso and notch zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes were found to have strong zzso zzso with zzso in the cultured zzso supporting the notion of some connection between the zzso and this zzso zzso Taken together with the zzso finding that zzso occupies zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoters in the in zzso zzso rat zzso the data suggest a network of genes with zzso at its center plays a role in regulating the terminal differentiation and capacity for drug and toxin handling by the nascent zzso zzso of the zzso
