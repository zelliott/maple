The effect of zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso signaling zzso of human zzso melanoma cell line zzso was zzso Two types of zzso targeting zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso cells, and zzso cells and cells zzso with scramble zzso were used as blank control and negative control zzso The expression levels of zzso and protein of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling target gene zzso were detected after real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure cell proliferation after zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso was used for assessing zzso signaling zzso zzso Our results showed that the two types of zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cells zzso As compared with zzso cells, zzso zzso had no significant influence on zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to the decrease of zzso at protein zzso zzso signaling zzso activity was inhibited zzso As a target of zzso zzso zzso was decreased at both zzso and protein levels, and cell proliferation was zzso Our study suggests that zzso may play an important role in zzso signaling zzso in human zzso melanoma cells by regulating zzso protein level, indicating that zzso is involved in the progression of zzso melanoma through zzso signaling zzso
