A zzso activity that zzso zzso basic protein in zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso from human zzso zzso interaction studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed that the zzso specifically associates with the Ral zzso The Ral zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso was found to be the preferred zzso for the Ral zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso interaction was not dependent on the zzso zzso status of zzso zzso was detected in a variety of rat zzso with zzso containing the highest and skeletal muscle the lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso as the zzso demonstrated that the zzso activity was associated with zzso of molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso and was detected in most rat zzso with a prominent 38 zzso band in zzso and a 40 zzso band in zzso Human zzso contained a single band of approximately 36 zzso zzso was distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent protein zzso and zzso dependent zzso To demonstrate in zzso interaction, the zzso zzso complex was isolated using a zzso affinity zzso The zzso complex zzso from this column upon washing with a 13 zzso zzso that encompasses the zzso domain in zzso The data suggest that zzso is a zzso specific zzso that zzso zzso and is zzso associated with zzso The current study provides additional support for a link between Ral and the zzso zzso pathways in the zzso
