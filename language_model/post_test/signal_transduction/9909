zzso zzso is one of the most prominent consequences of exposure to zzso zzso The characteristic features of zzso zzso changes include reductions in the number of the zzso and in the ratio of zzso to zzso T cells in the zzso While these changes have been shown to be caused by zzso of a zzso factor, the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso the zzso biological events that induce the zzso changes have not been zzso In the present study, we examined the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso a likely mechanism suggested by previous studies, in the zzso loss by zzso zzso of zzso We recently generated transgenic zzso mice expressing a zzso active zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso These zzso mice reproduced the zzso zzso caused by zzso at relatively high zzso In this study, we crossed the zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso mice, which have the zzso defective zzso zzso zzso or with zzso mice, which have the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate mice that are defective in zzso signaling and express the zzso in T lineage zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice showed the same extent of zzso reduction as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso T cells in zzso was also not affected by the absence of zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These results show that strong zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso
