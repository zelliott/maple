zzso factor recruitment to zzso sites of action is primarily due to direct zzso zzso The subsequent recruitment of zzso complexes leads to either zzso zzso or zzso In contrast to this zzso zzso some zzso factors, such as the zzso zzso zzso behave as zzso zzso when recruited to target genes through protein zzso We have investigated the zzso prevalence of zzso between zzso and zzso and found zzso zzso namely that zzso zzso to zzso zzso results in zzso repression, whereas zzso zzso to zzso results in zzso Further, other schemes of zzso and zzso zzso to regulatory zzso result in zzso zzso including neighboring and composite binding zzso The results indicate extensive zzso interactions between zzso and zzso further, they provide a zzso assessment of zzso regulation by zzso and a molecular basis for integration of signals zzso by zzso and zzso in health and zzso
