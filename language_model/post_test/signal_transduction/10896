zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein zzso C zzso that has been implicated in the protein zzso maintenance of long term zzso and memory storage in the zzso zzso zzso are uniquely positioned to promote enduring consolidation of structural and functional modifications at the zzso provided that zzso zzso is available on site for local zzso zzso We now report that the zzso zzso zzso is rapidly transported and specifically localized to zzso zzso zzso Transport of zzso zzso is specified by two zzso zzso targeting elements zzso zzso zzso zzso located at the interface of the zzso region and the open reading frame, directs zzso export of the zzso zzso zzso in contrast, is located in the zzso region and is required for delivery of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be subject to zzso control in local zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides a molecular basis for the functional integration of synaptic signal zzso and zzso control zzso
