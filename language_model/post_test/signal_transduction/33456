zzso aging of the brain is inevitable, regardless of the occurrence of pathological diseases such as zzso disease or cerebral vascular zzso zzso zzso memory zzso is an important zzso of brain zzso In contrast to zzso aging, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso are poorly understood and hindered by the lack of specific zzso for zzso We used the fruit fly zzso as a novel model for genetic analyses of zzso since it has a short lifespan and is suitable for quantitative analysis of learning and zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory in zzso are similar to those in zzso In a screen for zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso delayed zzso onset by more than zzso without affecting lifespan and memory at young zzso The first identification of zzso zzso provides provocative insights into the role of zzso signaling and the genetic relationship between zzso aging and brain zzso
