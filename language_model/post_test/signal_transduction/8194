zzso receptors zzso are a family of four G zzso receptors that are widely distributed in the zzso and involved in neural cell zzso differentiation and zzso The zzso system zzso continuous zzso throughout life and may represent a critical target of zzso cellular zzso In the present study we investigated the functional activity of zzso and zzso in zzso tissue preparations of zzso zzso layer zzso external zzso layer zzso and zzso cell layer zzso of the rat main zzso bulb and in primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso regulated multiple signaling zzso including zzso of zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation, stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso II and zzso of the zzso G protein zzso predominantly in zzso whereas only zzso of zzso was detected in the deeper zzso zzso nerve zzso by zzso irrigation with zzso induced a marked decrease of zzso signaling in zzso In primary cultures of zzso zzso double zzso analysis showed the zzso of zzso and zzso in cells positive for zzso protein and zzso zzso Cell exposure to either zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso peptides caused rapid zzso zzso This study provides the first characterization of the zzso distribution of zzso and zzso signaling in rat zzso bulb, demonstrates the presence of the receptors in zzso sensory zzso and suggests a role of zzso in zzso sensory zzso zzso
