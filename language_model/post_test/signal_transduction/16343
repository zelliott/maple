The role of zzso zzso zzso and its interaction with protein zzso C zzso in zzso to regulate zzso production has not been reported so zzso The present study thus investigates such mechanisms in the zzso cell line and human zzso zzso treatment to zzso cells induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso production was significantly reduced in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso production as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso activity and zzso production were significantly zzso whereas zzso inactive zzso and zzso small interfering zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction was observed in zzso cells, and this interaction was regulated by zzso zzso zzso their small interfering zzso and zzso inhibitor also attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso however, failed to affect zzso zzso zzso A similar role of zzso in zzso production and its regulation by zzso was evident in the primary human zzso thus signifying the importance of our zzso To our knowledge, the results obtained demonstrate for the first time that zzso and zzso functionally interact to regulate zzso production in zzso zzso A novel mechanism of zzso production that involves zzso zzso and the zzso axis is thus being zzso
