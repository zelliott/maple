zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is an important human zzso that occasionally causes localized infections and less frequently causes severe invasive disease with high mortality zzso How zzso regulates expression of factors used to colonize the host and avoid immune responses remains poorly zzso zzso communication is an important means by which bacteria coordinate gene expression to defend against host assaults and competing bacteria, yet no zzso zzso signaling system has been zzso in zzso zzso within the zzso zzso are four zzso zzso two of which zzso and zzso have no previously described zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso or zzso rely on zzso peptides to control zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso together tightly regulate two linked genes zzso new zzso zzso zzso activates zzso of and is required for full induction of the zzso zzso while zzso plays an zzso role and zzso zzso zzso The active zzso signals, termed zzso and zzso are short and zzso zzso and, though highly similar in zzso their ability to disrupt zzso complexes were observed to be different, indicating that specificity and differential zzso of promoters are characteristics of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso signaling requires an intact zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso supporting the model that zzso are zzso processed to the mature form, and subsequently imported to the zzso to interact directly with the zzso zzso At least one consequence of zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso is increased zzso of zzso which zzso negative regulation of zzso by zzso zzso These data provide the first demonstration that zzso zzso sensing functions in zzso and substantiate the role that zzso play as zzso receptors across the zzso zzso
