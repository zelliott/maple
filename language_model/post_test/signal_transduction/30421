zzso element binding factors zzso are zzso zzso factors, many of which have been linked to stress zzso A novel zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated by zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a total length of zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso a protein of 222 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso and a calculated zzso of zzso zzso alignment shows that zzso contains a 58 zzso acid long zzso domain and a zzso nuclear zzso zzso and belongs to a group II protein in the zzso zzso as typified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is a single copy gene in cotton zzso Using green fluorescent protein fusion, we demonstrate that zzso accumulates specifically in the nucleus of onion zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso is zzso expressed in true leaves, roots, seeds and zzso The transcripts of zzso accumulate highly and rapidly when plants are treated with zzso zzso salt, cold, drought stresses and zzso zzso acid zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso is regulated by certain components of the stress signaling zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso upstream region of zzso possesses some elements induced by zzso and environmental zzso These results indicate that zzso may play an important role in response to zzso zzso and environmental zzso
