zzso is a critical regulator of cell behavior during zzso and zzso zzso It also plays a crucial role in repair by modulating zzso zzso activity during the zzso phase of zzso wound zzso We zzso that growth factors liberated during the initial phase of wound healing convey signals to induce zzso of zzso zzso signaling during the zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and cultured from mice containing a zzso reporter responsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with growth factors present at the initial phase of wound zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased zzso protein levels and zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso expression was zzso This increase was attributed to zzso of zzso a zzso important for zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso or zzso before wounding of zzso mice resulted in larger scars and zzso within these wounds that strongly stained for zzso indicating significant zzso zzso activity in zzso Thus, zzso signaling is activated downstream of growth factors released during the initial phase of wound repair, and may act during the zzso phase of wound healing to integrate signals from initial phase factors into the expression of genes important during the later, zzso zzso
