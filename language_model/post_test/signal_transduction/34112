A number of recent studies identified nuclear factors that together have the unique ability to induce zzso in differentiated cell zzso However, little is known about the factors that are needed to maintain human embryonic stem zzso cells in an zzso zzso In a search for such requirements, we performed a comprehensive zzso of publicly available zzso and zzso zzso The rationale for this analysis was to identify genes that are exclusively expressed in human zzso cell lines compared to 30 differentiated tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found among the genes with an zzso zzso expression profile in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso validation by quantitative zzso and flow zzso confirmed that zzso zzso levels in human zzso cells are up to zzso higher compared to differentiated cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso cells induced dramatic changes in the zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of expression levels of germ zzso marker zzso and a rapid loss of expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso These findings identify the zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso surface zzso with a likely important role in the maintenance of zzso cell zzso zzso
