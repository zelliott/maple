The tumor zzso zzso is at the hub of cellular signaling networks that are activated by stress signals including DNA zzso In the present study, we showed that programmed cell death 5 zzso bound to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced the stability of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear export and zzso zzso We also found that zzso could zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso and interact with zzso directly to promote its zzso In cells with or without induction of DNA damage, zzso of zzso by zzso interference decreased the zzso zzso at zzso 20 and zzso zzso as well as the expression of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso association of zzso at the zzso site of the zzso promoter during DNA zzso Cell cycle analysis also indicated that zzso was required in zzso phase cell arrest during DNA zzso In zzso zzso may contribute to maintain a zzso pool of zzso proteins in zzso conditions, but upon DNA damage it functions as a zzso of zzso to regulate zzso and cell cycle zzso
