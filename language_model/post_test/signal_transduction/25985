U2 zzso is the most potent zzso in zzso which is involved in cardiac zzso including cardiac zzso and cardiac zzso Although the cellular mechanisms of the zzso zzso have been extensively zzso the zzso pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso growth zzso expression and collagen synthesis remain zzso In this study, we show that U2 promoted collagen synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cardiac zzso The zzso collagen synthesis and zzso production were significantly but not completely inhibited by blocking zzso Both zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso could separately inhibit zzso collagen zzso and the synergistic zzso effect was observed by blocking zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that U2 promotes collagen synthesis via zzso and independent zzso zzso in zzso cardiac zzso
