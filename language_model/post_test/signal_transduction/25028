We have shown that moderately differentiated zzso zzso zzso cells differentiate in response to zzso acid treatment, illustrated by their reorganization of zzso filaments and cell enlargement zzso et zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein zzso zzso caused a dramatic reorganization of zzso filaments in zzso cells, similar to zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the possibility that the zzso effects of zzso are due to zzso decreases in zzso of zzso and changes in downstream zzso zzso zzso acid caused a decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid treatment induced a dramatic zzso filament reorganization and cell zzso Treatment with zzso reversed this effect, because cells treated with zzso acid followed by zzso only possessed disrupted zzso zzso and appeared small, thus resembling medium zzso zzso acid induced a zzso and decrease in the amount of zzso zzso another zzso protein which is an zzso protein for zzso zzso In addition, zzso acid induced a zzso of zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso acid decreased cell detachment in detachment zzso one-half as many zzso cells detached as in zzso These results are consistent with the idea that zzso acid zzso differentiation of zzso cells by interfering with the zzso signaling zzso
