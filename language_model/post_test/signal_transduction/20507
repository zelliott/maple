The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso has been identified as a marker of cycling stem cells in several zzso zzso including small zzso zzso stomach and hair zzso To investigate whether zzso also marks zzso zzso stem cells, we performed in zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso progeny population in zzso zzso switches from the zzso to the zzso compartment during the first 12 days of zzso development, likely reflecting local changes in zzso zzso Together, our findings point to a zzso contribution of zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso lineages during zzso zzso zzso zzso
