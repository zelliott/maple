The present investigation analyzes the cellular distribution of zzso zzso receptors zzso and the gamma zzso of protein zzso C zzso in the rat zzso zzso employing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were most present in layers 2, 3 and 5, whereas most zzso zzso cells were found in layers 2, 5 and zzso Under normal, zzso conditions, approximately zzso of all zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso zzso nearly all zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso express the two types of zzso the zzso cell type represents the vast zzso Of all cortical zzso the large zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in layer 5 express the gamma zzso of zzso most abundantly and most zzso zzso zzso of these cells are zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a pronounced increase in the intensity of zzso zzso which may suggest that the zzso are functionally linked to the zzso zzso zzso No change was found in the number of zzso zzso In contrast, the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased by approximately 38% after zzso zzso The high degree of zzso in cortical zzso of both zzso proteins suggests a considerable zzso impact upon the regulation of zzso zzso a candidate key zzso in cortical learning and memory zzso
