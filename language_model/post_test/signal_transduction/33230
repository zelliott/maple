The presence of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in isolated rat pancreatic zzso was demonstrated by Western zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso activated zzso activity in a zzso and zzso manner and increased its zzso The threshold concentration of zzso was 10 zzso and the zzso effect was seen at 1 zzso An increase in zzso was observed 1 zzso after 1 zzso zzso zzso reaching a maximum at 10 zzso when zzso activity was increased zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso appears to be zzso by protein zzso C zzso since zzso increased zzso activity zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso or zzso acid had no effect, indicating that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is not important in zzso zzso Although there were some quantitative differences in the extent of zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso had parallel effects on zzso and zzso activities, consistent with a model in which zzso can be regulated in zzso by zzso
