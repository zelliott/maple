zzso based on the zzso zzso sequence of conventional protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibit zzso activity in zzso cells, but whether zzso can be used to study the role of zzso in the proliferation or migration of intact zzso cells zzso and zzso is zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso sequence were zzso to zzso more potent in zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso activity than was the zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso was zzso zzso in intact zzso and compared to zzso zzso growth of zzso expressing zzso was significantly slower than that of control zzso zzso zzso demonstrated slower rate of serum zzso migration than that of either control or zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso produced slower rates of zzso induced zzso migration, as compared to control zzso In an in zzso three-dimensional zzso in which zzso organize into zzso zzso the zzso that expressed zzso formed fewer such zzso This study shows that zzso zzso derived from zzso are more potent both in zzso and in zzso than one based on the conventional zzso zzso These data further support a role for zzso in proliferation and migration of intact zzso and zzso
