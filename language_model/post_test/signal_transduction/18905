zzso is an zzso zzso zzso conveying zzso properties to surface receptors on many cell zzso We show here that zzso paradoxically zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso production in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher levels of zzso and zzso were detected upon zzso infection or zzso treatment in zzso zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso zzso This resulted from altered zzso and enhanced responsiveness of zzso in zzso zzso Increased numbers of zzso were observed in the periphery of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso A higher proportion of zzso was activated in infected zzso mice, as demonstrated by zzso zzso using an zzso protocol for simultaneous detection of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not differ in mixed bone zzso zzso zzso In addition, a similar efficiency of zzso differentiation was observed in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso cultures of zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso This suggests that zzso signaling effects on zzso zzso are zzso In contrast, in response to zzso zzso effects on both zzso and zzso production were intrinsic to the zzso However, in response to zzso only zzso but not zzso production was affected by zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling in zzso can mediate different regulatory effects on their functions, depending on the mechanisms of zzso zzso The potential implications of the regulation of zzso functions by zzso for promoting health over disease are zzso
