zzso dysfunction has been reported in various kidney diseases but how it leads to kidney zzso and how this is regulated is zzso Here we found that zzso zzso protein 2 zzso was induced in kidney zzso zzso cells after unilateral zzso obstruction in mice and that mice with zzso zzso resisted zzso kidney zzso We tested this association further in cultured zzso cells and found that zzso remarkably induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso largely abolished the effect of zzso whereas zzso of zzso promoted zzso cell zzso zzso Analysis using a zzso zzso region zzso construct showed that zzso zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso mimic significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso transition, whereas a zzso inhibitor imitated zzso zzso Finally, zzso an zzso zzso zzso significantly ameliorated kidney zzso in zzso Thus, the zzso axis has an important role in zzso zzso zzso transition and kidney zzso zzso this zzso may shed new light for the future of zzso kidney disease zzso
