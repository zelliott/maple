zzso of the increase in zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso concentration zzso by protein zzso C zzso was investigated in cultured canine zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso led to zzso formation and caused an initial transient peak followed by a sustained zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso for 30 zzso blocked the zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso However, this zzso was reduced after zzso the cells for 4 h with zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso at 1 zzso did not inhibit these responses to zzso Prior treatment with zzso (1 zzso a zzso zzso inhibited the effect of zzso on the zzso response, suggesting that the effect of zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso In parallel experiments, a change of zzso activity was zzso zzso rapidly decreased zzso activity in the zzso of zzso while increasing it zzso in the cell zzso within 30 zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity decreased and persisted for at least 24 h of zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with 1 zzso zzso for 2 and 24 h did not significantly change the zzso and zzso of the BK zzso for zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso inhibit zzso zzso and consequently zzso zzso increase or inhibit independently both zzso The zzso zzso of responses to BK was associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso
