Cell death and removal of cell corpses in a timely manner is a key event in both zzso and pathological situations including tissue zzso and the resolution of zzso zzso clearance of cells dying by zzso is a complex sequential process zzso attraction, recognition, zzso zzso and ultimately zzso and degradation of cell zzso A wide range of molecules acting as zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors or soluble bridging molecules have been implicated within this zzso The role of zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso cell interactions with zzso has long been known though key molecules and zzso involved have not been zzso Here we sought to further dissect the function of zzso in zzso cell zzso A novel panel of zzso zzso zzso was employed to demonstrate that zzso mediates effective zzso cell interactions with zzso in the absence of zzso zzso whilst binding and responsiveness to zzso requires zzso Using a targeted series of zzso point zzso expressed in zzso cells we reveal zzso zzso 11 as key in the binding of zzso cells whilst other zzso are reported as key for zzso zzso zzso we note that expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso the ability to bind rapidly to zzso zzso Analysis of a panel of zzso cells reveals that a number naturally express zzso and that this is competent to mediate zzso cell zzso Taken together these data suggest that zzso relies on zzso 11 for zzso cell zzso and it may be an important zzso zzso on so called zzso zzso thus contributing to zzso cell clearance in a zzso zzso zzso these data establish zzso as a zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso which may thus zzso responsiveness of circulating zzso to zzso cell derived zzso
