In zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso regulate the selective stabilization of zzso zzso polarized in the direction of zzso The zzso zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso is involved both in zzso zzso and zzso stabilization, and the relationship between these two activities is zzso We found that zzso A zzso and zzso zzso drugs that release zzso from zzso filament barbed ends, zzso stable zzso formation in zzso zzso and caused a zzso of zzso onto zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso prevented stable zzso induction by zzso whereas blocking upstream zzso or zzso signaling had no zzso In search of zzso regulators of zzso we found that zzso protein induced stable zzso in an zzso manner and inhibited the zzso of zzso on the ends of growing zzso zzso zzso of capping protein by zzso reduced stable zzso levels in zzso cells and in starved cells zzso with zzso zzso These results show that zzso protein is a novel regulator of zzso stability that functions by zzso zzso activity toward zzso filaments and suggest a novel form of zzso zzso in which a single factor acts zzso on zzso and zzso
