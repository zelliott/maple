Communication between cells is important to the zzso and enables the coordination of cellular behavior along the length of the zzso zzso span considerable distances within the zzso network, and thus flow changes require the adaptation of vessel resistance over the whole length of the vessel in order to be zzso Such a task requires communication along the vessel wall, and gap junction channels that connect zzso as well as smooth muscle cells with each other set the stage for this zzso Communication along the vessel wall can be tested zzso by confined local stimulation of zzso either in zzso or in zzso Certain vascular stimuli induce both a local response and a zzso uniform remote response, confirming the rapid zzso of zzso stimuli along the vessel zzso Gap junctions in vascular tissue are composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso is of special zzso its lack results in a deficient zzso of zzso stimuli along the vessel zzso Interestingly, zzso mice display an elevated mean zzso pressure, suggesting that zzso gap zzso zzso is necessary to regulate vascular behavior and peripheral zzso While the role of other zzso is less well established, an abundance of experimental data has proven the necessity of gap zzso communication to coordinate vascular behavior during zzso blood flow zzso
