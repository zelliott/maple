Three zzso of zzso exist in zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso All three proteins share high zzso in their zzso acid zzso yet each zzso zzso has unique zzso motifs that are highly zzso during zzso Although these zzso proteins share similar properties in zzso zzso properties have been suggested through in zzso studies and by the unique zzso for each zzso zzso zzso To test our hypothesis that each of these zzso has zzso functions, and to identify such zzso roles, we genetically exchanged the coding sequence of the mature zzso zzso with a sequence from zzso using targeted zzso to create zzso zzso zzso mice zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso still occur through the zzso zzso associated zzso but cell signaling is triggered through the zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso Unlike zzso mice, the zzso mice show neither embryonic zzso nor signs of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso of the zzso zzso can prevent the zzso defects and zzso associated with zzso zzso However, the zzso mice have a shortened life span and display tooth and bone zzso indicating that the zzso zzso are not completely zzso zzso the zzso mice display an improved zzso zzso with reduced body weight gain and enhanced zzso tolerance by induction of beneficial changes to the white zzso tissue zzso These findings reveal both redundant and unique zzso functional diversity in zzso zzso signaling that has relevance to the design of zzso aimed at targeting the zzso zzso in human zzso
