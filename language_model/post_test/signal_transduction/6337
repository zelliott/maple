Previous studies have shown that zzso has an essential role in maintaining zzso of cells of the inner cell mass zzso and embryonic stem zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso die around the time of zzso thus zzso further analysis of gene function during zzso We have used the conditional zzso gene targeting strategy to assess zzso function in primordial germ cells zzso Loss of zzso function leads to zzso of zzso rather than to differentiation into a zzso zzso as has been described for zzso ICM zzso These new results suggest a previously unknown function of zzso in maintaining viability of zzso zzso
