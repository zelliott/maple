Major depression is a common, zzso zzso and often life-threatening zzso There is a growing appreciation that, far from being a disease with purely psychological manifestations, major depression is a systemic disease with deleterious effects on multiple organ zzso zzso life events have a substantial zzso association with depression, and there is now compelling evidence that even early life stress constitutes a major risk factor for the subsequent development of zzso The emerging evidence suggests that the combination of zzso early life stress, and ongoing stress may ultimately determine individual responsiveness to stress and the vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, such as zzso It is likely that genetic factors and life stress contribute not only to zzso zzso but also to the zzso of cellular plasticity and resilience observed in zzso Recent zzso and clinical studies have shown that signaling pathways involved in regulating cell plasticity and resilience are long-term targets for the actions of zzso zzso Agents capable of reversing the hypothesized zzso of cellular zzso reductions in brain volume, and cell death or zzso in depression have the potential of becoming new therapeutic classes of zzso zzso Novel cellular targets include agents targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso The future development of treatments that more directly target molecules in critical zzso zzso nervous zzso signaling pathways that regulate cellular plasticity thus hold promise as novel, improved long-term treatments for major zzso
