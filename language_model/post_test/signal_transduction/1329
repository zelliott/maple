zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent zzso factor responsible for promoting synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso zzso a major inhibitor of the zzso zzso In a variety of cells, zzso zzso of target genes requires active protein zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso We determined the role of zzso in the regulation of pulmonary zzso collagen synthesis in response to zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso have opposing effects on zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with specific small zzso zzso restores zzso induction of zzso and in parallel significantly reduces zzso collagen zzso Thus, zzso may play a critical role in the zzso of pulmonary zzso and may serve as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention to suppress zzso
