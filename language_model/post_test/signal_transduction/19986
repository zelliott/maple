The zzso acid zzso zzso is a recognized zzso of growth hormone zzso and has been shown to induce zzso gene zzso zzso is the natural precursor of zzso oxide zzso which is known to mediate many of the effects of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso was also shown to increase calcium influx in zzso cells, which might contribute to its effects on zzso zzso Although the mechanisms involved in the effects of zzso on zzso zzso are well established, little is known about them regarding the control of zzso gene zzso We investigated whether the NO zzso and/or calcium are involved in the effects of zzso on zzso gene expression in rat isolated zzso To this end, zzso from approximately 170 male zzso rats zzso zzso were removed, divided into two halves, pooled (three zzso and incubated or not with zzso as well as with different pharmacological zzso zzso (71 zzso the NO donor sodium zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso 1 zzso increased zzso zzso expression 60 zzso zzso The NO zzso zzso zzso zzso blunted the effect of zzso and the combined treatment with zzso and zzso (a NO zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso The calcium channel inhibitor zzso (3 zzso also abolished zzso zzso gene zzso The present study shows that zzso directly zzso zzso gene expression in zzso isolated from rats, excluding interference from zzso zzso which are supposed to be inhibited by zzso Moreover, the data demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso and calcium mediate the zzso effects on zzso gene zzso
