zzso zzso a major active zzso of green tea, has been shown to zzso inflammatory responses in zzso cells zzso however, the underlying mechanism has not been zzso Recently, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso In this study, we showed the molecular basis for the zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso signal zzso by zzso in zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso class I and II, which are molecules essential for zzso presentation by zzso were inhibited by zzso via zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso Interestingly, we also found that zzso markedly elevated the expression of the zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso through zzso These novel findings provide new insight into the understanding of negative regulatory mechanisms of the zzso signaling zzso and zzso inflammatory responses that are implicated in the development and progression of many chronic zzso
