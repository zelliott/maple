Here, we identified human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso a marker of muscle satellite cells and zzso alkaline zzso a marker of zzso in zzso zzso To determine whether human zzso zzso cells are able to act as zzso cells, we cultured both primary and immortalized zzso cells derived from the healthy muscle of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso spontaneously expressed two zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso and zzso and were able to undergo terminal zzso differentiation without exposure to an zzso zzso agent such as bone zzso zzso They also expressed the muscle zzso proteins zzso and zzso and lost their zzso characteristics in association with terminal muscle zzso Both zzso and zzso properties are thus simultaneously expressed in the human zzso cell lineage prior to commitment to muscle zzso In addition, zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso blocked zzso but not zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that human zzso zzso cells retain the capacity to act as zzso cells that form zzso bone spontaneously, and that zzso signaling is involved in a critical switch between zzso and osteogenesis in the human zzso cell zzso
