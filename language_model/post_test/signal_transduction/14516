zzso element binding zzso proteins are involved in zzso regulation in a number of cellular processes zzso neural plasticity and zzso zzso The zzso family contains zzso and zzso that may interact through positive and negative feedback zzso These zzso can be generated by zzso and zzso of expression of zzso zzso via zzso elements in or near their zzso zzso suggest that such feedback zzso may operate in several systems zzso zzso and zzso To understand the functional implications of such feedback zzso which are zzso via zzso of transcription, a minimal model with a positive and negative loop was developed and investigated using zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed diverse zzso dynamics zzso zzso and zzso The stability of steady states or zzso could be changed by time delays in the synthesis of the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso Investigation of zzso fluctuations due to small numbers of molecules of zzso and zzso revealed a zzso distribution of zzso molecules in the zzso zzso The zzso of the stable HIGH and LOW states of zzso expression to zzso noise zzso and a critical number of molecules was required to sustain the HIGH state for days or zzso zzso positive feedback or decreasing negative feedback also increased the lifetime of the HIGH state, and persistence of this state may correlate with long-term memory zzso A critical number of molecules was also required to sustain robust zzso of zzso zzso If a steady state was near a deterministic zzso zzso point, zzso resonance could induce zzso This comparative analysis of deterministic and zzso dynamics not only provides insights into the possible dynamics of zzso regulatory zzso but also demonstrates a framework for understanding other regulatory processes with similar network zzso
