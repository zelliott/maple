zzso are versatile immune cells that can detect a variety of zzso molecular patterns through their zzso receptors zzso In response to microbial challenge, the zzso zzso zzso an zzso program controlled by a zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso a complex zzso zzso network poses significant challenges and requires the integration of multiple experimental data zzso In this work, we zzso a zzso network underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profiling and zzso factor binding site motif scanning were used to zzso a network of associations between zzso factor genes and clusters of zzso target zzso The zzso correlation was used to analyze zzso expression data in order to identify potential zzso influences in the zzso A novel statistical test was developed to assess the significance of the zzso zzso Several associations in the resulting zzso network were validated using targeted zzso zzso The network incorporates known regulators and gives insight into the zzso control of zzso zzso Our analysis identified a novel regulator zzso that may have a role in zzso zzso
