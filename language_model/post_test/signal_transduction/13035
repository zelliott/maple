In the zzso embryonic central nervous system, neural stem cells, called zzso acquire fates in a zzso zzso Recent work has identified a set of genes that functions along the zzso axis to enable zzso that develop in different zzso zzso to acquire distinct zzso These genes include the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso nerve zzso defective and intermediate zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene zzso also plays a crucial role to pattern the zzso along the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and intermediate columns of the zzso and zzso analysis indicates that zzso regulates cell fate and zzso formation in these zzso zzso zzso tests, double zzso analysis and zzso interactions demonstrate that during these zzso zzso functions in parallel with zzso nerve zzso defective and intermediate zzso zzso and downstream of zzso zzso signaling to mediate its effect on zzso These results identify zzso as an important regulator of zzso pattern in the zzso and indicate that zzso acts in concert with zzso nerve zzso defective and intermediate zzso defective to regulate pattern and cell fate in the zzso
