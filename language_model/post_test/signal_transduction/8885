Environmental exposure to zzso metals through various sources including exposure to welding fumes has been linked to an increased zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso fumes contain many different metals including zzso typically present as zzso containing zzso zzso zzso However, possible zzso effects of this metal oxide on zzso zzso cells are not well zzso In the present study, we characterized zzso zzso zzso cellular events in cell culture models of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso cells including primary zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was determined to be 37 zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso effect was accompanied by a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of metal zzso proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso oxygen species generation, followed by release of zzso zzso c into zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso exposure induced zzso zzso of native protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to yield a 41 zzso zzso active zzso resulting in a persistent increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso mediate zzso zzso Also, zzso with zzso almost completely inhibited zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso using zzso protected zzso cells from zzso zzso cell zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso can exert zzso effects in zzso zzso cells via zzso zzso zzso suggesting that metal exposure may promote zzso zzso zzso
