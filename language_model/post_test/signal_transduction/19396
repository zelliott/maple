Combining zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso or conventional zzso drugs represents a promising new strategy against zzso zzso zzso is a highly potent and selective zzso inhibitor undergoing phase I human clinical zzso The effects of zzso zzso as a single agent and in combination with zzso were studied in 3 early passage primary pancreatic cancer zzso zzso 21, and 23, grown zzso 

zzso effects were determined in separate groups following chronic drug zzso zzso on cell cycle and downstream zzso were examined by flow zzso and western zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso were measured to monitor the drug zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso showed significant growth zzso in all the 3 models, with a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in zzso accompanied by a large decrease in zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest predominantly in zzso The zzso zzso protein was inhibited to a greater extent with combination treatment in all the three zzso Blood plasma zzso analyses indicated that zzso levels achieved in zzso are similar to those that produce target zzso and cell cycle arrest in zzso 

Agents targeting the zzso and zzso zzso have zzso activity in primary zzso and these results support testing this combination in pancreatic cancer zzso
