Two zzso cell populations of the zzso zzso and zzso were examined for expression of two zzso important zzso zzso class II and zzso oxide zzso following treatment with zzso zzso induced both molecules in zzso at substantially higher levels than zzso The addition of zzso to zzso elevated class II expression and NO in both zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso C, diminished zzso induction of class II zzso and NO in both zzso zzso zzso was most effective in zzso class II zzso zzso but had little zzso effect on NO zzso These results indicate zzso are more effective than zzso in producing zzso and zzso immune zzso in response to zzso and or zzso and multiple zzso but zzso signaling events are required for zzso induced class II zzso or NO zzso
