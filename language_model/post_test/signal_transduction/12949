zzso are essential to the normal development and maintenance of the nervous zzso zzso signaling is zzso by zzso family zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as by the zzso zzso zzso Here we have deleted the zzso gene in zzso precursors by zzso zzso zzso to study the function of the zzso in the zzso Despite the absence of zzso the mature zzso of zzso mice appears similar to that of wild type, with all types of cell present in normal numbers and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso appear normal and the former have typical numbers of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso are strongly zzso although present in normal numbers, they express reduced amounts of zzso markers and develop reduced numbers of zzso zzso and synaptic zzso Thus, zzso is essential to the development of zzso zzso and regulates zzso formation in addition to its role in the development of zzso zzso
