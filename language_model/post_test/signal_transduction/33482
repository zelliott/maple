zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the negative regulation of insulin and zzso zzso zzso knockout mice are hypersensitive to insulin and zzso and resistant to obesity when fed a high-fat zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of food zzso insulin and zzso actions and signaling in rats through selective decreases in zzso expression in discrete zzso zzso We generated a selective, transient reduction in zzso by infusion of an zzso zzso designed to blunt the expression of zzso in rat zzso areas surrounding the third zzso in control and obese zzso The selective decrease in zzso zzso resulted in decreased food zzso reduced body weight, reduced zzso after high-fat zzso improved zzso and insulin action and signaling in zzso and may also have a role in the improvement in zzso metabolism in zzso obese zzso
