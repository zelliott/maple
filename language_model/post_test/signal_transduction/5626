zzso are zzso cells for melanoma, which arises through zzso progression from zzso to zzso to zzso zzso Our previous data showed that zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in zzso guidance, stimulates zzso zzso and zzso through opposing actions of zzso and zzso C1 zzso We now show that zzso C1 is diminished or absent in human melanoma cell zzso analysis of tissue zzso of zzso melanoma, and zzso melanoma showed a decrease in zzso C1 expression in zzso melanoma, and an inverse correlation of zzso C1 expression with depth of zzso We examined the signaling zzso of zzso and downstream targets of zzso C1 in human zzso zzso activated zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso an zzso protein involved in cell zzso When zzso C1 expression was zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso indicating that zzso is downstream of zzso zzso Further, Lim zzso II, a protein that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso These data identify zzso C1 as a potential tumor zzso protein in melanoma zzso and suggest that loss of zzso C1 expression may promote melanoma invasion and zzso through loss of zzso signaling on zzso zzso
