zzso cell death of the zzso duct eliminates the primitive female zzso tract during normal male sexual zzso zzso zzso substance zzso or zzso triggers zzso by zzso a zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso that culminates in zzso of the zzso duct zzso zzso the zzso zzso used in this zzso event are zzso We have identified a member of the zzso zzso gene family, zzso as one of the first candidate target genes downstream of the zzso cascade to function as a zzso death factor in zzso duct zzso zzso with a role in regression, zzso expression was significantly elevated in male but not female zzso duct zzso Furthermore, this sexually zzso expression of zzso was extinguished in mice lacking the zzso zzso suggesting strongly that zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso Using rat organ zzso zzso organ cultures, we found that zzso of zzso activity prevented zzso regression, whereas zzso of zzso promoted zzso zzso duct zzso Finally, zzso zzso experiments resulted in partial zzso of zzso duct zzso Based on our findings, we propose that similar to other zzso programs where selective elimination or zzso of zzso occurs, localized induction of zzso zzso is critical for normal male zzso zzso
