Recent studies have demonstrated a significant association between zzso in genes involved in the zzso signaling zzso and extension of the life span of model zzso In this study which compared 122 Japanese zzso zzso than zzso with 122 healthy younger controls, we examined zzso variations of six genes which are involved in zzso zzso These genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the possible association of each gene locus and longevity by zzso association analyses using 18 zzso from public databases and the published zzso One zzso zzso which was comprised of 2 zzso in linkage zzso was more frequent in zzso than in younger zzso
