zzso nuclear zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso samples and zzso zzso signaling in a class of zzso cell lines with low zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso imply an important role of the zzso zzso zzso system in zzso However, most zzso and zzso cell lines depend on the activity of the zzso and the role of zzso in these zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso signaling by the zzso inhibitor zzso reduced proliferation and increased zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso activity and target gene expression were zzso reduced, whereas zzso protein levels remained zzso on zzso zzso Similar effects were observed particularly after small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not by zzso suppression of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso whereas nuclear zzso was reduced by zzso zzso or zzso However, because zzso also enhances the activity of a chronically nuclear zzso zzso zzso of the zzso distribution seems not to be the only mechanism by which zzso enhances zzso zzso Finally, reduced in zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment and in zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso imply that zzso constitutes a novel zzso zzso Taken together, our data identify zzso as a potentially target structure for future therapeutic intervention in zzso
