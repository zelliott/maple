zzso zzso zzso visceral zzso cells, have two kinds of zzso namely major processes containing zzso zzso and foot processes with zzso filaments zzso The present study investigated how zzso are organized by the zzso signal zzso zzso during process formation of zzso 

After induction of zzso zzso of the zzso immortalized mouse cell line were treated with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso as well as with zzso whose effects include zzso of zzso in order to inhibit the zzso zzso 

zzso of ROCK significantly enhanced the formation of thick processes containing zzso zzso zzso promoted process formation even in the presence of zzso A which zzso zzso strongly suggesting that ROCK directly regulates zzso zzso Treatment with zzso increased zzso stability, and stabilized zzso zzso localized in zzso zzso Moreover, when treated with a combination of zzso and zzso and with zzso and zzso as well, zzso developed not only zzso thick processes but also zzso thin zzso 

These data indicate a contribution of ROCK in zzso organization to promote zzso process formation, although it was originally thought to regulate zzso zzso zzso thin projections seem to be induced mainly by zzso of zzso and zzso The present study reveals a significant role of the zzso signal zzso in the reorganization of both zzso and zzso during process formation of zzso
