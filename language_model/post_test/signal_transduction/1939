A common zzso gene zzso zzso influences G protein zzso signal zzso We investigated whether this zzso influences zzso in isolated subcutaneous fat cells from 114 healthy obese zzso The zzso protein content was markedly decreased in zzso of zzso carriers, but the alternatively spliced short form of zzso previously shown in zzso of zzso carriers was not zzso Fat cells of zzso carriers showed a significant zzso decrease in the zzso effective concentration of zzso selective for zzso zzso and zzso as well as for the zzso zzso In zzso carriers, maximum zzso zzso zzso was zzso but the maximum zzso effect of zzso was less zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and circulating zzso levels of free fatty acids and zzso were reduced by half in zzso zzso The zzso did not influence the zzso content of zzso zzso zzso or zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso of zzso influences zzso zzso of zzso carriers have a lower zzso protein content and a decreased function of native zzso as well as zzso zzso which reduces the zzso effect of zzso These data differ from those obtained in other cell systems that have shown increased expression of an alternative spliced zzso zzso and enhanced G protein signaling in zzso carriers, indicating that the zzso has cell zzso effects that may be of importance for type 2 diabetes and other zzso zzso
