The zzso zzso is an important rhythmic zzso signal in the zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso rhythms in physiology and behavior, but the role of zzso zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso types, zzso and zzso in zzso of daily rhythms to zzso phase shifts is not zzso The present study analyzed locomotor activity rhythms and clock protein levels in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, as well as in zzso zzso mice with targeted deletion of the zzso zzso or both zzso to determine effects associated with phase delays or phase advances of the zzso zzso zzso In all mouse strains and zzso zzso of locomotor activity rhythms was significantly faster after a zzso phase delay than a zzso phase zzso zzso after the phase advance was, however, significantly slower than in zzso animals and in mice lacking functional zzso receptors than zzso animals with intact zzso zzso To investigate whether these behavioral differences coincide with differences in zzso of clock protein levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared between control mice kept under the original zzso cycle and killed at zzso time 04 zzso or at zzso respectively, and experimental mice subjected to a zzso phase advance of the zzso cycle and sacrificed at zzso on the third day after phase zzso This zzso zzso to zzso of the original zzso zzso Under the original zzso cycle, the numbers of zzso and zzso cell zzso were low at zzso and high at zzso in the zzso of all mouse strains and zzso zzso zzso mouse strains with intact zzso signaling and functional zzso receptors showed a significant increase in the number of zzso and zzso cell zzso at the new zzso as compared to the former zzso These data suggest the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso system to phase advances on the level of the zzso molecular clockwork by acting upon zzso zzso
