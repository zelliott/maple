zzso cells zzso are a subset of zzso zzso cells zzso that reside in the zzso as immature DC, where they acquire zzso A key step in the life cycle of zzso is their zzso into mature DC in response to various zzso including zzso zzso with zzso and skin infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso migrate to the zzso zzso where they present zzso to zzso T cells and zzso the zzso immune zzso zzso migration is thought to require the direct action of zzso and zzso on zzso In addition, zzso zzso are present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso produces zzso zzso zzso Both could contribute to zzso zzso We generated zzso zzso mice in which zzso are insensitive to zzso family members and most zzso zzso zzso migration in the steady state, after zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso hypersensitivity in zzso zzso mice was similarly zzso Interestingly, in response to zzso zzso infection, these mice displayed reduced proliferation of zzso zzso T cells and defective zzso subset zzso Surface expression of zzso molecules was intact on zzso but expression of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Thus, sensitivity to zzso signals is not required for zzso migration, but is required for the full zzso and function of zzso in the setting of zzso zzso
