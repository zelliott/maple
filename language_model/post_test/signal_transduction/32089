zzso stimulating factor zzso is a genetically truncated zzso zzso of zzso that is highly expressed during zzso development in fetal zzso and during tumor formation in human zzso zzso However, its potential functional role in regulating tumor metabolism remains zzso Here, we generated an immortalized zzso cell line that zzso zzso zzso and studied their properties relative to zzso control zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso zzso likely via increased zzso zzso In addition, zzso activates the zzso zzso factor zzso resulting in the onset of zzso thereby driving zzso metabolism zzso zzso in the tumor zzso zzso with the idea that zzso zzso fuel tumor growth (via zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased tumor growth, by up to zzso zzso dissection of the zzso signaling zzso indicated that zzso lies downstream of zzso and zzso zzso In accordance with this notion, zzso zzso in immortalized zzso was sufficient to drive zzso zzso to provoke a shift towards zzso metabolism and to promote tumor growth by up to zzso In conclusion, the zzso signaling cascade may be a critical zzso target in preventing zzso cancer metabolism in zzso zzso Thus, zzso functions in the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso by metabolically zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso
