The ability to sense and adapt to a hostile host environment is a crucial element for zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso These cellular responses are evoked by diverse signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Despite previous analysis of central components of the zzso pathway, its downstream signaling network is poorly characterized in zzso zzso Here we performed comparative zzso analysis with zzso signaling zzso to explore zzso genes and their correlation with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we not only provide important insights into zzso patterns of global gene expression for zzso external stresses but also zzso novel characteristics of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso First, zzso of the zzso zzso increases expression of zzso zzso genes and cellular zzso content, zzso a striking synergistic zzso activity with zzso B and providing an excellent opportunity to develop a novel therapeutic method for treatment of zzso Second, a number of zzso genes are zzso regulated by the zzso pathway, and their zzso causes resistance to zzso Finally, we have discovered novel stress defense and zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso system, and elements of the zzso zzso
