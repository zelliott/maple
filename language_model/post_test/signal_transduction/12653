Despite an excellent initial response to zzso hormonal treatment, most patients with zzso prostate cancer will succumb to a zzso form of the zzso Because these tumors are still dependent on a functional zzso zzso zzso there is a need to find novel and more potent zzso While searching for small molecules that bind to the zzso and inhibit its zzso activity, zzso was zzso This novel zzso showed an increased zzso zzso potency compared with the standard zzso zzso in both binding affinity to the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso reporter zzso In mature rats, zzso strongly inhibited zzso growth of the zzso prostate and seminal zzso In the zzso human prostate cancer zzso model, zzso showed increased efficacy over zzso zzso percent tumor growth zzso zzso versus zzso even at exposure levels of zzso zzso greater than what can be attained in zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso in zzso tumors initially zzso to treatment with zzso zzso was highly zzso in the zzso zzso human prostate zzso model, inducing stasis throughout the approximately 30-day zzso To explore the functional mechanisms of zzso gene expression profiling analysis was done on zzso zzso models in zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a global gene expression profile more similar to zzso compared with that of zzso Overall, these data highlight that the unique zzso profile of zzso may provide additional understanding for the hormonal treatment of prostate zzso
