Growth and survival of zzso cells is regulated by growth factors and zzso such as zzso 3 zzso When zzso is removed, cells dependent on zzso kill themselves by a mechanism that is inhibited by zzso of zzso and is likely to be zzso by zzso zzso family zzso Bad and zzso are 2 such zzso zzso family members that have been implicated as key initiators in zzso following growth factor withdrawal, particularly in zzso zzso To test the role of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso family members in zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso cell lines from mice lacking the genes for zzso zzso zzso both Bad and zzso and both zzso and zzso Surprisingly, Bad was not required for cell death following zzso withdrawal, suggesting changes to zzso of Bad play only a minor role in zzso in this zzso zzso of zzso also had no effect, but cells lacking zzso survived and formed colonies when zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso in the presence or absence of zzso and did not require zzso zzso or zzso suggesting zzso zzso survival signals and zzso zzso survival signals are zzso
