zzso tissue is critical for systemic zzso zzso zzso key factors regulating zzso tissue function is a research zzso The zzso zzso of nuclear receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso has emerged as important proteins in different disease states and in the regulation of zzso zzso particularly in liver and zzso However, the expression of the zzso members in human zzso tissue has not previously been zzso and their target genes are largely zzso 

To determine whether the zzso are zzso expressed in human zzso tissue in zzso and identify potential zzso target zzso 

Prospective analysis of zzso zzso tissue before and 1 year after fat loss, and during in zzso differentiation of primary human zzso zzso comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 13 extremely obese patients undergoing zzso diversion with zzso switch for fat loss, 12 extremely obese patients undergoing zzso sleeve zzso and 37 lean individuals undergoing zzso repair or zzso were included in the zzso zzso were done by quantitative zzso gene expression analysis of the zzso members and in zzso promoter analysis based on zzso zzso 

There was a strong zzso of the zzso in extreme obesity and zzso after fat zzso The zzso were expressed at the highest level in zzso fraction compared with zzso but were zzso in both zzso after fat zzso Their expression levels were also significantly higher in zzso compared with zzso zzso in zzso The zzso were zzso during differentiation of primary human zzso Moreover, the zzso were strongly induced within zzso of tissue zzso Finally, promoter analysis revealed potential zzso target genes involved in stress response, immune response, development and other zzso Our data show altered zzso tissue expression of the zzso in zzso suggesting that these stress responsive nuclear receptors may zzso zzso potential in zzso
