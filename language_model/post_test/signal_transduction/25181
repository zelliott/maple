zzso zzso disorders are characterized by migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso loss of expression of zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso synthesis zzso type I zzso We report here that bone zzso zzso zzso a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso both zzso and growth zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso cell growth as measured by zzso zzso into DNA synthesis and cell number in primary human zzso smooth muscle zzso cell zzso zzso addition of zzso stimulates the expression of zzso zzso namely zzso and heavy chain zzso as examined by zzso and Northern zzso zzso The collagen type zzso ratio that becomes lower with the zzso of zzso into zzso is also maintained in zzso cultures as compared to zzso zzso Studies on the mechanism of action indicate that zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso that was zzso during zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso which was shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso These results collectively suggest that zzso maintains the expression of vascular zzso zzso and may prevent vascular zzso disorders, thus potentially acting as a zzso after damage to the vascular zzso
