Links between synaptic plasticity in the lateral zzso zzso and zzso fear learning are well zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso can zzso LA zzso zzso increases zzso in the LA and mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso show more pronounced and persistent fear after zzso zzso zzso Here, we confirmed these initial findings and examined whether they extrapolate to more aspects of zzso physiology and to other forms of aversive zzso zzso zzso application in brain slices from zzso but not zzso zzso mice increased spontaneous zzso activity in LA zzso zzso In zzso slices from zzso zzso mice, zzso did not increase zzso zzso In comparison to zzso zzso but not long-term plasticity was increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no changes were detected in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso mice showed enhanced fear evoked by zzso conditioning and reduced spontaneous firing of zzso in the central nucleus of the zzso zzso Altogether, these results are consistent with a potentially important zzso role of zzso signaling in the zzso However, administration of zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso in brain zzso nor did they affect the expression of zzso fear following zzso zzso zzso zzso mice also failed to show differences in fear expression and extinction after zzso fear zzso and there were no differences in zzso taste zzso or zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso signaling zzso zzso physiology in a zzso fashion that likely is insufficient to generate therapeutic effects across zzso zzso
