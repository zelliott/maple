zzso is an zzso protein that is a zzso for zzso and other zzso protein zzso The presence of zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso as well as multiple zzso zzso sites suggests that zzso is involved in zzso and/or zzso zzso Here we show that stimulation of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane recruitment of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif to zzso generated a zzso zzso zzso protein whose zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was required for its ability to function as a negative regulator of cell zzso Additional experiments revealed that zzso associated with the zzso region and zzso tail of zzso Lyn promoted zzso of zzso and association of zzso and zzso Both Lyn and zzso were capable of zzso zzso However, the use of primary bone zzso mast cells from normal and zzso mice demonstrated that Lyn is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso promotes binding of the zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso recruitment to the plasma membrane where zzso is zzso by zzso and/or zzso family zzso
