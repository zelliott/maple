When skeletal muscle is stretched or injured, zzso satellite cells are activated to enter the cell zzso This process depends on zzso oxide zzso production by NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso growth factor zzso from the zzso zzso and presentation of zzso to the zzso zzso as demonstrated by a primary culture and in zzso zzso We now add evidence that zzso is involved in the satellite cell zzso cascade in zzso zzso medium from cultures that were treated with a calcium zzso zzso zzso for 2 h activated cultured satellite cells and contained active zzso similar to the effect of mechanical stretch or NO donor zzso The response was abolished by addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by its less inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Satellite cells were also shown to express functional zzso protein having a zzso activity at 12 h zzso which is the time at which the calcium zzso was added in this study and the stretch treatment was applied in our previous zzso zzso results from these experiments provide an additional insight that zzso mediates zzso release from the zzso and that this step in the zzso zzso is upstream from NO zzso
