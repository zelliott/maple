A shift towards overall larger very zzso zzso zzso and smaller zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso diameters occurs in insulin resistance zzso which reflects shifts in the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso indicated for zzso simultaneously reduces zzso and shifts in zzso zzso Individual responses to zzso vary, and we conducted a zzso association study to identify genetic differences that could contribute to such zzso 

Association analysis was conducted between single zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso array and zzso particle diameter responses to a zzso zzso trial, in 817 related Caucasian participants of the zzso of zzso zzso Drugs and Diet zzso Linear models were conducted, which adjusted for age, sex and study center as fixed effects, and pedigree as a random zzso The top three zzso associated with each fraction were examined subsequently for associations with changes in zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso and zzso genes reached, or closely approached, zzso levels of significance with zzso and HDL diameter responses to zzso respectively zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were associated with a decrease in the concentration of the large zzso zzso only zzso zzso associated with HDL diameter change were not associated with a single zzso concentration change zzso indicating small shifts across all zzso 

We report novel associations between zzso diameter responses to zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso Previous associations of these genes with zzso emphasize the role of zzso in zzso zzso response to zzso
