zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso are zzso associated with zzso to compose the zzso zzso complexes on B zzso The demonstration that different sets of zzso zzso bind to the zzso tails of zzso alpha and zzso beta suggests that zzso alpha and zzso beta may activate distinct second zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso against an exposed zzso of human zzso beta on zzso and B cell zzso zzso of zzso beta on B cells leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso effects zzso identical to those of zzso zzso Our observations thus indicate that zzso of zzso beta does not segregate signal zzso pathways connected with the zzso tails of zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso has been reported to be more effective in triggering zzso than B cells, whereas our results indicated that zzso beta zzso is more efficient in triggering B than zzso zzso In addition to their zzso properties, the zzso beta zzso effectively modulated B cell zzso complexes and blocked terminal differentiation of all plasma cell zzso The findings support the idea that zzso beta could serve as a universal B cell zzso
