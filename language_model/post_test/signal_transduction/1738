This review summarizes data about zzso actions of testosterone on zzso malaria, T cells and zzso produced by our group during the last 15 zzso In zzso mice, testosterone zzso a lethal outcome of blood stage infections with zzso zzso which normally takes a zzso course controlled by genes of the zzso complex and the zzso zzso This zzso effect of testosterone is zzso neither via the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso response nor, after conversion of testosterone to zzso via the zzso zzso zzso acts zzso zzso through surface zzso on zzso T cells and zzso which becomes evident as a rapid rise in the zzso free zzso concentration zzso In T cells, this rise reflects predominantly influx of zzso zzso while it is predominantly due to release of zzso from zzso zzso in zzso The zzso rise in zzso of both zzso and T cells is not inhibited by the zzso zzso and it is also zzso by the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso The surface receptors initiate a zzso signaling zzso of zzso Currently, we are trying to isolate testosterone surface receptors and to investigate a possible zzso of zzso testosterone signaling with other zzso signaling zzso
