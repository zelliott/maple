zzso signals that mediate differentiation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells zzso are largely zzso We have previously shown that protein zzso C zzso zzso (with zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso differentiation of primary human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to mature zzso We now find that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differentiation is zzso blocked by zzso of zzso zzso To further identify zzso signals and downstream events important in zzso zzso differentiation we have characterized a human zzso cell line model of this zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso into zzso cells in response to zzso zzso plus zzso or zzso (with or without the calcium zzso zzso or zzso with different stimuli zzso different aspects of the zzso zzso DC characteristics of zzso zzso cells include zzso zzso adherent cells with long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso DC characteristics include fluid phase zzso zzso zzso and zzso of resting T zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso reveals differences in expression of zzso receptors 1 and 2; zzso zzso zzso beta I, beta II, and zzso and zzso suggesting that these zzso are important for DC zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that zzso or zzso zzso stimulation of zzso is a model of human zzso zzso to DC differentiation and suggest that specific zzso signaling pathways mediate specific events in DC lineage zzso
