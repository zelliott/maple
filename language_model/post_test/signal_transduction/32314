To seek effective drugs zzso zzso zzso virus zzso with the signal zzso required by virus replication as the target zzso 

zzso zzso zzso effect was observed, and zzso method was adopted to detect call activity, in order to assess the zzso capacity of freeze dried powder of zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso was used to check the effect of zzso on signal zzso induced by zzso virus in zzso zzso 

zzso obviously zzso the zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso infection and zzso required for virus zzso The zzso ratio of zzso freeze dried powder at zzso zzso zzso and zzso g zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso The zzso concentration of the positive control zzso was zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The best administration time was from 2 h before infection to 6 h after zzso Western zzso also showed that zzso can notably inhibit zzso zzso nuclear zzso 

zzso can inhibit zzso virus zzso which is related to the zzso zzso of zzso required for virus zzso
