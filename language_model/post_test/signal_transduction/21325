Previous studies indicated that zzso zzso a zzso hormone involved in calcium zzso zzso is zzso induced by steroid hormone zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the rat and human within the window of zzso zzso disruption of zzso CT expression markedly impaired zzso in the zzso To gain insight into the molecular events underlying CT action in the zzso we performed gene expression profiling in response to CT in a human zzso zzso cell line, zzso We identified the gene zzso tissue zzso type II zzso which zzso in zzso zzso zzso as a downstream target of zzso Interestingly, addition of P alone to zzso cells led to a marked induction in the level of both CT and zzso indicating the existence of a zzso involving P zzso CT, and zzso in these zzso Other studies revealed that regulation of the zzso gene by CT occurs via its cell surface zzso and uses both zzso and zzso signaling zzso We also noted that zzso protein is expressed in human zzso during the zzso zzso phase of the zzso cycle, and it is localized at the zzso membrane of zzso zzso and the surrounding zzso The zzso expression of zzso in human zzso during the cycle closely overlapped with that of zzso In zzso we have uncovered a novel zzso signaling cascade in which P zzso CT, which, in turn, zzso zzso and potentially plays a critical role in the human zzso during zzso
