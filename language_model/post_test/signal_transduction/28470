The availability and interactions of signaling proteins are tightly regulated in time and space to produce specific and localized zzso For zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding to its variety of targets zzso signaling zzso and regulates its zzso zzso thereby making it unavailable for subsequent binding zzso Among zzso numerous targets, zzso protein zzso II is one of the most striking due to its unique ability to increase its affinity for zzso by zzso and to zzso when bound to zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to compare mobility and molecular interactions between zzso and zzso protein zzso II in solution and in living zzso These techniques revealed that zzso availability in cells could be altered by a change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exemplifies a generally zzso approach for studying zzso interactions in living cells that allows access to the behavior of signaling molecules within their native environment to probe for zzso in signaling pathways in different cellular zzso
