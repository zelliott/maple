The development of a complex organ requires the zzso of appropriate numbers of each of its constituent cell types, as well as their proper differentiation and correct positioning relative to each zzso During zzso zzso all three of these processes are controlled by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two genes zzso zzso zzso factors that we discovered utilizing an integrated zzso zzso and zzso strategy for identifying genes expressed in the developing zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are required during zzso cell division for the derivation of two distinct cardiac cell types from their mutual precursor and in zzso cell divisions that zzso a third type of heart zzso zzso and zzso control the division of cardiac zzso by regulating the activity of zzso a zzso involved in multiple steps of zzso This zzso demonstrates how zzso factors integrate diverse zzso processes during zzso
