zzso zzso in zzso is sensed and zzso by the carotid body into increased action potential (AP) frequency on the zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso is not zzso but previous work suggested that fast zzso channels play an important role in determining the rate and timing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso We speculated that zzso channel activity between zzso termed persistent zzso current zzso is responsible for zzso generation that and zzso and zzso which inhibit this zzso would impair organ zzso Using whole cell patch clamp recording of intact zzso zzso with projections to the carotid body, we demonstrated that zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso Furthermore, discharge zzso of zzso zzso activity, in zzso during zzso zzso 150 zzso and during acute zzso zzso 90 zzso were significantly reduced by zzso zzso at or above 5 zzso and by zzso at 100 zzso without significant affect on nerve zzso time, zzso magnitude zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effect of both drugs appeared solely zzso because zzso zzso release in the carotid body was not altered by either zzso The respiratory response of zzso unrestrained zzso rats to acute zzso zzso inspired zzso zzso which was measured with whole body zzso was significantly reduced after treatment with zzso (2 zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso and serves an important role in peripheral zzso function and, zzso in the zzso response to zzso
