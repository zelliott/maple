The zzso profile of zzso proteins under zzso conditions and after stimulation by zzso zzso was investigated in intact tissue and in isolated zzso from zzso airway zzso using zzso and zzso specific zzso In intact zzso several zzso were zzso zzso in the absence of any treatment zzso zzso After stimulation by zzso zzso changes in the zzso pattern were detected on seven zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced for three zzso zzso 37, and 44 zzso while zzso zzso was reduced for four zzso zzso 69, 100, and 130 zzso Raising zzso zzso with zzso induced identical changes in the protein zzso zzso zzso of the NO zzso by zzso either NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso abolished the changes in zzso induced by zzso The presence of zzso within the zzso was demonstrated using a specific zzso In addition, in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced protein zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso is an integral part of the zzso NO zzso The surprising observation that zzso zzso is accompanied by sustained zzso of zzso proteins via NO zzso was not detected in isolated zzso suggesting that the protein zzso were either lost or zzso during the isolation zzso This work reveals that any pharmacological manipulation that abolished zzso and zzso also abolished the enhancement of zzso zzso Thus, part or all of the zzso zzso are likely directly involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
