zzso of zzso or zzso yields divergent patterns of zzso that influence zzso and skeletal muscle zzso protein synthesis zzso after zzso zzso comparisons of the effects of contrasting zzso rates exhibited by these proteins are zzso by their differing zzso acid zzso 

Our objective was to determine the effect of divergent zzso by manipulating zzso patterns of zzso protein alone on zzso and anabolic signaling after resistance zzso 

In separate trials, 8 healthy men consumed zzso protein either as a single zzso zzso zzso zzso or as zzso small, zzso drinks zzso ten zzso drinks every 20 zzso to mimic a more slowly zzso zzso zzso and zzso of signaling proteins involved in protein synthesis were measured at rest and after resistance zzso 

zzso increased blood essential zzso acid zzso zzso above those of zzso zzso compared with zzso P zzso zzso 60 zzso after exercise, whereas zzso resulted in a smaller but sustained increase in zzso that remained elevated above zzso amounts later zzso zzso after exercise, P zzso zzso Despite an identical net area under the zzso curve, zzso was elevated to a greater extent after zzso than after zzso early zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso and later zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso (both P zzso zzso There were greater changes in the zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso after zzso than after zzso 

Rapid zzso in the zzso period enhances zzso and anabolic signaling to a greater extent than an identical amount of protein fed in small zzso that mimic a more slowly zzso zzso A pronounced peak zzso after exercise enhances protein zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
