The human zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso via zzso pits then zzso back to the cell zzso In an attempt to identify the molecular zzso involved in this process, we studied several zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso In the absence of zzso zzso receptors lacking the last 32 zzso zzso acids zzso are zzso zzso unlike full-length zzso zzso At steady state, zzso zzso receptors zzso with zzso a marker of early and recycling zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso zzso or by zzso of zzso a dominant negative form of the small zzso zzso or depletion of all three zzso of zzso indicates the involvement of zzso zzso In contrast, a truncated zzso lacking the last 42 zzso zzso acids zzso does not zzso zzso consistent with the possibility that there is a molecular zzso responsible for zzso zzso located in the last 10 zzso acids of zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso of zzso receptors involves a zzso motif zzso The potential role of this motif in the zzso of full-length zzso receptors has also been zzso Our results indicate that a zzso zzso motif is critical for the zzso zzso of truncated zzso zzso We suggest that this motif is masked in full-length zzso receptors which do not zzso zzso in the absence of zzso
