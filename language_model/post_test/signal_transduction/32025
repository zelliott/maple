Multiple sclerosis is a zzso zzso zzso disease of the central nervous system in which zzso and zzso play a central zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso are abundantly found in active multiple sclerosis zzso Recent studies have described an altered zzso zzso after zzso zzso However, it is unclear by which mechanisms zzso affects the zzso of zzso and how this zzso can influence zzso zzso Here we zzso by using zzso wide gene expression analysis, that zzso zzso have an enhanced expression of genes involved in migration, zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso also induced the expression of genes involved in zzso signaling and cholesterol zzso In zzso validation shows that zzso zzso indeed have an increased capacity to dispose zzso zzso In addition, zzso suppresses the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso which was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Our data show that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by nuclear zzso zzso which may subsequently affect zzso progression in zzso diseases such as multiple zzso
