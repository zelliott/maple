The zzso (or zzso type zzso zzso zzso 1) was the first of the family of zzso zzso zzso proteins to be cloned zzso zzso et zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 is expressed in most tissue types, all cell lines, transformed cells and zzso zzso It is thought to be responsible for zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso required for zzso zzso The rate of zzso transport via zzso 1 can be regulated under conditions in which the zzso rate must be adjusted such as cell division zzso and zzso zzso transformation and zzso zzso Here we review the recent literature on the control of zzso transport of zzso growth factors and zzso and discuss some of the implications for the integration of cellular zzso pathways and cell zzso
