zzso necrosis zzso zzso has recently been shown to induce insulin zzso We have examined the possible effect of zzso on the early events in insulin zzso zzso zzso of the zzso rat zzso zzso cells with 5 zzso zzso for 1 h led to a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso of both the insulin zzso zzso and zzso its major zzso zzso zzso impairment of zzso zzso was zzso at zzso zzso and was not accompanied by any reduction in insulin zzso Sixteen hours of zzso incubation led to further impairment in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may exert its zzso effect by interrupting the early zzso zzso zzso events, which are crucial to insulin zzso zzso
