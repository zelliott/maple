Since zzso zzso are a first line of defense against zzso and are involved in both innate and zzso zzso understanding the impact of aging on zzso function is zzso In the past studies, we and others have shown that aging decreases zzso responsiveness to classical zzso signals zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we examined the impact of aging on zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso from male zzso mice aged 2 zzso and zzso zzso months were zzso and then zzso with zzso Western zzso revealed a significant reduction ( approximately zzso in zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso alpha and beta in zzso from aged, when compared with young zzso This reduction in zzso was associated with a significant zzso reduction ( approximately zzso in total zzso protein and a complete zzso of zzso gene expression in response to zzso in old compared to young zzso These data may, in part, explain why classical zzso responses like zzso nitrogen and oxygen species generation, tumor killing and zzso activity are lower in zzso from aged zzso We conclude that zzso zzso from aged mice have an intrinsic zzso in zzso signaling which prevents them from fully responding to zzso
