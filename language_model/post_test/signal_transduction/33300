To assess the role of zzso a zzso G protein exclusively expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in human zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that in zzso cell lines, the expression of zzso zzso protein was zzso but the expression of zzso zzso and zzso remained zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells did not interfere with transient zzso of zzso free zzso zzso induced by zzso E1 zzso zzso factor, or zzso In parental zzso cells, zzso and zzso mobilized zzso from zzso stores with zzso effective zzso of zzso 6 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, apparently by stimulating zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso by zzso or zzso was completely zzso in zzso cells, indicating specific zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso toxin inhibited the effect of zzso in parental zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that signaling by the zzso zzso zzso requires zzso but may be modulated further by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso prior to stimulation with zzso markedly enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso effect of zzso and zzso was not impaired in zzso cells but was inhibited by zzso zzso indicating that functional zzso zzso are present on these cells and that the zzso effect primarily depends on zzso The data demonstrate zzso that zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso that stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso zzso by a mechanism that strictly depends on zzso and zzso that zzso zzso in zzso cells can communicate with two distinct signaling pathways zzso at the G protein zzso
