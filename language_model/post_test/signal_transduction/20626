zzso and zzso mechanisms play important roles in protein zzso although at different zzso zzso variations can alter zzso sites and thus influence the zzso regulation of zzso zzso providing an increasingly recognized mechanism of functional consequences of genetic zzso One of those genetic effects is the association of reduced zzso zzso expression with the functional genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that causes an zzso acid exchange in the zzso terminal of the zzso zzso We report that the zzso exchange at gene position zzso introduces a new zzso site into the zzso DNA at position zzso This leads to an enhanced zzso of the zzso DNA at this site and zzso This zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso in brain tissue of Caucasian chronic zzso zzso assessed zzso While in zzso subjects, a reduced zzso efficiency associated with chronic heroin exposure was compensated by an increased zzso density, this zzso was absent in carriers of the zzso zzso zzso due to a diminished zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only reduces zzso zzso zzso efficiency, but, by a zzso interaction, reduces zzso zzso expression and therefore, zzso the zzso system of a zzso reaction to chronic zzso This demonstrates that a change in the zzso can cause a change in the zzso with major functional zzso
