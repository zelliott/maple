Following infection with zzso zzso larvae, zzso of resistant zzso zzso snails execute a rapid zzso during which they migrate towards and zzso the zzso Such immediate and precise responses are thought to depend on signal zzso zzso though the zzso components involved remain largely zzso It is proposed that zzso protein zzso may play a role in zzso zzso immune zzso in particular zzso zzso protein zzso which are known to be associated with stress and inflammatory zzso Using zzso zzso followed by Rapid zzso of zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was cloned from both the zzso zzso embryonic zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was examined at the protein level in Western zzso analyses using an zzso that specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso showed that zzso cell zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso following 30 zzso incubation with zzso an established zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso protein zzso was also activated after only 5 zzso exposure to either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a comparative study, activated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso could also be detected using the zzso zzso zzso following cell treatment with zzso However, in contrast with zzso cells, zzso zzso was not activated by either zzso products or zzso treatments, suggesting fundamental differences in the role of zzso zzso protein zzso in signal zzso pathways between zzso and zzso zzso
