Rice is one of the most important staple crops worldwide, but its yield is compromised by different zzso including zzso zzso In this study we have characterized specific and general responses of rice zzso zzso roots challenged with two zzso zzso with very different modes of zzso Local zzso changes in rice roots upon root knot zzso zzso and root rot zzso zzso zzso zzso infection were studied at two time points (3 and 7 d after infection, zzso using zzso Our results confirm that root knot zzso zzso which feed as sedentary zzso stimulate zzso pathways in the zzso and enhance zzso transport towards the induced root zzso The migratory zzso on the other hand, induce programmed cell death and zzso stress, and zzso the normal zzso activity of the zzso While zzso infection causes zzso of zzso stress-related genes early in the infection, the sedentary zzso suppress the local defense pathways zzso salicylic acid and zzso zzso Interestingly, hormone pathways mainly involved in plant development were strongly induced zzso or zzso zzso at 3 zzso These results uncover previously zzso zzso expression profiles related to their specific infection zzso
