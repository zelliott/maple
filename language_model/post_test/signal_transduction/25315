zzso exert their activities in cell growth and differentiation by binding specific cell membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso protein zzso zzso that physically interact with zzso zzso of the zzso receptors and they play crucial roles in zzso signals triggered by the zzso zzso We have previously shown that conditional zzso of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso F3 zzso cells and that the zzso proliferation is completely inhibited by dominant negative zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso expression of a dominant negative form of zzso a major signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso F3 cells, also zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso active Ras or conditional zzso of zzso by chemical zzso fails to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso Ras and zzso molecules in zzso zzso F3 cells zzso for cell proliferation in the absence of zzso Our results indicate that Ras and zzso are essential and sufficient components of zzso zzso Our findings further indicate that the zzso signal zzso into Ras and zzso pathways following zzso zzso
