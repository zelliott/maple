zzso tissue growth factor zzso is an important zzso factor in kidney zzso zzso of zzso zzso ameliorates experimental zzso damage and zzso synthesis of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso regulates several cellular responses, including zzso migration, zzso and synthesis of zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso zzso in the inflammatory process in the kidney by evaluating the nuclear zzso B zzso pathway, a key signaling system that controls inflammation and immune zzso zzso administration of zzso to mice for 24 h induced marked zzso of inflammatory cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and led to elevated zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso increased zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso that recruit immune cells and promote zzso Treatment with a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso inflammatory responses, including the zzso of zzso and zzso In cultured zzso zzso cells, zzso rapidly activated the zzso zzso and the cascade of zzso protein zzso demonstrating zzso between these signaling zzso zzso via zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso gene zzso These data show that in addition to its zzso properties, zzso contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the kidney by zzso the zzso zzso
