In zzso coli, the heat zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso system are both attuned to zzso zzso For example, zzso activity rises in response to the overproduction of various zzso zzso Similarly, the activity of the zzso signal zzso pathway, which consists of an zzso sensor zzso and a zzso response regulator zzso is zzso by overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso In response to these zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate the zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso both mediate protein turnover within the bacterial zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso also control the synthesis of zzso zzso that can facilitate zzso zzso Specifically, zzso controls zzso of zzso which specifies a zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso system controls zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso required for efficient zzso bond formation in several zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in regulating both zzso and zzso activities within the bacterial zzso
