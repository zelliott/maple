zzso heart defects zzso are the most prevalent human birth zzso More than zzso of zzso are thought to result from a combination of genetic zzso and environmental zzso However, the stress-related zzso pathways involved remain largely zzso The zzso zzso factor is a key zzso zzso and a central regulator of the cellular stress zzso zzso activities are tightly regulated by its zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso Here we used the zzso system to delete zzso zzso ) or one copy of both zzso and zzso zzso ; zzso ) in zzso cells and their derivatives in mice to examine the regulation of the zzso zzso during vascular and cardiovascular zzso The zzso mice died before embryonic day zzso zzso and displayed severe vascular zzso On the other hand, the zzso ; zzso mice displayed zzso and zzso zzso defects zzso zzso of the heart, leading to severe heart dysfunction and zzso zzso During cardiac zzso cushion zzso zzso zzso was associated with defects in both the zzso transition zzso of the zzso cells and the zzso proliferation of the zzso cells, and the zzso zzso of the zzso ; zzso mice were fully rescued by deletion of one copy of zzso zzso maternal exposure to zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso the zzso heart zzso seen in the zzso ; zzso model, which was also dependent on zzso status, establishing a link between maternal zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso zzso These data revealed a new regulatory mechanism in cardiac zzso cushion zzso and suggested a possible cause of zzso due to environmental zzso
