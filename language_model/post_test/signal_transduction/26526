The introduction of zzso zzso has improved graft survival, but it causes zzso which limits its clinical zzso Recently, we reported that zzso zzso zzso protected zzso from zzso zzso injury as well as zzso To investigate the clinical applications of zzso we next evaluated the long-term therapeutic effect of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso dysfunction, while zzso administration significantly improved zzso zzso EPO treatment significantly increased zzso zzso while zzso treatment neither enhanced nor reduced zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso while zzso administration inhibited it and increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso assessment revealed that zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso In addition, real-time zzso demonstrated that cortical zzso levels of zzso and type I collagen were suppressed in the zzso zzso These results suggest a new therapeutic approach using zzso to protect zzso from zzso zzso
