Several effects of zzso in the immune system rely on its capacity to zzso zzso expression and zzso in the zzso Surprisingly, some of these effects are dependent on signal zzso through the zzso but not on the zzso of zzso Since all the well known effects of zzso in different cell types and zzso seem to be dependent on zzso zzso we hypothesized that, at least for the control of zzso function, another, unknown zzso could mediate the zzso of the zzso signal from the zzso towards the zzso signaling zzso 

Here, by employing zzso real-time zzso and flow zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso associated with the zzso in zzso zzso Following a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a transient association with zzso All these effects are independent of zzso zzso and, upon zzso zzso the signal zzso towards zzso is zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso significantly zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso signal independently of zzso zzso and mediates some of the zzso effects of zzso in this zzso
