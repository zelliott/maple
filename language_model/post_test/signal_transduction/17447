For the majority of patients with zzso lung cancer zzso response to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso In models of acquired resistance to zzso zzso of zzso zzso is frequently zzso Because zzso zzso results in downstream initiation of zzso protein translation, we hypothesized that a strategy of targeting zzso translation in combination with zzso might enhance zzso 

zzso cells that are wild type for zzso were zzso for sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso for zzso signaling and downstream zzso zzso by zzso after stimulation with zzso growth zzso zzso signaling and signaling zzso of zzso translation were zzso by zzso under zzso conditions 24 hours after treatment with zzso Finally, combination treatment with zzso and two different zzso translation zzso were done to assess the effect on cell zzso 

zzso signaling is coupled to zzso of zzso translation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso resistant cells, however, results in zzso of downstream signaling molecules including zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso 1/2, resulting in maintenance of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is maintained in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso Finally, using an zzso zzso against zzso translation initiation factor zzso and a zzso inhibitor to disrupt zzso formation, we show that zzso translation zzso can enhance sensitivity to zzso 

The results of these studies support further clinical development of translation zzso for treatment of zzso in combination with zzso
