Despite tremendous advances in zzso zzso zzso zzso remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among premature zzso Any intervention that would reduce the risk of zzso or improve its outcome is likely to have substantial clinical and financial zzso However, there is a clear lack of an effective agent for the treatment and/or prevention of zzso This is due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its zzso Taking a basic biological approach, our laboratory has discovered that disruption of normal zzso zzso signaling is centrally involved in this zzso Using a number of in zzso and in zzso models, our laboratory has demonstrated that stabilization of the normal zzso zzso signaling zzso can prevent and/or rescue the molecular injuries caused by the insults that lead to zzso Here, we review the existing approaches to prevent and treat zzso and then, based on our insights into the zzso of zzso we propose novel and innovative therapeutic options that impact the disease on a zzso level, unlike most of the current treatments available for zzso
