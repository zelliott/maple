B cells are important in zzso microbial zzso through their well-known role in zzso zzso production and their emerging role in zzso zzso Several specialized zzso B cell compartments have been zzso but the nature of conventional B cells in the zzso zzso is poorly zzso In this study, we identify a B cell population predominantly composed of surface zzso zzso cells residing in zzso of the small zzso and superficial zzso zzso of the large zzso but distinct from the zzso compartment or organized zzso zzso zzso Small zzso zzso B cells are diminished in zzso that alter the strength of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and in mice lacking zzso zzso zzso They are not dependent on enteric microbial zzso because they are abundant in mice that are zzso or genetically deficient in zzso zzso However, zzso B cells are reduced in the absence of zzso zzso T cells zzso or zzso zzso These findings define a distinct population of conventional B cells in small zzso zzso and suggest an zzso link between zzso zzso zzso T cells and this B cell zzso
