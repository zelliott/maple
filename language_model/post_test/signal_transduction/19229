The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso remain incompletely zzso We have investigated the potential role of zzso a cellular zzso zzso in COPD and cigarette zzso zzso zzso zzso is a dynamic process for the turnover of zzso and zzso which zzso zzso precursors through the zzso zzso of cellular zzso It is typically associated with survival zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in human diseases is less clear, and has been associated with both protective and zzso consequences, depending on the disease zzso While zzso is considered zzso this process is often found in association with cell death, and the relationships between zzso and cell death remain zzso We have found elevated zzso in COPD lung zzso as well as in response to cigarette smoke exposure in zzso and in zzso In our studies, the zzso of zzso proteins was associated with zzso cell zzso in response to cigarette smoke, with zzso implications in zzso Further studies are needed to determine the functional significance of zzso in COPD and other diseases of the zzso
