The cerebral zzso can be a vital source of signaling factors such as zzso zzso factor that zzso the zzso zzso against stress and zzso But the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully zzso Here, we use cell models to ask how vascular zzso is zzso Human brain zzso cells were grown in culture, and zzso media were transferred to primary rat cortical zzso Brain zzso zzso media activated zzso zzso signaling and protected zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso negated this vascular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2) was involved because depletion with zzso eliminated the ability of zzso media to protect zzso against zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 9, zzso 3 and Bad pathways were zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the molecular basis for vascular zzso involves zzso signaling that ameliorates zzso zzso Further investigation of these mechanisms may reveal new approaches for zzso zzso vascular zzso in stroke, brain injury, and zzso
