zzso zzso zzso is a well-studied zzso factor zzso cellular adaptation to zzso It also plays a crucial role under zzso conditions, such as in zzso where its regulation is less well zzso The zzso region zzso of zzso zzso is among the most zzso zzso in the zzso hinting toward zzso zzso To identify potential trans factors, we analyzed a large compilation of expression zzso In contrast to its known function of being a negative regulator, we found that zzso zzso positively zzso with zzso target zzso zzso modeling predicts that an additional level of zzso regulation of zzso can explain the observed positive correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso indeed changes its mode of regulation from zzso to stabilizing zzso zzso upon zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Using a model of zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso stabilization is crucial for cell zzso This demonstrates the zzso importance of a zzso mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso in zzso
