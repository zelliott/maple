zzso zzso signaling is often observed in human zzso zzso is a representative zzso zzso that can activate both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso is zzso This study was designed to understand whether zzso in the zzso zzso and its key downstream molecules such as zzso and zzso are involved in gastric zzso 

We analyzed the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso genes in 40 primary gastric normal and tumor zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso 

Our results showed a specific combination of genes expressed significantly in the gastric tumor zzso zzso of the tumor samples containing zzso zzso were zzso zzso were zzso and zzso of the samples involved zzso Interestingly, normal samples did not show any relevant zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso might be critically important in gastric zzso
