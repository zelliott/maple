Recent studies of isolated muscle membrane have enabled induction and monitoring of rapid zzso release from zzso zzso zzso in zzso by a variety of zzso On the other hand, various proteins that may be directly or indirectly involved in the zzso release mechanism have begun to be zzso In this zzso we attempt to deduce the molecular mechanism by which zzso release is zzso zzso and performed, by combining the updated information of the zzso release zzso with the accumulated knowledge about the key molecular zzso
