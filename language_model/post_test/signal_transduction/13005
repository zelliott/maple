The release of zzso at zzso junctions is not constant, but subject to zzso by a plethora of different zzso In this respect, zzso receptors located on the sympathetic zzso terminals are of utmost importance, because they are activated by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso In the latter case, the zzso that activate the zzso receptors of a nerve terminal may be released either from the very same nerve ending or from a different zzso zzso and the receptors involved are zzso and zzso zzso In terms of their structural and functional features, receptors of sympathetic zzso terminals can be zzso as either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (most commonly G zzso zzso This review summarizes results on more than 30 different zzso and four different zzso receptors that have been found to control the amount of zzso being released from sympathetic zzso Each of these receptors may not only zzso zzso and reduce sympathetic zzso release, respectively, but also interact with the functions of other receptors present on the same zzso zzso This provides a multitude of mechanisms that regulate the amount of sympathetic zzso zzso zzso a sophisticated zzso within and between zzso and zzso signals is integrated at zzso terminals to adapt the strength of zzso transmission to a given zzso This will not only determine the function of the sympathetic nervous system in health and disease, but also therapeutic and zzso effects of drugs that bind to the zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso
