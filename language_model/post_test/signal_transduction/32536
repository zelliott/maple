To dissect the cellular events responsible for the prolonged zzso of the response to zzso hormone zzso in zzso zzso we zzso with different steps of the signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid (a zzso zzso shortened the zzso suggesting a contribution of zzso zzso zzso depletion of cellular calcium stores prolonged zzso (up to zzso which returned to control levels upon zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone evoked a small, prolonged zzso current and significantly shortened the zzso of the response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso which zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso decreased the zzso of the response and increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso immediately before the challenge with zzso did not shorten the zzso of the zzso zzso the effective zzso density with zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in an extension of zzso whereas the expression of a large number of zzso receptors by injection of zzso transcribed from cloned zzso DNA zzso zzso shortened the zzso to below 2 zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of the response to zzso reflects the zzso of a late step in the signal zzso zzso most likely the release of calcium by zzso We propose that this process is zzso controlled by an early zzso event, involving the zzso of a zzso zzso protein by the zzso zzso
