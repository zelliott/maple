zzso networks have been an interesting starting point not only for the design of synthetic routes in a similar sequence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but also for assembling a number of zzso steps by preparing the required zzso and auxiliary zzso zzso analysis involving multiple zzso reactions steps therefore needs to consider the practically realized zzso single zzso The opportunities for route selection are enlarged if novel synthetic reactions connecting easily available starting materials and products are found, and/or both zzso and classical reactions of organic chemistry are zzso zzso and ingredients for zzso synthesis are of special interest for reactions difficult to achieve by classical organic zzso zzso and zzso zzso small molecules do not allow much space for protecting or zzso zzso zzso reactions have therefore performed well for a number of useful zzso in zzso form to achieve full zzso Although many well-known zzso from classical zzso have only been prepared in zzso form, it is of fundamental interest to have these available in zzso pure zzso zzso reactions with nature's privileged zzso zzso appear to be a promising synthetic strategy towards these zzso especially when sensitive or zzso zzso are to be zzso The main applications for these zzso are as references materials in zzso as zzso zzso for the characterization of zzso zzso activities and as potential pharmaceuticals in biomedical zzso The use of zzso zzso can thereby simplify in zzso applications and zzso flux zzso
