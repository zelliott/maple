In zzso zzso signaling is generally thought to inhibit neural zzso However, whether zzso can also promote specific early cell fates in this context is zzso We introduced activated zzso zzso into the mouse zzso before the onset of zzso using a zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso During zzso zzso cells became zzso zzso the first specialized cell type evident in the zzso Thus, rather than simply zzso zzso zzso signaling promoted the acquisition of an early cellular zzso zzso many zzso cells became zzso zzso cells previously shown to be neural stem cells in the zzso These results suggest that zzso promotes zzso zzso identity during zzso and that zzso zzso may be zzso related to stem cells in the adult nervous zzso
