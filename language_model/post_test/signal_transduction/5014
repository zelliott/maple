zzso spectrum disorders zzso are a group of related zzso disorders with significant combined prevalence zzso and high zzso Dozens of individually rare genes and zzso associated with high-risk for zzso have been identified, which overlap extensively with genes for intellectual disability zzso However, studies indicate that there may be hundreds of genes that remain to be zzso The advent of inexpensive zzso parallel zzso sequencing can reveal the genetic zzso of zzso complex diseases, including zzso and zzso However, whole zzso sequencing zzso and whole zzso sequencing zzso provides an embarrassment of riches, where many candidate zzso zzso It has been argued that genetic variation for zzso and ID will cluster in genes involved in distinct pathways and protein zzso For this reason, zzso methods that prioritize candidate genes based on additional functional information such as zzso interactions or association with specific zzso or empirical zzso or other zzso can be zzso In this study we applied several supervised learning approaches to prioritize zzso or ID disease gene candidates based on curated lists of known zzso and ID disease zzso We implemented two network-based zzso and one zzso zzso to show that we can rank and zzso known, and predict new, genes for these zzso zzso We also show that ID and zzso share common pathways that zzso an overlapping synaptic regulatory zzso We also show that features relating to zzso zzso in mouse zzso can help in zzso zzso zzso Our methods can be applied broadly to other diseases helping in zzso newly identified genetic variation that emerge from disease gene discovery based on zzso and zzso
