Patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and their first-degree relatives display increased zzso to zzso zzso predicts that experience of zzso stress is associated both with zzso prefrontal and zzso zzso zzso However, while there is evidence of zzso zzso zzso processing in psychotic disorder, the role of the prefrontal zzso remains zzso This study aimed at investigating zzso in zzso zzso release in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso of individuals at familial risk for zzso 

Fourteen healthy first-degree relatives of patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder and 10 control subjects underwent a single dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning session after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress was initiated at 100 zzso zzso using a computerized mental zzso task with social zzso threat zzso PET data were analyzed using the zzso simplified reference region zzso zzso analyses were performed to compare the spatial extent of zzso zzso displacement between control subjects and relatives and to find how it related to zzso experiences of zzso stress and zzso 

zzso relatives displayed zzso zzso signaling in the zzso in response to zzso Increased levels of zzso rated stress were associated with increased intensity of psychotic zzso This effect was particularly pronounced in first-degree zzso 

Although previous studies have hypothesized a role for prefrontal zzso dysfunction in zzso this study, to our knowledge, is the first in zzso human imaging study showing attenuated zzso zzso zzso stress zzso in zzso of individuals at familial risk for zzso
