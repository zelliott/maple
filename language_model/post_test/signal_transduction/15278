During early heart development, zzso gene expression is initiated in the cardiac zzso and then becomes restricted to the zzso tract and the zzso zzso We identified a zzso regulatory region, enriched in multiple zzso sites, sufficient to reproduce zzso expression patterns overlapping zzso and zzso gene activity in the zzso The role of zzso in zzso was analyzed by using zzso activated zzso transgenic zzso in chamber zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited an zzso narrow chamber zzso zzso to the expansion of zzso zzso 2 expression in the zzso or cardiac jelly and the appearance of the zzso cushions zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso which coincided with the outgrowth zzso transformed cells in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso identity from chamber type to zzso zzso zzso a central zzso of zzso zzso has a central part in directing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
