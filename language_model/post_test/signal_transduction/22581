WAVE is a zzso syndrome protein zzso protein that functions in zzso formation induced by zzso a zzso family small zzso Here we report that WAVE is a zzso whose zzso increases in response to various external stimuli that activate zzso protein zzso zzso zzso When Swiss zzso cells are zzso with zzso growth factor, zzso mobility shift occurs to zzso which reflects zzso This is perfectly inhibited by the addition of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso expression of an activated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso WAVE mobility zzso When zzso zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso the intensity of zzso growth zzso membrane zzso is greatly zzso In various cancer cell lines, the amount of WAVE mobility shift was found to increase significantly, suggesting the importance of WAVE zzso in the formation of membrane zzso and zzso zzso
