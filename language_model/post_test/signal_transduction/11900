zzso a novel member of the human zzso of zzso protein family, has been shown to be critical for tumor progression and poor prognosis for several types of zzso However, limited reports exist regarding the biological functions of zzso in human gastric cancer zzso The present study investigated the clinical significance of zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso using zzso zzso and explore the potential using zzso interference to zzso zzso zzso including the subsequent effects on tumor growth and invasion in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Our results showed that the rate of positive expression of zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso compared to that in adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso was lower in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was positively correlated with tumor differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso was zzso correlated with them zzso zzso in patients with zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited cell zzso activities and invasive potential, and induced cell in zzso zzso in zzso cells, accompanied with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased expression of zzso In addition, the tumor volumes in the zzso subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with zzso was significantly smaller compared to those of the PBS group zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that the expression of zzso is increased in human zzso and zzso with tumor differentiation and zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso cell growth and invasion through blockade of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
