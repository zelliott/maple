Recent clinical studies have shown zzso zzso zzso to be related to overweight status and zzso related to insulin zzso The present study was performed to investigate the potential effects of zzso zzso infection of zzso 

zzso cells and primary zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso either before or after induction of zzso and the effects on zzso and insulin signaling were zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso signaling was examined by assessing the effects of zzso zzso infection in zzso isolated from zzso zzso tissue of both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso successfully infected both zzso and differentiated zzso cells in zzso The bacteria were also detected in zzso tissue of infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels were significantly increased in cells infected with either live or zzso zzso zzso or treated with zzso or zzso protein zzso this increase was associated with zzso of zzso differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso insulin zzso and its zzso In contrast, zzso zzso infection in zzso zzso produced no apparent changes, but addition of zzso zzso reversed this zzso 

We demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, through a zzso inflammatory zzso can impair differentiation and insulin zzso
