zzso zzso is a potent zzso of the immune system, commonly produced by zzso T cells to limit ongoing inflammatory responses minimizing host zzso Many zzso diseases are marked by large populations of activated zzso T cells within the setting of chronic zzso therefore, drugs capable of inducing zzso production in zzso T cells would be of great therapeutic zzso Previous reports have shown that the small zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease in an animal model of zzso zzso However, the direct effects of zzso on zzso zzso populations remain zzso Using ex zzso cultures of zzso zzso T cells, we show that zzso elicits zzso expression in T helper type 17 zzso zzso cells, increasing the number of zzso and zzso zzso cells via de zzso induction of zzso zzso cultures differentiated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso more zzso with no change in zzso zzso necrosis zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the response, while analysis of zzso and zzso expression demonstrated increased numbers of zzso cells in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso Our findings translated in zzso as systemic treatment of male mice with zzso led to increased zzso zzso from zzso following zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acts directly on zzso T cells, and to our knowledge provide the first example of a synthetic small zzso capable of zzso zzso expression in zzso or hybrid zzso zzso
