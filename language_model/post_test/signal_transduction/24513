zzso necrosis factor zzso can induce proliferation as well as zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We have shown recently that these seemingly contradictory effects are based on the divergent capacities of the cells to produce zzso zzso factor zzso upon stimulation with zzso Only those cells that produce zzso survive the zzso attack and start zzso Here, we set out to zzso the mechanisms of the zzso effect of zzso Protection from zzso was achieved by zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso prevented protection, indicating that zzso might induce synthesis of zzso zzso zzso of protective genes was analyzed using zzso expression zzso and the results were verified by Northern and Western zzso zzso This screen revealed the elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso upon stimulation with zzso The major novelty of our study is that zzso carries protective effects against zzso zzso not only against zzso induced by zzso or zzso This protection requires de zzso protein synthesis and is zzso at least not zzso consequence of a direct zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
