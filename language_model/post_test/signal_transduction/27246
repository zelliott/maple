zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso Two related zzso receptors have been identified zzso and zzso although the precise zzso of zzso binding and calcium signaling of these receptors has yet to be zzso To examine this more closely, the human zzso receptors were cloned and expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from cells expressing zzso bind zzso selectively and with high affinity zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso a rapid increase in zzso zzso through both zzso zzso channels and zzso of zzso from zzso stores, and leads to a rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso prepared from these cells, fail to bind zzso levels of zzso However, zzso stimulation of cells expressing zzso zzso a small but significant increase in zzso zzso zzso stimulation of these cells with zzso leads to a zzso of the response to a level comparable to that seen in cells expressing zzso These observations suggest that the levels of cell surface zzso are controlled by novel zzso
