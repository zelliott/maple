zzso screening of a zzso zzso library derived from the marine snail zzso zzso yielded a zzso clone coding for zzso protein zzso that was zzso during zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso containing 144 zzso with a predicted molecular weight of 17 zzso showed zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso zzso protein zzso Analysis of zzso and foot muscle samples from a time course of zzso exposure showed a zzso transcript increase of zzso and zzso after 96 zzso and 48 zzso respectively, relative to zzso animals, with a subsequent decrease in transcript levels during zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso confirmed the observed zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso culture experiments were performed to determine a possible zzso of zzso of zzso with data indicating a putative role for zzso in signal zzso The zzso zzso of zzso during zzso may stabilize the existing zzso pool, via a possible zzso signaling zzso until oxygen reappears and protein synthesis zzso
