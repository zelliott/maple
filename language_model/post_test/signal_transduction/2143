The discovery of zzso drugs is now driven by the numerous molecular zzso identified in tumor cells over the past zzso To exploit these zzso it is necessary to understand how they define a molecular context that allows increased sensitivity to particular zzso Traditional genetic approaches together with the new wealth of zzso information for both human and model organisms open up strategies by which drugs can be zzso for their ability to selectively kill cells in a molecular context that matches those found in zzso Similarly, it may be possible to identify and validate new targets for drugs that would selectively kill tumor cells with a particular molecular zzso This article outlines some of the ways that zzso zzso can be used to streamline zzso drug zzso
