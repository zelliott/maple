Recent studies indicate that, in a manner similar to classical plant hormones, zzso can act as signaling molecules that control gene expression and zzso processes in zzso zzso evidence includes zzso zzso signaling from its zzso identification of zzso sensors, and isolation and characterization of zzso and other regulatory components in plant sugar signal zzso zzso The emerging scenario points to the existence of a complex signaling network that zzso zzso pathways from zzso and other hormone and zzso zzso
