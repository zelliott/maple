To investigate whether protein zzso C zzso zzso are expressed in zzso skeletal muscle and determine their distribution in various types of fibers by use of zzso zzso 

5 healthy adult Dutch zzso zzso 

In each zzso 2 biopsy specimens were obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso muscle were stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and examined by use of a zzso zzso zzso muscle samples were evaluated via western zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were localized within the fibers of zzso skeletal zzso In addition, zzso alpha and zzso were detected near or in the plasma membrane of muscle zzso For some zzso zzso distribution was specific for fiber zzso zzso of cell zzso for zzso alpha was observed predominantly in fibers that reacted positively with zzso heavy chain zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso were more pronounced in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso negative fibers contained more zzso zzso than zzso zzso Distribution of zzso zzso was equal among the different fiber zzso 

zzso indicated that zzso zzso are expressed in zzso skeletal muscle in a fiber zzso zzso zzso the involvement of zzso zzso in signal zzso in zzso skeletal muscle might be dependent on fiber zzso
