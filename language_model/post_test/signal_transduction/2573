The consequences of zzso injury on zzso has been studied zzso and previous investigations of methods of zzso protection during global and regional zzso have focused on zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the coronary artery zzso is also vulnerable to damage, and only recently have investigators been able to assess coronary zzso zzso 

This review examines some aspects of coronary flow abnormalities that occur after zzso and zzso In addition, we zzso recent data that address the hypothesis that injury to the coronary artery zzso may contribute to the zzso of global (and zzso cardiac zzso and zzso 

It appears that zzso and zzso selectively injure a component in the zzso complex linking zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso oxide zzso Further, oxygen zzso may contribute to this zzso Recent investigations demonstrate that oxygen zzso impair the zzso complex specific to the zzso oxide signal zzso zzso rather than causing global zzso zzso 

The understanding of zzso cell function and the zzso of the zzso oxide zzso should further clarify our understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso injury and coronary zzso and contribute to the development of effective therapeutic zzso
