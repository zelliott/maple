zzso To further explore the mechanisms of zzso growth, we investigated the zzso pathways through which zzso acts as a zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso of the spontaneously zzso zzso and we examined the mechanisms involved in the zzso to zzso of zzso from spontaneously zzso rats compared with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation was used to determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso C was evaluated by measuring zzso zzso zzso The role of protein zzso C and protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso was assessed by stimulating the cells with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis was completely abolished in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso formation was only zzso The presence of zzso zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso incorporation in zzso from spontaneously zzso rats and was without effect in zzso from zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso incorporation in a zzso manner and did not affect the formation of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso C zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a necessary step in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso C zzso in the increased zzso potency of zzso in spontaneously zzso zzso
