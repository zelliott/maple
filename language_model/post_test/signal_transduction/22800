A fluorescent indicator for zzso zzso insulin signaling is zzso Upon binding of insulin to zzso insulin zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso in the zzso A fluorescent indicator was designed by using synthetic zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso domain of zzso and its target protein zzso containing an zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso protein and zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso complex zzso a zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso was evaluated from a change in a zzso zzso spectrum based on zzso between the two zzso The zzso pair was formed to zzso in competition with the zzso zzso zzso resulting in a decrease in a zzso zzso zzso zzso at 580 zzso and causing an increase in zzso at 520 zzso zzso zzso by the partially zzso insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso was detected with this formed zzso pair, and resulting changes in zzso zzso zzso were observed for insulin concentration from about zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso pair served as a competitive fluorescent indicator for zzso zzso insulin zzso
