In search of chemical substances zzso for the treatment of cancer and other zzso disorders, we studied the signal zzso of zzso zzso factors zzso in zzso cells mainly using zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso both strongly inhibited cell proliferation by inducing zzso arrest, zzso was more effective than zzso zzso suppressed zzso D1 expression at both zzso and protein levels, whereas the zzso of zzso D1 overrode zzso cell cycle zzso The zzso decrease in the amount of zzso D1 protein preceded the reduction in the level of zzso D1 zzso The decrease in zzso D1 protein seemed to be caused by accelerated zzso since it was zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso D1 was also prevented by treatment with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso induced zzso D1 zzso through the zzso of zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso and it zzso zzso activity in an in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was revealed to induce the nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso These results suggested that zzso activates zzso to accelerate the zzso of zzso D1 and that this mechanism is involved in the zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso
