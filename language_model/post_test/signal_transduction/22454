Many protein zzso are key zzso signaling molecules that regulate a wide range of cellular zzso These functions may require complex zzso regulation of zzso zzso Here, we show that protein zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in sync in zzso zzso beta cells, forming a highly integrated zzso zzso We found that zzso activity was essential for this zzso circuit and was capable of not only initiating the signaling zzso but also modulating their frequency, thereby diversifying the zzso control of downstream zzso Our findings suggest that exquisite zzso control of zzso activity, zzso via signaling circuits resulting from zzso of signaling zzso can zzso diverse zzso into zzso parameters such as zzso frequency, which in turn contribute to proper regulation of complex cellular functions in a zzso zzso
