zzso zzso zzso which is produced by certain strains of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to induction of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso alters the innate immune zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso production of both zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso We investigated here the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso production by mouse zzso zzso suppressed zzso NO production through zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso Further, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to an zzso binding site on the zzso zzso In contrast to the native zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly enhanced zzso zzso expression and binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced in zzso from zzso zzso mice, which lacked a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with an zzso inhibitor or expression of zzso by zzso coli increased zzso coli survival in zzso suggesting that NO generated by zzso resulted in efficient killing of the bacteria and zzso contributed to zzso coli survival in zzso Thus, we zzso that zzso might represent a novel bacterial strategy to circumvent host defense during zzso zzso
