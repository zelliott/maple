Scaffolding proteins of the zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso are crucial for the initiation stage of zzso zzso These proteins are closely related but have implications in distinct zzso To determine how these proteins could be separated in certain cell pathways we performed a comparative study of zzso 

We have shown that zzso zzso and zzso zzso and form a complex in zzso A structural comparison of five zzso zzso which zzso most zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a similarity of their zzso zzso We showed that the zzso zzso of zzso bound well-established zzso of zzso as well as newly identified zzso protein zzso A search for a novel interacting interface revealed multiple zzso that could be zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso short zzso was observed in various cell zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and enabled their recognition by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso C zzso The zzso zzso mentioned were unable to bind zzso short zzso 

Our results indicate that during evolution of zzso zzso acquired a novel zzso interface that allows its specific recognition by the zzso zzso of signaling zzso We propose that these data could be important to understand the functional diversity of zzso zzso zzso
