The zzso zzso gene zzso encodes the previously identified zzso zzso a zzso factor containing a zzso During embryonic development zzso function is required for the formation of the zzso tree and in the patterning of the zzso zzso During zzso development zzso is required for cell proliferation and the differentiation of the wing zzso zzso expression is restricted to the regions where its function is required, and is dependent on the coordinate activities of zzso molecules such as zzso wingless and zzso zzso interacts with other genes involved in vein zzso including zzso thick zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso function may affect several zzso communication zzso We propose that the gene zzso zzso information from different zzso molecules and regulates the expression of specific cell differentiation genes during zzso development and vein zzso
