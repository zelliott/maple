During zzso zzso zzso restricted activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso first recruits zzso cells adjacent to the zzso to a zzso cell fate and then specifies zzso zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates migration of the anterior zzso cells known as border zzso Since Ras is known to mediate many zzso zzso zzso effects, we have investigated the role of Ras in zzso cell fate determination, zzso and migration throughout zzso Early zzso Ras activity induced transient expression of zzso zzso cell markers in anterior zzso cells, but did not inhibit anterior zzso Later zzso Ras activity inhibited anterior zzso cell differentiation but did not induce zzso marker zzso Complete transformation of anterior zzso cells to zzso zzso cells required early zzso Ras activity in egg chambers where terminal differentiation of anterior cells was zzso These results suggest that, in zzso as in zzso Ras can have diverse effects on different cells, but, in addition, Ras activity can have different effects on the same cells at different stages in their zzso
