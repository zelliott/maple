In the present report we describe the properties of a novel zzso zzso that has opened a route to the characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso The basis for the present work was that zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is robustly zzso following zzso zzso zzso We predicted accordingly that zzso receptors would also stimulate zzso of other proteins with a similar zzso To test this idea we raised an zzso against the zzso zzso where zzso is a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso was called zzso zzso for zzso zzso The present study describes the properties of zzso and shows that it can reveal quite striking differences in the zzso of different cell types and is able to pinpoint new targets in important signal zzso zzso zzso was used to map protein zzso regulated by the zzso zzso in T zzso One of these zzso proteins was zzso and revealed to be a previously zzso target for zzso zzso signal zzso namely an zzso adapter zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso The use of zzso detecting specific zzso sites is thus proved as a powerful method for the discovery of novel downstream components of zzso zzso signals in T zzso
