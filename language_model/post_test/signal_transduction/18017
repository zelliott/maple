Although zzso is frequently associated with zzso the stimulation of insulin zzso by fatty acids in the in zzso studies has remained a matter of constant debate, partly because of the uncertainty about a clearly defined mechanism to explain such a direct zzso In this study, we used a zzso approach to test the hypothesis that protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso is involved in fatty zzso insulin zzso zzso rat zzso were zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the absence or presence of selective zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest a role for zzso zzso zzso in the signal zzso of fatty zzso insulin zzso The data imply that either the zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso are involved in the stimulation of insulin release induced by fatty zzso
