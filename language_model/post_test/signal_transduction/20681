zzso is the cellular zzso process prior to the release of zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso is a complex phenomenon that begins with commitment of zzso stem cells to the replication and maturation of zzso cells through zzso and zzso differentiation zzso zzso production is determined by the number and size of zzso in the zzso and may be regulated at two zzso at early stages of cell proliferation resulting in increased zzso numbers, and at later stages by zzso which increases DNA content and the size of zzso zzso The mature zzso is a large zzso cell with a highly defined zzso membrane zzso zzso and contains the membrane molecules necessary for zzso function zzso zzso shedding appears to occur by fragmentation of the zzso of the zzso zzso release is thought to occur via zzso processes projecting into the vascular compartment zzso zzso although several studies indicate that zzso lodged in the lungs are capable of zzso formation zzso The factors stimulating zzso in the lung have not been well zzso In the past, the study of zzso development in zzso and in zzso was hampered by the rarity of zzso in the bone zzso the poorly defined cell zzso and inadequate zzso These prior studies of zzso development have been discussed in the recent past by zzso Hoffman zzso zzso Williams zzso and zzso zzso Long zzso An attempt will be made in this review to highlight and zzso various new concepts of regulation of zzso
