zzso tumors are comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso and intermediate zzso zzso Because cell growth and differentiation often involve zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso we explored zzso signaling and growth response in three zzso cell types after zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the feasibility of zzso treatment zzso 

Three human zzso cell cultures, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were treated in zzso cultures with increasing zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso their activated zzso forms zzso and zzso and zzso expression were assessed by Western zzso at 1 and 24 zzso At 72 hours, cell counts determined growth zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso assessed zzso 

Among all three lines, total zzso and zzso expression were unaffected by zzso However, zzso total zzso and zzso expression were significantly greater in zzso zzso cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Active zzso zzso levels decreased in dose response to zzso at 1 and 24 hours in all zzso zzso zzso levels increased with increasing zzso zzso at 1 hour in zzso zzso and at 24 hours in all zzso zzso zzso cell counts decreased in zzso fashion with zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso response with increased cell counts at 1 zzso zzso and slightly decreased cell counts at 10 zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso cells exhibit greater zzso total zzso and zzso expression than zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although all three lines exhibit zzso decreases with zzso zzso only zzso zzso cells significantly decrease their proliferation with zzso zzso Although zzso zzso holds promise in targeting zzso zzso cells, successfully treating this zzso tumor may require combining agents against zzso and zzso zzso
