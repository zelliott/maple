zzso studies demonstrated that loss of the tumor zzso gene zzso held independent zzso significance in zzso zzso We investigated whether loss of zzso predicted shorter survival in the zzso zzso The role of zzso in the zzso zzso is also zzso 

Patients with zzso proven newly diagnosed zzso were identified from a retrospective database between 2007 and zzso Cox zzso hazards analysis was used to calculate the independent effects of zzso zzso age, extent of zzso zzso performance scale zzso and treatment on overall zzso 

zzso percent of patients were men with median age of 63 years, and zzso had zzso Most patients zzso received standard treatment zzso with concurrent zzso A total of 72 zzso patients had retained zzso zzso Median overall survival zzso was zzso months zzso zzso zzso Median survival of zzso months zzso zzso zzso and zzso months zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso retained and zzso loss patients, respectively zzso zzso loss patients were also found to have zzso of zzso gene more frequently than patients with retained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that older age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lack of standard treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded worse zzso zzso loss was not zzso of overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Loss of expression of zzso does not zzso poor overall survival in the zzso zzso These findings imply a complex and zzso molecular relationship between zzso its regulators and zzso in the zzso of zzso Additionally, there is evidence that zzso may be more effective in zzso zzso cancer cells with zzso loss and zzso level the outcomes between the zzso retained and loss zzso
