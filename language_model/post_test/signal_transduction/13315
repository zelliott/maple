zzso signaling pathways are thought to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular linkages between the calcium signal and the processes driving zzso maturation are not clearly zzso The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso functions as one of these key zzso Mouse zzso were treated with a pharmacological zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and assessed for the progression of zzso Two systems for in zzso zzso maturation were zzso zzso spontaneous zzso maturation and zzso zzso hormone zzso reversal of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not spontaneous zzso zzso breakdown zzso was zzso inhibited by both zzso zzso and zzso but not its inactive zzso zzso However, zzso of the first polar body zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso maturation zzso zzso that failed to produce zzso exhibited zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso I to zzso I zzso Similar results were obtained when the zzso were treated with a zzso zzso zzso and matured zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and hence the calcium signaling pathway, is potentially involved in regulating the zzso maturation of mouse zzso This zzso both zzso in zzso resumption of zzso as well as promoting the zzso I to zzso I zzso Further evidence is therefore, provided of the critical role of zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso
