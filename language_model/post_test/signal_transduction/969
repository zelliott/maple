zzso cell death and survival is controlled by zzso and zzso zzso Because these proteins act on each other, cell fate is dictated by the relative activity of zzso versus zzso zzso Here we report that zzso a zzso zzso zzso peripheral membrane protein of the zzso network, protects cells against zzso and functions as an inhibitor of zzso zzso By using zzso and zzso forms we show that BRUCE zzso zzso activity and zzso depending on its zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso BRUCE is antagonized by three zzso first, through binding to zzso second, by the zzso zzso and third, by zzso zzso In addition to its zzso activity BRUCE has the distinctive property of functioning as a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso being a zzso Our work suggests that, zzso to its two activities and its zzso BRUCE may function as a specialized regulator of cell death zzso
