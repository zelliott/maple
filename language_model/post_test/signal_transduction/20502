zzso zzso 1 zzso has been shown to serve as a marker for zzso cells zzso but little is known about the regulation of the zzso functions of zzso cancer zzso We isolated zzso cells from human zzso gastric zzso cells and characterized these cells using an zzso zzso zzso cells constituted zzso of the human zzso gastric zzso cells, zzso and zzso were more zzso than zzso zzso and were able to zzso and generate zzso cell zzso Using gene expression zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso family, member 4) as one of the genes zzso in zzso cells, and thus as a novel marker for zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced the zzso ability of zzso cells, while zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso potential of zzso zzso We further found that zzso zzso reduces the expression of zzso and zzso and the size of the zzso cell zzso In human zzso gastric zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso correlated with each other, as assessed by zzso and zzso expression correlated zzso with zzso zzso as a measure of zzso zzso These findings illustrate that, in zzso gastric zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and that the increased zzso ability of zzso cells depends on zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso with a reduction in zzso population size and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso may provide a novel strategy in the treatment of zzso gastric zzso
