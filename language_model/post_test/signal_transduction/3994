Recent studies have indicated that zzso zzso regulates the activities of zzso and zzso However, the zzso responsible and the role of zzso zzso in zzso function remain zzso In the present studies, we examined the growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We provide in zzso and in zzso evidence that the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso specifically zzso zzso at zzso zzso in response to growth zzso Evidence for additional zzso zzso zzso is also zzso zzso is a relatively poor zzso for all zzso zzso tested both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso not its zzso zzso results in retarded mobility of the zzso protein on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is required for zzso formation, nuclear zzso and the DNA binding activity of this zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso also stimulates zzso zzso zzso but in contrast to growth factors, this occurs by an zzso zzso
