zzso (also called zzso and zzso are zzso zzso fusion genes that cause chronic zzso zzso associated with zzso The aim of this work was to gain insight into the mechanisms zzso fusion genes affect human zzso cells and in particular the zzso zzso 

We introduced zzso and zzso into human zzso zzso zzso and stem cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with these zzso formed zzso colonies even in the absence of zzso Both zzso also zzso the proliferation of cells in liquid culture and their differentiation into zzso This model thus zzso key features of the zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso We next showed that both fusion genes activated the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and patients' zzso Nuclear zzso was also activated in the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso the proliferation of which was blocked by zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso zzso that prevents nuclear zzso of nuclear zzso inhibited cell growth and the expression of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso In addition, several potential regulators of this process, including zzso zzso and zzso were identified using expression zzso 

We show that human zzso cells expressing zzso fusion zzso zzso autonomously and differentiate towards the zzso lineage in a process that requires nuclear zzso These results suggest new treatment possibilities for zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso
