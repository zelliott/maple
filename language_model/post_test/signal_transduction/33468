The zzso family zzso zzso receptors and their zzso zzso play key roles in a wide variety of zzso and pathological processes including tissue zzso zzso bone development, zzso zzso guidance, and neural zzso However, the signaling mechanisms underlying these diverse functions of zzso receptors have not been well zzso In this study, effects of zzso zzso zzso on several important signal zzso pathways are zzso In addition, the roles of these pathways in zzso growth cone collapse were assessed with a combination of zzso zzso pharmacological zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso active zzso These analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso activity but activates zzso zzso zzso However, regulation of these two pathways is not required for zzso growth cone collapse in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by expression of zzso active zzso and zzso failed to block zzso effects on growth cones, and zzso of the zzso zzso also failed to inhibit collapse by zzso zzso of zzso had no effects on zzso growth cone collapse zzso In addition, zzso to zzso and zzso showed no effects on zzso growth cone zzso However, pharmacological blockade of zzso zzso activity, the zzso family zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso light chain zzso significantly inhibited zzso growth cone zzso These observations indicate that only a subset of signal zzso pathways is required for zzso growth cone zzso
