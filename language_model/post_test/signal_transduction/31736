zzso zzso has been reported to promote bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully zzso The zzso zzso chains of zzso have a variety of biological zzso In the present study, we explored the potential role of the zzso chains of zzso in promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso without zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with or without zzso zzso zzso signaling and function were assessed by evaluating the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the binding specificity of the zzso cells to zzso was also investigated using zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that a zzso zzso lacking zzso chains decreased zzso zzso signaling and zzso differentiation and that the expression of this zzso zzso in zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso could not rescue its differentiation zzso as efficiently as zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso chains of zzso promote zzso zzso zzso
