zzso is an essential zzso factor for zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso both activate zzso but with different zzso In this study we compared their capacities to drive differentiation of human zzso zzso cells toward the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was much weaker than that of zzso zzso with a marked difference in the zzso of zzso zzso the response to zzso was sustained zzso zzso whereas the response to zzso was transient (4 zzso The continuous presence of zzso was required for sustained zzso zzso Similarly, optimal zzso polarization was only achieved upon prolonged exposure to zzso and could not be induced by a transient zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso responses through zzso of zzso expression and zzso with zzso in driving zzso cell zzso zzso zzso responses, on the other hand, were not prolonged by zzso zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1, rendering cells zzso to zzso but did not zzso the zzso zzso These data indicate that sustained zzso signaling is essential for optimal zzso cell development and that transient zzso of zzso in response to zzso may explain the poor zzso capacity of this zzso zzso these data show that the duration of zzso signaling is important for determining the biological zzso
