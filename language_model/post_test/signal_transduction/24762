zzso is a zzso two domain zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein containing the first zzso domain of zzso zzso with a zzso protein containing the second zzso domain zzso from zzso coli indicated a stable interaction which resulted in increased stability of the active zzso domain present in zzso This interaction was not dependent on the zzso region unique to zzso domain 2, but was affected by a zzso point zzso zzso in zzso zzso domain 2 enhanced zzso activity of the first domain in the full length zzso domain zzso whereas a zzso protein with the zzso domain of zzso in place of the zzso zzso region did zzso Thus the zzso domain of zzso associates with the zzso domain and this zzso the active zzso zzso A single zzso point zzso in the second domain is sufficient to zzso this zzso
