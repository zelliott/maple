The signaling pathways that trigger tumor cell escape from immune surveillance are not understood zzso zzso receptors zzso are considered to be expressed in both immune cells and tumor zzso By detecting zzso expression in mouse Lewis lung cancer zzso before and after zzso with mouse zzso the authors concluded that LLC cells zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Meanwhile, zzso expression in LLC cells was the strongest after zzso with mouse zzso To investigate the possible roles of zzso signaling zzso in zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso protein in LLC cells zzso were detected by zzso and the migration of LLC cells were detected by zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression in LLC cells was also detected after zzso stimulation by zzso The results indicated that both levels of zzso and zzso protein were significantly increased after zzso stimulation and reached to a maximum at 24 h and 10 zzso of zzso The migrated LLC cells with zzso stimulation were significantly increased and reached to a maximum at 10 zzso of zzso The expression of zzso protein was significantly enhanced after 10 zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso signaling zzso in lung cancer cells may be involved in tumor escape and progression by promoting the expression of zzso and zzso and tumor cells zzso
