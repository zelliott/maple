zzso is a widely used zzso agent, but its clinical use is restricted because of a high risk of zzso Bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso may repair zzso damaged zzso through zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study is to investigate if zzso causes the zzso of zzso and in turn zzso its healing zzso 

zzso were exposed to zzso and cell zzso was determined by western zzso and zzso 

zzso reduced the survival ratio and caused the zzso of zzso with the increase of zzso zzso level and zzso of zzso membrane zzso The zzso scavenger zzso zzso these zzso Moreover, zzso markedly activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso The specific zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso may abolish zzso zzso of zzso but the specific zzso inhibitor zzso not, indicating zzso and zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso Also, the zzso and total zzso proteins were increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso protein was reduced in zzso zzso At last, zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment reduced the zzso and IGF-1 released by zzso 

Taken together, zzso caused zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
