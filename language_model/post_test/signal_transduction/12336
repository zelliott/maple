zzso is essential for removal of zzso from inflamed zzso and efficient resolution of zzso zzso zzso abundantly expressed in zzso not only generates zzso zzso but also signals through the zzso zzso zzso to rescue zzso from zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso 

Because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the impact of zzso on zzso suppression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acute lung zzso 

Human zzso were cultured with zzso with or without zzso to investigate development of zzso Acute lung injury was produced by zzso injection of zzso plus zzso or zzso injection of live zzso coli in mice, and the animals were treated with zzso at the peak of zzso 

zzso through zzso of zzso expression promoted zzso of human zzso by attenuating zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of Bad and by reducing expression of the zzso protein zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was dominant over zzso effects even when it was added at 4 hours post zzso In mice, treatment with zzso accelerated the resolution of established zzso plus zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso pulmonary inflammation through zzso zzso to zzso cell death and zzso their removal by zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso enhances resolution of inflammation by overriding the powerful zzso signal from zzso thereby demonstrating a zzso zzso mechanism by which aspirin promotes resolution of zzso
