It is known that zzso zzso the zzso arrest in zzso cells that possess high numbers of zzso receptors and it was previously suggested that zzso protein was a major zzso zzso of the zzso zzso arrest of zzso zzso Here, we further investigate this phenomenon using the decoy zzso zzso for zzso sequence zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of the nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso of zzso decoy restored zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, infection of zzso zzso to express zzso zzso as the inhibitor of zzso also reversed the zzso zzso zzso The individual treatment of two zzso partially inhibited the zzso gene zzso whereas simultaneous treatment of two zzso exhibited more efficient zzso These observations suggest the zzso of zzso via zzso degradation and zzso via specific zzso zzso activity zzso induce zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso pathways mutually interact to play an important role in the zzso zzso zzso
