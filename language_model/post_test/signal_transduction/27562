The interaction between zzso and T cells is important in the development of central nervous system zzso This may result in full T cell zzso a partial state of zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso T zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso not only fail to initiate a mixed zzso reaction zzso but suppress background T cell zzso Even after zzso with zzso or following zzso zzso remain unable to support a zzso By contrast, zzso zzso are able to activate memory T cells in a recall zzso resulting in zzso zzso release and modest T cell zzso Although the stimulation index is small, functional relevance is zzso zzso from the recall zzso stimulate zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso factor within resting zzso This demonstrates that memory T cells not only receive sufficient stimulation from the zzso zzso to zzso and produce zzso but that there is also a zzso stimulation of resting zzso zzso this provides evidence that activated zzso have the potential to zzso immune responses in the central nervous system, but are unlikely to initiate a primary zzso
