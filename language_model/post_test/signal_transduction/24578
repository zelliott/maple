zzso are released into the peripheral circulation from the bone zzso where they arise as fragments of zzso zzso To characterize the effects of zzso zzso on zzso we examined calcium signaling and zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso factor zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso Initially, we compared zzso calcium zzso in zzso zzso cells and human zzso The 50% effective concentration values for the zzso to increase free zzso calcium were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso in zzso 157 zzso 5 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso 16 zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors were demonstrated to be coupled to zzso C because each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso cells exposed to the three zzso for 1 h showed different patterns and extent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso appeared to be necessary but not sufficient for zzso because 1) zzso of protein zzso C with zzso zzso zzso inhibited the calcium responses to all three zzso 2) zzso of protein zzso C with zzso attenuated subsequent zzso to each zzso and 3) each zzso increased protein zzso C activity in zzso cell zzso
