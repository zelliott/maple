zzso alternative zzso of the zzso gene in human zzso is essential for proper immune zzso zzso of the zzso variable zzso is controlled, in large part, by the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso upon zzso zzso however, the signaling cascade leading to zzso exclusion has remained zzso Here we demonstrate that in resting zzso zzso is directly zzso by zzso thus promoting interaction of zzso with zzso which prevents zzso from binding zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso reduced zzso activity leads to reduced zzso zzso releasing zzso from zzso and allowing it to bind zzso zzso regulatory elements and repress zzso zzso Our data place two players, zzso and zzso in the complex network that regulates zzso alternative zzso and demonstrate a paradigm for signal zzso from the cell surface to the zzso processing machinery through the zzso protein zzso
