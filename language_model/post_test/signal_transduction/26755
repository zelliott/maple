The cellular response to zzso radiation zzso involves a variety of mechanisms to repair damage and maintain cell zzso We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso promotes long-term cell survival after zzso zzso The molecular function of zzso is to enhance zzso zzso after zzso however, it is not known how this molecular function promotes survival after zzso zzso Here, we report that upon zzso exposure, cellular demand for zzso zzso is zzso zzso containing zzso are capable of surviving this zzso zzso demand, whereas zzso cells show impaired long-term zzso Additional zzso supplementation reverses the zzso of zzso cells suggesting impaired zzso zzso in these zzso Indeed, zzso cells are unable to maintain zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso is limiting, cells that contain zzso respond by slowing growth, but zzso cells and cells in which zzso zzso activity is inhibited are zzso and continue rapid zzso This cellular zzso to zzso depletion is also reflected at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, inability to restrict growth causes zzso cells to continue growing and eventually die due to lack of available zzso Together, these data indicate an important role for zzso and zzso zzso activity in maintaining zzso zzso which appears to be especially important for long-term survival of tumor cells after radiation zzso
