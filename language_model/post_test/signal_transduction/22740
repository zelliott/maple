The zzso signal in the zzso zzso of zzso patients on zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging has been zzso to arise from deposition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both iron and zzso are increased in iron zzso iron zzso may therefore increase zzso to zzso zzso To investigate the relationships between MR signal abnormalities and zzso and zzso status, 21 patients with chronic liver disease were enrolled zzso liver disease, zzso primary zzso zzso 9; primary zzso zzso 3; zzso B virus, 2; zzso C virus, 1; zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso in the zzso on zzso zzso weighted images zzso zzso time: 500 zzso zzso was observed in 13 of 21 zzso four patients had mild zzso three moderate, and six exhibited marked zzso zzso zzso zzso were positively correlated with the degree of the MR zzso zzso zzso zzso The log of zzso zzso concentration was also zzso correlated with all measures of iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings confirm the association of zzso with the development of zzso zzso in patients with liver zzso We further found that iron zzso is an zzso factor, probably because of increased zzso zzso of zzso We therefore recommend that patients with chronic liver disease avoid zzso supplements without concurrent iron zzso
