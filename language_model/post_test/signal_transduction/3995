zzso zzso stimulates a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso that zzso cells to differentiate and form projections oriented toward the zzso of zzso zzso by a mating zzso The polarized growth of mating projections involves new cell wall zzso a process that relies on zzso of the cell integrity zzso zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso during zzso induction requires the zzso output of the mating zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs subsequent to the zzso of the mating zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso a zzso family member, are two zzso proteins that are involved in the timing and other aspects of mating projection zzso Both proteins also affect the timing and extent of zzso zzso This correlation suggests that projection formation comprises part of the zzso signal that coordinates zzso zzso with mating zzso zzso of zzso activity occurs through the cell integrity zzso cascade and depends on zzso and the redundant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso by zzso was only partially impaired in cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso This zzso mechanism reveals the existence of an alternative zzso of zzso in some strain backgrounds that at least functions under zzso zzso
