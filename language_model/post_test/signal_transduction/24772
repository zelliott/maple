Gap zzso zzso communication zzso and cell proliferation were studied in control and zzso zzso zzso treated zzso liver slices of rat by evaluating zzso 32 zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the effect of different culture media zzso and zzso on control and zzso influenced zzso expression and cell proliferation was zzso zzso expression in control zzso liver slices was maintained during 8 h of zzso but decreased after prolonged zzso Control cell proliferation was significantly higher when zzso was used as culture medium than when zzso was zzso In slices treated with zzso zzso expression was zzso In slices cultured in zzso zzso this decrease preceded a zzso increase in cell zzso These results show the usefulness of zzso liver slices in studying cellular proliferation and zzso zzso
