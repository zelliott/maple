The complexity of human biology has made prediction of health effects as a consequence of exposure to environmental chemicals especially zzso Complex cell systems, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary, human, zzso disease models, leverage cellular regulatory networks to detect and distinguish chemicals with a broad range of target mechanisms and biological processes relevant to human zzso Here the authors use the zzso human cell systems to characterize effects relevant to human tissue and inflammatory disease biology following exposure to the 320 environmental chemicals in the Environmental Protection Agency's zzso zzso phase I zzso The zzso chemicals were zzso at 4 zzso in 8 zzso cell systems, with a total of 87 zzso zzso resulting in more than 100,000 data zzso Within the context of the zzso database, zzso compounds could be classified based on their ability to cause overt zzso in primary human cell types or according to toxicity mechanism class derived from comparisons to activity profiles of zzso reference zzso zzso chemicals with similarity to zzso of zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso zzso of zzso function, zzso of zzso zzso stress, or zzso zzso zzso were identified based on this zzso zzso This data set is being combined with additional zzso data sets for development of zzso toxicity models at the zzso
