zzso family zzso consisting of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso mediate assembly of protein complexes in zzso zzso an alternately spliced form of zzso lacks the regulatory zzso site and zzso zzso domain present in zzso and zzso We used gene zzso combined with zzso analysis to probe the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso are required for formation of focal zzso and for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso signaling is crucial during the early stages of zzso zzso whereas its termination by zzso family zzso zzso is important for turnover of focal zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activate the small zzso zzso whereas zzso lacking a functional zzso zzso domain, including zzso zzso activate zzso Thus, differences in the activity of zzso zzso including their zzso and their ability to be zzso by zzso are important for zzso dynamic changes in the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso
