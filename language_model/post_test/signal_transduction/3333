Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso comprises a family of zzso factors that regulate T cell development, zzso and zzso zzso zzso can also mediate zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso but it is unknown whether zzso influences their development from zzso Here, we report a novel role for zzso zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso lethally zzso mice with zzso stem cells expressing an zzso zzso resulted in enhanced development of the zzso zzso zzso bone zzso cells in media supplemented with zzso in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso A increased numbers of differentiated zzso Global gene expression analysis of zzso DC and zzso DC revealed differential expression of transcripts that regulate cell cycle and zzso In conclusion, these results provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso lineage zzso The finding that zzso of zzso enhances zzso development provides a novel insight into understanding how the treatment with drugs targeting zzso zzso influence the zzso of the innate immune zzso
