zzso zzso are able to control growth in response to changes in zzso zzso The limitation for single zzso including nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso produces stable arrest in zzso Restoration of the limiting zzso quickly restores zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso zzso very rapidly alters the levels of more than 2000 transcripts by at least zzso a large portion of which are involved with either protein production in growth or stress responses in zzso Although the signals generated by G, zzso and P are thought to be quite zzso we tested the hypothesis that depletion and zzso of any of these three nutrients would affect a common core set of genes as part of a generalized response to conditions that promote growth and zzso We found that the response to depletion of G, zzso or P produced similar zzso states with largely similar zzso As we predicted, zzso of each of the nutrients G, zzso or P induced a large zzso common core set of genes and zzso a large zzso common gene zzso Each zzso also produced zzso transcript zzso The zzso responses to each of the three nutrients depended on zzso and, to a lesser extent, the zzso zzso All three nutrients zzso zzso production within minutes of zzso and artificially increasing zzso levels was sufficient to replicate much of the core zzso zzso The recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso all played some role in the core zzso responses to N or zzso As expected, we found some evidence of cross talk between zzso signals, yet each zzso sends distinct zzso
