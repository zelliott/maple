zzso ensures the successful completion of the cell cycle and distribution of zzso zzso and zzso between daughter zzso It is accomplished by formation and zzso of an zzso zzso ring that drives the progression of a zzso zzso zzso experiments and in zzso zzso zzso have suggested a requirement for small zzso of the zzso family in zzso Yet, the identity of proteins regulating zzso signaling pathways during zzso remains zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso a putative exchange factor for zzso zzso zzso is required for the formation of the zzso ring and initiation of zzso The dynamics of zzso expression and its distribution during zzso as well as zzso analysis, indicate that it is a key regulatory component of the zzso zzso interacts genetically with zzso but not with zzso or zzso and zzso and zzso proteins interact in zzso in zzso Similar to zzso in zzso loss of zzso or expression of a zzso zzso blocks zzso Our results identify zzso as a zzso specifically required for zzso and linked through zzso activity to the reorganization of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
