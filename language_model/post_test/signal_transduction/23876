The cells of both the zzso and innate immune systems express a dizzying array of receptors that zzso and integrate an enormous amount of information about the environment that allows the cells to mount effective immune zzso Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in zzso the molecular details of signal zzso initiated by the engagement of immune cell receptors by their zzso Recent evidence indicates that immune receptors and components of their signaling zzso are zzso organized and that this spatial organization plays a central role in the initiation and regulation of zzso A key organizing element for signaling receptors appears to be zzso and zzso plasma membrane zzso termed zzso zzso Research into the molecular basis of the spatial segregation and organization of signaling receptors provided by zzso is adding fundamentally to our understanding of the initiation and zzso of signals in the immune zzso
