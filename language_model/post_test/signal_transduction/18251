zzso zzso is a strong zzso for both cell zzso and zzso marker zzso gene expression in conducting airway zzso zzso However, the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of both events have not been completely zzso The current study focuses on the common and divergent pathways involved in the induction of these two activities by zzso zzso Using a protein zzso zzso C zzso zzso I, zzso cell zzso and zzso gene expression were zzso Further, a zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell zzso in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso signaling zzso for both gene induction and enhanced cell zzso by zzso However, a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso could only block the gene induction event but failed to prevent cell zzso induced by zzso These results suggest that diverse signaling pathways after zzso zzso by zzso are involved in the regulation of these two zzso
