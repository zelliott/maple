zzso interaction between powdery zzso zzso and zzso has been widely used as a model system to study plant zzso zzso zzso zzso disease resistance 2) is a well characterized negative regulator in powdery zzso resistance and zzso cell zzso Recently, we showed that a zzso in zzso zzso zzso 1), suppressed zzso disease zzso zzso And the zzso single zzso displayed enhanced zzso to multiple zzso indicating that zzso plays important roles in plant zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso on plasma zzso loss of the membrane zzso signaling zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso physically associates with the zzso zzso zzso zzso sensing 2) and is required by zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that disruption of zzso membrane zzso affects the zzso zzso suggesting the membrane association of zzso is important for both zzso signaling and the zzso complex zzso Previously, it was shown that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insensitive 1) and plays critical roles in zzso zzso zzso Further exploration of signaling zzso downstream of zzso complex will not only shed new light on how zzso regulates plant zzso but may also help to dissect the connections between plant growth and zzso
