The long-term performance of zzso bone zzso is determined by a dynamic balance between bone zzso and zzso We proposed using embedded zzso zzso zzso to tune this balance toward a desirable final bone zzso In this study we established a systems biology model, and zzso explored the zzso effects of delivered zzso from zzso on final bone zzso We hypothesized that: 1) bone zzso was driven by zzso factors zzso and zzso which responded to released zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso drove the development of zzso zzso and contributed to bone mass zzso and 2) the zzso zzso on the other hand, governed the bone zzso and communications between these two lineages determined the dynamics of bone zzso In our model, zzso signaling pathways were represented by ordinary differential zzso while the zzso communications and cellular population dynamics were modeled by zzso differential zzso zzso of synergistic zzso combinations were evaluated by zzso index and Bliss zzso zzso results revealed that the zzso combinations released from zzso showed best control of bone zzso and synergistic effects, and suggested optimal dose ratios of given zzso combinations released from zzso to most efficiently control the long-term bone zzso We revealed the characteristics of zzso combinations of zzso which could be used to guide the design of in zzso bone scaffolds and the clinical treatment of some diseases such as zzso
