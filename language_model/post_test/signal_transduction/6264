The zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and the zzso zzso system are used by this pathogen to zzso the zzso growth rate within zzso zzso has also recently been shown to contribute to zzso by exerting tight repression of the zzso zzso in host zzso Here we show that loss of repression of the zzso system, linked to an zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso is accompanied by altered expression of zzso zzso zzso The changes in gene expression were different depending on the specific zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso of zzso which is required for zzso modification and zzso acid capsule zzso was enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso promoted this zzso in a zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso affected the expression of all other zzso genes zzso In this case, zzso alone was responsible for this zzso We also found that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso a gene required for zzso acid synthesis that is regulated positively by zzso Finally, it was observed that the fine regulation of zzso genes exerted by zzso requires the zzso protein and that an active zzso but not zzso diminishes expression of the zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that in zzso there is an intimate regulatory circuit between the zzso and zzso zzso which is revealed only when the zzso signaling route is zzso zzso with the zzso observed in zzso cells, zzso is predicted to favor expression of the entire zzso zzso based on its repression of the zzso zzso
