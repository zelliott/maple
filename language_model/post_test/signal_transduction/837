The cell cycle has been inextricably linked to the cellular response to radiation for many zzso However, it is only in the past decade that the concept of a coordinated DNA damage response zzso damage recognition, cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair has begun to be zzso The zzso protein is emerging as a key zzso of the damage response zzso a wide variety of zzso involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair to elicit a concerted effort to prevent zzso instability caused by unwanted changes in DNA zzso The key proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints in different zzso of the cell cycle, and their interaction, is a fertile and rapidly developing area of zzso This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of cellular checkpoints in response to zzso zzso breaks in zzso cells and how this impacts on zzso
