The zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling 1 zzso or zzso interacts with zzso and activates zzso zzso signaling systems independent of a zzso zzso zzso As an initial approach to further define the cellular role of zzso in zzso zzso we determined the influence of zzso on the regulation of zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel zzso current zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso current zzso by zzso zzso of a key zzso zzso within the zzso domain involved in zzso binding for zzso proteins eliminated the action of zzso The zzso of zzso was not overcome by increasing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but was progressively lost upon injection of increasing amounts of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may antagonize zzso signaling by altering the pool of zzso zzso available for zzso zzso and/or disruption of a zzso signaling zzso Such regulation would be of particular importance for those receptors that exist zzso to zzso zzso and for receptors operating within signaling zzso
