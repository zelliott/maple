zzso deposited on plants by zzso insects represent a threat as they develop into feeding zzso Plants are not a passive zzso and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect eggs and induce direct and indirect zzso Recent years have seen exciting development in molecular aspects of zzso zzso Some zzso zzso have been identified, and signaling pathways and zzso expression profiles are being zzso Depending on the mode of zzso both the zzso acid and salicylic acid pathways seem to play a role in the induction of defense zzso An emerging concept is that eggs are recognized like microbial pathogens and innate immune responses are zzso In addition, some eggs contain zzso that induce highly specific defenses in zzso Examples of zzso suppression of defense or, on the contrary, zzso resistance highlight the complexity of zzso interactions in an zzso arms race between zzso and their zzso A major challenge is to identify plant receptors for zzso zzso to assess the specificity of these zzso and to identify molecular components that zzso various responses to zzso
