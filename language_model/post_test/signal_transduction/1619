zzso plays an essential role in zzso of mature T cells via stimulation of zzso and zzso and is known to selectively zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso T zzso Recently, we reported that a zzso zzso which depends on zzso zzso reorganization mediates selective recruitment of zzso to the membrane or zzso and its zzso zzso by zzso zzso Because this zzso acted selectively on zzso we addressed here the question of whether the zzso and zzso of zzso in T cells is regulated by a unique zzso distinct from the conventional mechanism for zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso Using three independent approaches, zzso a selective zzso zzso a zzso T cell line, or a dominant negative zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso membrane recruitment and zzso zzso of zzso are largely independent of zzso In contrast, the same zzso strategies blocked the membrane zzso of zzso zzso or zzso raft recruitment of zzso (but not zzso was absent in T cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso T cells, and was enhanced by zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the membrane zzso of zzso but did not associate with zzso These results provide evidence that a zzso zzso and zzso zzso mediates the selective membrane recruitment and, zzso zzso of zzso in T zzso
