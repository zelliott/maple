zzso zzso is a potent zzso demonstrated in multiple cell lineages to promote the expansion and maintenance of stem and zzso cell zzso zzso effects are highly context dependent, and varying effects of zzso signaling on zzso stem cells zzso have been zzso We explored the impact of zzso signaling in zzso specifically in the context of the zzso niche by using an zzso promoter driving expression of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso signaling was markedly inhibited in zzso and, unexpectedly given prior reports, reduction in zzso zzso signaling resulted in reduced zzso zzso increased cell zzso and a progressive decline in zzso function after zzso This effect was zzso determined, but irreversible if the cells were transferred to a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso in the niche is required to limit zzso proliferation and preserve the zzso function of zzso zzso stem zzso
