zzso zzso factor zzso belonging to the zzso family of growth factors, has a widespread distribution in the central and peripheral nervous zzso In central motor structures including the motor cortex, zzso zzso zzso and spinal cord, zzso exerts both zzso and direct zzso effects via a zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso and a common zzso zzso zzso zzso The underlying signaling pathways mainly involve zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, and zzso zzso zzso The loss of zzso usually leads to zzso in these motor centers and eventually results in several severe motor diseases, such as zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso Parkinson's disease, zzso disease, as well as zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the recent understanding of functions of zzso in motor structures and suggest that zzso may be a potent candidate for the treatment of these neurodegenerative motor zzso
