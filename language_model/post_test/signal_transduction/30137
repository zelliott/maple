zzso of the zzso (B cell zzso zzso stimulates the production of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are generated from a common zzso zzso zzso In some systems, continuous zzso zzso synthesis is necessary for zzso zzso zzso production, but whether this is true for the zzso and whether zzso zzso synthesis is regulated following zzso zzso are not zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a shuttle to bring zzso to the plasma membrane as a means of stimulating zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex appears to zzso to zzso zzso This complex provides a novel shuttling mechanism that allows zzso to regulate the production of the zzso required by both its upstream zzso zzso zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso
