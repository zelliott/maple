zzso populations zzso gene expression collectively through zzso sensing zzso a zzso communication mechanism employing zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso regulator zzso protein zzso zzso is a key component of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso including the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso its precursor zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These drive the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of key zzso zzso as a function of bacterial population zzso zzso zzso constitutes a potential target for novel zzso agents which zzso infection through the blockade of zzso Here we present the crystal structures of the zzso zzso binding domain zzso and a complex with the native zzso zzso We show that the structure of the zzso zzso has an unusually large zzso pocket in which a native zzso zzso is stabilized entirely by zzso zzso Through a zzso design strategy we zzso and evaluated a series of 50 zzso and novel zzso zzso zzso and measured the impact on zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso The simple exchange of two zzso zzso for zzso switches a zzso zzso to an zzso with a zzso impact on the induction of bacterial zzso factor zzso We also determined the complex crystal structure of a zzso zzso bound to zzso revealing a similar orientation in the zzso binding pocket to the native zzso zzso This structure represents the first description of an zzso zzso zzso these studies present novel insights into zzso zzso binding and zzso drug design and provide a chemical scaffold for further zzso zzso zzso drug development by targeting the zzso zzso zzso
