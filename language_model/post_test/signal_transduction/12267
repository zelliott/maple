There is increasing evidence in humans and in experimental animals for a relationship between exposure to specific environmental chemicals and zzso in levels of critically important zzso hormones zzso Identification and proper interpretation of these relationships are required for accurate assessment of risk to public zzso 

We review the role of zzso in nervous system development and specific outcomes in adults, the impact of zzso on zzso zzso the relationship between adverse outcomes of zzso disruption and upstream zzso zzso and the zzso implications of zzso in zzso signaling by zzso zzso 

We drew on an extensive body of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso are critical for normal nervous system development, and decreased maternal zzso levels are associated with adverse zzso development in zzso In adult humans, increased zzso hormone is associated with increased blood pressure and poorer blood zzso profiles, both risk factors for cardiovascular disease and zzso These effects of zzso suppression are observed even within the zzso range for the zzso Environmental chemicals may affect zzso zzso by a number of mechanisms, and multiple chemicals have been identified that interfere with zzso function by each of the identified zzso 

zzso are potentially vulnerable to adverse effects as a consequence of exposure to zzso zzso Any degree of zzso disruption that affects zzso levels on a population basis should be considered a zzso of adverse zzso which may have important zzso zzso
