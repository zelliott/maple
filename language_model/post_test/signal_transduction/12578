zzso 26 zzso a novel zzso zzso without a zzso zzso is expressed in T helper 1 zzso and zzso zzso Currently, its function in human disease is completely zzso The aim of this study was to zzso its role in zzso zzso 

zzso studies were performed by reverse zzso zzso quantitative zzso western zzso and zzso Signal zzso was zzso by western zzso experiments and zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso serum levels were determined by an zzso zzso zzso 

All examined zzso zzso cell zzso lines express both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation increases the zzso expression of zzso zzso but decreases cell zzso In inflamed zzso zzso of patients with Crohn's disease, an elevated zzso zzso expression was found that correlated highly with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso protein expression in zzso T cells including zzso cells expressing the orphan nuclear zzso zzso with an increased number of zzso zzso cells in active Crohn's zzso 

zzso cells express the functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso gene expression and its expression is zzso in active Crohn's disease, indicating a role for this zzso system in the innate host cell response during zzso zzso For the first time, zzso expression is demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso supporting a role for this cell type in the zzso of Crohn's zzso
