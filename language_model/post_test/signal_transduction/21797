zzso zzso is a hormone that is zzso in models of neurodegenerative zzso This study examined whether EPO can protect against zzso death in the zzso region of the rat zzso following global cerebral zzso zzso human EPO was infused into the zzso zzso either before or after the induction of zzso produced by using the zzso model in zzso zzso zzso zzso damage was ameliorated by infusion of 50 U zzso Administration of EPO was zzso if given 20 zzso before or 20 zzso after zzso but not 1 zzso following zzso zzso of the zzso 3 zzso inhibitor zzso with EPO inhibited the protective effects of zzso Treatment with EPO induced zzso of both zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso EPO also enhanced the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso Finally, we determined that zzso zzso played minor roles in zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that a single injection of EPO zzso up to 20 zzso after global zzso is an effective zzso agent and suggest that EPO is a viable candidate for treating global zzso brain zzso
