zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibiting high activity in zzso the zzso zzso product zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso in complex with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The structure has been solved at zzso A resolution, which reveals that the active site of one zzso of the zzso zzso binds zzso whereas the other binds zzso A marked asymmetry between the two zzso is zzso Most noticeable are the differences in the zzso of zzso zzso 69 and zzso In all zzso structures published zzso the zzso groups of zzso zzso from both zzso stack at the zzso interface and are related by a zzso zzso zzso In the present structure of zzso however, the two zzso side chains point in opposite directions, although their zzso groups remain in zzso In the zzso with bound zzso zzso also interacts with zzso and the zzso group of zzso points away from the active site, whereas in the zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso into the active site, which breaks its interaction with zzso According to our previous results zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the availability of zzso in the active site assists the zzso of zzso with zzso We propose a model for the zzso mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso with zzso the zzso group of zzso is available in the active site of only one zzso at any given time and the stacked pair of zzso zzso act as a switch that couples the concerted movement of the two zzso side zzso The alternate occupancy of zzso in the two zzso has been confirmed by our kinetic analysis that shows the negative zzso of zzso for zzso zzso of the signaling between the zzso by mutating the zzso zzso released the negative zzso with zzso
