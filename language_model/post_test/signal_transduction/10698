The plant immune system relies to a great extent on the highly regulated expression of hundreds of defense genes zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso The expression of many of these genes is controlled by a family of zzso known as zzso these zzso zzso fatty acid derivatives are reminiscent of zzso The roles of zzso also extend to the control of zzso zzso How are these complex events zzso Nearly 20 members of the zzso family have been zzso zzso like zzso acid, exist in unmodified forms, whereas others are zzso to other lipids or to zzso zzso zzso Why do so many chemically different forms of these zzso exist, and do individual zzso have unique signaling properties or are they made to facilitate transport within and between cells? Key features of the zzso signal zzso have been identified and include the specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso thought to target zzso zzso zzso for modification or zzso Several classes of zzso factor are known to function in the zzso pathway, and, in some cases, these proteins provide zzso that integrate this network with other important defensive and zzso zzso Progress in zzso research is now zzso but large gaps in our knowledge zzso zzso to keep pace with progress, the ensemble of zzso zzso zzso at the Signal zzso zzso Environment describe zzso the zzso signaling pathway, zzso the zzso signaling pathway, and zzso the zzso and structures of the zzso zzso
