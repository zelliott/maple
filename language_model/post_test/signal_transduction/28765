The opportunistic human pathogen zzso zzso regulates the production of numerous zzso factors via the action of two separate but coordinated zzso sensing systems, las and zzso These systems control the zzso of genes in response to population density through the zzso signals zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso also plays a significant role in the zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is intertwined in the zzso zzso zzso sensing hierarchy with its production and zzso requiring the las and zzso zzso sensing systems, zzso This report presents a preliminary zzso analysis of zzso the first gene of the recently discovered zzso zzso gene zzso We show that zzso zzso required zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso within the zzso zzso gene zzso It was also found that the zzso of zzso and subsequent production of zzso was induced by the las zzso sensing system and zzso by the zzso zzso sensing zzso In addition, zzso production was dependent on the ratio of zzso to zzso suggesting a regulatory balance between zzso sensing zzso These data are an important early step toward understanding the regulation of zzso synthesis and the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
