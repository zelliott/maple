During an immune response, activated zzso zzso T cells condition zzso cells zzso to enhance DC function and survival within the inflamed draining zzso zzso zzso It has been difficult to ascertain the role of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso member zzso zzso in this process because signaling through the zzso zzso controls multiple aspects of zzso tissue zzso To resolve this, we have used an in zzso system where the expression of zzso family zzso is manipulated only on the zzso T cells that interact with and condition zzso zzso We report that zzso is a critical participant required for optimal DC function, independent of its described role in maintaining zzso tissue zzso In the absence of zzso or zzso on zzso T cells, DC dysfunction could be rescued in zzso via zzso or zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that these two pathways cooperate for optimal DC zzso
