zzso the process by which all complex biological structures are formed, is driven by an intricate interplay between zzso growth, as well as zzso and zzso zzso While the expression of different genes changes the mechanical properties and shapes of cells, growth exerts forces in response to which zzso zzso and more complex structures are zzso This is exemplified by a number of recent findings for instance in zzso formation in zzso and zzso tube formation in zzso However, growth not only generates forces, mechanical forces can also have an effect on growth rates, as is seen in zzso zzso or bone zzso In fact, mechanical forces can influence the expression levels of patterning zzso allowing control of zzso via mechanical zzso In order to study the connections between mechanical stress, growth control and zzso information about the distribution of stress in a tissue is zzso Here, we applied zzso to the wing zzso disc of zzso zzso a commonly used model system for organ growth and zzso in order to assess the stress distribution present in this zzso For this purpose, stress-related differences in zzso are measured using a zzso optical zzso zzso this method, we found that the stresses are zzso distributed in the wing disc, with maximum zzso in the zzso of the wing zzso This zzso increases with wing disc size, showing that mechanical forces vary with the age of the zzso These results are discussed in light of recent models proposing mechanical regulation of wing disc zzso
