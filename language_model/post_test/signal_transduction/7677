zzso 1000 is a small zzso inhibitor targeting the zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor and vascular zzso growth factor, which have known roles in the zzso of pulmonary zzso The zzso potential of zzso 1000 was determined in a rat model of zzso lung zzso and in an ex zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso exposed to a single zzso injection of zzso were treated with zzso 1000 starting 10 days after zzso zzso To gauge for zzso activity, collagen deposition and zzso growth factor gene expression was zzso in isolated zzso Furthermore, the activity of zzso 1000 was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso I zzso zzso in an ex zzso zzso zzso to zzso differentiation zzso performed in primary human zzso zzso Treatment of rats with zzso 1000 resulted in the zzso of zzso as assessed by the reduction of collagen deposition and the zzso of zzso gene zzso In the cellular zzso both zzso and zzso 1000 showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso or related small molecules with a similar zzso zzso profile, may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary zzso
