This study aimed to investigate whether zzso IV zzso the zzso zzso transition pore zzso opening through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to zzso IV for 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were determined with western zzso The zzso opening was evaluated by measuring zzso membrane potential zzso zzso oxide zzso generation was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence images were obtained with zzso zzso 

zzso IV significantly enhanced zzso zzso and prevented zzso loss of zzso These effects of zzso IV were reversed by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the NO sensitive zzso zzso selective inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso IV activated zzso and zzso zzso IV was also shown to increase NO production, an effect that was reversed by zzso and zzso zzso IV applied at zzso reduced cell death caused by simulated zzso indicating that zzso IV can prevent zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso IV prevents the zzso opening and zzso injury by zzso zzso through the zzso signaling zzso zzso is responsible for NO generation and is activated by the zzso zzso
