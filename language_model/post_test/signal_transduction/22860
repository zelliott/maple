zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is a zzso implicated in the zzso of numerous chronic and acute inflammatory zzso We have previously shown that mouse zzso cells respond to zzso by increasing zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso In this cell type zzso activates the zzso protein zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso the last of which is responsible for zzso production zzso To determine which zzso signaling zzso is required for zzso induction of zzso zzso we have zzso the protein zzso inhibitor zzso demonstrating that treatment of zzso cells with such compound significantly reduced zzso expression and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment increased the expression of zzso zzso providing a possible mechanism of action of this zzso By using zzso zzso to zzso and to zzso zzso receptors and both human and mouse zzso we demonstrate that both zzso receptors are expressed and that only the zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso activates all of the three zzso whereas zzso failed to activate any of the zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
