The zzso of DNA zzso breaks zzso to generate zzso tails is a pivotal event in the cellular response to these zzso In the zzso model of zzso primarily zzso in zzso initial zzso by zzso is followed by extensive zzso by two distinct pathways involving zzso or zzso However, zzso pathways and their exact contributions in humans in zzso are not as clearly worked out as in zzso Here, we examined the contribution of zzso to DNA end zzso in humans in zzso in response to zzso radiation zzso and its relationship with other zzso pathways zzso or zzso We find that zzso plays a zzso role in zzso in human cells along with an alternate zzso dependent on zzso While zzso and zzso stimulate zzso in human cells, they are not absolutely required for this process and zzso can function in zzso even in the absence of zzso Interestingly, the recruitment of zzso to DNA breaks appears to be inhibited by the zzso protein zzso and the higher level of zzso that occurs upon zzso depletion of zzso is dependent on zzso In addition, zzso may be regulated by zzso and zzso and the restoration of zzso in zzso cells upon depletion of zzso is dependent on zzso Finally, we find that zzso zzso zzso a transition from zzso to zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso Our results identify zzso as a key zzso of DNA end zzso and zzso repair and damage signaling decisions in human zzso
