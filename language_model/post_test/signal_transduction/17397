zzso zzso zzso in response to insulin is essential for zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso with insulin results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into the plasma membrane and subsequent zzso zzso Here we establish that zzso and zzso are key regulators of zzso trafficking that function at independent, sequential steps of zzso zzso zzso functions upstream of zzso in the sorting of zzso to the specialized transport zzso that ferry zzso to the plasma zzso zzso and its zzso protein zzso zzso comprise the principal signaling module downstream of insulin zzso zzso that regulates the zzso of zzso transport zzso at the plasma zzso Although both zzso and zzso are regulated by the GAP activity of zzso in zzso only zzso is under the control of zzso in zzso zzso regulation of the pool of zzso required for zzso zzso occurs through regulation of zzso since zzso of zzso by zzso its zzso exchange factor, does not require insulin zzso
