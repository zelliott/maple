We have undertaken a functional analysis of the zzso zzso repertoire in the zzso zzso Each zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used as a zzso and the odor response spectrum zzso by the zzso was determined in zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of these receptors were then matched to those of defined zzso to establish a zzso zzso In addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the signaling mode, zzso zzso or zzso and the response dynamics of the zzso An individual zzso can mediate both zzso and zzso responses to different zzso in the same cell, suggesting a model of zzso zzso zzso zzso vary widely in their breadth of zzso and zzso vary widely in the number of receptors they zzso Together, these properties provide a molecular basis for odor coding by the zzso repertoire of an zzso zzso
