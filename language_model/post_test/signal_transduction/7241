zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of gamma zzso activity, had been originally developed for the treatment of zzso zzso In recent years, it has been exploited in cancer research to inhibit zzso signaling that is zzso activated in various zzso We previously found that zzso could zzso with zzso agent, zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we delineate the underlying cell zzso mechanism using zzso cells, which have strong zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell death, although zzso alone did not affect cell viability at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest in a zzso manner, which was preceded by zzso cell death, as shown by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso amplified zzso zzso formation triggered by zzso Altogether, we show the evidence that zzso enhances zzso zzso in zzso cells via zzso zzso zzso formation, independent of zzso zzso These data suggest that one or more zzso zzso yet to be identified, in a zzso processed form, may play a role in maintaining functional zzso zzso More significantly, the synergistic effect of zzso in combination with VCR could be exploited in clinical setting to improve the efficacy of zzso
