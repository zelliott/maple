zzso zzso is a distinct member of the killer cell zzso zzso zzso family in human zzso cells that can induce zzso production and zzso activity in resting zzso zzso zzso zzso normally expressed only by zzso zzso cells, was reported to be a zzso for zzso however, zzso expression is not restricted to the zzso and can be found in zzso subset of peripheral blood zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso can interact with alternative zzso expressed by cells of zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso screen revealed that zzso recognition of zzso zzso is directly regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to directly interact with zzso and the zzso domain of zzso was essential for this zzso zzso zzso zzso can regulate zzso production by zzso zzso cells and zzso cells zzso and zzso differential zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso thus leading to zzso of zzso production and degradation of the zzso Furthermore, we showed that intimate interaction of zzso zzso HS zzso zzso and zzso directly affects zzso zzso and membrane zzso
