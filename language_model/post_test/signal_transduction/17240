Recent studies demonstrated that not only tumor zzso but zzso derived factors play crucial role in cancer zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso acid rich, zzso zzso that zzso zzso interactions and promotes tumor zzso zzso level of zzso has been shown in melanoma patient and predicted as a zzso zzso Recent reports have indicated that zzso zzso are involved in regulating stem cell zzso and zzso cell zzso However, the function of zzso derived zzso in regulation of side population zzso enrichment leading to melanoma growth, zzso and zzso is not well studied and yet to be the focus of intense zzso 

In this study, using melanoma model, in wild type and zzso knockout mice, we have demonstrated that absence of host zzso effectively zzso melanoma growth, zzso and zzso zzso cells isolated from tumor of zzso wild type zzso mice exhibited more zzso feature as compared to the parental cell line or cells isolated from the tumors of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, host zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso We report for the first time that zzso derived zzso regulates SP zzso in zzso melanoma zzso Moreover, loss in and gain of function studies demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates SP zzso specifically through zzso zzso 

This study establish at least in part, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of host zzso in melanoma growth and zzso and better understanding of host zzso interaction may assist the advancement of novel therapeutic strategy for the management of zzso zzso
