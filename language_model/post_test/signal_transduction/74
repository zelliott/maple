The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has recently been appreciated as a central zzso of zzso and an important drug zzso however, the influence of genetic variation in this zzso on zzso cancer is not zzso zzso zzso leads to cell zzso zzso and is zzso We sought to test the hypothesis that zzso cancer zzso and survival are modified by inherited variations in the sequence of the zzso and its zzso zzso We tested associations using a zzso study of zzso zzso cancer cases and zzso controls from New zzso zzso zzso reduction software was used to predict zzso zzso We detected an increased risk of zzso cancer associated with zzso zzso for the single zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso experienced longer survival than those with zzso zzso zzso adjusted hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso form of the zzso zzso had worse survival zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso Our findings suggest modified zzso cancer risk and survival associated with genetic variation in the zzso zzso zzso these genetic influences on increased zzso cancer zzso and survival may help in cancer zzso drug development and choice of therapeutic zzso
