Recent evidence suggests that hormones such as insulin and zzso act in the zzso to regulate energy balance and zzso zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso rats, zzso induced expression of zzso receptors in the area of the zzso zzso nucleus improved peripheral insulin sensitivity via enhanced suppression of zzso zzso production, with no change of zzso zzso zzso or zzso This effect was associated with increased insulin signal zzso via zzso zzso (as measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in liver, but not skeletal muscle, and with reduced zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the beneficial effects of zzso zzso signaling on zzso insulin sensitivity were blocked by selective zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso action increases peripheral insulin sensitivity primarily via effects on the liver and that the mechanism underlying this effect is dependent on the zzso branch of the zzso zzso
