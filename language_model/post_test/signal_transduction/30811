Recent demonstrations of insulin expression by zzso of mouse and human embryonic stem zzso cells have attracted interest in setting up these cells as alternative sources of zzso needed in diabetes cell zzso It is widely acknowledged that information gathered in the field of zzso biology as applied to the zzso is of relevance for designing in zzso differentiation zzso However, looking back at the protocols used so far, it appears that the natural route toward the zzso which goes via the definitive zzso was usually zzso As a consequence zzso zzso the earliest inhibitor of zzso initiation from the zzso was generally not zzso A recall of the status of this zzso during zzso cell differentiation appears necessary, especially in the light of findings that zzso A treatment of mouse and human zzso cells zzso them into definitive zzso a lineage showing wide zzso zzso expression with the potential to hinder pancreatic zzso
