It is well established that increasing age is associated with a decreased capacity of the immune system to mediate effective immune responses to vaccination and invading zzso Because of the inherent limitations of conducting experiments in humans, much of what we have learned is owed to the utility of experimental mouse models of zzso Recent studies performed in the mouse have demonstrated mechanisms responsible for age-related declines in the function of zzso and zzso zzso This review describes key findings regarding age-related defects in zzso function and discusses the impact these defects have on vaccine efficacy and zzso
