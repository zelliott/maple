zzso of the zzso gene is frequently detected in human zzso When zzso in zzso zzso cells, the normal zzso product, zzso displays potent transforming ability as well as zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso activity in the absence of zzso added zzso To investigate the basis for its chronic zzso we sought evidence of a zzso for zzso either in serum or produced by zzso zzso cells in an zzso zzso We demonstrate that a putative zzso for zzso is not contained in zzso zzso molecules composed of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso portion of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso did not show any transforming ability or zzso zzso when they were expressed in zzso zzso zzso However, they were able to zzso a zzso signal when triggered by a zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain of zzso These results provide evidence against the idea that an zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we obtained direct evidence of the zzso zzso activity of zzso by demonstrating that the zzso zzso remained active in a zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso in the absence of any zzso zzso for the zzso Thus, under conditions of zzso the normal zzso is a zzso active zzso able to transform zzso zzso cells in the absence of zzso
