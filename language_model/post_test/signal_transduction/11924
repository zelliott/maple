zzso can develop zzso zzso immunity by zzso zzso small zzso that guide gene zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruits zzso zzso zzso zzso to foreign sequences to amplify a zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that, in addition to an zzso memory of silenced zzso zzso zzso can also develop an opposing zzso memory of zzso We refer to this zzso which can prevent or reverse zzso as zzso zzso gene zzso zzso We show that zzso which engages zzso small zzso complementary to zzso zzso is required for zzso We show that a zzso with zzso activity also exhibits zzso of zzso zzso small zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso acquires and maintains a zzso zzso memory that recognizes and protects zzso allowing zzso to recognize foreign sequences zzso without the need for prior exposure
