The present review describes several lines of recent evidence providing new insights into the basic principles and mechanisms of zzso projection from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso are classified into approximately 1000 zzso according to the expression of specific zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso expressing a given zzso zzso are distributed within one zone out of the four circumscribed zones of the zzso zzso and send their zzso to the corresponding zone of the zzso zzso the principle of zzso zzso We discuss possible functions of a novel cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in the formation and maintenance of zzso projection of both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sensory zzso expressing a given zzso zzso zzso their zzso onto only two zzso fixed zzso among the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the principle of zzso zzso These zzso connection patterns give rise to the response specificity of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells, to a particular range of odor zzso In the process of zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso cell zzso molecules and zzso zzso proteins may be required for the establishment of the precise targeting of zzso zzso to the appropriate zzso
