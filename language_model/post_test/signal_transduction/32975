zzso radiation is known to potentially interfere with cellular functions at all levels of cell organization and zzso DNA zzso apparently with an zzso zzso related to D, also at low zzso On the other hand, low doses have also been observed to initiate a slowly appearing temporary protection against causation and zzso of DNA zzso involving the radical zzso system, DNA repair and removal of DNA zzso This protection apparently does not operate at high zzso it has been described to be zzso increasing initially with D, beginning to decrease when D exceeds approximately zzso zzso and eventually disappearing at higher zzso The various zzso responses have been shown to last individually from hours to weeks in different cell types and resemble responses to zzso zzso zzso to DNA is continuously and zzso produced mainly by zzso oxygen species zzso generated in a normal zzso zzso This zzso DNA damage zzso exceeds DNA damage from zzso zzso by several orders of zzso Thus, the protective responses following acute zzso zzso may be presumed to mainly counteract the zzso DNA zzso zzso the model described here uses two zzso functions, a linear one for causing and a zzso one for protecting against DNA damage from whatever cause in the zzso cells and zzso The resulting net zzso function strongly suggests that the zzso of cancer versus dose in the zzso zzso is much less likely to be linear than to exhibit a zzso The observed cancer zzso may even fall below the spontaneous zzso when D to cells is below approximately zzso zzso However incomplete, these data support a zzso of the zzso zzso
