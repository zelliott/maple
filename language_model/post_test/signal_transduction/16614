zzso bovine zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso These TVs were prepared by dissection of zzso that were collected by zzso zzso after culture for seven days in the zzso following transfer of zzso derived by in zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnoses were performed twice, between Day 26 and Day 43 and between Day 38 and Day 73 zzso by zzso The pregnancy rate was significantly increased at first pregnancy diagnosis when zzso were transferred with TVs zzso zzso compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three losses occurred in the zzso group between the first and second pregnancy zzso The final pregnancy rates according to delivered offspring were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the pregnant and zzso groups with regard to the average diameter of the TVs measured before transfer at three points during the gestation zzso The birth weight and gestation lengths of the offspring were almost the same for the zzso and control zzso In the zzso group, the genetic identities of calves from the separated zzso were not affected by the TVs, as confirmed by parental blood type zzso zzso offspring in zzso groups showed normal zzso In conclusion, the present study indicates that zzso of TVs prepared from zzso cultured in zzso following transfer of zzso zzso enhances the fertility of zzso during the early stages of pregnancy, as has similarly been shown in previous research for those prepared from in zzso zzso
