Pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is clinically characterized by a sustained zzso in mean pulmonary artery pressure leading to significant morbidity and zzso The disorder is typically zzso and in such cases the term idiopathic zzso zzso is zzso However, cases that occur within families zzso zzso zzso display similar clinical and zzso features, suggesting a common zzso zzso zzso of a type II member of the zzso cell signaling zzso known as zzso on zzso zzso have been identified in many zzso with zzso yet display both reduced zzso and sex zzso This report presents the compilation of data for 144 distinct zzso that alter the coding sequence of the zzso gene identified in 210 independent zzso zzso This large data set characterizes the extent of sequence variation and reveals that the majority zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso comprise nonsense, zzso and zzso zzso and gene zzso These predict premature termination of the transcript with likely loss through the process of zzso zzso zzso A total of 44 zzso zzso were identified that substitute zzso acid zzso at highly zzso sites within recognized functional zzso of the mature zzso We assess this category of zzso in the context of their zzso effects on cell signaling when zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso are zzso Taken together, these observations are likely to aid in the development of targeted zzso detection strategies relevant for patient zzso Finally, we examine the zzso and zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso by reviewing zzso animal models and the requirement for additional genetic and/or environmental zzso of zzso In conclusion, these data provide compelling genetic evidence that zzso is the zzso molecular mechanism underlying disease zzso and support the concept of a critical threshold of signaling activity below which disease may be zzso
