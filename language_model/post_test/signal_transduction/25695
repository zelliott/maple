The zzso zzso zzso is associated with coronary zzso plaque zzso We previously generated transgenic mice with vascular smooth zzso expression of human zzso and found that these mice developed zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso expressed in vascular smooth muscle in zzso zzso E zzso mice would accelerate zzso 

zzso mice with or without the zzso zzso were zzso We found a zzso increase in zzso plaque size and more specifically a large increase in zzso plaque area zzso versus zzso of zzso artery plaques and zzso versus zzso of zzso root zzso in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso protein and other zzso genes was increased in zzso and cultured vascular smooth muscle, and importantly, these changes in gene expression preceded the development of vascular zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso were zzso at least in part, by zzso stress because zzso of zzso zzso attenuated zzso osteogenesis in cultured vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso transgenic mice in the zzso background zzso showed minimal vascular zzso suggesting that zzso requires a zzso environment to induce zzso differentiation and vascular zzso 

zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reminiscent of features associated with plaque zzso
