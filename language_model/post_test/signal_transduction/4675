zzso variation in the 71 Crohn's disease zzso zzso implicated by zzso association studies zzso only accounts for approximately zzso of estimated zzso The contribution of zzso zzso to disease zzso is emerging as a research zzso 

The zzso status of zzso zzso sites across the zzso was analyzed using the zzso Human zzso zzso in DNA extracted from whole blood samples from 40 adult females (21 zzso CD, 19 healthy zzso and 16 girls with zzso CD, all zzso Our primary analysis compared zzso profiles in adult cases and zzso 

Our data define a global zzso profile characteristic of zzso zzso In all, zzso sites were zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 50 showed significantly altered zzso in cases compared with controls zzso P zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso including genes altering immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene zzso analyses implicated zzso pathways as targets of zzso modification zzso system processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immune response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defense responses to bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses implicated zzso cell activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and differential regulation of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified a significant enrichment of zzso changes within 50 zzso of CD zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in adults; zzso zzso zzso zzso in adults and children zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso status was zzso of disease status zzso zzso specificity zzso Disease activity, drug therapy, zzso and zzso zzso were not associated with zzso zzso 

These data provide an important insight into the impact of zzso mechanisms in the zzso of zzso
