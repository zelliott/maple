zzso zzso and zzso zzso are mutually zzso zzso that stimulate zzso T cells to develop into either zzso or zzso zzso One feature of zzso differentiation in mice is the loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is accompanied by the inability to produce zzso in response to zzso In this report, we show that freshly isolated human T cells activated with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso exhibit a greatly diminished response to zzso whereas the zzso response of T cells activated with zzso plus zzso is zzso zzso zzso binding studies demonstrate that the impairment of T cell zzso responsiveness by zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the enhancement of zzso responsiveness by zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Through the use of a newly zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso we show that neither zzso nor zzso affect the expression of zzso which we determine to be one of at least two zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso exert opposite effects on T cell zzso responsiveness by zzso modulating the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso that are distinct from zzso and required, together with zzso for zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso This provides a basis for understanding the interplay between different zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso and offers insight into one of the mechanisms governing zzso and zzso zzso
