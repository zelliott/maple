During limb development, zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso keep the underlying zzso cells in a zzso state preventing differentiation by zzso signaling molecules such as zzso growth factor zzso We investigated the molecular mechanism of the zzso effect on the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of chick limb bud zzso cells as a model zzso We found that expression and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was increased zzso during zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso differentiation of zzso cells, and this effect was reversed by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso treatment also inhibited the expression and zzso of protein zzso zzso whereas it activated zzso and inhibited zzso zzso protein zzso all of which appeared to be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and altered the expression of cell zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso All these zzso effects were zzso by zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso regulate zzso of chick limb bud zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso and by modulating signaling pathways including those of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso
