zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso II through zzso of the zzso regulatory light chain zzso Its regulatory zzso zzso zzso is responsible for regulating the zzso zzso in response to upstream signals and for determining the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was identified to study the roles of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso defective for both maternal and zzso zzso demonstrated a failure in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the defects were mainly confined to the leading edge cells which failed to fully zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected in lateral region of the leading edge cells, suggesting that the role of zzso is to repress the zzso of zzso zzso II at the zzso location for coordinated cell shape zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the leading edge cells may zzso to the zzso aberrations of such zzso Similar defects were seen in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso function zzso The genetic interaction of zzso with zzso in the components of the zzso signaling cascade also indicates that zzso functions zzso to the zzso signal zzso zzso The results indicate an important role for zzso zzso in zzso
