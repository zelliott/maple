The zzso protein zzso I zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso but the specific functions of its two zzso zzso and zzso are poorly zzso Recent studies indicated a novel zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso To dissect the effects of zzso stress on the zzso zzso we used mouse embryonic zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso expressing both, one, or none of zzso In zzso cells, but not in cells expressing only zzso incubation with zzso induced the formation of a zzso bond between the two identical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with increased zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso production, indicating that it activates zzso directly via zzso Interestingly, there was a mutual influence of zzso and zzso on zzso activity and zzso bond formation, zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso slightly impaired its zzso by zzso whereas zzso of the zzso with zzso attenuated its zzso by zzso To evaluate the functional relevance of the zzso zzso pathway, we studied the regulation of the zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and, to a lower extent, in zzso expressing only zzso or none of the zzso Thus, zzso lowers zzso mainly via a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso stress selectively targets the zzso zzso which then zzso cellular processes in a zzso zzso A decrease in zzso in zzso via zzso of zzso might be a major mechanism of zzso zzso
