zzso are aggressive zzso brain zzso characterized by zzso proliferation and an abnormal zzso giving rise to brain zzso and increased patient zzso Here, we have characterized the zzso of zzso blood vessels and describe a gene signature clearly associated with zzso zzso altered vessels in human zzso zzso IV zzso We identified 95 genes zzso expressed in zzso vessels, while no significant differences in gene expression were detected between vessels in zzso brain and grade II zzso zzso vascular expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso was validated by zzso using a tissue zzso Through zzso analysis of gene induction in primary zzso cells, we provide evidence that increased zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is sufficient to invoke many of the changes in gene expression noted in zzso zzso zzso we found an enrichment of zzso target genes within the distinct gene signature of zzso vessels and a significant increase of zzso zzso complexes in the zzso of human zzso in zzso This indicates a key role of zzso zzso in regulating vascular zzso and suggests that, in addition to zzso zzso may represent a new target for vascular zzso zzso
