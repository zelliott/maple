zzso zzso is a hallmark of many debilitating neurological disorders and is thought to be regulated by mechanisms distinct from those governing cell body zzso Recently, zzso 6 zzso via zzso precursor protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was discovered to induce zzso zzso after zzso zzso We tested whether this zzso is involved in zzso zzso caused by withdrawal of other zzso support, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso withdrawal activated this zzso 6 zzso and resulted in zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso were not involved in zzso zzso induced by mechanical or toxic zzso However, loss of surface zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso were observed during zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso dysfunction, which zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with motor zzso disease and frontal zzso zzso thus suggesting that the zzso 6 zzso could be important in specific types of zzso zzso zzso The zzso deprivation zzso with its defined molecular pathway, was used to examine the context of zzso zzso zzso We found that although zzso blocks zzso zzso after zzso factor withdrawal, it did not prevent loss of zzso zzso or zzso 6 zzso within the zzso suggesting it acts downstream of zzso zzso These results indicate that diverse insults induce zzso zzso via multiple pathways and that these zzso signals zzso on a common, zzso program that is uniquely involved in zzso but not cell body, zzso
