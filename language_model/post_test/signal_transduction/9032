zzso hormone zzso plays a key role in adjusting the zzso and zzso zzso axis zzso zzso is also widely distributed in zzso zzso where it acts as a zzso to integrate the complex zzso zzso and behavioral zzso response to zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso circuits are involved in zzso disturbances and stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and zzso This review describes the main zzso features of the zzso network and summarizes recent relevant information concerning the molecular mechanism of zzso action obtained from signal zzso studies using cells and zzso and transgenic mice zzso Special focus is placed on the zzso signaling pathways triggered by zzso through the zzso zzso 1 that plays an essential role in zzso action in zzso zzso and in specific brain zzso Recent findings zzso the concept of specific zzso pathways restricted to specific anatomical zzso zzso zzso action at molecular levels will not only provide insight into the precise zzso mechanism of action, but will also be instrumental in identifying novel targets for pharmacological intervention in neuroendocrine zzso and specific brain areas involved in zzso zzso
