Many common inflammatory disorders are characterized by the zzso of zzso across zzso lined zzso surfaces resulting in disruption of critical barrier function that protects from microbes and noxious zzso In such conditions, disease symptoms are complex but directly related to zzso effects on the barrier and zzso cell zzso It is now highly regarded that cellular factors such as zzso and zzso interactions zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells have potent effects on zzso zzso defined by coordinated zzso migration, zzso and regulated cell zzso Certain zzso for example, not only alter zzso interactions with zzso through changes in expression of zzso molecules but also affect barrier function through zzso in the composition and dynamics of zzso zzso In particular, zzso loss of many tight junction zzso in part, can account for zzso cellular zzso migration, survival, and barrier zzso This review will highlight how zzso interact with zzso cells with particular focus on zzso molecules involved and signaling events that play roles in regulating zzso zzso and zzso A better understanding of these molecular events may provide new ideas for zzso directed at attenuating consequences of zzso inflammation of zzso zzso
