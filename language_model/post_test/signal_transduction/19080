zzso zzso zzso the common zzso zzso of zzso cancer, presents as a zzso tumor or as an zzso often lethal zzso To study UC molecular biology, candidate gene and zzso approaches have been zzso Here, it is argued that a zzso zzso perspective is useful to integrate findings from both zzso According to this view, zzso zzso typically exhibit zzso of the zzso pathway, as a consequence of zzso zzso in zzso or zzso with increased zzso D1 zzso In contrast, invasive UC are characterized by severe disturbances in zzso cell cycle regulators, zzso zzso and zzso which decrease dependency on zzso zzso In addition, these disturbances permit, promote and are in turn exacerbated by zzso instability, which is further enhanced by loss of zzso zzso In another vicious cycle, defective cell cycle regulation interacts with DNA zzso zzso The transition toward invasive UC may require zzso and interacting defects in cell cycle regulation and the control of zzso zzso zzso neither zzso zzso nor zzso signaling appear to play major roles in zzso This may reflect its origin from more differentiated zzso cells possessing a high zzso potential rather than a stem cell zzso
