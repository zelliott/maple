One of the major characteristics of tumors is their ability to evade zzso through altering the properties and functions of host zzso and/or immune zzso zzso has been shown to play important roles in T cell zzso zzso and zzso production, which promotes the differentiation and proliferation of zzso cells important for immune defense against zzso zzso In this study we found that zzso mice were more susceptible to bacterial infection and showed reduced zzso levels in serum during zzso zzso Our data further demonstrated that the soluble factors zzso by zzso zzso tumor cells but not normal zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso expression in zzso in response to zzso but not to zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso molecules on zzso zzso expression was regulated at the zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis by zzso or through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso completely reversed the zzso effect of zzso medium zzso on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and the zzso analog zzso could mimic zzso zzso zzso and the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso analog on zzso zzso expression could be completely reversed by the zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, blocking zzso synthesis in zzso led to partial recovery of zzso production during zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso zzso from breast cancer cells suppresses zzso zzso in zzso zzso through a zzso signaling pathway, which may result in suppression of host immune responses against subsequent bacterial zzso
