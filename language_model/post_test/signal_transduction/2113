zzso between cells help to elaborate pattern within the zzso central nervous system zzso The genes zzso and zzso which zzso members of the zzso family of zzso zzso signals, are zzso at the zzso zzso of the developing neural tube, zzso with zzso zzso Each signal is essential for embryonic development, zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for formation of the zzso zzso but the absence of a zzso zzso zzso in each zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be zzso Here we demonstrate that in the absence of both zzso and zzso there is a marked zzso in neural crest zzso which originate from the zzso neural tube, and a pronounced reduction in zzso neural precursors within the neural tube zzso These zzso do not seem to result from a disruption in the mechanisms responsible for establishing normal zzso zzso Rather, our results are consistent with a model in which local zzso zzso regulates the expansion of zzso neural zzso Given the widespread expression of different zzso genes in discrete areas of the zzso neural tube, this may represent a general model for the action of zzso zzso in the developing zzso
