In this communication, we demonstrate that an increase in zzso zzso by 1) addition of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or 2) zzso of the zzso with zzso down regulates the levels of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso activity in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso expression in a time and zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso decreases the amount of zzso protein by zzso and zzso zzso zzso to down regulation of zzso we observe an up regulation of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a differentiation marker for zzso zzso Using specific zzso and zzso we have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not involved in the zzso of zzso gene zzso The zzso factor zzso is significantly reduced while zzso becomes up regulated after zzso zzso However an zzso mobility shift zzso with the zzso zzso motif present in the promoter of the rat zzso gene indicates that this motif is not involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso zzso levels regulate the expression of zzso in rat zzso zzso cells by a zzso zzso that is different from the zzso signal zzso zzso
