To determine the expression profile of protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso genes in human primary zzso zzso zzso and to compare it with that of immortalized human zzso zzso zzso with a view to learning whether zzso zzso cells can be used for zzso signal zzso pathways in human zzso 

We used the zzso Human zzso zzso and a method based on zzso with zzso zzso to zzso the expression profile of protein zzso genes in primary human zzso zzso and compared it with that of immortalized human zzso cell line zzso zzso using zzso and Western zzso 

A total of 21 zzso genes were identified and several of these have never been shown to be expressed in human zzso zzso Comparative expression analysis of some selected zzso genes showed that the zzso expression pattern of many protein zzso genes in zzso zzso was identical to that of zzso zzso zzso However, there were differences in the level of protein expression of selected protein zzso in these zzso For example, zzso expression of the novel zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso and in the cell lines zzso but by Western zzso zzso protein was not detected in zzso zzso In these studies, we also identified a novel zzso form of the zzso domain zzso 2 zzso transcript from zzso cell line zzso 

Our results provide novel information about protein zzso gene expression in zzso zzso and indicate that the transformed zzso cell line zzso zzso may be suitable for zzso signal zzso pathways in zzso and to investigate how they regulate zzso function in inflammatory and degenerative joint zzso
