Members of the zzso family of small zzso control cell zzso and zzso through dynamic regulation of the zzso zzso Although twelve family members have been identified, only three of these - zzso zzso and zzso - have been studied in zzso zzso regulates the formation of focal zzso and the bundling of zzso filaments into stress zzso It is also involved in other cell zzso pathways including the regulation of gene expression and the generation of zzso second zzso zzso zzso zzso is very closely related to two other small zzso about which much less is zzso zzso and zzso (which are approximately zzso zzso Perhaps the most intriguing of these is zzso zzso is largely zzso but zzso to the plasma membrane on zzso zzso however, is entirely zzso to the zzso face of zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests a potential role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso however, no evidence has been presented to support zzso zzso has been shown to act at the plasma membrane to regulate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso and targets it to the zzso compartment zzso We show here that zzso acts through zzso to regulate the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso
