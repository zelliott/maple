We develop a model of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso to regions of close zzso proximity (close zzso that physically exclude zzso zzso such as zzso zzso exclusion generates regions of low zzso and high zzso activity and thus our model provides a framework to examine the kinetic segregation model of zzso zzso We incorporate a sequence of zzso steps modeling the construction of the zzso with a final zzso or zzso signaling zzso The residence time of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is shown to be too short for zzso of zzso steps, whereas binding to an zzso lengthens the zzso time and leads to generation of fully active zzso zzso detection depends only on this zzso and therefore kinetic segregation represents a viable zzso detection zzso or signal zzso mechanism across zzso distinct from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We examine the degree of discrimination of zzso from a background of zzso zzso zzso and from weak zzso achievable by this zzso
