The aim of the present study was to define the effect of zzso zzso extracts zzso on vascular tension and responsible mechanisms in rat zzso zzso zzso 

Ethanol extract of the leaves of zzso zzso was examined for their vascular zzso effects in isolated zzso rat zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso induced relaxation of the zzso zzso rings in a zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rings with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso entry via zzso zzso channels failed to block the zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso entry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso markedly attenuated the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels of the zzso rings in a zzso manner and the effect was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, zzso zzso was significantly attenuated by zzso a zzso zzso channels blocker, but not by zzso an zzso zzso channels zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso receptors blockade had no effects on zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle via zzso zzso signaling through zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which may, at least in part, be related to the function of zzso zzso
