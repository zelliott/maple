zzso tube growth is a key step in sexual reproduction of higher zzso The zzso tube is a typical example of zzso cells and shows a polarized zzso To develop and maintain polarized growth, zzso tubes need a carefully regulated zzso zzso It is well known that zzso proteins are responsible for the direct control of dynamic zzso filaments and serve as a link between signal zzso pathways and dynamic zzso changes in determining cellular zzso Several of these classes have been identified in zzso tubes and their detailed zzso is progressing zzso Here, we aim to survey what is known about the major zzso proteins that affect zzso assembly and zzso and their zzso zzso in zzso tube zzso
