In zzso skeletal muscle cells expressing human insulin receptors zzso exposure to 25 zzso zzso for 3 zzso induced a rapid zzso increase in zzso and zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso The high zzso concentration also activated the insulin zzso zzso toward the zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso At zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso insulin zzso the exposure to 25 zzso zzso zzso no effect on zzso zzso In the zzso cells, the acute effect of zzso on insulin zzso zzso was paralleled by a zzso decrease in both the membrane and the insulin zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso activities and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso decrease in zzso and zzso zzso activities was accounted for by zzso of zzso but not of zzso or zzso This decrease in zzso was paralleled by a similarly sized increase in zzso zzso In intact zzso cells, zzso of zzso expression by using a specific zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso by the insulin zzso This effect was independent of insulin and accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso disposal by the zzso Thus, in the zzso skeletal muscle cells, zzso acutely regulates its own zzso through the insulin signaling system, independent of zzso zzso zzso appears to involve zzso zzso from the insulin zzso and its zzso zzso
