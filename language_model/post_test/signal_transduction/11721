zzso growth factor zzso belongs to a family of zzso with diverse biological zzso In the present study we have assessed the role of zzso signaling in the development of nervous system and zzso zzso in chick zzso Treatment of in zzso cultured zzso with zzso human zzso zzso led to abnormalities in neural induction and development, zzso formation and zzso as studied by gross zzso and zzso zzso growth and development was also adversely affected as seen from the measurement of body axis zzso Further, treatment of zzso with zzso resulted in differential zzso of expression of two genes important in normal development as studied by whole mount in zzso zzso using zzso zzso The expression of zzso which is necessary for zzso formation, was zzso in zzso zzso The expression of zzso the product which zzso in the patterning of the chick neural tube was, on the other hand, zzso within 2 zzso We also studied development of neural and zzso zzso in conditions where zzso signaling was zzso This was achieved by zzso the zzso in the presence of zzso In the presence of low doses of zzso zzso zzso abnormalities were detected mainly in the zzso structures while at higher doses zzso zzso the nervous system too was found to be abnormal in a large proportion of zzso Treatment of chick zzso with zzso zzso zzso also modulated the expression of zzso zzso within a 2 h zzso The results zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in the molecular events leading to the development of nervous system and zzso zzso in the chick zzso
