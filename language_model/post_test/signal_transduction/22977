Human zzso cells are large zzso zzso that kill zzso or zzso infected targets using zzso zzso zzso or zzso is one of the cell surface molecules that can trigger the killing machinery following binding of the zzso portion of zzso to the zzso a mechanism known as zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso We have recently shown that some individuals express an additional zzso on their zzso cells, zzso or zzso This zzso has now been characterized at the zzso zzso and functional zzso The present review outlines our findings to date on the features of this novel zzso These findings suggest that the presence of a functional zzso on the surface of zzso cells could have important clinical consequences in both tumor zzso and zzso zzso
