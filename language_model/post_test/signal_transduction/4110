The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor which regulates growth, development, differentiation and zzso To test the hypothesis that the diverse effects of the zzso could be zzso by interacting with other zzso zzso the present study assessed its interaction with the tumor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor which is involved in cell cycle regulation and zzso We found that the zzso zzso physically zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso had no or reduced repression effect, depending on the sites of zzso These findings suggest that zzso can cross talk with the zzso in zzso signaling pathways in zzso
