Recent evidence associates the zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein with higher stage and increased zzso of zzso zzso while the zzso 12 zzso zzso Ras zzso shows no such zzso Several observations may be relevant to this zzso First, zzso activity of zzso Ras is one-quarter that of zzso Ras and one-tenth that of zzso zzso zzso Second, binding of the zzso analogue zzso to zzso Ras is zzso weaker than its binding to zzso or zzso Ras and crystal structures indicate that zzso zzso between the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso and the gamma zzso of the bound zzso may make zzso binding to zzso Ras weaker even than that of zzso It is proposed that this lowering of affinity for zzso allows zzso Ras an escape from the zzso zzso state, whereas zzso tightly bound to zzso zzso Ras generates a more persistent, potentially zzso zzso zzso comparisons also suggest that differences between the zzso I zzso region of zzso and zzso Ras could modify interactions with downstream zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other differences between the zzso and zzso zzso Ras proteins include a lower affinity of the zzso zzso protein GAP for zzso than for zzso or zzso zzso but, as both zzso and zzso Ras are zzso to zzso zzso by GAP zzso this may be less zzso These studies complement experimental data showing that such Ras zzso differ in their effects in zzso and in zzso and, with recent data indicating zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso make it plausible that zzso 12 Ras zzso differ in zzso potential and zzso zzso
