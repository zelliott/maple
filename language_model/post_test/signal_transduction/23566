Maintaining the zzso of zzso zones in adult zzso is a fundamental but mechanistically poorly understood zzso In particular, what controls stem cell zzso remains zzso We have previously shown that zzso signaling limits neural stem cell zzso proliferation in the adult zzso zzso Combining pharmacological and genetic zzso we demonstrate here that long-term zzso zzso primarily zzso zzso amplification through their zzso from zzso and increased occurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the generation of a zzso zzso directly zzso zzso in these zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso function results in the generation of zzso at the expense of the activated zzso zzso Together, our results support a differential involvement of zzso receptors along the successive steps of zzso zzso They zzso zzso at the top of this hierarchy to gate zzso zzso and amplification, protecting the zzso of adult zzso reservoirs under zzso zzso
