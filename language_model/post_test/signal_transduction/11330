Gene expression profiling has revealed that diffuse large B cell zzso zzso consists of at least two distinct zzso Patients with one zzso zzso termed activated B zzso (ABC) zzso have a distinctly inferior zzso An untapped potential of gene expression profiling is its ability to identify zzso signaling pathways in cancer that are amenable to therapeutic zzso The gene expression profiles of ABC zzso were notable for the high expression of target genes of the nuclear factor zzso zzso factors, raising the possibility that zzso activity of the zzso zzso may contribute to the poor prognosis of these zzso Two cell line models of ABC zzso had high nuclear zzso DNA binding activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and rapid zzso degradation that was not seen in cell lines representing the other zzso zzso zzso center zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso or dominant negative forms of zzso was toxic to ABC zzso cells but not zzso zzso zzso DNA content analysis showed that zzso zzso caused both cell death and zzso growth zzso These findings establish the zzso zzso as a new molecular target for drug development in the most clinically intractable zzso of zzso and demonstrate that the two zzso zzso defined by gene expression profiling zzso distinct zzso zzso
