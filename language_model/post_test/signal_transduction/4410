The zzso zzso plays an important role in clinical zzso In normal cells, it is the most zzso expressed protein in the B zzso zzso zzso expression is induced at the point of B lineage commitment during the differentiation of the zzso stem cell, and its expression continues through zzso and mature B cell differentiation until it is finally zzso during terminal differentiation into plasma zzso zzso expression is maintained in zzso cells that have undergone zzso zzso and therefore zzso is useful in diagnosis of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso Interestingly, zzso is also expressed in a subset of acute zzso zzso zzso indicating the close relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso Because B lineage zzso and zzso rarely lose zzso zzso and because it is not expressed in the zzso stem cell, it has become the target for a variety of zzso agents, including zzso Treatment of zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso zzso coupled to biological toxins has proven to be effective in zzso and in animal models, and has shown some promising results in Phase I clinical zzso Recently, the analysis of zzso effects on zzso cell growth has highlighted a novel mechanism of zzso zzso of cell surface receptors like zzso by zzso can have zzso effects by the zzso of signal zzso pathways which control cell cycle progression and programmed cell death zzso
