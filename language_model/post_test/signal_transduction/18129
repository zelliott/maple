It has been shown that zzso migration zzso factor zzso zzso not only zzso functions, but also T cell zzso However, detailed analysis of the zzso function on responses of various T cell zzso remained to be zzso In this report, using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso functions on various T cell zzso It was shown that zzso zzso inhibited zzso responses of both zzso producing and zzso producing T zzso The zzso appeared to be related to blockade of the signal zzso via T cell zzso zzso but not that via zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso showed no zzso effect on zzso cell responses zzso through zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the signal zzso via zzso in mainstream T cells but not in zzso zzso
