zzso are key innate immune zzso cells that are rapidly recruited to sites of infection and inflammation to provide early zzso against invading zzso This function is facilitated by the expression of zzso zzso zzso family members by zzso allowing the recognition of an extensive repertoire of zzso molecular patterns zzso and thus triggering the response to invading zzso zzso zzso leads to important cellular processes including zzso oxygen species zzso generation, zzso production and increased survival, all of which can contribute to the zzso of chronic inflammation when zzso becomes zzso In turn, inflammation and tissue injury results in the release of zzso zzso zzso known as zzso molecular patterns zzso which are a rapidly growing class of potent inflammatory zzso zzso act in an zzso manner, alerting the host of damage, but can also amplify inflammation leading to further tissue zzso This review highlights recent literature on zzso zzso function and regulation during disease, and provides an overview of the recently emerging area of zzso responses to zzso
