We have previously demonstrated that zzso increase zzso zzso through a zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to further investigate the downstream end of the signaling zzso with a focus on zzso light chain zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso to zzso was measured in isolated coronary zzso Under control conditions, the zzso oxide donor sodium zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso two- to zzso Similarly, zzso of protein zzso C zzso with zzso zzso zzso significantly elevated zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso significantly attenuated the zzso responses to the zzso Furthermore, zzso dose zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the protein zzso inhibitor zzso dramatically increased zzso zzso These results suggest that 1) zzso and zzso play an important signaling role in the regulation of zzso barrier function and 2) zzso zzso contributes to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
