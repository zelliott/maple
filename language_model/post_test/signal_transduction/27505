Because zzso zzso blockade prevents protection by zzso zzso zzso in several species, zzso of zzso zzso appears to be critical for zzso The zzso zzso identity, however, is zzso The present study tested whether zzso of a zzso zzso zzso the insulin zzso could mimic zzso and if the mechanism of protection was similar to that of zzso zzso rabbit hearts were subjected to 30 zzso of regional zzso and 2 h of zzso zzso size was determined by zzso zzso and expressed as a percentage of the area at zzso zzso size in control hearts was zzso zzso zzso A zzso infusion of insulin (5 zzso followed by a zzso zzso period prior to zzso significantly reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso given around the insulin infusion blocked protection zzso zzso zzso However, when present during the onset of zzso zzso had no effect on protection triggered by insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of either zzso by zzso B zzso zzso or zzso channels by zzso zzso zzso also failed to prevent protection by insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the reduction in zzso size by insulin was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was still able to protect the heart when given only during the zzso period zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and still offered significant protection in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of the insulin zzso reduces zzso size in the rabbit heart even when instituted upon zzso However, the mechanism of protection is quite different from that of zzso and involves zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso
