zzso proteins contribute to the zzso control of zzso signaling and zzso is an zzso cascade scaffold that zzso to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor zzso To better understand the molecular mechanisms of zzso function, we examined the interaction of zzso with each of the zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we identify a zzso motif within the zzso sequence zzso of zzso and zzso that is required for zzso binding to zzso and find that zzso binding and zzso in the zzso zzso region enable zzso to form a zzso complex with zzso and zzso following growth factor treatment that enhances zzso zzso We also find that zzso of active zzso to the zzso scaffold allows zzso to zzso zzso and zzso on feedback zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso of zzso and zzso promote their zzso and result in the release of zzso from the plasma zzso Together, these findings provide unique insight into the signaling dynamics of the zzso scaffold and reveal that through regulated interactions with zzso and zzso zzso acts to both zzso and zzso zzso cascade zzso thus regulating the intensity and duration of zzso cascade signaling emanating from the plasma membrane during growth factor zzso
