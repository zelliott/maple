The zzso signaling zzso plays a crucial role in specifying cellular fates by interaction between cellular zzso however, the molecular mechanism underlying smooth muscle cell zzso differentiation by zzso signaling has not been well zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso signaling promotes zzso differentiation from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, an activated form of zzso zzso the expression of multiple zzso marker genes including zzso heavy chain zzso in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation by its zzso zzso but not zzso directly zzso zzso expression in zzso cells without de zzso protein zzso indicative of a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cells and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we show that such an induction is independent of the zzso response zzso complex, but absolutely dependent on zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso binding zzso Of importance, zzso signaling and zzso zzso activate zzso gene zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso constitutes an zzso signal for zzso differentiation through an zzso mechanism and zzso gene expression zzso by the zzso zzso Given that zzso zzso components are expressed in vascular zzso during normal development and disease, zzso signaling is likely to play a pivotal role in such situations to zzso the vascular smooth muscle cell zzso
