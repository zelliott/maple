zzso is a regulator of G protein signaling which is zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso promotes cell proliferation in several zzso cell zzso Here we showed that zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These changes were reversed upon the zzso of zzso zzso with an elevated zzso activity, increased levels of zzso Bad and zzso and a diminished expression of zzso were zzso thus demonstrating that zzso can zzso cell proliferation via multiple zzso
