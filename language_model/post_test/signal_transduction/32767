The zzso of zzso fluid by the zzso cells of zzso zzso is regulated by membrane receptors coupled to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso These zzso zzso pathways as their interactions were investigated in a sheep zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced a transient zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso 50 were zzso M for zzso zzso M for zzso and zzso M for zzso zzso increase in zzso calcium was comparable for zzso and zzso but was 3 to 5 fold larger for zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso calcium increases similar to single zzso reflecting absence of zzso zzso between these zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso but not by zzso and zzso This zzso resulted from an increase in zzso production rather than to an zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso each use specific zzso pathways in the sheep zzso zzso zzso
