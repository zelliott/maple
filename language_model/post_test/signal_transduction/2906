Plant zzso protein zzso zzso zzso play a pivotal role in a range of zzso and zzso stress zzso In this study, we isolated a novel group D zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized mainly to the nucleus and its zzso domain extension is believed to be essential for zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso is involved in response to zzso signaling molecules such as zzso acid, hydrogen zzso salicylic acid, zzso acid and zzso and induced by low temperature and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso of zzso at zzso level and zzso also mediates low zzso expression of zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco zzso zzso accumulated less zzso oxygen species under zzso stress by affecting zzso defense zzso zzso tobacco exhibited enhanced tolerance to cold by means of an increased zzso rate, and increased zzso and soluble sugar levels relative to control zzso The zzso levels of zzso genes were higher in zzso lines than in control plants under cold and zzso stress zzso zzso plants displayed enhanced resistance to viral zzso and the expression of the zzso gene zzso was significantly increased, indicating that zzso might be involved in zzso pathogen zzso zzso
