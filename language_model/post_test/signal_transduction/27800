The zzso beta zzso fusion protein isolated from patients bearing a zzso zzso is transforming when expressed in zzso zzso To examine the signal zzso events activated by this zzso we measured the effect of zzso on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in mouse bone zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in the activity of zzso was observed in transient zzso as well as in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso This zzso was zzso when the zzso cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of the zzso beta zzso zzso indicating that the activity of the zzso beta part of the fusion protein was involved in zzso zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso 4 zzso a direct zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso OH zzso zzso zzso a promoting survival factor, zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso was shown to initiate an zzso response that was enhanced by treatment of cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso zzso cell death through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, expression of the dominant negative zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso while a zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhances cell zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso by zzso is related to zzso rather than cell proliferation and zzso
