zzso is a widely expressed zzso protein zzso zzso that is implicated in regulation of zzso signaling triggered by both cell zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso regulates zzso zzso path finding in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation in zzso The molecular mechanism underlying the tissue specific function of zzso has not been clearly zzso We investigated the role and mechanism of zzso in zzso growth factors zzso and zzso signaling in human tissue culture cells in which the expression of zzso is under the control of an zzso zzso We found that although both zzso and zzso induce zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not interact directly with the zzso growth factor zzso since the zzso zzso of growth factor receptors was not affected by induction of zzso The specific effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso appeared to be zzso by specific zzso of the zzso of two signal zzso that act downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and a 180 zzso zzso and by prevention of their interaction with the zzso protein zzso In contrast, zzso selectively inhibited the zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso and the formation of the complex between zzso and zzso but this effect did not influence the zzso of zzso by zzso These data suggest that zzso and similar zzso protein zzso zzso may contribute to the regulation of zzso signaling by selectively zzso the zzso zzso of specific signal zzso that act downstream of the plasma zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the formation of signaling complexes by these proteins may contribute to the specificity of the signals generated by specific zzso growth factors as well as zzso zzso zzso
