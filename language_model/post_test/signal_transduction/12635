Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death zzso The spectrum of aberrations affecting zzso pathways in lung cancer zzso has not been fully zzso zzso expression of zzso is restricted to the zzso system, where its best-known function is as a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso an activity strictly controlled by zzso zzso downstream of cell surface zzso Here we find zzso expression in zzso of 78 lung cancer cell lines zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of primary human lung cancer tissue samples revealed zzso expression in zzso zzso samples, including zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with larger zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in lung cancer cells reduced proliferation in zzso and zzso growth in nude mice, while control zzso had no effect, suggesting that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of lung cancer zzso zzso is zzso in lung cancer cells following zzso by the growth factors zzso and zzso suggesting its participation in zzso events in these zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso an zzso growth zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a role in the zzso process in lung cancer, identifying it as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer zzso
