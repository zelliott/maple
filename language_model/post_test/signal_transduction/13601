zzso zzso play a major role in plant protection against zzso and zzso zzso zzso these molecules are known to be beneficial for human health and are responsible for zzso of foods and beverages such as wine and thus have a great impact on the final quality of the zzso Genes playing a role in the PA zzso are only partially zzso The amount of available zzso and genetic data to select candidate genes without a zzso knowledge from zzso function increases every zzso However, the methods used so far generate so many candidate genes that it is impossible to validate all of zzso In this study, we used an zzso strategy based on different screening methods to select a reduced list of candidate zzso We have crossed results from different screening methods including zzso mapping and three zzso studies to select 20 candidate zzso located in zzso intervals and fulfilling at least two zzso zzso This list includes three zzso already suspected to have a role in the PA zzso zzso Among the 17 remaining zzso we selected three genes to perform further analysis by association genetic zzso For each of these zzso we found a zzso linked to PA zzso The three genes zzso zzso and zzso not previously known to play a role in PA zzso are promising candidates for further molecular physiology zzso
