zzso signaling zzso is important for development and zzso zzso of this pathway, such as zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso gene and zzso zzso of zzso would result in stabilization of zzso and subsequent zzso to nucleus where genes are zzso Recently, a zzso of zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso while a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso related protein zzso was found to be zzso in some zzso These findings suggested that zzso is a potential zzso while zzso is a potential tumor zzso zzso We aimed to investigate whether zzso and zzso were altered in gastric zzso Twelve cases of gastric cancer, including 7 cases of zzso type, 4 cases of diffuse type and I case of mixed type, were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in most of the paired normal gastric zzso zzso was zzso in 9 cases zzso of gastric zzso zzso while zzso was zzso in 2 cases zzso zzso nuclear zzso was identified in 3 cases zzso and zzso D1 was expressed in 5 cases zzso of cancer zzso All these cases were associated with either zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso Our results suggested that zzso of zzso or zzso were frequent in gastric zzso These provide alternative mechanisms leading to zzso of zzso signaling zzso in gastric zzso
