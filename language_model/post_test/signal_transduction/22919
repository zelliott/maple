To determine whether the currently available evidence supports the hypothesis that zzso and mood zzso may bring about some of their long-term therapeutic effects by regulating signal zzso pathways and gene expression in the central nervous zzso 

To address this question, we reviewed the evidence showing that chronic administration of zzso and mood zzso involves zzso in signaling pathways and gene expression in the central nervous zzso 

A large body of data has shown that zzso and zzso exert effects on the protein zzso C signaling zzso and the zzso protein 1 family of zzso zzso in contrast, zzso affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso and may bring about their therapeutic effects by modulating zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the central nervous zzso 

Given the key roles of these signaling zzso in the amplification and integration of signals in the central nervous system, the findings have clear implications not only for research into the zzso and zzso of the severe mood disorders but also for the development of novel and innovative treatment zzso
