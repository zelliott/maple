zzso zzso plays an important role in B cell development and zzso Signaling initiated by zzso zzso or zzso zzso can rapidly convert zzso to an activated zzso zzso The binding of zzso to their zzso can then induce zzso cell zzso which can facilitate zzso zzso or cell migration on zzso zzso The signaling pathways involved in zzso zzso and zzso events in B cells are not completely zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activate the zzso and zzso zzso in B cells and that zzso zzso is essential for zzso B cell migration zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso Burgess, zzso zzso and Gold, zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso Christian, zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Burgess, zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso and Gold, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that preventing zzso zzso by expressing zzso zzso protein II zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding of zzso B cell lines to zzso zzso molecules and to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by expressing a zzso active form of zzso enhanced B cell zzso showing for the first time that zzso can promote zzso zzso We also show that blocking zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell spreading and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso changes and zzso B cell zzso Thus, the zzso zzso regulate zzso B cell zzso as well as processes that control B cell zzso and zzso
