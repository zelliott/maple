zzso of zzso factors and zzso between zzso zzso factors are a zzso theme in cell zzso An equally prevalent event that is frequently overlooked in lineage commitment models is the zzso of zzso zzso often through zzso zzso zzso Here, we use a minimal model that combines zzso and zzso elements of regulation in order to understand how both zzso and zzso events can inform cell commitment decisions in zzso Our results suggest that zzso positive zzso feedback can induce a zzso response to external stimuli during zzso differentiation by providing zzso to both zzso and committed states while protecting zzso from zzso differentiation or zzso Our model provides support to both the zzso and zzso theories of commitment: cell fates are ultimately driven by zzso zzso factors, but zzso signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy zzso decisions with complex, pertinent behaviors such as zzso zzso and robust zzso The simulations further suggest that the zzso of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting zzso state as well as on the route of commitment that is zzso Lastly, our model shows good agreement with zzso zzso expression zzso from zzso experiments and provides a zzso framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in zzso that have been observed zzso
