Little is known about the impact of different microbial signals on skin barrier organ function and the zzso between resident zzso and zzso zzso This study shows that zzso and zzso zzso differ in their ability to induce expression of zzso zzso zzso and activate different signaling pathways in human primary zzso Whereas zzso factors of skin zzso induce expression of the zzso zzso and zzso in primary human zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso those of zzso zzso activate the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways and suppress zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso bacteria are able to amplify the innate immune response of human zzso to pathogens by increased induction of zzso expression and zzso of zzso suppression, suggesting that the two zzso pathways can act in a synergistic zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso evolved specific mechanisms to zzso innate immunity of the zzso
