We investigated the zzso effect and mechanisms of action of zzso a zzso second-generation zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso calcium channels, in zzso cells that were zzso differentiated by treatment with nerve growth factor zzso zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells were treated with several zzso of this drug before performing viability zzso Free radical levels and zzso signaling proteins were measured with the fluorescent probe, zzso zzso and western zzso zzso Cell viability was not affected by low zzso of zzso up to 150 zzso but it was slightly decreased at 200 zzso zzso Following zzso exposure, the viability of zzso cells decreased zzso however, treatment with zzso increased the viability of zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in a zzso increase in free radical levels in zzso cells, and zzso treatment reduced free radical levels in zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso treatment increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and heat shock zzso factor zzso which are proteins related to zzso cell survival, and decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso activated zzso 3, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are associated with zzso cell death, in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso mediates its zzso effects by reducing zzso stress, enhancing survival signals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso death signals from zzso c release, zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso
