zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a very strong zzso factor which mediates its action, at least in part, through the expression of zzso tissue growth factor zzso Along with these zzso the involvement of zzso in wound healing and the development of zzso has been zzso Among them, zzso acid zzso is a novel, potent regulator of wound healing and zzso that has diverse effects on many types of zzso We decided to evaluate the effect of zzso together with zzso on zzso zzso We found that zzso treated with zzso and zzso produced an additive effect on zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the induction of zzso expression by zzso was abolished by a dominant negative form of the zzso zzso type II zzso and by the use of zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso activity of zzso suggesting that zzso induction is dependent on zzso and requires active zzso Moreover, we show that zzso requires zzso proteins for the induction of zzso zzso but not their zzso or their nuclear zzso The requirement of zzso for zzso zzso is zzso since treatment of zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso abolished the induction of stress fibers but not the induction of zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso induction in response to zzso requires the zzso of zzso but not zzso signaling zzso The zzso requirement is independent of zzso zzso These novel results for the mechanism of action of zzso and zzso are important for understanding the role of zzso growth factors and zzso involved in wound healing and related zzso
