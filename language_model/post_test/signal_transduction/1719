In this study, we characterized the zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and assessed the zzso and zzso dependence of these zzso To facilitate this we inserted a zzso zzso tag in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided by zzso zzso zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso indicated that each zzso zzso underwent rapid zzso which was strongly inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition zzso rapid zzso of zzso fluorescent protein zzso or zzso from zzso to membrane was observed in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was partially blocked by a selective inhibitor of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was not significantly affected by this zzso Similarly, zzso zzso production after zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was increased after zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso stimulation was zzso zzso by zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso receptors in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was partially blocked by zzso with zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso was less effective in reducing zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso or zzso underwent significant zzso zzso from zzso to membrane in cells zzso zzso or zzso but not in cells zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is subject to zzso and zzso zzso In addition, regulation by these zzso zzso differential zzso zzso
