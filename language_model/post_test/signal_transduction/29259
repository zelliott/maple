zzso zzso formed by two surrounding guard cells in the zzso of plant leaves, allow influx of atmospheric carbon dioxide in exchange for zzso water zzso zzso also restrict the entry of zzso important air zzso that has an increasingly negative impact on crop yields, and thus global carbon fixation and climate zzso The zzso of zzso pores is regulated by the transport of zzso active zzso and zzso across guard cell zzso Despite the vital role of guard cells in controlling plant water loss, ozone sensitivity and CO2 supply, the genes zzso some of the main regulators of zzso movements remain zzso It has been proposed that guard cell zzso channels function as important regulators of zzso closure and are essential in zzso zzso responses to zzso and stress zzso However, the genes zzso membrane proteins that mediate guard cell zzso zzso have not yet been zzso Here we report the mapping and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) is zzso expressed in guard cells and encodes a distant zzso of zzso and bacterial zzso acid transport zzso The plasma membrane protein zzso is essential for zzso closure in response to zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso humidity change, calcium zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso impair slow zzso zzso channel currents that are activated by zzso zzso and zzso acid, but do not affect rapid zzso zzso channel currents or zzso channel zzso A low zzso of zzso to bacterial and zzso organic acid transport zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso channels to zzso suggest a vital role for zzso in the function of zzso zzso zzso
