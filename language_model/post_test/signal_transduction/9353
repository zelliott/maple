The G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso trafficking modulated by the zzso associated zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso Of this trafficking, especially the zzso of zzso into primary zzso and back to the zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso The complete mechanism of this zzso zzso however, is not completely zzso Here we demonstrate that Growth Arrest zzso 8 zzso a zzso associated zzso of the zzso Regulatory Complex zzso interacts with zzso to zzso this zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells reduces zzso signaling activity and zzso zzso whereas zzso stimulates zzso activity in a zzso zzso The C zzso of zzso is important for both zzso interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso knocking down zzso results in attenuated zzso zzso responses and impaired early muscle zzso These effects can be reversed by the zzso of zzso zzso or by zzso zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso display a synergistic effect on zzso early muscle development and some effects of zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso does not interfere with zzso zzso as the primary zzso architecture is unchanged upon zzso knock down or zzso zzso This is in contrast to cells zzso expressing both zzso and zzso in which zzso are significantly zzso These results identify zzso as a positive regulator of zzso signaling that zzso with zzso to control zzso zzso
