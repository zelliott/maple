During zzso zzso maintain normal zzso zzso by stimulating zzso zzso zzso in circulating zzso and zzso two hormones that activate zzso zzso trigger the zzso zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso key zzso regulators of this zzso Although the underlying mechanism is zzso zzso zzso is also regulated by the zzso clock, which coordinates zzso metabolism with changes in the external zzso zzso control of gene expression is achieved by two zzso zzso Clock and zzso which stimulate zzso zzso and zzso and Period zzso zzso and zzso zzso that feed back on zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity during zzso is modulated by zzso and zzso which are rhythmically expressed in the zzso zzso expression was elevated during the zzso transition, when it reduced zzso zzso gene expression by blocking zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso and in the protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso studies, we found that zzso inhibited zzso of zzso in response to G zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso a direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins seemed to zzso zzso activity directly through interaction with zzso As zzso zzso of zzso lowered blood zzso zzso and improved insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso mice, our results suggest that compounds that enhance zzso activity may provide therapeutic benefit to individuals with type 2 zzso
