The zzso binding molecules zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of many zzso and zzso Here we analyzed the expression of zzso and zzso in the developing mouse zzso which are continuously growing zzso with a stem cell zzso Overlapping but distinct expression patterns for zzso and zzso were observed during all stages of zzso development zzso zzso zzso Both proteins were detected in the zzso zzso a transient zzso signaling structure that is important for tooth zzso and the cervical loop where the stem cell niche is zzso The functions of zzso and zzso were studied in dental zzso and zzso cultures in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus indicating a regulatory loop between these zzso zzso and zzso molecules also activated expression of both zzso in zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso varied according to the zzso or zzso origin of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited in zzso germs cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are involved in stem cells zzso zzso and zzso processes during mouse zzso zzso
