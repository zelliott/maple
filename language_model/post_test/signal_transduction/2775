Biological function of the zzso zzso is dependent on its activated zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain, the zzso site in zzso or the major zzso site of the zzso domain selectively disrupt downstream signaling but not zzso zzso zzso Despite a loss of zzso transformation activity, all three zzso retain the ability to render zzso cell lines growth factor independent and transform primary bone zzso cells in zzso In zzso tests of zzso potential reveal a most critical role for signals dependent on the zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of both zzso and zzso transformation by zzso is strongly affected by increased dosage of the zzso adapter zzso which can connect zzso zzso signals to zzso The zzso zzso activates multiple alternative pathways to zzso for zzso zzso
