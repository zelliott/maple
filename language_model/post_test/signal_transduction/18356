In the mouse embryonic zzso zzso tooth zzso have been identified, which can be mistaken for the first upper zzso In order to determine whether such a situation might exist in the lower jaw as well, tooth development was investigated in the mouse zzso cheek region during zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reconstructions demonstrated the existence of zzso dental structures, whose gradual appearance and zzso was associated with the zzso progress of zzso along the zzso axis of the zzso 1) At zzso zzso the zzso segment zzso was the most prominent part of the dental zzso zzso It included an zzso budding dental zzso The zzso although generally mistaken for the lower first zzso zzso zzso zzso and did not finally participate in zzso cap zzso 2) At zzso zzso a wide dental bud (called segment zzso appeared zzso to the zzso Although the zzso segment zzso represented the zzso part of the dental zzso at zzso it participated only in the formation of the zzso end of the zzso zzso 3) The top of the zzso segment at zzso was not the precursor of the zzso knot zzso contrary to what has been zzso 4) The central segment of the zzso cap as well as the zzso developed later and zzso to the zzso zzso 5) zzso specific zzso correlated with the zzso in growth of the zzso segment as well as with strong zzso changes in the zzso situated zzso to zzso These highlight the need to zzso current molecular data on early zzso development in the mouse in order to correlate the expression of zzso molecules with specific zzso events in the appropriate zzso or zzso segments of the embryonic zzso
