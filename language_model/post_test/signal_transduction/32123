This work examines the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in salicylic acid zzso zzso of zzso stress as a result of cadmium zzso stress in alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure caused severe growth zzso and zzso zzso which were zzso by zzso with zinc zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso of plants with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso both of which could induce zzso gene zzso significantly reduced the zzso of growth and zzso zzso The zzso effects were also evidenced by a decreased content of zzso zzso substances zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso and the loss of plasma membrane zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso modulated the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or their corresponding zzso zzso enhancement of the ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso and expression of their metabolism genes was observed, consistent with a decreased zzso oxygen species zzso distribution in the root zzso These effects are specific for zzso since zzso blocked the above actions, and the aggravated effects triggered by zzso plus zzso were zzso reversed when carbon monoxide zzso or zzso zzso two zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Together, the results suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso stress by zzso zzso zzso
