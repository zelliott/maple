zzso response zzso proteins zzso are a family of zzso zzso that consist of 5 members zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso outgrowth by binding to zzso zzso resulting in the assembly of zzso zzso also mediates the growth cone collapse response to the repulsive guidance zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso signaling and its function in the developing mouse brain remain zzso We generated zzso mice in order to study the in zzso function of zzso and identified a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We also observed increased zzso branching in cultured zzso zzso zzso as well as in cultured cortical zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso extension and branching of the zzso of zzso zzso however, these zzso were compromised in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso and that this is partly dependent on zzso zzso
