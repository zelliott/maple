Within the first 72 h of the interaction between zzso and their host plants, zzso zzso induction and infection zzso We predicted that zzso profiling of early stages of the zzso between zzso zzso roots and zzso zzso would identify regulated plant genes that likely condition key events in zzso zzso zzso using a zzso with about 6,000 zzso we compared transcripts from zzso and zzso roots corresponding to defined stages between 1 and 72 h post zzso zzso Hundreds of genes of both known and unknown function were significantly regulated at these time zzso Four stages of the interaction were recognized based on gene expression profiles, and potential marker genes for these stages were zzso Some genes that were regulated zzso during stages I (1 zzso and II zzso zzso of the interaction belong to families zzso proteins involved in calcium transport and zzso zzso oxygen zzso and zzso and cell wall zzso Genes involved in cell proliferation were found to be zzso during stages III zzso zzso and IV zzso zzso Many genes that are zzso of defense response genes were zzso during stage I but zzso later, likely zzso infection thread progression into the root zzso Additionally, genes zzso involved in signal zzso and zzso regulation were found to be zzso regulated in the zzso roots at each time zzso The findings shed light on the complexity of coordinated gene regulation and will be useful for continued dissection of the early steps in zzso
