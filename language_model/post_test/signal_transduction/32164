During development neural crest derived zzso Cell zzso precursors migrate to nerve trunks and populate nascent zzso zzso zzso by SC is a prerequisite for normal nerve function and the integrity of zzso as well as zzso zzso To provide adequate support functions, SC colonize entire zzso One important prerequisite for this is their migration into zzso zzso zzso 

Here, we studied the role of zzso cell line derived zzso factor zzso a zzso related growth factor, for SC zzso To this end we used a superior cervical zzso zzso zzso migration zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and a chemical inhibitor for zzso signaling in combination with zzso zzso We found that zzso signaling is zzso for SC migration along zzso embryonic sympathetic zzso Furthermore, in zzso analyzes revealed that SC migration along the zzso nerve is also not dependent on zzso 

In contrast to previous in zzso findings in the zzso nerve and a SC precursor cell line, our results clearly indicate that zzso is zzso for embryonic SC zzso This is demonstrated for the sympathetic nervous system and also for the zzso nerve in zzso
