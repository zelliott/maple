The G protein coupled zzso zzso zzso reveals some specific molecular and zzso zzso zzso interaction has been zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso the construction of zzso zzso and molecular zzso Major results of these studies will be zzso The zzso of the zzso is mainly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso that are derived from the ground structure of zzso bind the zzso at distinct sites partly zzso with the zzso binding zzso zzso are able to couple to different G zzso with a subsequent stimulation of zzso zzso zzso In dependence on G protein zzso zzso can zzso zzso or zzso zzso Some evidence is provided that zzso are also present in form of zzso or zzso complexes at the cell zzso The affinity of the zzso for zzso is strongly dependent on the presence of zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol that both act like positive zzso zzso While the zzso state of the zzso for zzso requires zzso zzso and cholesterol, the zzso state for zzso is only dependent on a sufficient amount of zzso zzso affects zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since the zzso of the zzso has never been zzso alternative methods to study the zzso in its native environment are zzso Promising strategies for the zzso zzso of the zzso will be zzso The employment of diverse reporter molecules introduced at different positions within the zzso might allow us in the near future to measure zzso changes of the zzso in its native zzso zzso
