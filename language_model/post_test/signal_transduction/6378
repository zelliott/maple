During liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become active, a transformation that is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and overproduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso are potential strategies to block the zzso of zzso for the prevention and treatment of liver zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are dramatically diminished in parallel with zzso zzso zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We demonstrated recently that zzso the yellow zzso in curry, inhibited zzso zzso in zzso reducing cell zzso inducing zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Further studies indicated that zzso induced the gene expression of zzso and zzso its activity in activated zzso in zzso which was required for zzso to inhibit zzso zzso The aims of the present study were to evaluate the roles of zzso zzso in the induction of zzso and suppression of zzso gene expression by zzso in activated zzso and to zzso the underlying zzso Our results demonstrated that blocking zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso on the induction of zzso and zzso of the expression of zzso genes in activated zzso in zzso Further experiments demonstrated that zzso suppressed the gene expression of zzso zzso growth zzso receptors and interrupted the zzso zzso zzso in activated zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity in activated zzso in zzso which was required for zzso to reduce cell zzso induce zzso and suppress zzso gene zzso These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The characteristics of zzso which has no adverse health effects, make it a potential candidate for prevention and treatment of zzso zzso
