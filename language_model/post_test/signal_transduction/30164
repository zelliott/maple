We studied the regulation of zzso body zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso by investigating culture conditions to zzso zzso body size, which we found was affected by the zzso ratio zzso zzso in the culture zzso zzso the nitrogen source or decreasing the zzso ratio from 38 to 9 induced the appearance of zzso bodies with diameters less than 2-3 zzso zzso which are usually found at a zzso ratio of 38 in this zzso To determine factors regulating zzso body size, we compared zzso body zzso from zzso cells cultured at different zzso zzso We found some differences in zzso profiles between zzso body zzso from zzso cells cultured at different zzso ratios for 2 days when the zzso bodies were enlarged at a zzso ratio of zzso We then compared the zzso of zzso body zzso since protein zzso plays a pivotal role in various aspects of signal zzso In zzso zzso in the zzso body fraction indicated that protein zzso activity toward zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso basic protein increased in the zzso body fraction at a zzso ratio of zzso Further analysis by zzso protein zzso zzso indicated the presence of at least three activated protein zzso with molecular masses of 75, 72, and 42 zzso which were also zzso These results indicate the presence of zzso protein zzso and increased zzso in zzso bodies, which correlate with the appearance of smaller zzso bodies in this zzso Further studies to characterize these protein zzso at the molecular level should provide new insights into the link between zzso sensing and zzso zzso
