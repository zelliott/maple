Discovery of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paved the way for zzso discoveries in the growing family of zzso zzso zzso is a field that is broadening our view of the molecular world to include a wide variety of zzso zzso signaling zzso Many of these lipids will undoubtedly provide new insights into old questions while others will provide broad platforms for new zzso J Michael Walker's last 8 years were dedicated to this search and he lived long enough to see 54 novel lipids isolated from biological zzso in his zzso Here, we zzso the zzso metabolism and biological activity of two of the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and introduce four additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of these compounds is found throughout the body at differing levels suggesting zzso functionality and at least four of the zzso zzso are regulated by the zzso fatty acid zzso zzso The family of zzso zzso presented here is merely a sampling of what is to come in the continuing discovery of novel zzso zzso
