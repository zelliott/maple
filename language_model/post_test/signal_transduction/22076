The zzso gene zzso was identified as a tumor zzso zzso which is zzso in familial zzso zzso zzso an zzso predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acting as a negative regulator of the nuclear factor zzso zzso signaling zzso by removing zzso zzso chains from zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso in zzso signaling in human zzso zzso zzso cells, we first studied the expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was lower in zzso both at protein and zzso levels compared to the surrounding zzso zzso In order to further study the role of zzso in the zzso sensitivity of zzso cells, zzso was specifically zzso in zzso cell lines via zzso zzso The specific zzso of zzso resulted in increased resistance towards treatment with zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreased the sensitivity towards tumor necrosis zzso zzso The zzso zzso also led to the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in enhanced zzso activity in zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso expression was triggered by the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso as well as by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso In zzso we show that zzso is zzso in human zzso and is involved in the zzso resistance of zzso zzso Our data identify the zzso of zzso expression as an attractive approach for overcoming resistance to treatment in zzso
