The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso human zzso virus zzso infection and cancer zzso The signal zzso and zzso trafficking of zzso are involved in these functions, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that the zzso formed a complex with the zzso protein zzso in a zzso manner in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso The zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso with the full-length and the zzso fragments of zzso zzso 1 but not with the zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso 1, thereby suggesting an interaction between the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso This interaction was confirmed by zzso microscopic reconstructions showing zzso of these two proteins in the internal zzso after zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso of zzso with zzso interference zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso of zzso signal regulated zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso expressing zzso and of zzso T cells was inhibited by the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso infection in zzso zzso cells was inhibited by the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso appears to interact with zzso and plays an important role in zzso signaling and trafficking and zzso zzso
