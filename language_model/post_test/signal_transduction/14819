G zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso primarily occurs through the zzso of zzso factors by zzso This requires zzso of an zzso signal via scaffold proteins that can ultimately determine the outcome by binding signaling zzso and adapter proteins with effects on the target zzso factor and locus of zzso By investigating these mechanisms, we have zzso how zzso zzso cells decode an input zzso signal into coherent zzso output from the zzso zzso gene zzso We show that zzso activates zzso and multiple members of the zzso family, zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso and zzso Using zzso point zzso and chemical zzso we identified that zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 specifically acts as a scaffold for a focal zzso complex comprised of zzso zzso and zzso that zzso an zzso signal to the zzso The locus of action of zzso was specifically mapped to early growth zzso zzso DNA binding sites within the zzso zzso gene zzso promoter, which was also activated by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed as the zzso factor target of zzso and zzso by blockade of protein zzso zzso activity, and DNA zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso that specifically regulates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter, and thus provide insight into the molecular mechanisms required for differential regulation of zzso gene zzso
