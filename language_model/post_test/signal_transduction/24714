Complete T cell zzso requires at least two zzso The first is delivered through the zzso T cell zzso whereas the second is generated by zzso interactions through zzso molecules of T cells and zzso cells and/or by zzso produced by zzso zzso The delivery of the two signals results in gene transcription, zzso zzso expression of new cell surface molecules including zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso agents were shown to act at different subsequent stages of T cell zzso and zzso Among zzso compounds, those which can enhance T cell responses are likely to zzso or replace the second signal in T cell zzso or zzso to act at later stages such as zzso zzso zzso zzso expression or response to zzso zzso For the purpose of in zzso evaluation of the activity of zzso on the second signal of T cell zzso we devised a model of accessory cell depletion and zzso This model allows the capacity of a given compound to enhance surface zzso zzso expression or to trigger zzso zzso synthesis to be tested, and these effects to be assessed on T cell zzso
