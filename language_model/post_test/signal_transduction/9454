zzso penile zzso is under the control of multiple factors and signaling zzso Although zzso signaling is implicated in normal and abnormal penile erection, the exact role and the underlying mechanism for zzso signaling in penile physiology remain zzso Here we report that zzso stress leads to increased zzso release from zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso zzso is a key zzso required for the production of elevated zzso from zzso released by zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso elevated zzso functions through the zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate the zzso signaling cascade and subsequent increased zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso These in zzso studies led us to discover further that zzso was induced during sustained penile zzso and contributes to zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso via zzso signaling in intact zzso Finally, we demonstrate that lowering zzso in zzso mice or genetic deletion of zzso in zzso mice significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent impaired penile zzso featured with the reduction of ratio of zzso zzso pressure to systemic zzso pressure from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively (both zzso Overall, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches, our findings reveal that zzso is a novel zzso signaling via zzso zzso contributing to penile zzso via zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that this signaling zzso may be a novel therapeutic target for zzso zzso
