Our previous results showed that zzso is a potent zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Compared to the classic zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at low zzso without zzso on zzso zzso zzso is a known target for inflammation zzso Thus, we became interested in whether zzso has zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model of inflammation to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso the production of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso the zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso were enhanced by zzso zzso At zzso of less than 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner and significantly suppresses zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso and decreases the expressions of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso which indicate that zzso has zzso zzso However, zzso has no significant effect on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was involved in zzso Furthermore, our results showed that zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso activity of zzso induced by zzso which may be through suppression of zzso zzso In conclusion, our study indicates that zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso and has zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso is mainly through decreasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso thus suppressing zzso zzso and nuclear zzso
