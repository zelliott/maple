Members of the zzso growth factor zzso family induce lens zzso cells to undergo cell division and differentiate into zzso a low dose of zzso can stimulate cell proliferation (but not zzso zzso whereas higher doses of zzso are required to induce zzso zzso To determine if these cellular events are regulated by the same zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso lens cell proliferation and zzso We show that zzso induced a zzso zzso of zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso as early as 15 minutes in culture, with a high zzso dose of zzso stimulating a greater level of zzso zzso than a lower zzso zzso zzso blocking experiments using zzso (a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso is required for zzso lens cell proliferation and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso can block the zzso changes associated with zzso lens zzso zzso however, it cannot block the synthesis of some of the molecular differentiation zzso zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the in zzso distribution of the zzso zzso forms of zzso in the zzso Taken together, our data indicate that different levels of zzso zzso may be important for the regulation of lens cell proliferation and early zzso events associated with zzso zzso however, multiple zzso pathways are likely to be required for the process of lens zzso differentiation and zzso
