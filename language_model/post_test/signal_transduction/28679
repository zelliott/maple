zzso proteins play key roles in zzso signaling of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is known to inhibit zzso zzso through binding to zzso zzso Recently, an zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso were zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts zzso with zzso zzso and most strongly with zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso complex formation and zzso expression of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso may function as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso
