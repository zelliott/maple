The topography of titanium implants has been identified as an important factor affecting the zzso of surgically placed dental zzso Further modification to produce a zzso zzso titanium implant surface has been shown to increase zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to determine possible molecular mechanisms to explain this clinical observation by examining differences in the whole zzso zzso expression profile of primary human zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso titanium zzso A decrease in zzso proliferation associated with the titanium surfaces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with an increase in expression of the zzso differentiation markers zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that a number of genes associated with the zzso zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso with culture on the zzso zzso zzso was shown to have the largest fold change increase in expression which was subsequently confirmed at the protein level by zzso Several other genes associated with the functionally important mechanisms relevant to bone healing, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso These results suggest that chemical zzso modification of the zzso surface may result in more successful zzso through zzso zzso
