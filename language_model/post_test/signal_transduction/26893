zzso of the zzso tumor zzso is associated with structural and zzso zzso zzso The zzso abnormalities in zzso cells may partly result from aberrations in cell division caused by disruption of zzso during zzso Here we show that zzso is a component of the zzso that is recruited through an interaction with zzso A zzso zzso At the zzso zzso influences the recruitment of zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso zzso zzso and zzso and formation of zzso and zzso complexes during zzso zzso of these zzso interactions by zzso zzso results in increased zzso defects but has no effect on zzso zzso zzso repair of DNA zzso These findings identify a specific role for zzso in the regulation of zzso structure and function, separate from DNA damage repair, that may explain in part the zzso instability in zzso zzso
