zzso zzso allows zzso zzso analysis of single cells, making it a promising tool for drug discovery and profiling of zzso zzso To add zzso capacity to flow zzso we developed a zzso zzso technique called fluorescent cell zzso zzso In zzso each sample is labeled with a different signature, or zzso of zzso intensity and zzso zzso and mixed with other samples before zzso zzso and analysis by flow zzso Using three zzso zzso we were able to zzso and combine entire zzso plates, reducing zzso consumption zzso and acquisition time to zzso zzso per zzso Using zzso and zzso flow zzso we screened a zzso library for zzso of T zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously determining compound efficacy and zzso We also analyzed zzso signaling in multiple cell types from primary mouse zzso revealing differences in sensitivity and zzso between B cells, zzso and zzso T cells and zzso zzso
