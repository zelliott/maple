The zzso zzso DNA can prevent spontaneous zzso of B zzso However, the precise mechanisms by which zzso DNA blocks zzso remain zzso In this study, we showed B cell zzso was significantly inhibited by addition of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso DNA could reduce the expression of zzso 3, increase zzso and zzso expressions, and inhibit zzso protein expression which level was increased in B cell spontaneous zzso at 24 zzso zzso zzso activity was increased with the incubation of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso could abrogate the protection of B cell from zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso DNA were not inhibited when blocking zzso by specific inhibitor zzso while the zzso of zzso by zzso DNA could be blocked by zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso of spontaneous B cell zzso by zzso DNA was correlated to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso is zzso through zzso zzso
