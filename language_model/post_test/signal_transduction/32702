The objective of this study was to record the zzso of the smallest living zzso to extend the domain of data for comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso These data are needed to establish the relationship between the zzso zzso and heart size in zzso species of all zzso 

In recently born mice (age zzso to 8 weeks) weighing between zzso and 10 g and with estimated heart weights between 15 and 60 zzso zzso using bipolar limb zzso were recorded during general zzso The zzso zzso representing zzso transmission time was about 40 zzso which is quite long for hearts of this zzso On the basis of detailed analysis of the data, we zzso the presence of a fixed delay or zzso propagation in the zzso zzso not only in newborn mice, but in zzso of all zzso 

zzso transmission times obtained in zzso (including zzso cannot be explained on the basis of generally accepted, classic zzso zzso zzso The acceptance of the presence of a fixed delay in the zzso zzso may ultimately be of value to better understand zzso zzso function during zzso rhythm and zzso zzso
