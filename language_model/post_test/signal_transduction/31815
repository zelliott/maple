During the past half-century, zzso of breast cancer have increased zzso Various zzso and zzso been implicated in the initiation and progression of this zzso One potential environmental risk factor that has not received a lot of attention is the exposure to heavy zzso While several mechanisms have been put forth describing how high zzso of heavy metals play a role in zzso it is unclear whether zzso low-level exposure to certain heavy metals zzso cadmium and zzso can directly result in the development and progression of zzso zzso and zzso have been hypothesized to play a role in breast cancer development by acting as zzso that bind to zzso receptors and mimic the actions of zzso Since the lifetime exposure to zzso is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer, anything that mimics its activity will likely contribute to the zzso of the zzso However, heavy metals, depending on their zzso are capable of binding to a variety of proteins and may exert their zzso by zzso multiple cellular functions, complicating the analysis of whether heavy zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso The purpose of this review is to discuss the various zzso in zzso and in zzso studies that show a link between the heavy metals, cadmium and nickel, and breast cancer zzso We will particularly focus on the studies that test whether these two metals act as zzso in order to assess the strength of the data supporting this zzso
