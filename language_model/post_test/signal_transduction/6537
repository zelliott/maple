One way in which cells acquire zzso information during embryonic development is by measuring the local concentration of a signaling factor, or zzso that is zzso by an organizing center zzso The ways in which zzso zzso are established, particularly in zzso remain obscure, although various suggestions have been made for the mechanisms by which signaling molecules traverse fields of zzso These include simple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we use a functional zzso zzso to zzso long-range signaling in the zzso zzso in real zzso Our results show that the zzso family member zzso is zzso efficiently from embryonic cells, and a new method of tissue zzso allows us to investigate the way in which the zzso zzso multiple cell zzso This reveals that zzso exerts long-range effects by zzso rapidly through the zzso milieu of zzso zzso No evidence has been obtained for long-range signaling through zzso zzso zzso or zzso In demonstrating that long-range signaling in the early zzso zzso occurs by diffusion rather than by these alternative routes, our results suggest that different zzso in different zzso contexts use different means of zzso
