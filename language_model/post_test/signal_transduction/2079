zzso zzso zzso zzso has been known to mediate and zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of this substance on isolated terminal zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso the zzso of rat zzso The free zzso calcium concentration zzso of the sensory device was monitored by digital image zzso in combination with a zzso fluorescent probe, zzso Application of zzso in zzso raging from 10 zzso to 1 zzso evoked an increase in zzso in zzso cell processes covering the zzso zzso terminals as well as in round zzso of the cells protruding from the zzso In both portions, the zzso zzso zzso were slowly zzso at 10 and 20 zzso and continuous at zzso higher than 50 zzso zzso 100 zzso blocked the effect of zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso while zzso zzso was zzso These data indicate that the terminal zzso cells express zzso zzso linked with the zzso zzso zzso and that this phenomenon is involved in the zzso sensory zzso
