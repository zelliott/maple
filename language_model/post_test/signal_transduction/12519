zzso zzso plays an important role in cell growth, zzso and zzso of various zzso This signaling zzso has been shown to be frequently altered in several human zzso including zzso zzso However the role of this zzso signaling zzso has not been explored in the Middle Eastern zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso we investigated zzso genetic zzso such as zzso amplification, zzso zzso zzso protein loss and their relationships with various zzso characteristics in 156 zzso 

Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso technique and DNA sequencing were used to analyze zzso amplification and zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso amplification was seen in 54 of 152 zzso zzso cases zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso and with the proliferation marker zzso 

Our data showed mutual zzso between the molecular event of zzso amplification and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso which suggests that each of these zzso may individually be sufficient to drive zzso tumor zzso zzso High prevalence of genetic zzso in zzso zzso in a Middle Eastern zzso zzso provides genetic evidence supporting the notion that zzso zzso pathways play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
