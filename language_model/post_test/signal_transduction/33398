We have characterized signaling pathways involving the related zzso focal zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso or zzso in zzso human zzso zzso Stem cell factor, which zzso the growth of zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso zzso which causes differentiation of zzso cell lines, induced the zzso zzso of zzso but not of focal zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with stem cell factor resulted in an increase in the zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso under these conditions was zzso by a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso D, which zzso the zzso abolished the zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso zzso and stem cell factor zzso indicating that zzso association with the zzso zzso appears to be critical for its zzso In addition, we observed an association of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso were shown to bind directly through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso inhibited significantly the zzso zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso might play an important role in the zzso of signaling pathways within the focal zzso and that zzso zzso in signaling events that link signals from the cell surface to the zzso Furthermore, this study suggests that zzso might be involved in zzso proliferation and zzso
