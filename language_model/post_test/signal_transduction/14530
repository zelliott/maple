The zzso protein has been implicated in multiple biological functions including regulation of gene transcription, zzso trafficking, cellular growth and zzso However, the cellular signals that control zzso functions are zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso during zzso differentiation in both human zzso tissue and reconstructed zzso skin zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso early differentiation of human zzso zzso indicating an essential and downstream role for zzso in this zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso promotes expression of zzso and zzso 10 in zzso under low calcium conditions, while zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso and zzso 10 zzso Previous work has established that the zzso gene is controlled by a zzso promoter that harbors a zzso zzso Here we show that both calcium and zzso activate zzso stimulate zzso of zzso and augment the activity of the zzso promoter in a manner dependent on its zzso zzso zzso of calcium from zzso stores with zzso an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso free zzso without zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso Taken together, these data suggest that an zzso calcium store independent zzso signaling zzso zzso early zzso differentiation through zzso of zzso
