In biological systems, chemical activity takes place in zzso and zzso compartments that constantly change in shape and zzso These ever-changing cellular compartments zzso chemical zzso and we demonstrate that the rates of such incorporated reactions are directly affected by the ongoing shape zzso First, we show that the rate of product formation in an zzso reaction can be regulated by simple volume zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may regulate the dynamics of interior reaction pathways zzso the zzso zzso by volume zzso We then show the effect of shape changes on reactions occurring in more complex and structured systems by using zzso networks composed of zzso compartments joined together by zzso Chemical activity was measured by implementing an zzso zzso zzso During ongoing zzso the network connectivity is changed suddenly zzso to the dynamic tube zzso found inside zzso zzso for example), and the effect on the reaction is zzso We show that zzso properties of the zzso system are extremely sensitive to sudden changes in network zzso and that chemical reactions can be zzso or zzso in certain zzso as a function of zzso
