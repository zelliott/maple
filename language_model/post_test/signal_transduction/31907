We previously interrogated the zzso in heart tissue from zzso mice, a mouse model of zzso caused by zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and found that the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso branches of the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso were zzso zzso prior to the onset of significant cardiac zzso We have now used an alternative gene expression analysis tool to zzso this zzso and identify zzso of a third branch of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of hearts from zzso mice showed enhanced zzso zzso prior to and after the onset of heart disease as well as in hearts from human subjects with zzso caused by zzso zzso Treatment of zzso mice with the zzso inhibitor zzso prevented left zzso zzso and deterioration of fractional zzso compared with zzso mice but did not block the expression of collagen genes involved in cardiac zzso These results demonstrate that three different branches of the zzso zzso signaling zzso with overlapping consequences are involved in the zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso They further suggest that pharmacological zzso of zzso may be useful in the treatment of this zzso
