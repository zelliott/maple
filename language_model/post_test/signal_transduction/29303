zzso zzso zzso zzso cousin of zzso was previously shown to inhibit pressure zzso cardiac zzso zzso with an increase in zzso function and zzso zzso The combined analyses of zzso zzso pull-down experiments and mass zzso enabled us to determine that zzso directly interacts with muscle zzso protein zzso via its zzso half zzso It was also shown that zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso is known to play a role in zzso zzso to the zzso in the zzso which is critical for zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso zzso zzso therefore, suggested that zzso may affect zzso signaling through its interaction with zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso or more specifically zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, pressure zzso zzso of zzso target genes was significantly diminished in the hearts of zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso with zzso interactions in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was displaced from the zzso zzso with an zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in the hearts of zzso transgenic zzso zzso of zzso restored the zzso responses and the increase in zzso zzso activity that was inhibited by zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso inhibited cardiac zzso to an extent that was comparable to that of full-length zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso cardiac zzso largely by zzso regulating zzso signaling via disruption of the zzso zzso
