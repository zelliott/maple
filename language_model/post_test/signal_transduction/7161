The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of family B G zzso receptors zzso is a major drug target in zzso due to its regulatory effect on zzso zzso zzso The zzso controlling zzso zzso signaling are far from fully zzso A fundamental mechanism controlling the signaling capacity of zzso is the zzso trafficking of receptors between recycling and zzso zzso Here, we combined zzso with novel real-time zzso to monitor both zzso trafficking and signaling in living zzso We find that the human zzso zzso rapidly and with similar zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso and the stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in mouse pancreatic zzso zzso is shown to be a recycling zzso with faster recycling rates zzso by zzso as compared to zzso and zzso Furthermore, a prolonged cycling of zzso zzso was observed and is suggested to be correlated with a prolonged zzso zzso
