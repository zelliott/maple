The zzso zzso of zzso coli encodes a zzso zzso zzso This system regulates gene expression in response to external C 4 zzso During entry into stationary phase zzso bacteria express genes that impart cellular resistance to environmental zzso In zzso coli , 50 or more genes are triggered by zzso factor ( zzso s ) during entry into stationary zzso zzso zzso and zzso integrated zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso is positively regulated during growth zzso Many genes that are required for zzso adaptation are controlled by zzso a zzso alternative zzso factor, whose expression is, in turn, controlled by many zzso To understand whether the zzso is dependent upon zzso a zzso zzso strain was zzso beta zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis reported that the generated zzso zzso strain and the wild type showed the same expression during stationary zzso Surprisingly, the growth zzso of the expression of zzso is still present in zzso zzso strain suggesting that other zzso regulatory mechanisms zzso be the zzso system or zzso in addition to zzso may control zzso zzso zzso
