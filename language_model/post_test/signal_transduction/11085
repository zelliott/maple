The potential zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to be a major component in the development of insulin zzso Increased levels of zzso correlate with insulin resistance in both obese and diabetic patients, but this relationship does not exist in endurance trained zzso zzso This may be, in part, related to differences in the gene expression and activities of key zzso involved in fatty acid transport and zzso as well as in the zzso status of the zzso in zzso patients as compared with zzso zzso zzso in fat and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle have been shown to activate protein zzso C zzso which acts on several downstream zzso zzso including the insulin and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, an increased zzso of zzso may reduce insulin sensitivity by increasing zzso which is known to increase the expression of zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso A common characteristic observed when zzso both zzso and zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and subsequently an zzso of its zzso of downstream zzso zzso These may be important players in the development of insulin resistance and understanding their zzso and expression in both obese and zzso humans should assist in understanding how and why zzso become zzso
