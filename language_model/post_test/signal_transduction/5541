zzso signaling at target zzso is essential for growth and development and for normal zzso of zzso fat, and protein zzso Control over this process is therefore tightly zzso It can be achieved by a negative feedback control mechanism zzso downstream components inhibit upstream elements along the zzso zzso zzso or by signals from apparently unrelated pathways that inhibit insulin signaling thus leading to insulin zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins on zzso zzso has emerged as a key step in these control processes under both zzso and pathological zzso The list of zzso zzso implicated in the development of insulin resistance is growing zzso zzso with the list of potential zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso Here, we review a range of conditions that activate zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins on zzso zzso zzso The flexibility zzso specificity features of this reaction is discussed and its characteristic as an zzso zzso is zzso Finally, its implications on insulin zzso insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, an emerging epidemic of the 21st century are zzso
