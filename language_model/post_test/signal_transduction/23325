zzso and zzso are important zzso factors during zzso zzso however, the potential mechanisms of their zzso in zzso remain zzso We found that zzso and zzso are abundant in zzso zzso of 3- and zzso pigs at the zzso and protein zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increases to the peak at Day 2 and then zzso In contrast, zzso is lowest on Day 2 and gradually zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso enhances or zzso zzso zzso and zzso maker zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion causes a mild decrease of zzso protein level, and zzso interference also zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso promotes zzso zzso at Day 8, and increases the zzso markers during differentiation in comparison with the controls and the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso binds to zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso In conclusion, the results suggest that zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso possibly through zzso feedback regulatory loop and zzso protein zzso
