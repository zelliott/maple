Spinal and zzso muscular zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease caused by an abnormal expansion of a tandem zzso repeat in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso gene that results in an zzso long zzso tract zzso in the zzso zzso As a result, the zzso zzso zzso zzso forming zzso and nuclear zzso in the affected zzso zzso only appears to be associated with the formation of nuclear zzso Thus, improved zzso zzso zzso which indirectly decreases zzso nuclear zzso has beneficial effects on affected zzso In addition, increased zzso clearance contributes to maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso preventing the zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways that might play a role in the zzso in zzso The expression of heat shock protein B8 zzso a member of the small heat shock protein family, is highly induced in surviving zzso of patients affected by zzso diseases, where it seems to participate in the stress response aimed at cell zzso We report here that zzso zzso the zzso removal of zzso zzso species of zzso In addition, though zzso does not influence zzso and zzso zzso key zzso zzso zzso it does prevent zzso bodies formation, and restores the normal zzso flux in these zzso Interestingly, zzso a well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might act as one of the molecular zzso of the zzso activity of zzso zzso these data support the hypothesis that treatments aimed at restoring a normal zzso flux that result in the more efficient clearance of zzso zzso might produce beneficial effects in zzso zzso
