Loss of immune function and increased zzso disease are among the most clinically significant consequences of zzso zzso stem cells zzso from mice lacking zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso have high rates of cell zzso Studies were designed to test the hypothesis that aging zzso zzso zzso mice develop premature zzso exhaustion, and changes leading to zzso zzso Compared to zzso aging zzso mice showed a decreased survival rate, zzso increased circulating white blood cells, zzso cell zzso in zzso and zzso Analysis of bone zzso indicated increased numbers of zzso and zzso cells, but decreased zzso zzso There was also decreased zzso capacity of zzso determined by competitive zzso and serial zzso zzso also showed increased levels of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso but decreased zzso zzso cells from aging zzso mice had abnormal expression of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in trafficking and associated with zzso zzso from zzso mice had gene changes related to zzso maintenance and consistent with zzso zzso The most prominent gene changes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso and accelerated zzso zzso analyses also indicated an enrichment of genes associated with zzso stress, acute zzso zzso aging, and heat shock response, and the zzso zzso These data indicate that loss of zzso and associated changes in multiple signaling pathways promote premature zzso exhaustion and development of a zzso zzso They also zzso a critical role of the zzso in the regulation of zzso
