The sensing of zzso zzso concentration zzso and zzso of cellular processes associated with acute or sustained changes in zzso are zzso specific and zzso by the calcium sensing zzso zzso zzso zzso requires protein zzso C zzso but the identity and role of zzso zzso in zzso responses remain zzso Here we show that high zzso activated zzso and zzso in zzso cells and in human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso and that this response correlated with the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso by acute high zzso required influx of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or - with the zzso attenuated sustained zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso site zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells showed that this site was important for zzso zzso at high zzso zzso of zzso by high zzso was not necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso in dispersed bovine zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso signal leading to regulated zzso zzso that requires zzso zzso zzso is not zzso via the zzso zzso
