The function of brown zzso tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; zzso both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in zzso efficiency can be of zzso Both the acute activity of the zzso zzso the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue zzso results in a higher zzso zzso are under the control of zzso released from sympathetic zzso In zzso zzso brown zzso tissue is essential for classical zzso zzso (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown zzso zzso as well as for the cold zzso zzso zzso Heat production from brown zzso tissue is activated whenever the zzso is in need of extra heat, zzso zzso during entry into a zzso state, and during zzso from zzso and the rate of zzso is centrally controlled via a zzso initiated in the zzso Feeding as such also results in zzso of brown zzso zzso a series of zzso apparently all characterized by being low in zzso result in a zzso recruitment of the zzso this zzso zzso is also under zzso zzso When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and zzso are zzso in the zzso The development of brown zzso tissue with its characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso was probably zzso for the evolutionary success of zzso as its zzso enhances zzso survival and allows for active life even in cold zzso
