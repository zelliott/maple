zzso zzso receptors are primary zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso These receptors zzso rapidly following zzso zzso but the functional significance of this process is zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso and signaling in zzso cells and cultured zzso zzso using real-time zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors promoted zzso of receptors with a time course overlapping that of acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blunted acute zzso zzso signaling in both zzso cells and zzso slice zzso Although zzso zzso markedly attenuated acute zzso zzso zzso the subsequent recycling of receptors had no zzso Further, zzso receptors localized in close proximity to zzso zzso G protein and zzso zzso immediately after zzso Together, these results suggest a previously unanticipated role of zzso and the early zzso pathway, in supporting rapid zzso zzso
