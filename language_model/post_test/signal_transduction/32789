zzso are a family of zzso peptides affecting zzso migration during the inflammatory zzso zzso modification of zzso has been shown to affect their biological zzso Here, the isolation and identification of natural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso gamma and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso tumor cells produced predominantly intact zzso forms, whereas peripheral blood zzso zzso mainly zzso truncated zzso The order of zzso zzso potency of these zzso zzso was zzso alpha zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso both for intact and truncated zzso However, truncated zzso alpha zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso were zzso fivefold and zzso more active than the corresponding intact zzso As a consequence, truncated zzso alpha zzso was zzso more potent than intact zzso indicating that both the type of zzso and its mode of processing determine the zzso zzso Similar observations were made when intact and truncated zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso were compared for their capacity to induce an increase in the zzso calcium concentration in zzso zzso and to zzso the calcium response towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It must be concluded that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in general enhances the inflammatory response, whereas for zzso zzso zzso processing mostly results in reduced zzso zzso
