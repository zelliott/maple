The stimulation of cell proliferation by insulin like growth factor IGF-1 has previously been shown to depend on zzso of zzso gated zzso zzso The signaling involved in zzso of zzso gated zzso channel zzso includes the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso dependent protein zzso zzso and the serum and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, nothing is known about mechanisms zzso the stimulation of zzso by zzso Most recently, zzso has been shown to zzso and thus zzso the zzso zzso zzso The present study has been performed to explore whether the regulation of zzso involves zzso To this end zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso with or without zzso of zzso and/or zzso active zzso In zzso expressing zzso but not in water injected zzso zzso from a holding potential of zzso zzso to zzso zzso triggers rapidly zzso currents typical for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhances the currents zzso The effects of either zzso or of zzso are zzso by destruction of the respective zzso zzso zzso or zzso Further experiments revealed that wild type zzso and zzso and to a lesser extent zzso are similarly effective in stimulating zzso in both, presence and absence of zzso It is concluded that zzso is zzso by zzso and stimulates by zzso zzso and zzso The data thus disclose a novel mechanism of zzso channel zzso
