zzso zzso immunity requires both the zzso and the migration of specific T cells to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in the initiation of zzso zzso We investigated the possibility that zzso may also regulate migration of primed T cells to target zzso In zzso zzso signals enhanced zzso zzso migration, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso T cells bearing a zzso in the zzso zzso domain, which abrogates zzso zzso displayed normal zzso expansion but defective zzso to zzso sites following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation led to zzso memory zzso migration to zzso zzso which occurred independently of zzso zzso zzso signals and zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso and zzso signals exert opposite effects on zzso trafficking in zzso These findings highlight a novel zzso function of zzso that has crucial implications for the therapeutic manipulation of this and other zzso zzso
