Recent studies suggested that nuclear factor zzso B zzso plays a key role in the zzso of zzso zzso This study investigated whether zzso zzso zzso progressive zzso damage in zzso zzso injury and its zzso 

Adult male rats were zzso and treated with one of the following for 4 weeks: vehicle zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in drinking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in drinking solution and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by zzso The activity of zzso was measured by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were measured by Western zzso and real-time zzso and zzso and zzso were measured by zzso 

zzso that received zzso zzso exhibited hypertension and severe zzso zzso Renal cortical zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and collagen IV, protein expression of zzso and zzso and zzso binding activity were significantly zzso in rats that received zzso zzso Treatment with zzso significantly decreased the percentage of cells positive for zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and collagen IV, and protein levels of zzso and zzso were also inhibited by zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso signal zzso plays a role in the progression of zzso zzso zzso
