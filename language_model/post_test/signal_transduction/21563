The protein zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso has been extensively documented with regard to its membrane zzso potential, as well as its efficient delivery of zzso in zzso However, the majority of zzso and zzso molecules zzso to the nucleus rather than to the zzso after zzso due to the functional nuclear zzso sequence zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was deliberately designed to ensure the efficient zzso delivery of the zzso zzso In comparison with zzso zzso and its fusion partners exhibited a clear preference for zzso zzso and also markedly enhanced membrane zzso zzso Unlike the mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs independently of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to be much more efficient than zzso in the zzso of the zzso properties of zzso suggesting that zzso functional molecules can be more efficiently targeted by zzso zzso In in zzso trafficking studies, zzso zzso exhibited unique organ zzso to the liver and zzso zzso when zzso injected into mice, whereas zzso exhibited no such zzso Taken together, our findings zzso zzso as a novel delivery zzso appropriate for zzso molecular targeting to zzso compartments in zzso zzso the development of class zzso zzso vaccines, and zzso special drug delivery in zzso without causing any zzso effects on nuclear genetic zzso
