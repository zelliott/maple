We have identified and characterized two genes in zzso whose products are required for activated zzso to signal with normal efficiency, but do not appear to effect signaling by activated zzso One encodes the beta zzso of type I zzso zzso a zzso zzso essential for targeting zzso to the plasma zzso The other encodes a protein zzso that we have named zzso zzso of zzso zzso By genetic criteria, we show that zzso functions in multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso of zzso that, together with the zzso zzso define a novel class of zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a general and zzso zzso component of the zzso signaling zzso that acts between zzso and zzso
