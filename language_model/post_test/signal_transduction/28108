zzso precursor cells in the developing zzso require activity of the sonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways for growth and zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling pathways are implicated in the zzso tumor zzso Here, we describe a mechanism through which these disparate signaling pathways cooperate to promote proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling drives expression of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for expansion of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein via zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The effects of zzso activity on zzso stabilization are zzso by zzso growth factor, a zzso zzso with roles in central nervous system precursor growth and zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso signaling pathways zzso on zzso to regulate zzso precursor cell cycle zzso Furthermore, they provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of zzso signaling in zzso
