Nuclear factor zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso factor whose function is regulated by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso activity is diminished in zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kirshenbaum, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In view of the growing evidence that the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso plays a critical role in suppressing zzso we zzso whether this region accounts for the underlying effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of human embryonic zzso cells with full length zzso resulted in a significant zzso reduction in zzso activity zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in DNA binding and zzso increase in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso control zzso In contrast, no significant change in zzso activity was detected with either a zzso domain deletion zzso zzso zzso or zzso domain point substitution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a small zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity was noted with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso may not be critical for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso delivery of an zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso impaired the ability of zzso to suppress zzso provoked by zzso plus zzso in zzso zzso The data provide the first evidence for the regulation of zzso by zzso through a mechanism that requires the zzso zzso domain that links zzso to the zzso signaling zzso for suppression of zzso
