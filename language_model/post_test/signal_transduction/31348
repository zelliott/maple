The zzso of host cell zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso invasion has been reported by some authors, while other workers claim that it instead zzso zzso of the zzso In this study we aimed at zzso the basis of this zzso We performed experiments with zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains G and zzso which differ markedly in zzso and enter target cells by engaging the surface molecules zzso and zzso respectively, which have signaling zzso Treatment of zzso cells with the zzso drug zzso D or zzso B inhibited the invasion by strain G but not the invasion by strain zzso In contrast to cells penetrated by strain zzso which were previously shown to have a disrupted zzso zzso architecture, no such zzso was observed in zzso cells invaded by strain G, and zzso were found to be closely associated with target cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso coli zzso which recruits host cell zzso for zzso drastically reduced entry of strain zzso into zzso cells but not entry of strain zzso In contrast to zzso in its zzso form, which zzso disruption of zzso and zzso zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso molecules promoted an increase in zzso zzso by zzso zzso These data, plus the finding that drugs that interfere with zzso cell signaling zzso affect the zzso of zzso forms of strains G and zzso indicate that the host cell invasion zzso by zzso is associated with signaling events that favor zzso zzso in contrast to zzso invasion, which triggers the signaling pathways leading to zzso of zzso
