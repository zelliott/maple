The zzso zzso in the zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso gene results in a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso domain of zzso causing zzso dominant Parkinson's disease zzso We hypothesized the zzso alters cellular zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and might be zzso in zzso other than in the zzso We therefore compared total levels and zzso of the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in extracts of zzso isolated from patients with zzso carrying the zzso zzso healthy zzso carriers, patients with idiopathic zzso and healthy zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was reduced significantly in cell extracts from patients with zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso Similarly, zzso was reduced significantly in zzso and zzso in the group of healthy carriers of the zzso as well as in patients with idiopathic zzso zzso reductions in total zzso were also observed in these three groups compared to the zzso The results of this pilot project therefore indicate significant zzso in key zzso proteins in zzso from patients with zzso and were most pronounced in zzso zzso Changes in zzso may thus be common to zzso zzso regardless of zzso Such changes may also be shown in blood samples during the zzso stage of zzso zzso which could be particularly important for the development of zzso strategies to delay zzso or slow progression of zzso
