Research on aging shows that regulatory pathways of fertility and zzso are closely zzso However, evolutionary theories on social species propose that lifelong care for offspring can shape the course of zzso beyond the restricted context of zzso zzso These observations suggest that control circuits of aging are remodeled in social organisms with continuing care for zzso Here, we studied a circuit of aging in the honey bee zzso zzso The bee is characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso queen zzso and a zzso zzso of female workers that are zzso zzso care zzso We focus on the role of the zzso zzso precursor gene zzso that, in zzso zzso shortens lifespan as a downstream element of the zzso growth factor signaling zzso zzso protein is zzso at high levels in honey bee queens and is abundant in zzso zzso We establish that zzso gene activity protects worker bees from zzso zzso Our finding suggests that one zzso explanation for patterns of longevity in bees is that a zzso regulatory zzso has been remodeled to extend zzso This perspective is of considerable relevance to research on longevity regulation that builds largely on zzso from solitary model zzso
