We have previously demonstrated the presence of active zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its involvement in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso however, the mechanism of zzso zzso was not zzso We show here that the zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso II or by zzso acid, two zzso which activate specific zzso receptors zzso or by directly zzso protein zzso A using zzso This zzso occurs in zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso and a zzso We also show that the zzso is activated in zzso incubated under in zzso zzso conditions, without any added zzso but not in zzso medium or when zzso is zzso Despite the fact that zzso is activated in zzso zzso this state is not sufficient to induce the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso is zzso during zzso via zzso zzso while further zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso is required in order to induce the zzso zzso The zzso reaction can be induced by zzso via the zzso of the zzso by a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
