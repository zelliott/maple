Although budding zzso cell biology and zzso provided a powerful system to isolate zzso checkpoint zzso initial studies relied on a zzso not likely to be relevant in higher zzso The first zzso were isolated for their inability to restrain zzso zzso zzso in zzso Since most zzso do not assemble zzso until zzso the zzso of this approach might have been zzso However, these early studies were designed with a highly valid assumption in mind; that checkpoints have a variety of targets, but comprise zzso zzso zzso that make up these signaling zzso The task that lies ahead is to determine targets of the zzso checkpoint relevant to zzso One step forward might be the realization that the budding zzso zzso checkpoint prevents loss of sister zzso cohesion while DNA replication is zzso If this mechanism is zzso in zzso it could prove vital for zzso segregation zzso
