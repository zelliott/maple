zzso are plant hormones that regulate both zzso and zzso plant zzso zzso were initially identified as zzso signaling zzso In the present work, the tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso was cloned and its role in zzso signaling and plant physiology assessed by generating zzso zzso zzso zzso plants were generated by zzso zzso Lines with different levels of zzso zzso by zzso selected and their zzso zzso Lines exhibiting reduced zzso levels displayed increased shoot zzso reduced plant zzso increased number of zzso and excessive zzso root zzso In addition, these lines exhibited zzso zzso such as smaller flowers, zzso as well as fewer and smaller seeds per zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso loading to the zzso sap is possibly restricted to zzso zzso by zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in lines with a relatively mild reduction in zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso dominance and fruit yield were only mildly zzso This demonstrates that reduction of zzso zzso could be a suitable tool in zzso weed zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso are involved in even more zzso processes than so far zzso
