zzso zzso gene zzso via the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be dependent upon zzso zzso zzso expression in human breast cancer zzso We have investigated the zzso heat shock protein zzso as a zzso of zzso between the zzso and the zzso signal zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso activity was determined by transient zzso zzso using a zzso expression zzso zzso gene expression was inhibited when the zzso expression zzso was zzso with a zzso reporter zzso However, zzso of zzso did not block induction of an zzso reporter zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso signaling through its ability to squelch zzso two zzso expressing protein products that bind zzso were zzso into zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso an zzso deletion zzso that does not bind DNA, and zzso the zzso domain of human zzso both led to increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso distribution of zzso was investigated in human breast cancer cell zzso These studies showed zzso to be primarily zzso in zzso cell lines, whereas in matched zzso cell lines zzso was distributed equally between the zzso and zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso can regulate zzso activity in zzso and that zzso is dependent upon cellular zzso content through a mechanism that involves zzso
