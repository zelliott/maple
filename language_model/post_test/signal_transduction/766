zzso differentiation during development is a zzso process, which requires zzso communication between zzso and zzso zzso Cell surface interactions can induce the assembly of synaptic zzso but maintenance and growth of zzso depend on zzso zzso zzso responses associated with synaptic differentiation are observed in central and peripheral zzso and depend on retrograde signals coming from the target zzso Although the identity of most of the retrograde signaling pathways remains to be identified, the zzso family of growth factors have emerged as one crucial signal at the zzso zzso Here, we discuss evidence for zzso control during synaptic differentiation and the signaling pathways zzso retrograde zzso zzso
