The role of the zzso box class O zzso zzso factor in breast cancer migration and invasion is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso and zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells while zzso opposite effects in zzso cells and in zzso zzso cell lines, demonstrating that the nuclear zzso represents a crucial switch in zzso control of breast cancer cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso events were paralleled by a significant induction of zzso zzso an essential constituent of zzso zzso associated to tumor invasion and zzso zzso induction occurs at the zzso level through zzso binding to a zzso responsive core sequence located at position zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly emphasized zzso effects on cell migration and invasion, while zzso and zzso zzso were able to reverse them, demonstrating that both proteins are pivotal zzso of these zzso controlled zzso In zzso an zzso analysis on tissue sections from patients with zzso or zzso invasive breast zzso or in zzso zzso zzso showed that nuclear zzso zzso zzso or directly zzso correlated with the invasive zzso of breast zzso In conclusion, zzso role in breast cancer zzso and invasion depends on zzso status, disclosing a novel aspect of the well-established zzso zzso Therefore zzso might become a zzso target to be suitably exploited in combination therapies either in zzso or zzso breast zzso
