Severe acute zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and tissue necrosis but the zzso zzso mechanisms regulating organ injury in the zzso remain zzso zzso is a potent regulator of specific cellular processes zzso several zzso zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso zzso in acute zzso 

zzso was induced by infusion of zzso into the pancreatic duct in zzso zzso Animals were treated with a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso before induction of zzso 

zzso infusion caused a clear-cut increase in blood zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cell necrosis and zzso formation in the zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso were significantly increased, indicating local and systemic zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso protected against zzso For example, 5 zzso zzso reduced zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as well as tissue levels of zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso Moreover, zzso zzso decreased lung zzso by zzso and blood zzso by zzso zzso TAP levels were reduced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso cells in zzso 

Our novel data suggest that zzso zzso plays an important role in acute zzso by regulating zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso and tissue zzso Thus, these results indicate that zzso may constitute a novel target in the management of zzso
