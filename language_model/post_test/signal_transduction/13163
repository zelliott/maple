zzso zzso induce zzso behavior in genetically initiated but zzso human zzso zzso The genetic basis for such transformation is still zzso By using zzso zzso technology, we zzso zzso gene expression of transformed zzso benign zzso zzso zzso and parental zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso expressed zzso which are associated with zzso or tumor zzso One striking finding is that a significant portion of the zzso genes belongs to zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso inhibited the zzso zzso cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso and inhibited tumor growth in zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso molecules zzso with the zzso effects of zzso In addition, these genes are reported to be mapped mainly to two zzso regions, zzso and zzso which are frequently deleted in human prostate zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso with the zzso database revealed that expression of the zzso genes was zzso in approximately zzso of the 49 clinically characterized samples of zzso zzso zzso we show that there seems to be a direct link between zzso molecules and zzso tumor zzso These findings suggest zzso molecules as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of prostate zzso
