T zzso can be activated via the T cell zzso zzso or by triggering through a number of other surface structures, including the zzso zzso zzso Signaling through the zzso zzso was shown previously to be dependent on the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso also functions in T cells which express zzso lacking a functional zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso T cells that express only the zzso part of the zzso protein and thus lack a functional zzso zzso readily produce zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso expressing minimal receptors consisting of an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso segment were effectively zzso via zzso zzso For zzso zzso of zzso cells, two zzso zzso were sufficient to induce zzso when the zzso molecules were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso signaling does not necessarily employ the zzso in zzso cells and that zzso zzso in zzso cells can be zzso via two functional zzso zzso
