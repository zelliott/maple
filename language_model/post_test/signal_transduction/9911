The ability of zzso zzso to cycle between the zzso and zzso life stages in intermediate hosts is key to zzso survival and the zzso of zzso Studies from a number of laboratories indicate that differentiation in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso pathways or molecular mechanisms that control formation of the zzso zzso stage are unknown and specific zzso of differentiation have not been zzso We engineered a reporter zzso to facilitate simultaneous comparison of differentiation and replication after various zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso from the zzso promoter zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed from a zzso specific promoter zzso was used as a measure of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso of zzso zzso reduced reporter zzso replication and caused zzso zzso zzso differentiation in many other pathogens is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso dependent protein zzso and zzso zzso dependent protein zzso inhibited replication and induced zzso The zzso reporter zzso provides a method to zzso and compare agents that cause differentiation in zzso zzso
