zzso cells have the capacity to metabolize several important zzso this includes the ability to store and then metabolize zzso as well as the capacity to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is predominantly zzso via zzso to zzso although the spectrum of zzso may vary depending upon the source of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are likely to be an important zzso function of the zzso cell as these potent lipids appear to have a role in maintaining vascular tone and zzso interactions of the zzso with circulating inflammatory zzso In addition to production of zzso and zzso zzso cells metabolize zzso zzso and zzso zzso and other fatty acids such as zzso to zzso compounds zzso There is also evidence that small amounts of zzso are zzso via a zzso The zzso significance of these minor zzso pathways is not known at this zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is not a zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells is one component of the early zzso response that occurs in response to stimulation with zzso and zzso hormones or to zzso agents such as zzso and bacterial zzso A central mechanism for zzso of the relevant pathways is a rise in cellular calcium zzso that can be zzso by zzso or by direct zzso of the cell membrane to calcium zzso zzso Regulatory mechanisms zzso to the calcium signal are unknown, but current evidence suggests that calcium directly or indirectly activates zzso that release zzso from zzso and zzso a specific zzso to the immediate precursor of zzso There is evidence that protein zzso C may, in part, regulate this process, but the role of other potential regulatory zzso such as other protein zzso or zzso is not zzso As noted above, the most direct mechanism for initiation of zzso zzso and zzso release would be zzso of a zzso zzso as shown in zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the total amount of zzso released, although the magnitude of that contribution is not yet zzso In addition to generation of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso generates second zzso that are important in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso C, in response to hormonal zzso generates zzso and zzso zzso from zzso Each of these is a potent zzso second zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
