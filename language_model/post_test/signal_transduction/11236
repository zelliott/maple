Rapid assessment of immune or stem cells, which are now widely applied in the clinical setting of cancer treatment, is necessary to speed their development and to determine their zzso We have evaluated immature zzso cells zzso by zzso imaging zzso which provides detailed assessment at a single cell zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was studied by imaging analysis as well as zzso mobility shift zzso with an excellent correlation zzso over a broad range of zzso zzso zzso Imaging analysis was time saving (5 h zzso 3 zzso and required zzso to zzso less cells per zzso Single cell information revealed remarkable zzso between individual zzso and permitted detection of responses to 40 zzso of zzso In zzso activated zzso zzso responses preceded zzso responses, and the expression of both was strongly correlated in individual cells zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso correlated with the quality of zzso preparations zzso and zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso in zzso within mixed cell cultures zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that these strategies are zzso for analyses of complex zzso zzso Imaging analysis is a method that could be valuable for quality control of cell therapy zzso
