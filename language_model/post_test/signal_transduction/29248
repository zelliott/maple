zzso chromatic adaptation zzso provides zzso with the ability to shift between red and zzso zzso that are zzso for zzso of different zzso of zzso Controlled by the ratio of green to red light, this process results from differential expression of two groups of zzso many of which zzso proteins involved in zzso light harvesting antennae zzso In the freshwater species zzso zzso the inverse regulation of these two classes is complex and occurs through different zzso It also involves a zzso zzso that includes a zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso Here we uncover the mechanism through which this system controls zzso by demonstrating that zzso binds to the L Box within promoters of both classes of zzso zzso We provide functional evidence that complementary regulation of these zzso occurs by zzso simultaneous zzso and repression of zzso in red zzso We identify zzso and L zzso in the zzso of a marine zzso capable of zzso suggesting widespread use of this control zzso These results provide important insights into the long-standing zzso of zzso regulation and complete the first description of an entire zzso system controlled by a zzso zzso
