zzso zzso dysfunction is associated with increased zzso zzso deposition and reduced smooth muscle content in the corpus zzso The mechanisms of these processes are not well zzso In this study, we investigated zzso changes in the corpus zzso of rats with zzso diabetes to determine the mechanisms underlying zzso changes in penile structure and zzso Forty zzso zzso rats were randomly distributed into control and diabetic zzso Diabetes was induced by a one-time zzso injection of zzso 60 zzso Twelve weeks later, zzso function was measured by cavernous nerve zzso with real-time zzso pressure zzso The zzso was harvested for zzso examination zzso zzso zzso zzso red zzso Hart zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Western zzso Diabetes significantly attenuated zzso response to cavernous nerve zzso zzso animals exhibited a decreased smooth zzso ratio in the corpus zzso The ratio of collagen I to II fibers was significantly lower in the zzso of diabetic rats compared with zzso zzso elastic fibers were fragmented in diabetic zzso There was zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso tissue growth factor signaling zzso in diabetic zzso zzso expression was higher in smooth muscle cells and zzso of diabetic rats, as was the zzso zzso The zzso of the transforming growth factor zzso tissue growth factor signaling zzso might play an important role in zzso zzso structural changes and deterioration of zzso zzso
