The zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso blocks the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and is thereby a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso of inflammatory zzso The majority of the healthy human population has zzso against zzso that have been shown to interfere with its function in zzso The aim of this study was to define potential zzso for human zzso on the zzso zzso We also initiate the process to identify a zzso zzso zzso that is not efficiently recognized by zzso zzso zzso and retains zzso zzso 

In this paper, we panned zzso displaying zzso libraries against a pool of zzso specific zzso zzso human zzso The selected peptides could be divided into two groups of zzso The first group was the most dominant with 36 of the 48 zzso clones zzso zzso to human zzso zzso was verified by zzso for a selection of zzso sequences in zzso zzso For further analysis, one zzso was chemically zzso and zzso zzso on this zzso were found to bind the zzso zzso as studied by zzso and Surface zzso zzso Furthermore, seven potential zzso zzso responsible for zzso recognition were identified by mapping zzso selected zzso sequences on the zzso surface as defined in the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were verified by in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Single zzso introduced in the proposed zzso zzso were shown to decrease zzso binding to zzso The biological function in terms of zzso signaling was studied by flow zzso A few zzso were shown to affect this biological function as well as the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso recognized by human zzso have been mapped on the zzso surface and zzso acid zzso involved in both zzso and zzso interaction could be zzso This information has implications for the development of an effective zzso agent based on a functional zzso zzso with low interaction with human zzso
