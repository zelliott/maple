The zzso target of zzso zzso is a central element in an evolutionary zzso zzso zzso that regulates cell growth, survival and zzso orchestrating signals originating from growth factors, nutrients or particular stress zzso Two important zzso of zzso activity are the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Many studies have shown that zzso plays an important role in the biology of zzso cells, including deregulation of the cell cycle, zzso of zzso machinery and resistance to zzso zzso The development of several zzso zzso in addition to zzso has facilitated studies of the role of zzso in cancer, and verified the zzso effect of zzso zzso in many types of zzso including zzso Clinical trials of zzso derivatives in zzso patients are already in development and there are encouraging preliminary results, such as the substantial response of a subset of mantle cell zzso patients to the zzso analogue zzso Based on results obtained from in zzso and in zzso studies of the zzso zzso in zzso it seems that better understanding of zzso regulation will reveal aspects of zzso and contribute to the development of more powerful, targeted therapies for zzso zzso
