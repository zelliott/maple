The zzso zzso sense employs several zzso zzso situated at characteristic locations in the zzso cavity to detect and report on different classes of zzso These zzso zzso use different zzso signal zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso projection zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a newly appreciated zzso zzso with zzso zzso located just inside of the zzso that project zzso to a unique domain of interconnected zzso in the zzso zzso zzso It is not well understood how the zzso relates to other zzso zzso in contributing to the zzso zzso Furthermore, the range of zzso and the signal zzso cascade zzso by the zzso have remained zzso To resolve these zzso we explored the molecular relationship between the zzso and the zzso zzso another zzso zzso that zzso similarly interconnected zzso in the same zzso zzso We found that mouse zzso zzso express the zzso signaling proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso gated channel zzso A3 coupled to a zzso repertoire of zzso particulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso The primary zzso signaling zzso of the zzso is shared with the zzso zzso unifying their target zzso as a unique center of zzso zzso signal zzso However, the distinct zzso repertoire in the zzso suggests that the zzso is an independent zzso zzso This zzso is well suited to detect a unique set of zzso and to mediate behaviors that remained intact in previous zzso zzso
