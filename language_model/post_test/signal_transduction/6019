zzso breast cancer zzso is a rare but particularly aggressive form of primary breast zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso are largely zzso 

To obtain further insight into the molecular zzso of zzso we used real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso to zzso the zzso expression of 538 selected genes in zzso relative to zzso 

zzso zzso of the 538 genes were significantly zzso in zzso compared with zzso None were zzso The 27 zzso genes mainly zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and growth factor receptors zzso zzso and zzso We also identified a gene expression profile, based on zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso of zzso patients with good, zzso and poor zzso 

Our study has identified a limited number of signaling pathways that require inappropriate zzso for zzso zzso Some of the zzso genes identified here could offer useful diagnostic or zzso markers and could form the basis of novel therapeutic zzso
