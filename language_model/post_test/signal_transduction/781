The normal human breast zzso cell line, zzso was used to investigate the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be transient in zzso cells and sustained in zzso zzso zzso cells also showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso protein zzso and increased zzso protein zzso Although zzso zzso was decreased in the zzso cells, the zzso was sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso comparable to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the upstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no density zzso zzso of zzso activity provided further evidence that regulation of zzso zzso is the critical signal zzso step controlling zzso cell cycle zzso Both zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso blocked cell cycle progression of zzso zzso In zzso we report the novel finding that zzso blocks zzso cell cycle progression by zzso zzso signaling at the level of zzso zzso zzso rather than at the level of zzso zzso
