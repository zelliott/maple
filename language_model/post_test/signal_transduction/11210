The zzso adult male zzso originate from the zzso zzso During the zzso zzso the external parts of zzso zzso from two zzso zzso the zzso left and right zzso halves fuse at the zzso zzso At the same time the male zzso perform a 360 zzso zzso Several zzso are known to affect the rotation of the male zzso while none is known to affect zzso zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso one of the three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso growth factors, is required for both zzso Males either zzso for zzso or bearing a dominant negative form of zzso or stasis zzso the unique zzso zzso do not complete either rotation or zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso disc is restricted to the A8 zzso However, zzso signaling influences zzso A9 and A10 cells, suggesting that the zzso protein zzso from its zzso zzso zzso for the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso or zzso for zzso which encodes a zzso that zzso the zzso terminal zzso pathway, lead to the same zzso as zzso in zzso Our results indicate that zzso signaling functions not only in zzso phenomena but are also required during rotation and zzso closure of the zzso male zzso zzso
