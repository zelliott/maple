zzso of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso by IGF-1 is associated with the risk and progression of many types of cancer, although despite this it remains unclear how activated zzso contributes to cancer zzso In this study, gene expression changes zzso by IGF-1 were zzso in breast zzso zzso We noted that many genes are functionally linked to cancer progression and zzso To validate some of the changes observed, the zzso and/or protein was confirmed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso zzso zzso Nuclear proteins were also temporally monitored to address how gene expression changes were zzso We found that IGF-1 zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which correlated with zzso changes in gene zzso Next, the promoter regions of zzso genes were searched in zzso The promoters of genes that clustered together had similar regulatory zzso In zzso IGF-1 zzso a gene expression profile relevant to cancer zzso and this study provides insight into the zzso zzso some of these changes zzso
