The symbiotic association of zzso with zzso involves zzso derived zzso factor, which is sufficient to activate the formation of zzso on the roots of the host zzso zzso of zzso factor by root hair cells zzso calcium zzso that are a component of the zzso factor signal zzso zzso zzso of the calcium zzso is a function of a zzso and zzso protein zzso and this activates zzso gene expression via two zzso domain zzso regulators, zzso Signaling zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso factor required for zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso form a complex that is associated with the promoters of early zzso zzso We show that zzso binds directly to zzso promoters through the novel zzso zzso While zzso shows direct binding to the zzso promoter in zzso this association in zzso requires zzso The zzso association with the zzso promoter is enhanced following zzso factor zzso zzso in the domain of zzso responsible for its interaction with zzso highlight the significance of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso Our work reveals direct binding of a zzso protein complex to DNA and highlights the importance of the zzso complex for efficient zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso
