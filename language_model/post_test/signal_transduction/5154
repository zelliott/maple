zzso zzso has been used in industry as an alternative to zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso gene expression and analyzed the molecular mechanism of its activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso protein and zzso levels, as well as zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Additionally, exposure to zzso markedly enhanced the production of zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments with several human zzso promoter zzso revealed that zzso activated the zzso factors nuclear zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso but not zzso or the zzso zzso response element binding zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso were significantly activated by zzso These results demonstrated that zzso induced zzso expression via zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings provide further insight into the signal zzso pathways involved in the inflammatory effects of zzso
