zzso of the zzso in an zzso marks a fresh round of zzso potential, yet the zzso stage and location within the zzso where the primordial germ cells zzso form differs wildly among zzso In most animals, the zzso is formed either by an inherited zzso in which maternal provisions within the zzso drive localized zzso fate once acquired in the zzso or an zzso mechanism that involves signaling between cells that directs zzso zzso The inherited mechanism has been widely studied in model organisms such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Given the rapid generation time and the effective adaptation for laboratory research of these organisms, it is not coincidental that research on these organisms has led the field in zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, is less well understood and is studied primarily in the mouse zzso zzso In this review, we compare and contrast these two fundamental mechanisms for zzso determination, beginning with the key molecular zzso that play a role in the formation of germ cells across all animal zzso We next explore the current understanding of the zzso mechanism of zzso determination in mice, and evaluate the hypotheses for selective pressures on these contrasting zzso We then discuss the hypothesis that the transition between these determination mechanisms, which has happened many times in zzso is more of a zzso than a zzso zzso Finally, we propose an zzso between zzso determination and sex determination in zzso of the milestones of reproduction and zzso which animals use contrasting strategies to activate similar zzso
