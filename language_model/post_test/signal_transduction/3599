Bone zzso proteins zzso are involved in patterning and cellular fate in various zzso including the zzso However, the zzso of zzso and their receptors have made it difficult to zzso their zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in peripheral zzso T cells by zzso the effects of an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso naturally occurs in T zzso At high doses, zzso suppressed proliferation of T cells in a zzso manner, inducing zzso zzso Also, zzso suppressed zzso and induced zzso zzso while preserving zzso zzso zzso efficiently suppressed zzso production even at low doses in mouse zzso T cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso in these zzso In addition, zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso pattern of zzso production, while zzso suppressed zzso production at higher doses in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controlled the zzso of zzso revealing the molecular nature of its zzso zzso we describe multiple effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating a zzso role for zzso zzso in these zzso
