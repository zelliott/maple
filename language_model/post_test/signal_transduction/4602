zzso zzso zzso has been associated with inflammation and zzso The zzso zzso system is one of the major signaling pathways that induce inflammation and zzso However, its role on zzso has not been zzso We subjected zzso zzso , and zzso mice to zzso zzso and assessed zzso and behavioral zzso Lack of zzso or zzso decreased the zzso volume early after zzso zzso but delayed its zzso The zzso size was accompanied by brain zzso zzso death, and neurological zzso Although zzso zzso was attenuated in zzso or zzso mice 1 day after injury, more zzso were present at later time points, suggesting that alternative signaling pathways had been activated to recruit zzso On the contrary, zzso and zzso zzso were decreased in these mice, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso In addition, we also found that zzso and zzso were able to restore the changes found in zzso mice, but zzso failed to do zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso may be an indispensable step to fully activate the zzso in zzso The data also indicate that zzso signaling zzso may be a molecular target for the treatment of zzso
