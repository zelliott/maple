This review focuses on the zzso and zzso zzso family members involved in zzso which is the zzso process controlling cell zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso The members of the zzso protein family, whose expression levels are under the control of zzso hormones, internally control this mechanism also during zzso They can physically interact with each other, sometimes in an zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo repeated cycles of structural development, functional differentiation and regression, therefore provide a unique model for investigating this family of proteins that regulate the fate of the zzso cells and consequently milk zzso The involvement of zzso family members is reviewed in zzso tissue during zzso at different stages of zzso cycle and in comparison with dairy and laboratory zzso
