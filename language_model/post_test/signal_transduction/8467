Kit is a cell surface type III zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in cell transformation through zzso or zzso zzso Two categories of Kit zzso displaying zzso either in the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso or in the zzso domain zzso zzso have been zzso To explore the effect of Kit zzso zzso on its zzso zzso we constructed enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso human Kit zzso harboring zzso either in the regulatory zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso When expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso Kit was activated on stem cell factor zzso whereas both zzso Kit zzso displayed a zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso exhibited a zzso zzso pattern and an zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso induce downstream zzso signaling without the need to reach the cell zzso zzso of zzso Kit zzso activity with zzso induced a complex, mature zzso pattern identical to zzso zzso Kit and resulted in the zzso of the zzso to the plasma zzso This zzso was clearly correlated to the zzso of zzso activity because zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso inactive on the zzso zzso zzso induced only the zzso of the zzso zzso These data show that on zzso zzso the zzso zzso of Kit zzso can be fully zzso Kit zzso are then exported and/or stabilized at the cell surface as inactive and fully zzso zzso
