zzso zzso zzso stress and the zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso have been implicated in a number of complications associated with diabetes zzso including zzso and zzso zzso In this study we examine zzso stress levels in blood cells isolated from human subjects with zzso syndrome and in healthy zzso Total zzso and protein were isolated from zzso and the levels of specific zzso stress markers were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that, compared to healthy controls, individuals with zzso syndrome have elevated zzso levels of genes indicative of zzso zzso including spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress levels correlate with blood zzso but not plasma zzso zzso Furthermore, in healthy individuals, a standard zzso oral zzso challenge produced a significant zzso in spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso post challenge and a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso The zzso was also activated ex zzso in human zzso cultured in the presence of zzso zzso supporting a specific role for zzso The oral zzso challenge was associated with a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso that may result from zzso zzso These findings suggest that there is an association between both acute and chronic zzso and zzso stress in zzso
