The present study focused on the mechanism of zzso effect of zzso on the primary rat zzso cultures exposed to simulated zzso conditions in zzso To study these mechanisms, the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways was zzso zzso in zzso zzso caused death of approximately zzso of zzso via zzso and decreased cell viability about 50% at 8 zzso Exposure to zzso at zzso of zzso zzso in these conditions significantly decreased the number of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso conversion and the decrease of zzso zzso zzso release after 1 and 10 zzso zzso treatment were observed indicating a significant increase in cell zzso When cultured zzso were incubated during 8 h simulated zzso with zzso zzso an zzso regulated zzso 1 and 2 zzso inhibitor or zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell zzso was zzso These effects of used zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso were antagonized by adding 1 and 10 zzso zzso to the culture zzso In addition, zzso significantly zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were observed as a result of treatment with 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso markedly attenuated the effects of zzso on expression of activated zzso zzso of the present study indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways are vital for zzso effect of zzso
