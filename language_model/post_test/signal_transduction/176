zzso zzso plays a critical role in cellular development by providing signaling cues that direct zzso In order to study both the cues that natural zzso provides and zzso cell responses to that information, human fetal lung zzso were used to produce a zzso three-dimensional zzso Following the removal of the zzso by zzso zzso protein and zzso constituents of the remaining zzso were identified by zzso and zzso zzso components included zzso zzso collagen I, collagen IV, collagen zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso was a uniquely distributed zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso signaling during zzso were then studied in human zzso cells seeded onto the zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased cell area were noted, as compared with cells on zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso and all of these zzso more with zzso than zzso collagen I, or collagen zzso Additionally, the zzso cells remodeled the zzso zzso and formed networks of tubes with zzso zzso zzso zzso in these tubes also predominantly zzso with zzso The pattern of membrane type 1 zzso zzso expression in the zzso cells suggested its involvement in the zzso zzso that occurred during zzso These results indicated that information in zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso
