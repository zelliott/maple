Previous studies show significantly specifically changed zzso reactions against retinal zzso in the serum of glaucoma and zzso hypertension zzso patients in comparison to healthy zzso As zzso of glaucoma still is unknown the aim of this study was to analyze if the serum and zzso of glaucoma patients interact with zzso zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with serum of patients suffering from primary open angle glaucoma zzso normal tension glaucoma zzso or zzso zzso serum after zzso removal and serum from healthy people for 48 h under a normal or an elevated pressure of zzso Pa zzso zzso zzso cells were additionally incubated with zzso zzso under a normal zzso zzso profiles of the zzso cells were measured with zzso protein identification was performed with zzso zzso analysis of the zzso cells was performed with zzso zzso zzso analysis including zzso statistics, zzso component analysis as well as calculating zzso distances was zzso 

zzso significant changes of the complex protein profiles after incubation with glaucoma and zzso serum in comparison to healthy serum were zzso showing specific changes in the cells zzso zzso at zzso Da zzso The zzso component analysis showed an effect of the serum of 59% on the zzso The pressure had an effect of zzso on the zzso zzso removal led to significantly changed cell reactions zzso Furthermore, the incubation with zzso serum and its zzso led to zzso changes of proteins in the zzso 

These studies show that the serum and the zzso of glaucoma patients significantly change protein expressions involved in cell regulatory processes in zzso zzso These could lead to a higher vulnerability of retinal cells towards stress factors such as an elevated zzso and eventually could lead to an increased zzso of the cells as in zzso
