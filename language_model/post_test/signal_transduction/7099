Cellular sensory systems often respond not to the absolute levels of zzso but to the zzso in zzso Such a property is called zzso detection zzso and is important for accurately sensing dynamic changes in environmental signals in the presence of fluctuations in their absolute zzso Previous studies defined zzso as zzso zzso and proposed several zzso models that achieve such a zzso Here, we prove that the previous zzso models can be zzso by a zzso Although the zzso zzso the zzso zzso requirement, its response zzso and response duration strongly depend on the input zzso This creates limitations in the specificity and zzso of detecting zzso in zzso Nevertheless, zzso with specificity and zzso by cells has been reported in the context of zzso wing zzso zzso by this fact and by extending previous zzso models, we here propose two possible mechanisms to achieve zzso with specificity and zzso One is the zzso zzso a system zzso the rate of zzso change in input and makes a response when the integrated value reaches a constant zzso and this is followed by the reset of the integrated zzso The other is the dynamic threshold zzso a system response occurs when the input level reaches a zzso whose value is multiplied by a certain constant after each zzso These two mechanisms can be implemented zzso by appropriately combining zzso and feedback zzso The main difference between the two models is their memory of input zzso we discuss possible ways to distinguish between the two models zzso
