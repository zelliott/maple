A salient characteristic of dysfunctional zzso progressing to heart failure is an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein alpha zzso G zzso It has not been determined zzso whether increased zzso activity in the heart is beneficial or deleterious in zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in the mechanism of zzso zzso however, no in zzso evidence exists that any of the G alpha zzso are zzso We have created a novel molecular tool to specifically address the role of zzso proteins in normal and dysfunctional zzso 

We have developed a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso composed of the region of G zzso that interacts specifically with G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals specifically in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso and zzso signals are not zzso In zzso expression of zzso in transgenic mice effectively causes a zzso zzso of cardiac G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice display a baseline zzso consistent with zzso zzso However, when subjected to zzso injury, zzso transgenic mice demonstrate a significant increase in zzso size compared with zzso mice (from zzso to zzso zzso this zzso zzso includes increased zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso 

Overall, our results demonstrate the in zzso utility of zzso to dissect specific mechanisms attributed to zzso signaling in stressed zzso Our results with zzso indicate that zzso of G zzso is an zzso protective response after zzso to shield zzso from zzso
