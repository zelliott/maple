zzso in the cell membrane potential have been suggested to affect signaling mechanisms participating in diverse cellular zzso many of which involve structural cellular zzso In order to contribute some evidence in this respect, we explored the effects of several zzso procedures on the structure and zzso organization of bovine zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso were incubated with or without the zzso agent, either in a saline solution or in culture medium for up to 30 zzso zzso potential was monitored by zzso zzso using zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso were employed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the plasma zzso achieved via the incorporation of zzso D into zzso zzso cells or by modifications of the zzso saline zzso provoked an zzso of zzso zzso and changes in cell zzso consisting mainly of modifications in the zzso zzso In some areas, noticeable zzso spaces zzso The zzso modifications mainly consist of a marked zzso of zzso and zzso with accompanying changes in zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso of the plasma membrane potential may participate in mechanisms involved in zzso organization and zzso continuity in zzso zzso cells in zzso
