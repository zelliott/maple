zzso body zzso zzso learning in zzso provides a powerful model to investigate memory zzso zzso integrate zzso zzso stimulus zzso zzso with zzso reinforcement zzso zzso zzso which for aversive learning is thought to rely on zzso zzso signaling to zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso A wealth of evidence suggests the conclusion that parallel and independent signaling occurs downstream of zzso within two zzso zzso cell types, with each supporting half of memory zzso For instance, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is sufficient to restore normal learning to zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso is sufficient to rescue zzso zzso zzso zzso are the only case where memory performance is fully zzso consistent with the hypothesis that zzso receives the US zzso for both zzso and zzso lobe zzso We zzso however, that zzso expression in zzso zzso is sufficient to fully support zzso and long-term zzso We argue that zzso zzso association is formed in zzso zzso followed by communication between zzso and zzso zzso to drive zzso
