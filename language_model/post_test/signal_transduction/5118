The zzso zzso transition pore zzso is a zzso zzso channel that is closed under zzso zzso Opening of the zzso leading to abolition of zzso functions, is a major mechanism of zzso necrosis by zzso and direct zzso of zzso opening by use of pharmacological or genetic zzso limits zzso size in zzso Multiple zzso signal pathways commonly target the zzso and inhibit its zzso Although the molecular structure of the zzso has not been established, recent studies have characterized roles of each zzso zzso and functions of several proteins directly interacting with the zzso This article briefly describes the understanding of zzso regulation and interaction of the zzso with four proteins zzso II, zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, and zzso 3) that are downstream of signal pathways relevant to protection from zzso zzso
