zzso is a potent zzso considered to be a potentially dangerous bioterrorist agent due to its wide availability and the possibility of zzso delivery to human zzso Studies in zzso and nonhuman primates have demonstrated that zzso delivered to the pulmonary system leads to acute lung injury and symptoms resembling acute respiratory distress zzso zzso evidence suggests that the inflammatory effects triggered by zzso are responsible for its zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso administered to the lungs of mice causes death of pulmonary zzso and the release of zzso zzso suggesting zzso may be a primary target of zzso Here we examined the requirement for zzso in the development of zzso pulmonary inflammation by employing transgenic zzso mice that express an zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter for zzso zzso of zzso upon injection of a synthetic zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso to zzso mice led to reduced inflammatory responses, including recruitment of zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso When compared with control mice treated with zzso zzso mice treated with zzso displayed a reduction in pulmonary zzso zzso mice deficient in zzso we found that zzso inflammatory responses were zzso including zzso zzso could be restored by zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited zzso inflammatory responses, including recruitment of zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest a central role for zzso and zzso signaling in the inflammatory process triggered by zzso
