zzso zzso availability is widely known as a zzso of plant growth and zzso zzso However, less attention has been paid to the effect of the type of N source zzso zzso or zzso on the respiratory zzso This review summarizes the latest findings on this topic, with an emphasis on the effect of ammonium and zzso oxide zzso on the respiratory system, and the zzso role of alternative zzso zzso First, concentrated ammonium has been found to increase plant zzso rate zzso respiratory increase, zzso We will introduce two hypotheses to explain zzso futile ammonium cycling and excess reducing zzso and verify the zzso of each zzso We suggest that these two hypotheses are not necessarily mutually zzso Second, gene expression of zzso is suppressed when N is predominately available as nitrate instead of zzso We will discuss possible signaling pathways leading to this expression zzso Third, while zzso expression is induced by zzso zzso activity itself is insensitive to zzso In contrast, activity of zzso c zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso We outline the NO production pathway, focusing on zzso NO production, and discuss the zzso significance of the fact that zzso activity is insensitive to zzso Finally, this review aims to build an integrated scheme of the respiratory response to the type of N source, considering leaves in high light conditions or hypoxic zzso
