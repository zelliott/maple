Over the past decade, zzso therapies have been added to zzso and zzso drugs in the treatment of cancer, with the aim to target the molecular pathways that zzso the zzso process and maintain the cancer zzso Success with some of these agents has suggested that identification and validation of the drug target is the starting point for the route of development of active, safe and effective zzso Main molecular targets used to the development of zzso drugs are cell surface zzso signal zzso zzso gene zzso targets, zzso shock proteins and zzso zzso components (especially zzso zzso Here, we review the development of the main molecular targeted zzso agents studied in cancer, highlighting lessons derived from the development of these novel drugs and proposing new horizons for the clinical development of zzso zzso
