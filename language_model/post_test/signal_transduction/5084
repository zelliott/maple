zzso zzso levels correlate with the severity of zzso malaria in humans and mouse models, but the impact of zzso classic signaling through membrane zzso as well as zzso zzso through soluble zzso on the outcome of malaria has remained zzso In this study, we created zzso mice that exhibit a 50% survival of otherwise lethal zzso malaria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by injection of mouse zzso soluble zzso in zzso mice restores the lethal outcome to malaria zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso via injection of zzso zzso protein in control mice results in a zzso survival zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso rather than classic zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso in mice, preceded by an increased inflammatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso may serve as a novel promising therapeutic basis to combat zzso
