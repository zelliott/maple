Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that is marked by the dysfunction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance is especially zzso in type 2 diabetes, as it zzso zzso and zzso zzso tolerance and promotes systemic zzso and zzso fatty liver zzso zzso dysfunction is closely associated with insulin resistance and might contribute to the progression of zzso Here we used previously generated mice with zzso insulin resistance zzso to the deletion of the genes zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to here as zzso zzso zzso to establish the molecular link between zzso insulin action and zzso zzso The expression of several zzso box zzso zzso target genes increased in the zzso liver, including zzso zzso zzso which zzso complex III and IV of the respiratory chain and lowers the zzso ratio and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso liver, it was zzso and failed to promote zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso liver zzso the expression of zzso and the zzso ratio, reduced zzso zzso and restored zzso zzso metabolism and zzso Thus, zzso zzso insulin signaling with zzso function, and zzso of zzso can improve zzso metabolism during insulin resistance and the zzso zzso
