While the I zzso zzso zzso scaffolding protein zzso essential zzso zzso binds to zzso chains to transmit inflammatory signals, zzso itself is also zzso in response to a variety of inflammatory zzso Although there have been hints that zzso of zzso is essential for avoiding inflammatory disorders, the zzso zzso role of zzso zzso is zzso In this work, we knock in a zzso zzso in which two major inflammatory zzso zzso sites cannot be zzso We show that mice with a zzso zzso zzso display embryonic zzso zzso females develop inflammatory skin zzso decreased B cell numbers, and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by mating onto a zzso background, at the cost of severe zzso and early zzso and we also show that zzso zzso is required for optimal innate immune signaling zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso is crucial for zzso activity in response to innate immune zzso
