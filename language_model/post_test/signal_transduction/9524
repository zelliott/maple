zzso is an industrial chemical that can cause severe zzso zzso This study was a preliminary investigation into the effect of zzso exposure to zzso vapor using a zzso zzso burn model and zzso zzso zzso abdominal sites were exposed to a mean calculated zzso vapor concentration of zzso g zzso for 10 or 20 zzso At 48 h zzso total zzso from skin samples was isolated, zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Genome zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso vapor exposure for 10 or 20 zzso promoted similar zzso changes in the number of significantly modulated probe zzso A minimum of zzso of the probe sets was similar for both exposure zzso zzso pathways analysis revealed eight common biological functions among the top 10 functions of each experimental group, in which 30 genes were commonly shared among 19 significantly altered signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2 zzso gamma chain, and zzso zzso zzso were identified as common potential therapeutic targets for Phase zzso clinical trial or zzso zzso The present study is an initial assessment of the zzso responses to zzso zzso vapor exposure identifying molecular networks and genes that could serve as targets for developing zzso for zzso skin zzso
