The promise of precision medicine is now a clinical zzso Advances in our understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso cancer zzso are leading to the development of a variety of zzso that are being used as early detection zzso zzso zzso and markers for predicting treatment zzso This is no more evident than in the recent advances in testing zzso for specific molecular zzso in order to guide treatment with the zzso zzso therapies zzso and zzso which target the zzso growth factor zzso In this review, we update a prior review published in 2010 and describe our current understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso and how these zzso relate to emerging zzso for early detection and risk zzso zzso zzso prognosis zzso zzso and the prediction of treatment responses zzso zzso
