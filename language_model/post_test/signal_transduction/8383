The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso expression is poorly defined in oral zzso Investigation of two different oral zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines with high zzso zzso expression revealed, however, that this expression was dependent on two zzso protein zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso because combined zzso of these pathways was needed to abolish zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell line zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso nor zzso was involved in zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso expression is regulated by several zzso and emphasizes that individual tumors use different strategies for zzso zzso
