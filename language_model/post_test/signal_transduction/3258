zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso by a number of zzso including the scavenger zzso zzso and the zzso zzso scaffolds zzso and zzso In addition, in a number of in zzso and in zzso models, the loss of zzso results in a decreased cell surface expression and whole cell level of zzso suggesting an interaction between these two proteins in zzso We investigated if zzso and zzso interact directly, and as zzso binds to zzso we investigated if this zzso scaffold was required for a zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments using rat kidney zzso demonstrated an interaction between zzso and zzso which was zzso by their zzso As this interaction may be controlled by a scaffold zzso we zzso any interaction between zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and that this interaction was via an internal zzso binding domain in the zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso protein levels in the whole cell or plasma zzso Using zzso against zzso we demonstrated that zzso was required to facilitate the interaction between zzso and zzso Using fusion zzso we zzso a protein complex containing zzso and zzso which is zzso by zzso in the absence of any other zzso zzso these observations are the first to describe an interaction between zzso and zzso which is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso
