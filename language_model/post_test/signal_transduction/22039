zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are key regulators of cardiac zzso and zzso during pathological stress, but their role in regulating zzso channels in the diseased heart is zzso Thus, we compared the zzso profile and zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso weeks after zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso and zzso activities were markedly increased in zzso hearts, while parallel zzso studies in zzso zzso revealed a characteristic zzso of transient outward zzso current zzso zzso When zzso zzso were treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso density increased to control zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso by zzso growth zzso which decreased zzso activity in zzso hearts, and these changes were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was also markedly decreased zzso and was reversed by zzso growth zzso in an zzso zzso We conclude that expression of zzso zzso channels is zzso regulated and that chronic impairment of the zzso system in the zzso heart contributes to zzso zzso through sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The cardiac zzso system may thus be a novel therapeutic target to reverse or prevent zzso zzso in the failing zzso
