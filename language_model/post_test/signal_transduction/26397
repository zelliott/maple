zzso and zzso which are members of the zzso family of zzso factors, play a pivotal role in the development of the zzso zzso However, recent evidence shows that both proteins can also drive the process of zzso transition during zzso cancer zzso The understanding of how both zzso act as zzso factors opens up new possibilities for future treatment of advanced zzso This review gives insight into the molecular mechanisms that form the basis of the multitude of cellular processes controlled by both zzso zzso By using an evolutionary approach, we analyzed how the specific organization of the different zzso and regulatory sites in zzso and zzso came into zzso On the basis of this analysis, a detailed overview is provided of the different zzso and zzso mechanisms that are associated with zzso protein zzso
