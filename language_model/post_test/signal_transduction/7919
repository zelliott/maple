zzso 3 is a zzso zzso zzso predominantly expressed in skeletal zzso zzso binds to the zzso and zzso regions of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso evidence showing that compromised zzso zzso activity leads to muscular zzso zzso muscular zzso type zzso indicates the importance of zzso function in zzso Here we show that a series of zzso zzso zzso is expressed immediately after muscle differentiation and zzso change zzso during zzso We found that the zzso zzso (but not zzso domain of zzso was not only localized in the zzso but also directly bound to zzso zzso These data suggest the incorporation of zzso zzso fragments of zzso into the zzso In zzso zzso of zzso expressed zzso shifted from the zzso to zzso as the zzso lengthens beyond approximately zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso activity is involved in responses to muscle conditions, which may explain why zzso zzso causes zzso muscular zzso
