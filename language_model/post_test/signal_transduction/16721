B cell development is a process tightly regulated by the orchestrated signaling of zzso zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso and the B cell zzso zzso It zzso with common zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of B zzso genes and committing to the B cell zzso zzso signaling zzso stem cell factor, zzso is essential at this stage of development as it suppresses cell death, sustains proliferation and zzso heavy chain zzso As a result of heavy chain zzso the zzso is zzso which then becomes the primary zzso of survival, cell cycle entry and zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of B cell lineage commitment and describe the signaling pathways that are initiated by the zzso Finally, we compare zzso and zzso structure, signal zzso and function, drawing parallels between early zzso and zzso cell zzso
