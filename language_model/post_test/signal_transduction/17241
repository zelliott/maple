zzso is an zzso zzso zzso pathway, widely implicated in controlling various cellular responses such as cellular proliferation and stem cell renewal in human and other organisms, through external zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in human adult stem cell line may cause different types of zzso zzso targeting this zzso in cancer therapy has become zzso but the non availability of detailed molecular zzso complex regulations by zzso and zzso proteins and cross talks with other pathways pose a serious challenge to get a coherent understanding of this signaling zzso for making therapeutic zzso This motivated us to perform a zzso study of the zzso and to identify probable drug zzso In this work, from available databases and literature, we reconstructed a complete zzso zzso which reports the largest number of molecules and interactions to zzso Using recently developed zzso techniques, we further performed structural and logical analysis of this zzso In structural analysis, the connectivity and zzso parameters were calculated to identify the important proteins from the zzso To capture the regulations of the zzso we developed a master zzso model of all the interactions between the proteins and created different cancer scenarios, such as zzso zzso and zzso We performed zzso analysis on these cancer conditions to identify the important and minimal combinations of proteins that can be used as drug zzso From our study we observed the under expressions of various zzso in zzso zzso while zzso at a time the combinations of the proteins zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This reconstructed zzso signaling zzso and the zzso analysis for identifying new zzso drug targets will be useful for future zzso and zzso analysis to control different zzso
