zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso are the major cause of infections zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso resistance genes is zzso by two closely related zzso integral membrane zzso zzso and zzso upon binding of the zzso zzso to the sensor zzso zzso we report the crystal structure at zzso A resolution of the sensor domain of zzso in complex with a zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso involves zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso antibiotic, a process promoted by the zzso side chain of zzso We present evidence that, on zzso the zzso side chain experiences a spontaneous zzso that zzso the sensor in its activated zzso zzso zzso and quantum zzso mechanical calculations and the interaction networks in the crystal structure shed light on how this unprecedented process for zzso of a zzso may be achieved and provide insights into the zzso features that differentiate the zzso zzso from the structurally related class D zzso zzso of zzso zzso
