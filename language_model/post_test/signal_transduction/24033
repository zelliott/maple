The zzso dead zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso gene encodes a nuclear protein with a zzso zzso domain termed the zzso zzso interaction zzso We show here that zzso is expressed in a subset of zzso zzso in the zzso embryonic central nervous system and that zzso forms part of the zzso regulatory cascade required for normal development of these zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed a role for zzso in formation of the normal embryonic zzso zzso zzso arise normally in zzso zzso zzso but they fail to migrate to their final zzso zzso of the spatial organization of the zzso zzso zzso accounts for the mild defects in zzso zzso observed in the zzso zzso zzso with the late zzso observed, expression of the zzso cells missing zzso and reversed polarity zzso genes was found to be normal in zzso zzso zzso However, from stage 15 of zzso expression of locomotion defects zzso and zzso zzso was found to be missing in a subset of zzso This suggests that zzso and pros are targets of zzso zzso zzso in some zzso We conclude that zzso is an important regulator of the late development of zzso zzso
