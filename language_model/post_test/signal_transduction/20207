Type I zzso zzso form a network of zzso zzso that bind to a shared, zzso cell surface zzso and engage signaling pathways that activate innate and zzso immune zzso The ability of zzso to mediate differential responses through the same cell surface zzso has been subject of a controversial debate and has important medical zzso During the past decade, a comprehensive insight into the structure, zzso and dynamics of zzso recognition by its zzso zzso as well as detailed correlations with their functional properties on the level of signal zzso gene zzso and biological responses were zzso All type I zzso bind the zzso zzso at the same sites and form structurally very similar zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were found to be determined by different lifetimes and zzso affinities toward the zzso zzso which dictate assembly and dynamics of the signaling complex in the plasma zzso We present a simple model, which explains differential zzso activities based on rapid zzso of signaling complexes and negative feedback mechanisms interfering with zzso complex zzso More insight into signaling pathways as well as zzso signaling and trafficking will be required for a comprehensive understanding, which will eventually lead to therapeutic applications of zzso with increased zzso
