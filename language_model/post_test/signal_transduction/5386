zzso signaling has been implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation during the development of the central nervous zzso In this work, we assessed the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of genes related to the zzso differentiation of stem zzso 

zzso mouse zzso stem cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene expression profile of these cells was determined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso results were confirmed by real-time zzso chain zzso 

Several zzso expressed genes were identified in the zzso zzso Many of these genes are targets of the zzso signaling pathway, such as those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso modulated the expression of genes of zzso differentiation of these stem zzso 

This work demonstrated that zzso is an important regulator gene for the expression of zzso of stem zzso
