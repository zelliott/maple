zzso of zzso zzso zzso to promoters plays an important role in gene zzso zzso signaling zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso through direct zzso yet the molecular mechanisms remain to be zzso Here we report that zzso is an important component of zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso in a zzso repression zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso pathway, whereas depletion of zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso the zzso The recruitment of zzso by zzso leads to increased zzso and decreased zzso of zzso zzso II on target zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso in resistant cell lines while zzso of zzso prevents sensitive cell lines from zzso These studies identify a molecular mechanism of zzso zzso and highlight the function of zzso in hormone zzso
