To investigate the role of zzso signaling in differentiation of zzso zzso rat retinal zzso cells zzso 

zzso were isolated from zzso embryonic zzso rats and cultured in zzso zzso were cultured respectively in media with zzso zzso or without zzso zzso zzso inhibitor X which was used to block zzso zzso zzso observation and zzso were applied at day 14 to determine the cell types and analyze the expression of zzso zzso genes in both zzso 

Most zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso or its downstream zzso factor zzso A few expressed zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso Most zzso zzso expressed zzso or zzso while a few of them expressed zzso zzso zzso or zzso In the group treated with zzso inhibitor X, the positive rate of zzso or zzso was much lower than that in the control group while the positive rate of zzso was much higher than that in the control zzso The difference in the positive rate of recovering between the two groups was not zzso 

In zzso zzso signaling may inhibit retinal stem cells zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso may promote differentiation to zzso and partially inhibit zzso zzso
