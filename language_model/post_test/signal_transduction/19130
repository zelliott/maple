zzso zzso signaling contributes to the neural control of food zzso zzso signaling is thought to regulate zzso the reward value of a food item as determined by zzso cues such as taste and zzso The reward value of a food reflects not only these sensory properties but also the relative value of competing food zzso In the present experiment, we used a zzso contrast paradigm to manipulate the relative value of a zzso solution for two groups of zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso for both groups, however, this suppression was selective, occurring only for the relatively more valuable zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso signaling contributes to the zzso of relative reward zzso
