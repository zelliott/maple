zzso an zzso zzso encodes a protein that potentially acts as a zzso factor by modulating zzso growth factor 1 signaling and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential role of zzso in the therapeutic effect of zzso against Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso and memory impairment in aged zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment (10 and 40 zzso for 8 weeks, zzso in zzso zzso mice reduced memory deficits, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso loss, increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and activity, and decreased zzso protein zzso and zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the cerebral zzso zzso and serum, decreased zzso and zzso box class zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the zzso growth factor 1 zzso and induced zzso box class zzso zzso in zzso cells along with zzso zzso An inverse correlation was found between zzso expression and the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be a novel therapeutic target for age-related zzso and zzso zzso might contribute to the zzso effect of zzso against zzso
