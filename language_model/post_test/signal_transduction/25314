The dormant spores of zzso zzso become competent for growth and nuclear division in a process called zzso zzso To analyze the molecular details of zzso zzso we developed a genetic screen in which we identified spore zzso zzso that are blocked in this process at the restrictive zzso These zzso defined eight zzso of which we identified zzso Four of the five were directly involved in translation and protein zzso and the fifth showed a high degree of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that out of a wide array of processes occurring during zzso zzso translation is essential if zzso is to zzso We also show that zzso containing a zzso form of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the absence of an inducing carbon source, suggesting an important role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso Together these data suggest a model by which a carbon source activates a zzso sensory zzso inducing translation and leading to zzso zzso This study shows that zzso zzso in zzso zzso requires protein synthesis and that the initiation of translation is linked, through an as yet to be determined signaling cascade that includes zzso to a zzso zzso
