zzso zzso are differentiated zzso cells that regulate the zzso zzso through the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be damaged by zzso oxygen species induced by ultraviolet rays and zzso In addition to its effects on the zzso zzso stress poses a major threat to organisms and is believed to play an essential role in many disease zzso In this study, we show that human zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso In addition, cell viability of zzso is increased by zzso zzso via regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso attenuated zzso cell growth zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso growth arrest through regulation of the signal molecules zzso and zzso and suggest that zzso may have value as an zzso material in cosmetics and zzso
