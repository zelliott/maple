We wanted to zzso whether zzso calcium may regulate the expression of the cardiac zzso proteins zzso 40 and zzso In the free wall of the left zzso of 126 cardiac surgery patients with either zzso rhythm zzso or chronic zzso zzso zzso we determined the expression of the cardiac zzso proteins zzso and zzso by Western zzso and zzso For deeper investigation, we incubated cultured zzso rat zzso at 2 or 4 zzso zzso for 24 h and determined zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso protein trafficking and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso A (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso We found in patients that both zzso are zzso in zzso in the left atrium (by zzso Interestingly, zzso was mainly zzso if total serum calcium was zzso zzso while zzso was independent from zzso zzso In cultured cells, 4 zzso zzso lead to zzso of zzso but not zzso We found enhanced zzso in the plasma membrane and reduced zzso in the zzso zzso The membrane zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso zzso with a shift in the zzso fit of zzso zzso indicating a higher contribution of zzso as revealed by dual whole cell zzso clamp zzso zzso could prevent all zzso zzso Moreover, zzso A completely abolished the zzso changes, while zzso was zzso We conclude that zzso calcium (24 h zzso seems to zzso zzso but not zzso
