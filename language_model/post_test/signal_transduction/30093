The presentation of zzso zzso guidance factors plays a major role in shaping central nervous system zzso zzso Recent work suggests that zzso zzso zzso regulates guidance factor zzso however, the in zzso zzso guidance roles of its carrier proteins zzso zzso zzso or zzso are largely zzso Here we demonstrate through genetic analysis in zzso that the zzso zzso zzso is critical for the zzso of zzso repellent signaling at the zzso of the zzso zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit consistent defects in zzso zzso guidance, plus potent and specific genetic interactions supporting a model in which zzso improve the efficiency of zzso zzso and/or zzso To test this hypothesis, we show that zzso distribution is altered in zzso zzso and that zzso and its zzso bind to zzso However, when we compare the function of the zzso zzso to a different class of zzso that zzso to zzso zzso zzso we find functional zzso suggesting that these zzso act as zzso specific carriers of common HS structures that enable growth cones to interact with and perceive zzso as it zzso away from its source at the zzso zzso
