zzso zzso root sheath zzso is important for tooth root formation, but the molecular basis for the signaling of root development remains zzso We hypothesized that Sonic zzso zzso signaling is involved in the zzso function, because it mediates zzso interactions during embryonic zzso We examined the gene expression patterns of zzso signaling in zzso developing zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were identified in the zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso dental zzso in addition to the zzso To confirm whether zzso signaling zzso functions in zzso we analyzed zzso zzso zzso mice carrying an abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso cell proliferation was zzso around the zzso at 1 zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was zzso and all roots were shorter than those in control zzso at 4 zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling is important in tooth root zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso sonic zzso zzso zzso
