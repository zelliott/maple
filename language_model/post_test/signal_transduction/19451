Following zzso stress, cells activate a complex zzso signaling network to arrest the cell cycle and initiate DNA zzso zzso tumor cells zzso their checkpoint response and become dependent on the zzso zzso for survival after DNA damage, despite a functional zzso zzso We used functional zzso to dissect the contributions of zzso and zzso to checkpoint zzso We show that nuclear zzso activity is essential to establish a zzso checkpoint, while zzso zzso activity is critical for prolonged checkpoint maintenance through a process of zzso zzso zzso Following DNA damage, the zzso complex zzso from nucleus to zzso where zzso zzso zzso to stabilize zzso zzso while zzso zzso and releases the zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso functions within a positive feedback loop, sustaining the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to block zzso entry in the presence of zzso DNA zzso Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of gene expression as part of the DNA damage response in cancer zzso
