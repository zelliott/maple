We observed that treatment of prostate cancer cells for 24 h with zzso a zzso component extracted from the root and stem bark of the zzso herb zzso zzso induced zzso cell death in a zzso and zzso zzso A sustained zzso of the major survival zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with an zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a rapid decrease in the level of zzso zzso leading to zzso of its zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso also caused a decrease in zzso zzso of Bad (a zzso zzso which is a downstream target of zzso zzso interaction zzso revealed that zzso an zzso zzso was associated with Bad during treatment with zzso We also observed that during treatment with zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso membrane occurred and the zzso was accompanied by zzso c release, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar results were observed in human colon cancer zzso cell line, but not zzso cell zzso Interestingly, at similar zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not affect the viability of normal human prostate zzso cell zzso zzso We also observed that zzso cell death by zzso was associated with significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that one of the mechanisms of the zzso activity of zzso involves its effect on zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso
