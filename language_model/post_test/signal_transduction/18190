zzso stimulates proliferation of zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso We investigated the action of zzso on the zzso state of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and tested the hypothesis that zzso oxygen species zzso might be involved in the signal zzso zzso linking zzso zzso of nuclear zzso factors to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly increased zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso and/or zzso acid significantly decreased zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, the induction zzso zzso levels by zzso was completely abolished by zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso fluorescent dye zzso zzso we determined that zzso zzso zzso rapidly increased the generation of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso implicating zzso zzso as the source for the generation of zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso and zzso and the expression of zzso zzso in zzso in response to zzso are zzso via the generation of zzso and zzso zzso as important zzso in the signal zzso zzso through which zzso promotes zzso proliferation in states of vascular zzso
