zzso alcohol abuse during pregnancy is one of the leading causes of birth defects in zzso Despite extensive studies, the molecular basis is still not zzso Here we zzso exposed zzso zzso to alcohol and showed that alcohol zzso produced zzso and growth zzso Moreover, it reduced the expression of several key neural genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which zzso was most zzso An alcohol concentration as low as zzso could produce more than zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso to zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso zzso and restored the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso To test whether zzso oxygen species zzso is the upstream signal for zzso zzso and zzso suppression, we zzso zzso in zzso zzso and found that zzso not only decreased zzso zzso formation, but also fully restored zzso expression and reversed zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso could only provide partial protection against growth zzso zzso from this study illustrate for the first time the critical role of zzso zzso suppression in zzso zzso and suggest the presence of additional mechanisms for zzso fetal growth zzso
