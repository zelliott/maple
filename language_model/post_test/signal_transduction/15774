zzso memory T cells zzso have an important role in immunity against zzso However, little is known about the factors regulating zzso maintenance and zzso In this study, we investigated the role of direct interactions between zzso and zzso T cells zzso for human zzso zzso zzso of separated or mixed zzso and zzso populations was analyzed after zzso stimulation in zzso Compared to each isolated subset mixed zzso populations showed increased proliferation and expansion of both zzso and zzso zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso memory T cells zzso induced an increased expression of zzso and zzso on both zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso stimulation of zzso by zzso and of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso on activated zzso selectively inhibited proliferation of zzso while blocking of zzso on zzso zzso proliferation of zzso Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that the expression of zzso is exploited on the one hand by zzso to increase the proliferation of activated zzso and on the other hand by zzso to support the expansion of activated zzso Thus, efficient zzso expansion requires zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso
