zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso beta cell destruction, an essential mechanism in the zzso of type 1 diabetes zzso zzso analysis recently identified zzso zzso now known as zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso member 11b zzso as a zzso gene in beta zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the functional role and zzso pathways of zzso that are involved in zzso beta cell zzso 

As cellular models, the rat beta cell line zzso and human primary pancreatic zzso were zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression were zzso by northern zzso and zzso The effect of zzso on beta cell survival was assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways were evaluated by western zzso analysis using zzso against zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso cell line and primary pancreatic zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which were enhanced by zzso and zzso Exposure to zzso resulted in sustained zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and subsequent cell zzso Administration of zzso zzso prevented both zzso beta cell death and sustained zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso production of zzso may protect beta cells from further zzso This protective effect is, at least in part, zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso is an zzso or zzso survival factor for beta zzso
