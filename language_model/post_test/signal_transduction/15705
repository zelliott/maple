Cancer stem cells are responsible for tumor initiation and zzso In zzso cancer, the zzso zzso cancer stem cells are also able to repair the tumor and serve as tumor vascular zzso zzso these cells is therefore necessary to improve treatment outcome and patient zzso The previous demonstration that the zzso cancer stem cells are resistant to zzso cell death induced by conventional chemotherapy agents suggests that other forms of targeted therapy should be zzso We show in this study that targeting zzso zzso is a potent stimulus to induce zzso cell death in a panel of zzso cancer stem zzso Treatment of these cells with the novel zzso zzso zzso significantly depressed zzso function exhibited by decrease in zzso zzso and zzso levels, and by increase in zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso This promotes a state of cellular zzso that activates two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to loss of zzso membrane zzso The demonstration that a compound can specifically target the zzso to induce cell death in this otherwise zzso cell population opens a new venue for treating zzso cancer zzso
