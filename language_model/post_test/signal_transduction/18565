Novel and diverse functions of zzso cells are currently the focus of much attention zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2005) Nature zzso 6, zzso Here we present evidence that rat zzso release zzso zzso as part of their response to hypoxic zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso zzso and hence zzso stress, subsequently leads to a switching in zzso from the classical zzso zzso to a preferential increase in the zzso zzso for a soluble form, zzso This change in expression is reflected in increased zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cells, with a zzso and marked increase in zzso zzso that zzso at 1 h zzso An analogous increase in zzso over a similar time scale, occurs in response to psychological stress zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature 93, zzso as well as to head injury and stroke zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso 6, zzso The data presented here suggest that zzso cells may be key chemical intermediaries in such situations and, perhaps more generally in pathological conditions involving zzso stress, such as zzso
