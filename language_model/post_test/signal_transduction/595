In this study, we demonstrate that zzso of round primary zzso into a zzso zzso zzso with a profound induction of zzso protein and stress zzso Culture of zzso zzso in zzso gel zzso a precipitous loss of zzso protein and a loss of stress fibers zzso with the zzso of the zzso differentiation zzso We have found that zzso in limb bud zzso cultures similarly zzso a loss of zzso protein and that expression of dominant negative zzso in such cultures can markedly enhance zzso zzso with these results, expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can restore zzso gene expression in zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso of cells with agents that block zzso zzso enhance the ability of either zzso zzso or a zzso zzso fusion protein to activate gene zzso Interestingly, the enhancement of zzso function by zzso zzso requires both protein zzso A zzso activity and a zzso zzso site in zzso zzso that is known to enhance zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates the ability of zzso to both activate zzso markers and maintain its own expression in zzso via a positive feedback zzso
