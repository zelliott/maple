The involvement of zzso signals and zzso signals in spinal ligament cells was investigated using zzso fatty rats zzso that carry zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats that present obesity due to destruction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty rats zzso , that have a with functional zzso of zzso receptors are a spontaneous model of zzso of the zzso zzso ligament that develops sympathetic nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso protein were eminent by detected in the cartilage zzso and the zzso region in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells were slightly less in the zzso group than in the zzso and control zzso The results suggest that zzso signaling for cell proliferation was enhanced in zzso which may explain the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on the spinal ligament in zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso does not play any role due to functional zzso in zzso the direct involvement of zzso in ligament zzso may be slight in zzso zzso expression in the stage preceding ligament zzso was confirmed, suggesting that zzso of the spinal ligament may be inhibited by sympathetic nerve stimulation in zzso
