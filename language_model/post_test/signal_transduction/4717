zzso is a highly effective zzso agent used for treating a wide spectrum of tumors, but its usage is limited because of its zzso zzso especially in pediatric zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso However, less attention has been paid to the effects of age on zzso zzso signaling in zzso This study focused on investigating differential zzso sensitivity between zzso and adult zzso in particular, between zzso and adult zzso in zzso Our results show that zzso activity in normal mouse hearts decreased by zzso zzso within the first 3 zzso after birth, associated with a rapid zzso in the expression of key zzso proteins in intrinsic and zzso zzso This rapid zzso of zzso activity was confirmed by zzso for zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso label zzso zzso treatment induced a zzso increase in zzso activity and zzso in zzso mouse hearts, and both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Using transgenic mice with a nuclear localized zzso reporter gene to label zzso in zzso we observed a fourfold higher level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice compared with that in zzso zzso This study points to a major difference in zzso signaling in zzso zzso between zzso and adult mouse hearts and reveals a critical transition from high to low zzso to zzso zzso during zzso heart zzso
