zzso mice zzso generally depend on the background strains used in their zzso To examine the effects of genetic background on insulin zzso we analyzed zzso zzso in four zzso strains of mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso content of insulin zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso At 2 months, the male B6 mouse is the least zzso despite exhibiting similar insulin sensitivity and zzso insulin zzso as the other zzso The zzso male mouse zzso contains less insulin and exhibits a higher threshold for zzso zzso insulin zzso than the other zzso Female mice generally manifest better zzso tolerance than zzso which is likely due to greater insulin sensitivity in liver and zzso zzso a robust zzso insulin zzso in B6 and zzso zzso and improved insulin sensitivity in muscle in zzso and zzso zzso At 6 months, although males exhibit improved zzso insulin zzso their physiology was relatively zzso whereas female B6 and zzso mice became less insulin zzso Gene expression of insulin signaling zzso in zzso zzso was generally not strain dependent with the cell content of zzso zzso being zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso expressed and zzso and zzso zzso were detected in significant amounts in fat and brain zzso zzso These data indicate zzso zzso and zzso tissue sensitivity to insulin that is generally not associated with transcript content of zzso or its zzso and should be taken into consideration during zzso characterization of transgenic zzso
