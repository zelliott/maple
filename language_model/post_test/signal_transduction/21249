Many zzso bacteria regulate gene expression in response to their population size by sensing the level of zzso zzso signal molecules which they produce and liberate to the zzso We have developed an zzso for these signals that couples separation by zzso zzso with detection using zzso zzso harboring zzso fused to a gene that is regulated by zzso With the exception of zzso zzso the reporter detected zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso side chains of all lengths zzso The intensity of the response was zzso to the amount of the signal zzso zzso Each of the zzso and the zzso derivatives migrated with a unique zzso Using the zzso we showed that some bacteria produce as many as five zzso signal zzso zzso could be assigned tentatively on the basis of mobility and spot zzso The dominant species produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the properties of zzso zzso a structure that was confirmed by mass zzso An isolate of zzso zzso produced five zzso species, three of which had novel zzso zzso These were identified as the zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso can be used to screen cultures of bacteria for zzso zzso for zzso the amounts of these molecules produced, and as an zzso and zzso aid in determining the structures of these signal zzso
