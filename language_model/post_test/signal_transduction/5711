zzso control of infection depends on the generation of zzso armed with a particular array of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The differentiation of zzso T cells into functionally distinct zzso zzso is regulated by signals from the T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using gene zzso approaches, the initiation of discrete zzso programs appears zzso sensitive to the loss of individual zzso signaling zzso likely due to differences in the zzso factors needed to activate individual zzso zzso Less well understood however, are the signal requirements for the execution of zzso zzso With a focus on zzso cells and the zzso zzso we review recent observations that point to differences between the signals needed for the initiation and zzso of zzso programs in zzso T zzso Indeed, zzso zzso cells signal differently from both their zzso counterparts and from zzso zzso suggesting they may zzso zzso signals differently or may be selectively receptive to different zzso zzso Potential regulation points for zzso function lie at the level of zzso and translation of zzso zzso We also discuss how provision of these execution signals may be zzso zzso in zzso occurring at tissue sites of inflammation and subject to zzso by the pathogen zzso
