The protein zzso zzso plays a central role in a number of key biological functions including protein zzso zzso zzso and the regulation of cell survival or zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso growth factor receptors stimulate zzso has been recently zzso In contrast, the mechanism of zzso of zzso by other cell surface receptors is much less zzso For G zzso receptors zzso conflicting data suggest that these receptors stimulate zzso in a cell zzso manner by a yet to be fully zzso zzso Here, we took advantage of the availability of cells, where zzso activity could not be enhanced by zzso acting on this large family of cell surface zzso such as zzso zzso cells, to investigate the zzso linking zzso to zzso We present evidence that expression of zzso zzso zzso beta is necessary and sufficient to transmit signals from G proteins to zzso in these zzso zzso and that the zzso of zzso may represent the most likely mechanism zzso zzso stimulate zzso as the vast majority of cells do not express zzso a known G zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, available evidence indicates that zzso activate zzso by a zzso distinct from that zzso by growth factor zzso as it involves the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by G protein zzso zzso
