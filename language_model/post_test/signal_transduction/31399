In this paper, we review experimental advances in molecular zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso with special emphasis on analysis of neural function of proteins involved in zzso zzso their relation with several signaling pathways and with zzso stress in zzso zzso genetic studies have found that zzso in zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso in zzso gene are implicated in zzso zzso Recent studies show that these zzso in addition to its role in zzso processing, are involved in several zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso studies show early synaptic protein zzso in zzso brains and animal zzso DNA damage caused by zzso stress is not completely repaired in zzso and is accumulated in the genes of synaptic zzso Several functional zzso in synaptic genes may be interesting candidates to explore in zzso as genetic zzso of this zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, experimental evidence shows that proteins implicated in zzso zzso have differential roles in several signaling pathways related to zzso and zzso in adult and developing zzso zzso and zzso studies support these zzso We suggest that zzso stress effects on DNA and inherited variations in synaptic genes may explain in part the synaptic dysfunction seen in zzso
