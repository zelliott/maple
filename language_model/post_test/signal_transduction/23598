Crohn's disease representing a clinical zzso of inflammatory zzso disease is a zzso immune disorder with complex zzso zzso Recent zzso association studies of zzso zzso have highlighted on the importance of the zzso pathway, which previously had not been implicated in disease zzso zzso represents an zzso highly zzso zzso process of cellular zzso due to zzso of zzso damaged, or aged proteins and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso terminally zzso in zzso zzso is deeply involved in regulation of cell development and zzso survival and zzso and it also fundamentally affects the inflammatory zzso as well as the innate and zzso arms of immune zzso zzso is mainly activated due to sensors of the innate zzso zzso by pattern recognition zzso zzso The interplay of genes regulating immune functions is strongly influenced by the environment, especially gut resident zzso The basic challenge for zzso immune recognition is the requirement of a simultaneous delicate balance between tolerance and responsiveness towards zzso On the basis of zzso risk genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired sensing and handling of zzso bacteria by innate zzso closely interrelated with the zzso and unfolded protein pathways seem to be the most relevant zzso zzso zzso is now widely considered as a key regulator mechanism with the capacity to integrate several aspects of Crohn's disease zzso In this review, recent advances in the exciting zzso of zzso coding zzso zzso and innate immunity are zzso
