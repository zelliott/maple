zzso evidence supports the importance of zzso signaling in the zzso and progression of zzso zzso signaling is implicated in many different zzso and pathological processes in the zzso High blood pressure is in part determined by elevated total peripheral vascular resistance, which is ascribed to zzso of zzso function and structural zzso of blood zzso zzso zzso zzso usually induced by excessive production of zzso oxygen species zzso and/or by decreases in zzso activity, can induce zzso of vascular zzso zzso increase vascular tone by influencing the regulatory role of zzso and by direct effects on the zzso of vascular smooth zzso zzso contribute to vascular zzso by influencing zzso zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso growth and death of vascular cells, cell migration, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, there are diverse roles of the vascular zzso system in hypertension, suggesting that the complexity of zzso signaling in distinct spatial zzso should be considered for a better understanding of zzso
