The zzso zzso a predicted structural element observed in sensor proteins from all zzso of life, is proposed to transmit signals between zzso sensory input zzso and zzso output zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located just inside the zzso membrane and are projected to form two short zzso zzso zzso and zzso joined by an zzso zzso The presumed zzso are comprised of zzso zzso in zzso repeats, with only three positions exhibiting strong zzso We generated zzso zzso at these three positions and throughout the zzso zzso in the zzso coli nitrate sensor zzso zzso and screened the resulting zzso for defective responses to zzso Most zzso zzso in this region resulted in a zzso zzso mimicking the zzso state, and only one zzso (a zzso zzso before zzso was essential for zzso zzso zzso We also scanned the zzso zzso zzso with an overlapping set of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso resulted in zzso zzso Two deletions in zzso resulted in a novel reversed response zzso in which the response to zzso was the opposite of that seen for the zzso zzso These observations are consistent with the proposed zzso zzso structure, show that the zzso zzso plays an active role in zzso signal zzso and indicate that the two zzso zzso have different roles in signal zzso
