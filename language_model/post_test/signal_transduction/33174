Based on the presence of multiple zzso motifs in the zzso zzso we tested its possible association with zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling complexes through zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These associations are regulated by zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that they may be part of zzso zzso cellular signaling zzso In zzso binding studies indicate that zzso zzso of zzso or zzso are required for their binding to zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be a unique adapter protein for zzso zzso signaling and may be involved in the regulation of zzso signaling zzso
