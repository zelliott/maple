In the developing zzso zzso precise coordination of retinal zzso cell proliferation and zzso exit is essential for the formation of a functionally mature zzso zzso or disrupted cell proliferation may lead to zzso retinal zzso or zzso Both zzso and zzso factors regulate the proliferation of zzso cells during zzso zzso There is now growing evidence that in the developing zzso zzso both slow and fast neurotransmitter systems zzso the proliferation of retinal zzso zzso Classic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are released, via zzso or zzso mechanisms, into the immature retinal zzso Furthermore, these zzso signal through functional receptors even before zzso are zzso Recent evidence indicates that the zzso of zzso and zzso receptors may regulate the zzso machinery and consequently the expansion of the retinal zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso appear to have opposing roles, inducing retinal zzso zzso zzso In this review, we present recent findings that begin to zzso the roles of zzso as regulators of zzso cell proliferation at early stages of retinal zzso These studies also raise several new questions, including how these zzso regulate specific zzso pathways and the mechanisms by which retinal zzso cells integrate the signals from zzso and other zzso factors during zzso zzso zzso
