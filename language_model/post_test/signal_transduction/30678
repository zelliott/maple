zzso and zzso zzso bases zzso are precursors to more complex zzso and play distinct signaling roles crucial for cell growth and zzso zzso reactions within the zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the formation of these zzso zzso of target of zzso complex 2 zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso however, the precise step regulated by this complex remains zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso cells deficient in zzso activity are impaired for de zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso We find that zzso regulates this step in part by zzso the zzso zzso zzso and that this step is antagonized by the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is activated independently by zzso the direct precursors to zzso our data suggest a model wherein zzso signaling is coupled with zzso levels to control zzso activity and, ultimately, regulate zzso zzso
