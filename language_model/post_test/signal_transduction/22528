The zzso signal zzso system zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a response regulator zzso zzso play important roles in sensing and reacting to environmental changes, and in bacterial zzso Previously, we have identified and characterized zzso in zzso zzso a severe plant zzso zzso at zzso zzso Here we conducted a comparative zzso analysis of zzso in 53 zzso of 16 zzso zzso These species include important plant, animal, human, and insect zzso zzso or symbiotic zzso Comparative zzso analysis revealed that zzso contain eight pairs of core zzso zzso trees reconstructed from a zzso of the core set of zzso from zzso and for individual zzso proteins from species in zzso showed that most zzso protein trees in the zzso or in species of the zzso agreed well with that of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso It also showed that zzso relationships existed between zzso partners of the zzso and zzso Several core zzso were quite ancient and universal based on zzso analysis of protein zzso These results indicate that the core zzso are relatively zzso and suggest that these zzso may have maintained their ancient core zzso and might acquire specific new zzso for their survival in different environments or zzso or may have evolved new zzso of the core zzso for adaptation to different ecological zzso
