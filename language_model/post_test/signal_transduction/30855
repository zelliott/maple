zzso zzso and maturation are three major zzso of the development of blood zzso Although many receptors required for blood vessel formation have been zzso the zzso signal zzso pathways involved in vascular maturation remain zzso zzso zzso fail to develop beyond zzso days because of a lack of blood vessel zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso function in embryonic vascular vessels is still largely zzso Here we show a normal development pattern of zzso cells in zzso zzso but a zzso of smooth muscle cells at the zzso side of the zzso This zzso results from arrested vascular maturation characterized by the failure of mural cells to migrate around zzso zzso This migration zzso is also observed when zzso growth zzso zzso controlled migration is studied in zzso embryonic zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso exhibit a significant growth zzso indicating that zzso is required to maintain the viability of zzso zzso The zzso signal is zzso through the zzso signaling pathway, and a downstream target of zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso is required for smooth muscle cell migration and zzso a novel mechanism involving communication between zzso and zzso in vascular zzso
