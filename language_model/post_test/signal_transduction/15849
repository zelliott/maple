zzso of plant immunity is associated with dramatic changes in the cellular zzso zzso Both zzso and reductive bursts have been described that trigger a set of down stream responses resulting in zzso of the zzso and establishment of disease zzso Nonetheless, how these zzso changes are sensed and signal to downstream regulators remained a missing link in studies of plant zzso Emerging evidence now indicates that zzso changes in the cellular zzso environment are sensed by zzso zzso zzso of key regulatory zzso zzso degrees of zzso zzso zzso modifications control the activity, zzso zzso and stability of regulatory zzso These diverse effects on protein function make zzso zzso modifications potent zzso of plant zzso
