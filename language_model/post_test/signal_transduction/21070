The involvement of zzso in the salicylic acid zzso signal zzso zzso leading to zzso gene induction has previously been demonstrated using zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that in tobacco suspension cells, zzso induced a rapid and transient zzso of a zzso zzso that uses zzso basic protein as a zzso This zzso is called the zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso of zzso which induce zzso genes and enhanced resistance, also activated this zzso whereas inactive zzso did zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was associated with its zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso tobacco suspension culture zzso The zzso zzso zzso is strongly zzso on a zzso zzso and treatment with either protein zzso or zzso zzso abolished its zzso Using zzso corresponding to the sequences of internal zzso zzso we cloned the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence indicates that it belongs to the zzso zzso family and that it is distinct from the other plant zzso zzso previously implicated in stress responses, suggesting that different members of the zzso zzso family are activated by different zzso
