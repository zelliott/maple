zzso oxygen (HBO) has been used in the clinical setting to heal problem wounds, yet its direct effects on zzso are not zzso The present study evaluates the effects of HBO on the growth and zzso production of growth factors by zzso grown in an in zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso were zzso in zzso media and subjected to daily 90-minute HBO treatments at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of pressure for 7 consecutive zzso Cell proliferation and zzso zzso for basic zzso growth factor zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso were performed on days 1, 3, 5, and zzso 

On day 1, HBO inhibited growth of zzso at all atmospheric pressures compared with zzso By day 7, cell proliferation was significantly enhanced only in cells treated with zzso HBO compared with zzso zzso of zzso was significantly increased by zzso zzso on day 1; zzso levels slightly increased with HBO treatment on day 1, but this effect was not statistically zzso zzso levels were zzso on day 1 only for control and zzso cells at zzso zzso and not zzso for any cell groups after day zzso 

These results suggest that daily HBO treatment enhances the growth of zzso when administered to a critical zzso Also, HBO appears to directly effect zzso production of zzso growth factors on initial zzso We zzso that zzso possess the ability to respond to zzso directly, which causes changes in cell signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and growth factor zzso
