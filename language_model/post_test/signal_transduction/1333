The signal zzso pathways and zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling cascade regulate a variety of cellular zzso including proliferation and differentiation in zzso To zzso the mechanisms of signal transmission required for the regulation of gap and tight junctions during DNA synthesis in rat zzso we determined changes of expression and function of gap and tight junctions of cells grown in primary culture, using zzso of signaling pathways for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso During the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso of gap junction protein zzso and of tight junction protein zzso markedly decreased with reduction of gap zzso zzso communication zzso and the fence function of tight zzso In Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein decreased and zzso zzso protein in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso increased during the stimulation of DNA zzso During zzso of DNA zzso the changes of zzso and zzso returned to control levels, as did both zzso In treatment with the zzso before DNA zzso zzso inhibited the changes of expression and function of zzso but not zzso without zzso of cell growth, whereas zzso completely inhibited cell zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso zzso plays an important role for zzso proliferation of rat zzso and that changes of zzso in zzso during the stimulation of DNA synthesis may be in part controlled through zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso protein may be a target of activated zzso zzso in zzso
