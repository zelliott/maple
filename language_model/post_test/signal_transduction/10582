zzso zzso infection is a serious complication in zzso individuals and in patients with zzso zzso We have previously shown that the type III zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso in various cultured cell lines via its zzso zzso zzso The zzso process was further shown to involve intrinsic zzso zzso requiring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infection resulted in zzso 8 zzso in zzso cells, which was inhibited by zzso of a dominant negative version of zzso death domain zzso suggesting that zzso zzso was zzso In fact, zzso laser scanning zzso showed that zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso In addition, the zzso activity of the zzso was required for the induction of zzso zzso and zzso 8 zzso However, blocking the zzso interaction by zzso zzso to zzso or to zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso 8 and zzso 3 zzso neither did the zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso suggesting that zzso 8 zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso 8 zzso involves zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso 8 by zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso zzso whereas it rendered zzso cells markedly increased resistance towards zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso through a mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso 8 zzso
