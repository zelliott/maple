zzso acid zzso plays a major role in zzso of the nervous system and has been reported to induce differentiation in zzso cell zzso To identify zzso signaling pathways involved in such differentiation zzso two zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were extensively zzso Northern zzso experiments determined that of the three zzso zzso only zzso was significantly zzso with respectively weak or zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors were zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed the zzso expression of zzso and absence of zzso and weak levels of zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso and induced a drastic increase of zzso (both at the zzso and protein zzso To further characterize the function of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, nuclear extracts from zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso Three specific retarded complexes were observed which were significantly decreased or shifted in the presence of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment dramatically induced a zzso zzso zzso Treatment with combinations of zzso or zzso zzso with a zzso zzso or with a zzso zzso alone, induced zzso supporting the probability that both zzso or zzso zzso are involved in zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The availability of novel synthetic zzso zzso zzso should provide the possibility of tissue specific therapeutic zzso
