zzso from the zzso zzso with a deletion in the zzso gene coding for the active site of neutral zzso 2 zzso zzso increased amounts of zzso zzso This was reversed by zzso with the zzso zzso suggesting a connection between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in storage of zzso zzso and cholesterol with a 50% reduction in zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that increased zzso zzso resulted from increased zzso zzso 2 zzso activity localized to zzso zzso zzso Although cholesterol levels were also elevated in zzso zzso from mouse zzso deficient in zzso acid zzso activity zzso of the zzso zzso there was no increase in zzso zzso We then showed that in zzso zzso the reduced zzso was associated with decreased zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso and increased zzso of its zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso and zzso although zzso was zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso increased zzso synthesis and zzso We propose that zzso are the key zzso of the regulation of zzso zzso via zzso and the zzso zzso
