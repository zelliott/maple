zzso zzso has recently been found to relay zzso signals to zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso produces positive zzso zzso The present study was designed to examine whether zzso a zzso DR zzso zzso also produces zzso zzso 

zzso function was examined in both isolated zzso and hearts subjected to zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso in rat or mouse kidney zzso Moreover, zzso increased the zzso of cell zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso in rat or mouse cardiac zzso These effects were significantly attenuated by blockade of either zzso signal regulated zzso 1/2 zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso A, suggesting a role of zzso and zzso zzso in the positive zzso effect of zzso More importantly, zzso significantly increased cell survival rates for at least 24 h after zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso also protected hearts against zzso injury in both zzso and isolated zzso The protective effect was reversed by blockade of zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso of protein zzso zzso The involvement of zzso and zzso was further confirmed by examining the zzso of these zzso with western zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso with zzso zzso both positive zzso and zzso effects via stimulation of zzso zzso The unique properties of zzso may make zzso zzso a promising drug to treat heart zzso
