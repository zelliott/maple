The Ras zzso of small G proteins contributes zzso to numerous cellular and zzso processes zzso zzso Olsen and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000, 12, zzso This family comprises a large class of proteins (more than zzso which all share a common zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to create the products zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Takai, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, 81, zzso For this reason Ras family zzso which include the zzso zzso zzso Ran and zzso zzso are classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 2000, 12, zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso zzso thus, Ras family zzso participate in signal zzso Ras signaling depends on binding to zzso Many of the known zzso can bind to multiple Ras zzso often leading to common cellular zzso but each Ras zzso also engages specific zzso pathways to mediate unique zzso Further, each Ras zzso can zzso multiple signaling zzso indicating the presence of cellular zzso which allow for zzso in zzso interactions while also maintaining zzso Small distinctions in zzso structure, and/or cellular regulation contribute to these differences in zzso binding and subsequent cellular zzso A major focus of investigation in the Ras signaling field is identifying the zzso of these individualized zzso This review will attempt to zzso the current state of understanding of this question (with a particular focus on the Ras zzso and the approaches being taken to address it, and will discuss prospective areas for future zzso
