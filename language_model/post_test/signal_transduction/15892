Root system architecture depends on lateral root zzso initiation that takes place in a relatively narrow zzso window zzso Here, we analyzed the role of zzso zzso established along the parent root in defining this zzso for zzso zzso zzso between zzso distribution and response, and zzso control of zzso initiation were analyzed in zzso zzso and tomato zzso zzso In both zzso and tomato roots, a well defined zone, where zzso content and response are zzso zzso the position of a zzso for founder cell zzso and zzso zzso We show that in the zone of zzso minimum zzso cells have highest probability to become founder cells and that zzso perception via the zzso pathway, and polar zzso zzso are essential for the establishment of this zzso Altogether, this study reveals that the same zzso zzso zzso can act simultaneously as a zzso trigger of zzso founder cell identity and as a zzso signal defining positioning of the founder cell zzso This zzso minimum zone might represent an important control mechanism ensuring the zzso initiation zzso and the zzso zzso initiation zzso
