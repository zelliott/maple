zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso in the zzso zzso We previously reported that kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were transformed into zzso cells by gene zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated the altered characteristics of cell zzso in these zzso transition zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso were tested, and cell zzso to zzso was found to be specifically increased in the zzso cells compared to zzso The expression of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso and zzso resulting in an increase in the formation of complexes such as zzso and zzso These zzso also contributed to the enhanced binding of zzso In the zzso cells, the zzso of zzso a downstream target of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on attachment to zzso or collagen zzso zzso signaling through zzso was also promoted on attachment to zzso suggesting some of the correlation between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, on treatment with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso the enhanced zzso signaling was suppressed with a zzso decrease in the formation of complexes between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso zzso by modulating zzso signaling through altered zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cells, suggesting a novel regulatory role for zzso in zzso
