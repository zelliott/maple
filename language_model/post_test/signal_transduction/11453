Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso factors activated in response to zzso and growth zzso zzso active zzso has been shown to mediate zzso transformation in cultured cells and induce tumor formation in zzso An increasing number of zzso cell lines as well as samples from human cancer have been reported to express zzso active zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso cancer cell lines express high levels of zzso active zzso In this study, we show that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a dominant negative zzso zzso significantly suppresses the growth of zzso and breast cancer cell lines harboring zzso active zzso In the zzso cancer cell lines, zzso also diminished the zzso of zzso zzso DNA binding activity, and the expression of zzso Further, zzso induced significant zzso in zzso and breast cancer cell lines expressing high levels of zzso active zzso but had a less profound effect on normal cells lacking zzso active zzso zzso also enhanced zzso induced by zzso in zzso cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach for treating zzso and breast zzso
