Increased risk of zzso labor has been linked to zzso infection with zzso zzso and group B zzso Although various experimental models have been developed to study the role of zzso infection in zzso labor, they typically exclude the initial interaction between zzso zzso zzso from zzso vessels into the avascular fetal zzso and infecting zzso In this work, we zzso whether inflammatory molecules zzso by zzso zzso zzso stimulate the zzso production of zzso involved in human zzso Using a zzso process beginning with zzso circulating zzso as a proxy for zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso zzso with plasma from zzso whole blood zzso with group B zzso resulted in a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso levels in zzso zzso changes in the zzso tissue arrangement and a decrease in collagen content demonstrated the degradation of the zzso zzso following this zzso In contrast, plasma from blood zzso with zzso zzso induced a highly significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso without changes in the zzso zzso organization or zzso These data demonstrate that group B zzso induce degradation of the zzso as a result of zzso production, probably via zzso whereas zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso probably via zzso potentially stimulating zzso zzso Our study provides novel evidence that the zzso cells circulating within the zzso zzso respond zzso to an infectious agent, triggering alternative molecular signaling pathways leading to human zzso
