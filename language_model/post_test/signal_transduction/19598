zzso signals regulate trafficking events to reorganize proteins at the plasma membrane zzso however, few zzso of this regulation have been zzso zzso relay signaling cues to the trafficking machinery by controlling zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, we show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso control zzso sorting of zzso the general zzso acid zzso in response to zzso These studies are the first to demonstrate association of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso proteins (AP) and show that zzso and zzso interact directly with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso trafficking of zzso requires zzso which mediates zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso During nitrogen zzso zzso zzso of zzso may stimulate zzso incorporation into zzso zzso to promote zzso trafficking from zzso to the zzso zzso Ultimately, increased zzso recycling of zzso from zzso results in higher zzso levels within cells and at the PM by diverting Gap away from trafficking pathways that lead to zzso zzso This work defines a new role for zzso in membrane trafficking and offers insight into how zzso coordinate signaling events with protein zzso
