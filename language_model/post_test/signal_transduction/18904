Vitamin A is established as an important immune regulator, but the mechanisms zzso vitamin A regulates T cell biology are poorly zzso In this study, we show that an active zzso of vitamin A, zzso zzso acid zzso zzso stimulates T cell proliferation by modulating zzso signaling downstream of zzso and independent of the induction of zzso Thus, at zzso as low as zzso zzso zzso enhanced the division of normal human T zzso that were simultaneously zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso At the optimal concentration of zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase in T cell proliferation was zzso The induced proliferation was preceded by increased zzso of the zzso protein and enhanced zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso effect of zzso was found to be particularly directed toward increased expression of zzso D3 at both the zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso D3 expression as well as on cell proliferation was completely abolished in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso or blocking zzso alpha zzso and zzso also enhanced zzso D3 expression and T cell proliferation in the presence of zzso zzso Finally, we showed that the zzso effect of zzso was zzso by zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso and completely inhibited by a zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso via zzso stimulates zzso signaling in a zzso manner to enhance zzso D3 expression and thereby promote T cell zzso
