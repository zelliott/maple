Although short-term treatment with zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to prevent early zzso zzso its long-term effects and molecular mechanisms, including zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We examined whether zzso treatment zzso prevention of zzso zzso and fibrosis, and affects the zzso signaling zzso in rats with chronic progressive zzso serum (ATS) zzso induced by repeated ATS injections on days 0 and zzso 

zzso and zzso rats were treated with either zzso or control zzso zzso twice weekly for 4 weeks from days 7 to 35 (each group, zzso zzso Renal zzso and cortical expression of zzso zzso zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso type I zzso and zzso zzso zzso were examined by zzso Western zzso and/or real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The binding of zzso in zzso cortical cell zzso to the zzso element zzso was investigated by the zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso rats developed heavy zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso deposition resulting in zzso zzso zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and preferential zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso activity were also zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in marked zzso of chronic progressive ATS zzso at 8 zzso 

In chronic progressive ATS zzso the zzso signaling was zzso zzso blockade by zzso suppressed the progression of zzso zzso at least in part, via zzso of activated zzso zzso
