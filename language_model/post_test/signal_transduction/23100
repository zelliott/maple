zzso is a novel, zzso zzso hormone that has been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on zzso zzso is zzso at lower levels, in human brains and zzso of the precursor of zzso zzso decreases neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem zzso No previous studies have evaluated whether zzso may directly regulate zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso signaling were studied in zzso using mouse zzso zzso cell zzso 

We observed that cell proliferation is regulated by zzso in a zzso manner in mouse zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso of zzso 5 to zzso had no effect on cell proliferation when compared to zzso By contrast, pharmacological zzso of zzso 50 to zzso increased cell proliferation when compared to zzso Similar to these results regarding zzso effects on cell zzso we also observed that only pharmacological zzso of zzso increased zzso but not zzso and/or zzso zzso Finally, we observed that zzso did not activate either zzso protein 2, a specific zzso outgrowth marker, or zzso a specific zzso marker in mouse zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso in pharmacological zzso increases cell proliferation in mouse zzso zzso cells via zzso but not zzso and/or zzso signaling zzso By contrast, neither zzso nor pharmacological zzso of zzso alter markers of zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso cell zzso
