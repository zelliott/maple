zzso has been identified as one of the zzso of the small zzso protein zzso zzso evidence has demonstrated that the zzso zzso plays an important role in various cellular functions, not only in vascular smooth muscle contraction but also in zzso zzso organization, cell zzso and zzso zzso and gene expressions, all of which may be involved in the zzso of zzso Indeed, animal experiments have demonstrated that zzso zzso effectively suppress coronary artery zzso and that long-term zzso of zzso zzso the development of coronary zzso zzso and even causes zzso of coronary vascular zzso in zzso Recent clinical studies also have demonstrated the zzso effect of a zzso inhibitor on coronary artery zzso in patients with zzso angina and on zzso zzso zzso in patients with stable effort angina with adequate zzso It is possible that zzso is also involved in the zzso of other forms of cardiovascular zzso Thus, zzso could be regarded as a novel therapeutic target in treatment of cardiovascular zzso
