Identification of signal zzso pathways that are critically involved in Alzheimer's disease zzso is essential for the development of zzso zzso and drug zzso 

This study is aimed at identifying protein zzso and signaling pathways that are activated in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso profiling was employed for the detection of protein zzso activity in zzso brain tissue derived from zzso and zzso zzso control zzso Global zzso zzso activity profiles are identified applying a zzso array system consisting of 140 peptides derived from known zzso zzso sequences zzso attached to porous chips, through which a protein solution is constantly pumped up and zzso zzso zzso is determined by measuring the association of a mixture of zzso labeled zzso raised against zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from freshly frozen zzso brain tissue from zzso controls and zzso confirmed zzso cases show zzso zzso of zzso In zzso and control cases, peptides that are zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso zzso activity profiling can be used to reveal novel zzso and new signaling pathways involved in zzso zzso
