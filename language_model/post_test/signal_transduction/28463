Adult zzso neural zzso cells can differentiate into zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso central nervous system, but the molecular mechanisms that control their differentiation are not yet well zzso zzso growth factor I zzso can promote the differentiation of cells already committed to an zzso lineage during zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso affects zzso neural zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso stimulates the differentiation of zzso adult rat zzso neural zzso cells into zzso Modeling analysis indicates that the actions of zzso are zzso zzso differentiation by zzso appears to be zzso through an zzso of bone zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the zzso leads to an increase in zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of a single zzso zzso that can influence the fate choice of zzso adult neural zzso cells to an zzso zzso
