The receptors for human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso respectively, consists of two zzso alpha and zzso both of which are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso beta zzso and several cellular proteins is observed after zzso zzso We analyzed the role of zzso zzso in the zzso beta zzso and the nature of zzso zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso using several zzso beta zzso zzso In addition to the zzso region, a membrane zzso region zzso zzso of the zzso beta was required for zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso existed within the region 544 to zzso and substitution of zzso to zzso in zzso beta zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso In contrast, the same substitution in a wild type zzso did not affect zzso induced activities such as zzso zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso but the substitution abolished zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso is not essential for zzso zzso and several zzso zzso cooperate for zzso zzso It is well documented that zzso or zzso activate zzso in zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso functions, however, is largely zzso We examined the role of zzso in zzso induced signaling zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain suppressed zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso was involved in both signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso in zzso zzso however, these zzso events were inhibited by the expression of delta zzso Taken together, these results indicate the zzso is a primary zzso regulating all the known activities of zzso zzso mediates zzso induced zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
