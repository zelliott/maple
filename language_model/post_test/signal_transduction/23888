zzso acid zzso is present at elevated zzso in the zzso and plasma of zzso cancer zzso zzso cancer cells produce and release zzso both zzso and after zzso zzso can induce zzso survival, zzso and resistance to chemotherapy of zzso cancer zzso This suggests that zzso may be critically important for the development or progression of zzso cancer and is thus a potential target for zzso In this study, we demonstrate that introduction of the integral membrane zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso with selectivity for zzso into zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells decreases zzso activity, increases zzso and decreases tumor growth in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso parental cells decreased the zzso activity of the parental cells, compatible with zzso decreasing levels of an zzso mediator, likely zzso zzso with this contention, the expression of zzso was associated with increased rates of zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso activity were substantially reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to zzso the effects of zzso combined with the inability of an zzso inactive zzso to alter cellular function, suggests that the major effect of zzso was to increase the zzso of zzso zzso Thus genetic or pharmacological manipulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso or downstream signaling is an attractive approach for therapy of zzso zzso
