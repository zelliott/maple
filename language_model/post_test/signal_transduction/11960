The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso remains poorly zzso It is also unclear how these functions are zzso with external zzso Here we unveil a series of molecular interactions in zzso at the surface of T zzso with potent effects on zzso and zzso in these cells, and zzso with zzso zzso These interactions were controlled by the signature zzso of T helper zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso was found to play a key role for zzso zzso by promoting development of polarized cell shape and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell surface expression of zzso through zzso Cell surface expressed zzso induced zzso and processing of zzso while zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso synthesis of zzso and zzso through zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex inhibited zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso regulated zzso expression and promoted zzso through zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was connected to zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso through zzso The zzso zzso mechanism antagonized zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in collaboration with zzso directs a zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells seem programmed to prioritize movement before zzso through this zzso In conclusion, vital decision-making in T zzso regulating zzso adhesive interactions and zzso are integrated through a molecular mechanism connecting different cell surface receptors and their zzso zzso
