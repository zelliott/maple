The role of the signal transmission zzso of zzso A zzso in mast cell zzso was examined using rat zzso mast zzso First of all, we investigated the cellular distribution of zzso using fluorescent zzso This indicated that zzso is immediately incorporated into cells and distributes in zzso around the zzso We then investigated the effect of zzso on mast cell protein zzso zzso which is part of the signal zzso cascade for zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso induced by compound zzso zzso zzso at 10 to 100 zzso and zzso zzso at more than 50 zzso in a zzso zzso As far as the zzso zzso change in zzso cells was concerned, zzso (10 zzso suppressed the rise in zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso while zzso did not suppress the rise induced by zzso zzso This evidence suggests that zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso influx, but zzso does not act on the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso We also investigated the influence of zzso on the zzso and membrane changes using mast cells and zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited the zzso assembly formation in zzso zzso mast cells induced by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso from 3 to 1000 zzso in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso influx and zzso assembly formation, and membrane stabilization are involved in the zzso effect of zzso in mast cell zzso
