zzso memory is characterized by heightened zzso zzso G zzso production caused in part by enhanced plasma cell formation zzso by zzso zzso and zzso segments in zzso zzso B cell zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso tail enhances zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso signaling responses to zzso by analyzing B cells from zzso transgenic mice with zzso receptors or zzso zzso receptors containing the zzso tail zzso The zzso tail segment enhanced zzso calcium responses but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and crosses to zzso mice established that zzso tail enhancement of calcium and zzso responses, as well as marginal zone B cell formation, was not due to diminished zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso profiling showed no evidence for enhanced signaling by the zzso tail for zzso zzso or nuclear factor zzso response genes and little evidence for any enhanced gene zzso Instead, almost half of the zzso gene response in zzso B cells was diminished zzso by the zzso tail zzso These findings suggest a novel zzso hypothesis to explain how switching to zzso enhances B cell memory responses, zzso decreased zzso signaling to genes that oppose marginal zone and plasma cell differentiation enhances the formation of these key cell zzso
