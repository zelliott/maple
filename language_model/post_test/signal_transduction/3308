zzso zzso leukemia zzso a zzso of mature B cells, is incurable with zzso zzso from the zzso support zzso cell survival and proliferation and may zzso chemotherapy zzso ON zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is entering phase III trials for zzso zzso Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ON zzso against zzso cells in zzso and investigate the molecular effects of this drug on tumor zzso 

zzso of ON zzso against zzso cells from 34 patients was determined in zzso with flow zzso of cells stained with zzso V and zzso Global gene expression profiling on zzso zzso flow zzso Western zzso and zzso with zzso cells were used to delineate ON zzso mechanism of zzso 

ON zzso induced zzso in zzso B cells without significant toxicity against T cells or normal B zzso ON zzso was equally active against zzso cells associated with a more aggressive disease course zzso zzso variable region zzso adverse zzso than against cells without these zzso Gene expression profiling revealed two main mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso that resulted in an zzso stress response through zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso culminating in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells from drug-induced zzso ON zzso also zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso cells on zzso cells and reduced zzso migration of zzso zzso 

These data support the clinical development of ON zzso in zzso
