zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso was found to be induced by different chemical and physical signals, namely the amount and quality of nutrients as well as the zzso and rigidity of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted in the zzso zzso of the zzso G protein was specifically defective in zzso induced by carbon zzso A similar zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso effect of zzso addition to zzso of these zzso confirmed the involvement of zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was delayed in carbon zzso zzso but completely unable to zzso on zzso zzso Based on these data, it is proposed that the zzso response of zzso zzso zzso is controlled by three zzso zzso zzso induction by rich media is zzso dependent on zzso induction by carbon sources requires zzso zzso and zzso and induction by contact to zzso surfaces is absolutely dependent on zzso Other defects of the zzso zzso such as low zzso excessive formation of zzso and delayed host infection, were also restored by zzso zzso studies of zzso growth and differentiation on host zzso revealed that the delayed infection of the zzso zzso was due to a surface sensing zzso leading to a reduced zzso Thus, in addition to their role in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso are required also for proper host surface recognition and penetration ability of zzso zzso
