We review what is presently known about structure, cellular distribution, zzso zzso and function of a new family of human zzso receptors referred to as zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso or zzso zzso receptors zzso These receptors are zzso zzso and functionally related to a group of natural killer zzso cell receptors for zzso class I molecules known as killer cell zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso at least some of them recognize zzso class I zzso Whereas some zzso either inhibit or induce cell zzso others may be zzso as soluble zzso zzso receptors may allow all immune cells to monitor class I expression on other cells and to respond in its absence, just as zzso cells zzso In addition, they may contribute to zzso by establishing zzso thresholds that can be overcome only by relevant triggering stimuli and not by bystander zzso
