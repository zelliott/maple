zzso approaches were used to investigate the potential zzso effects on mice by oral exposure to Nanjing drinking water zzso Changes in the zzso zzso of zzso male mice zzso zzso were monitored and dissected after oral exposure to zzso for zzso No zzso and zzso zzso were observed in the zzso tissue by the end of zzso zzso However, total of zzso genes were changed zzso Thirty-one percent of zzso expressed genes zzso were associated with the functional categories of cell cycle regulation, zzso growth, zzso and signal zzso which are closely implicated in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso revealed that 43 zzso were mapped to several crucial signaling pathways implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In signal zzso network constructed via zzso software, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso relationships obtained from Comparative zzso Database and scientific zzso revealed that the hubs have direct mechanism or zzso relationships with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso prolonged intake of zzso without employing any indoor water treatment strategy might zzso mouse to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as promising zzso of the potential combined zzso
