Cancer stem cells zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and several solid zzso Similar to zzso stem cells, zzso are capable of zzso and differentiation and have the potential for indefinite zzso a function through which they may cause tumor zzso Although conventional zzso treatments might eradicate most zzso cells in a zzso they are potentially ineffective against zzso zzso which may ultimately be responsible for recurrence and zzso Human zzso melanoma is a highly aggressive and drug-resistant zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso molecular signatures, and increased zzso of melanoma zzso with zzso differentiation plasticity strongly suggest the presence and involvement of zzso melanoma stem cells zzso in the initiation and propagation of this zzso Here, we review these findings in the context of functional properties ascribed to zzso stem cells and zzso in other zzso We discuss the association of zzso signaling zzso zzso instability, and zzso mimicry phenomena observed in melanoma zzso in light of the zzso zzso We propose that a subset of zzso may be responsible for melanoma zzso tumor zzso and zzso progression and that targeted zzso of a zzso compartment could therefore ultimately lead to stable zzso and perhaps cures of zzso zzso
