zzso fluid flow plays an essential role in the breaking of zzso zzso symmetry in mouse zzso but it has remained unclear how the flow is sensed by the zzso We report that the zzso channel zzso zzso is required specifically in the zzso crown cells for sensing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso forms of zzso shows that the zzso zzso of zzso is essential for correct zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso which lack all zzso failed to respond to an artificial flow, restoration of primary zzso in crown cells rescued the response to the zzso Our results thus suggest that zzso flow is sensed in a manner dependent on zzso by the zzso of crown cells located at the edge of the zzso
