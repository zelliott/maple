The zzso of zzso zzso which is critical to normal zzso gastrointestinal development, is implicated in the development of various tumors, including zzso zzso In the zzso a precursor zzso zzso the Sonic zzso zzso when compared with normal tissue and zzso The present study was designed to investigate zzso related protein expression in zzso zzso and the zzso sequence in the colon and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso of the zzso 69 zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso and 30 normal colon samples were used in the zzso We checked the expression of zzso both patched zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and compared the expression rate of each zzso 

Almost all zzso 22 of 23 zzso expressed zzso In other groups, 4 of 17 zzso zzso zzso 7 of 31 zzso zzso zzso 13 of 38 zzso zzso zzso and none of the 30 normal samples expressed zzso The rate of expression in zzso and zzso gradually increased in accordance with tumor zzso 

This result indicates that zzso zzso and zzso expression may be a trigger for the zzso zzso This study suggests a potential therapeutic target of zzso blockade in zzso
