zzso of regulated zzso zzso protein zzso activity zzso are zzso that can increase zzso zzso activity, suggesting that zzso may regulate the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso In the present study, we focused on the regulation of zzso and its role in zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso Although there was no zzso zzso zzso rhythm in the rat zzso zzso and treatment of cultured zzso with zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso level of zzso the zzso state and zzso distribution of zzso protein were regulated by zzso zzso analysis combined with zzso zzso or zzso treatment showed that zzso protein was rapidly zzso and zzso to the nucleus after zzso stimulation in rat zzso Similar zzso of zzso also occurred zzso in the rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso with zzso (a zzso zzso but not zzso (an zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso indicating the participation of the zzso zzso zzso Studies with protein zzso zzso showed that only zzso acid and zzso A were effective in blocking the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of protein zzso 2A in this zzso Moreover, zzso zzso had an enhancing effect on zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso stimulation causes nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso the protein through a zzso mechanism and that nuclear zzso of zzso appears to regulate zzso zzso by zzso in the rat zzso zzso
