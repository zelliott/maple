Single zzso zzso zzso in the transforming growth zzso gene zzso have been zzso associated with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso dysfunction following cardiac zzso The impact of genetic zzso related to the zzso system zzso and zzso zzso which are implicated in zzso zzso is zzso The primary objective of this study was to validate the association between two common zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso transplant zzso zzso The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of candidate genes related to the zzso zzso zzso and other elements involved in the zzso signaling of these zzso 

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 158 heart transplant recipients treated with zzso and evaluated the association between select zzso and the estimated zzso zzso rate as calculated by the zzso of Diet in Renal Disease simplified zzso A total of 273 zzso distributed in 44 genes were zzso 

No association was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso in the protein zzso zzso gene zzso zzso which is implicated in the zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso estimated zzso zzso rate after adjusting for possible zzso zzso This marker is in linkage zzso with two zzso located in putative regulatory regions of the gene zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso may be a potential predictor of zzso zzso in heart transplant recipients, and could therefore be a promising candidate to identify patients who are most susceptible to this adverse drug zzso
