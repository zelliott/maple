zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is found not only in the brain, but is also abundantly expressed in the zzso germ zzso However, the zzso role of zzso zzso remains zzso zzso studies showed a considerable number of zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of round zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso were examined for the zzso zzso of zzso binding sites and zzso The highest levels of zzso binding sites and zzso were found in the zzso followed by the zzso and the lowest levels in the membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein showed a specific competitive zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso and 27, with a Ki of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso to the zzso of zzso only slightly activated zzso zzso while it markedly zzso the expression and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso did not activate zzso but zzso and zzso still zzso Because zzso which binds both zzso and zzso is expressed in the zzso the findings suggest that zzso zzso proteins are also present and coupled to zzso The zzso zzso does not seem to require a zzso zzso Because zzso and its receptors are zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may directly interact with the zzso zzso protein without the zzso being released into the zzso zzso This possibility is supported by the observation that zzso zzso zzso in zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso This mechanism may be called zzso and its zzso significance is zzso
