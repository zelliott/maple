zzso zzso is a member of a small family of three related zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unusually broad array of regulatory functions, which include roles in cell cycle and zzso a variety of zzso functions, cell zzso zzso and stem cell zzso zzso zzso the expression of a very large number of zzso but the magnitude of the majority of the regulatory effects is only zzso or zzso zzso can both activate and repress the promoters of its target zzso Identification of genes directly regulated by zzso has been an enduring question in the zzso We report here zzso expression profiling of a high resolution time course of zzso zzso using zzso cells in which zzso activity can be modulated from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso presented is the largest reported to date with zzso zzso regulated genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene expression patterns fit well with the known biological functions of zzso We describe several novel findings and present tools for further data zzso Although the mechanisms of zzso zzso by zzso are well zzso how zzso zzso an even greater number of genes remains incompletely zzso One mechanism involves the binding of zzso to other, positively acting zzso factors, and interfering with their zzso We identified zzso genes likely to be direct zzso targets, and analyzed the promoters of the zzso genes to identify zzso factors that could be targets of zzso zzso
