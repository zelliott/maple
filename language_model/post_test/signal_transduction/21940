At least zzso of childhood obesity is due to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a seven zzso zzso zzso is important in the regulation of feeding behavior and body zzso The specific pathways of zzso signaling remain in investigative zzso To further understand its function, we hypothesized that the zzso zzso activates the zzso C signaling pathway, resulting in zzso of zzso calcium in immortalized zzso zzso zzso 

Changes in zzso calcium were measured after loading zzso cells with zzso zzso were treated with zzso an zzso stimulating hormone zzso and zzso calcium changes were zzso zzso treated with zzso were also treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess the specific zzso zzso involved, zzso zzso were treated with the zzso C inhibitor zzso and its inactive zzso zzso zzso were also performed after zzso of zzso receptors with zzso zzso Additional experiments were conducted in a zzso buffer zzso Data were analyzed by zzso with statistical significance of P zzso zzso 

zzso treatment zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the calcium zzso Treatment with zzso (10 zzso attenuated the calcium response, while zzso (10 zzso had minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the calcium zzso and the use of zzso buffer did not affect the zzso of the calcium zzso 

Our study demonstrates that, upon zzso zzso the zzso zzso mediates increases in zzso calcium through the zzso C dependent signaling zzso zzso the zzso importance of calcium signaling by the zzso zzso may be important for future development of therapeutic zzso
