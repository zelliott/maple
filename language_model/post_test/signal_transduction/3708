zzso of human zzso zzso lacking zzso chains at zzso and zzso were zzso from the culture media of insect cells by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso As previously reported, while zzso lacking zzso at zzso and zzso had similar zzso binding activities compared with the wild type zzso zzso zzso they differed in their signal zzso zzso The zzso lacking zzso at zzso had zzso less zzso activity than zzso but the absence of zzso at zzso resulted in the reduction of zzso zzso by zzso A similar effect of the zzso was observed on the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso showed significant zzso The zzso lacking zzso at zzso had a much higher negative mean zzso zzso zzso at 200 zzso and a lower negative zzso at 220 zzso than that lacking zzso at zzso and zzso The zzso rates of the zzso and zzso zzso deficient zzso at pH 3 and room temperature, measured by using zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The results of both CD zzso and zzso studies strongly suggest that the absence of zzso at zzso results in zzso changes in the zzso which might explain the loss in its signal zzso zzso This is further supported by indirect evidence from two other lines of zzso Unlike the zzso lacking zzso at zzso the one lacking zzso at zzso zzso with the two zzso specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso which normally did not zzso with the native or the zzso Also, zzso zzso but not zzso was able to restore the zzso activity of the zzso zzso deficient zzso From all the data taken together, it appears that the loss of second zzso activity of zzso with the absence of the zzso chain at zzso was probably due to a zzso change in the zzso rather than due to the loss of the zzso zzso
