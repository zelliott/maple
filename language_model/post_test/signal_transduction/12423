zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso family, and its differential expression has been associated with acute and chronic inflammation and several human zzso Our previous work showed that zzso was severely zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso To further investigate the zzso regulation of zzso we zzso the zzso promoter region and found several putative zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso carrying the zzso exhibited enhanced zzso activity in response to zzso zzso zzso Further study demonstrated that zzso zzso and protein expression could be positively regulated in a zzso manner and zzso could bind to zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso could induce cellular zzso and this was partly zzso zzso of zzso impaired the zzso induced by zzso Thus we conclude that a gene zzso in zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso target, zzso cellular zzso in a partly zzso manner and mediates the zzso zzso zzso
