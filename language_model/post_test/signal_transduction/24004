zzso numbers of peripheral zzso are tightly zzso For conventional T cells, signals delivered through the interaction of the T cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso molecules are required for the peripheral survival of zzso T cells and for their zzso expansion in zzso zzso zzso including zzso are also essential for survival of peripheral zzso T zzso zzso V alpha zzso natural killer zzso cells are a specialized zzso T subset with zzso zzso The relative roles of zzso engagement and zzso signaling in the peripheral zzso of V alpha zzso zzso cells were zzso After adoptive transfer, the survival and expansion of peripheral V alpha zzso zzso cells was independent of zzso expression in the zzso In contrast, zzso (but not zzso was required for maintenance of peripheral zzso V alpha zzso T zzso zzso of V alpha zzso T cell transfers into zzso zzso deficient hosts suggests that zzso cells and zzso cells compete for peripheral zzso Our results indicate that zzso maintains the zzso of peripheral V alpha zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso cells, if it occurs under zzso conditions, does not by itself provide a sufficient signal for their peripheral zzso
