The underlying mechanisms of zzso the first stage of zzso fatty liver disease zzso that is characterized by the zzso of lipids in zzso remain zzso Our study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that cigarette smoke is known to change circulating zzso profiles and thus may also contribute to the zzso of lipids in the zzso 

Mice and cultured zzso were exposed to zzso whole smoke zzso a major component of zzso smoke and a variety of cellular and molecular approaches were used to study the effects of cigarette smoke on zzso zzso 

zzso increases zzso zzso in zzso by modulating the activity of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso response element binding zzso zzso two critical molecules involved in zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso of zzso which contributes to increased zzso of zzso These changes of activity lead to zzso of zzso in zzso 

These novel findings are important because they point to another risk factor of smoking, zzso that of contributing to zzso In addition, our results showing that both zzso and zzso are critically involved in these effects of smoke point to the potential use of these molecules as targets for treatment of cigarette zzso zzso zzso
