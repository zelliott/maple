zzso mechanics practiced in the present progressive mode can incorporate into itself the propagation of a signal of a local zzso It is possible to view that any movement in the present progressive mode is zzso in the sense of internal interactions due to the absence of an external agency zzso the global situation zzso The idea of living memory is discussed as carrying the leftover from those actions completed and registered in the present perfect mode and surviving at any present zzso The occurrence of both the signal propagation of a local character and living memory is upheld upon exchange interaction of a quantum mechanical zzso zzso evidence suggesting the likelihood of such an exchange interaction is found in the zzso zzso channels located on the plasma membrane of the muscle cell in the vicinity of zzso zzso containing zzso near the nerve zzso Another case from the empirical evidence is seen in the zzso system demonstrating the zzso propagation of variations in the acceleration of the displacement of an zzso filament sliding on zzso molecules in the presence of zzso zzso
