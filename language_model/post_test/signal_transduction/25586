zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso leaves are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, however, little is known about their mechanism of zzso 

The aim of this study is to explore the zzso properties of zzso zzso leaves and their zzso zzso zzso as well its mechanism of action in zzso zzso 

A zzso and essential zzso infusion of Cy leaves was prepared zzso zzso and zzso by column zzso zzso properties of Cy extract zzso zzso and its zzso namely zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tannins (78 zzso were investigated using zzso zzso Raw zzso zzso as in zzso zzso As inflammatory zzso zzso oxide zzso production was evaluated by zzso reaction, as well as effects on zzso zzso zzso NO zzso zzso expression and on zzso signaling pathways zzso which were analyzed by Western zzso using specific zzso 

Cy extract inhibited zzso zzso NO production and various zzso pathways like zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and the zzso nuclear factor zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and the zzso zzso zzso were not affected by Cy zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression and NO production but none of the zzso modulated zzso or zzso zzso Neither Cy extract nor zzso affected zzso zzso expression but zzso zzso production is inhibited by Cy extract and by zzso zzso zzso 

Our data provide evidence that support the usage of zzso zzso leaves extract in traditional medicine, and suggest that zzso in particular its zzso compounds, could constitute a natural source of a new and safe zzso zzso
