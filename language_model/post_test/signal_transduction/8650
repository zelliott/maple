Originally considered an enigmatic zzso the zzso zzso has recently been identified as a unique zzso molecular zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso This discovery causes us to look back at the many proposed roles of this zzso even before its molecular function was identified, in many diseases such as methamphetamine or cocaine addiction, zzso pain, depression, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, retinal zzso zzso infection, and zzso In this review, we examine the reports that have clearly shown an zzso relationship regarding zzso receptors in models of those diseases and also review the relatively known mechanisms of action of zzso receptors in an attempt to spur the speculation of readers on how the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso might relate to so many zzso We found that the most prominent action of zzso receptors in biological systems including cell lines, primary cultures, and animals is the regulation and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso channels, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and SK channels, and zzso and zzso zzso We found that the final output of the action of zzso zzso zzso is to inhibit all zzso zzso zzso channels, while they zzso zzso zzso The zzso or zzso induced by zzso is blocked by zzso zzso zzso Other mechanisms of action of zzso zzso and to some extent those of zzso zzso were also zzso We conclude that the zzso and zzso receptors represent potential fruitful targets for therapeutic developments in combating many human zzso
