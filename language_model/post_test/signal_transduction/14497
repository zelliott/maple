zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to either zzso or inhibit zzso depending upon the cellular context, but its role in lung zzso is zzso Here we sought to define the role of zzso in lung zzso by examining evidence of zzso zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso biopsy samples and by using genetic and zzso approaches to zzso zzso expression and activity in cultured zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was detected in 114 zzso of 252 zzso biopsy samples and was predominantly zzso providing evidence of zzso zzso in a subset of zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso active, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 4 zzso into the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso increased the zzso zzso migration, invasion and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells by introduction of zzso short hairpin zzso reversed the transformed zzso indicating that zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties in these zzso The proliferation of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in which zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is activated in a subset of zzso biopsy samples and promotes zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that strategies to inhibit the zzso zzso should be considered for the prevention and treatment of zzso
