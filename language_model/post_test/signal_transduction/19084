zzso exert their zzso actions through the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso deletion of zzso in mice causes various symptoms, including changes in locomotor activity, increased ring zzso zzso zzso and impaired memory zzso Although the zzso zzso contains the highest level of zzso severe zzso functional deficits have not been reported in zzso zzso zzso To clarify the roles of zzso in zzso function, we subjected zzso zzso mice to a delay version of classical zzso zzso This paradigm is a test for zzso discrete motor learning, in which zzso stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso electrical zzso are zzso We found that delay zzso conditioning performance was severely impaired in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, they exhibited normal performance in a trace version of zzso conditioning with 500 zzso zzso zzso intervened between the zzso offset and the US zzso This paradigm is a test for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice to zzso or US was normal, suggesting that impaired delay zzso conditioning is attributable to defects in association of responses to zzso and zzso We also found that zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso mice caused severe impairment in acquisition but not extinction of delay zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on trace zzso conditioning with a 500 or 750 zzso trace zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso signaling through zzso is essential for zzso discrete motor learning, especially for its zzso
