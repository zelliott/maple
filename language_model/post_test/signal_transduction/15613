In B cells, zzso drives the formation of zzso zzso zzso clusters that initiate the formation of signaling complexes associated with the zzso zzso of the zzso These signaling active complexes contain a number of protein and zzso zzso and zzso and adapter and scaffolding proteins that together function to trigger downstream signaling zzso leading to the zzso of a variety of genes associated with zzso zzso Although we are learning a considerable amount about the molecular details of the assembly of immune zzso signaling complexes, as reviewed in this volume, a fundamental question remains, namely how does zzso binding outside the cell initiate the assembly of signaling complexes inside the zzso For B cells, we do not yet understand how the information that the zzso of the zzso has bound to an zzso is translated across the membrane to induce changes in the zzso zzso that trigger the assembly of signaling zzso Here we describe what is known about the initiation of the zzso zzso signal zzso in the newly emerging context of zzso recognition of zzso presented by zzso cells in zzso zzso We also discuss a recently proposed model for the initiation of zzso signaling termed the zzso zzso zzso and address the implications of this model for the mechanisms by which zzso signaling may be modulated by adapters and zzso
