zzso zzso senses its environment, including the surrounding bacterial community, using both the second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensing zzso to regulate zzso formation and other bacterial zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a complex network of 61 zzso predicted to mediate changes to the levels of zzso in response to zzso signals, and the zzso of many of these zzso is influenced by zzso Because of the complexity of the zzso signaling system in zzso zzso it is difficult to determine if zzso of zzso zzso in response to different stimuli is driven primarily by changes in zzso synthesis or zzso Here, we describe a novel method, named the ex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that systematically measures total zzso and zzso cellular zzso We show that zzso zzso grown in different environments exhibits significantly different zzso levels of zzso and we used zzso to determine that these differences zzso to changes in both zzso synthesis and zzso Furthermore, we show that the increased concentration of zzso at low cell density is primarily due to increased zzso activity due to the zzso zzso Our findings highlight the idea that zzso of both total zzso and zzso activity alters the zzso concentration of zzso and we present a new method that is widely zzso to the systematic analysis of complex zzso signaling zzso
