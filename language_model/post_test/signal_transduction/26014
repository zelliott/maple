The zzso zzso is a major signaling cascade in bone biology, playing a key role in regulating bone development and zzso with aberrations in signaling resulting in disturbances in bone zzso The objectives of our study were to correlate serum zzso expression with bone mineral density zzso and assess the potential role of zzso as a zzso marker of bone zzso zzso was collected from a cohort of patients zzso zzso zzso 18 patients with a reduced zzso and 18 control zzso zzso zzso expression as zzso by zzso was correlated with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration in the osteoporosis group was significantly higher than control group zzso zzso 116 zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was highly correlated with bone mass variables with inverse associations found between serum zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Our data further emphasizes the pivotal role played by zzso signaling in bone mass zzso zzso a powerful zzso of zzso zzso zzso may have a role to play as a zzso marker for disorders of bone mass, zzso further zzso
