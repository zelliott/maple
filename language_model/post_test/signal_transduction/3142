In zzso detection of zzso bacteria particularly involves binding of the zzso component zzso zzso to its zzso zzso complex, zzso Toll like zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation of the zzso zzso complex elicits a signaling network, including zzso zzso directly activated by the zzso zzso complex as well as zzso induction of indirect zzso and zzso signaling zzso All these different pathways are integrated into the zzso response towards an inflammatory stimulus by a highly complex zzso of the pathways zzso This also includes a tight control by several zzso and zzso feedback zzso zzso an inflammatory response sufficient to battle invading pathogens and to avoid zzso tissue damage caused by an overwhelming inflammatory zzso Several zzso indicate that the zzso zzso between the zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso forms a critical axis successively activated by zzso The balanced zzso of this axis is essential for both induction and propagation of the inflammatory zzso response as well as for the control of the resolution phase, which is largely driven by zzso and sustained zzso zzso In this context regulation of zzso of zzso signaling zzso expression and the recently described divergent regulatory roles of the two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso for the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and gene zzso which includes the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso appears to play an important zzso
