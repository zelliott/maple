Signaling by some zzso zzso family members, including zzso is zzso by zzso zzso factors zzso that interact with zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso Here we have defined the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso that directly interact with zzso and zzso the affinities of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso in zzso zzso deletions of zzso and zzso defined minimal zzso acid sequences necessary for zzso formation and indicated that the coiled zzso zzso region is required for zzso zzso with the idea that zzso zzso is required for zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso significantly weaker than zzso zzso In surface zzso resonance studies, a hierarchy of affinity of zzso zzso for zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be sufficient for optimal zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso through zzso zzso In contrast, a higher degree of zzso zzso was necessary for zzso signaling in a cell line expressing a zzso zzso zzso that signaled only through zzso The affinities of zzso proteins for zzso receptors as well as different requirements for degree of zzso zzso appear to contribute to the selectivity of zzso recruitment to zzso zzso zzso
