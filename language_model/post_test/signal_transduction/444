Marine organisms have proven to be a rich source of potent zzso active zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso sponges zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea zzso zzso class: zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso multiple bond zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of the compounds on cell viability was determined using the zzso zzso zzso potential was measured using the zzso equivalent zzso capacity zzso zzso of nuclear zzso activity was detected by zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso against an array of protein zzso was determined in zzso zzso 

All compounds had prominent zzso activity, comparable to that of the synthetic vitamin E zzso zzso zzso showed the greatest zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso All three compounds inhibited zzso zzso in this cell line, with zzso being the most zzso zzso of 23 zzso involved in signal zzso pathways zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso inhibited the activity of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), and zzso also inhibited the activity of other zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso 3 and zzso growth factor 1 zzso 

The zzso zzso isolated from the marine sponges zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso activities and inhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and protein zzso These findings may result in the generation of new lead substances in cancer zzso
