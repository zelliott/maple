The past few years have brought new advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Barrett's esophagus and zzso zzso Although knowledge of the genetic basis for these conditions has not yet translated into clinically useful zzso the current pace of biomedical discovery holds endless possibilities for molecular medicine to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with these zzso This article provides a useful conceptual basis for understanding the molecular events involved in the making of Barrett zzso and in its zzso zzso and provides a rationale for evaluating studies on the application of molecular medicine to the diagnosis and management of patients with Barrett's esophagus and zzso zzso
