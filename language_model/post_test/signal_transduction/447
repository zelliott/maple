zzso zzso zzso zzso represent the gold standard for the treatment of severe pain but may paradoxically also enhance pain sensitivity, that is, lead to zzso zzso zzso We show that abrupt withdrawal from zzso zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso at the first zzso in pain zzso zzso of zzso withdrawal zzso requires zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso receptors and a rise of zzso calcium zzso In contrast, the acute depression by zzso is induced zzso at these zzso zzso zzso can be prevented by tapered withdrawal and shares pharmacology and signal zzso pathways with zzso These findings provide a previously zzso target to selectively combat zzso effects of zzso without compromising zzso zzso
