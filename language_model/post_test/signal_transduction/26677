zzso zzso is a prominent zzso drug that binds to zzso synaptic zzso zzso 2A protein and has reported effects on zzso channels, but with a poorly defined mechanism of zzso We investigated zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels as a potential mechanism through which zzso exerts effects on zzso zzso We used zzso methods to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso synaptic transmission and zzso channel activity in superior cervical zzso zzso zzso In zzso we investigated the effects of the inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso (each at 100 zzso inhibited synaptic transmission between zzso in long-term culture in a zzso manner, significantly reducing zzso zzso zzso after a zzso zzso In isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not short-term application (5 zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso current zzso zzso In zzso recordings, zzso reduced the zzso of the zzso potential in a zzso manner but also increased the action potential zzso in a zzso manner, which suggests additional mechanisms associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso application zzso zzso caused rapid zzso of zzso zzso to an extent comparable to that seen with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso application of zzso zzso produced any zzso effects on zzso zzso These results identify a zzso zzso zzso through which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso are proposed to contribute to the zzso effects of zzso
