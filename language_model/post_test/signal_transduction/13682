The molecular mechanism responsible for the zzso effect of zzso D3 zzso is still not well zzso zzso systemic toxicity of zzso has encouraged to develop more potent and less toxic zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Our aim was to explore the zzso effect of BE and its molecular mechanism in zzso zzso 

zzso sorted zzso T cells zzso zzso from zzso of psoriasis and zzso arthritis patients were cultured zzso BE and zzso followed by proliferation zzso zzso dilution zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to determine the signaling cascade responsible for the zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso BE zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso zzso proliferation of T cells zzso zzso zzso and at equivalent doses, the zzso effect was more than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of BE was extended to activated zzso and zzso memory T cells zzso without much effect on the zzso T zzso BE induced more zzso of T cells zzso zzso compared to zzso cells zzso and the zzso effect was markedly more than that of zzso zzso zzso BE effectively inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and in both, BE showed more potency than zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is being used successfully in psoriasis for zzso However, its potency is less compared to topical zzso The de zzso BE showed significantly more zzso than conventional zzso and the zzso effect is zzso zzso Our results indicate that BE could be an effective therapeutic agent for psoriasis and other zzso zzso zzso
