zzso zzso exerts both positive and negative feedback control over zzso hormone zzso zzso during the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha but not zzso knockout mice lack zzso zzso Thus, zzso feedback appears to be primarily zzso by zzso However, it is now recognized that, in addition to binding to zzso response elements zzso in DNA to alter target gene transcription, zzso signals through zzso or zzso zzso and the relative contributions of these pathways in conveying zzso feedback remain zzso Previously we created a zzso mouse model expressing a zzso form of zzso zzso with zzso zzso but intact zzso zzso zzso this zzso onto the zzso zzso background, we examine the ability of zzso zzso signaling pathways to convey zzso feedback regulation of the female zzso axis in zzso zzso exhibited zzso lower serum zzso levels compared with zzso zzso Additionally, like wild type, zzso mice exhibited elevated zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso rise in serum zzso was significantly suppressed by zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso However, unlike wild type, both zzso and zzso mice failed to exhibit zzso zzso spontaneous zzso or an afternoon zzso surge response to zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso signaling is sufficient to convey a major portion of zzso negative feedback actions, whereas positive feedback and spontaneous zzso zzso require zzso zzso zzso
