The rapid induction of type I zzso zzso is essential for establishing innate zzso zzso During infection, zzso viral zzso is sensed by two zzso box zzso zzso zzso and zzso ultimately driving zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso type I zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso forms of zzso were sensed by zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso usually found in defective zzso zzso acting as a better zzso of zzso than zzso zzso However, despite the presence of zzso zzso in the de zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso replication did not lead to a substantial induction of zzso zzso We demonstrate the existence of an evasion mechanism based on the zzso of the zzso sensor through the action of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso expression of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso levels occurred in cells undergoing a zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso but not in cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso from the zzso to an zzso fraction during the de zzso zzso infection of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The loss of zzso zzso was prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso targets zzso to the zzso This study reveals a novel zzso mechanism employed by zzso to counteract the early zzso response to viral zzso in infected zzso
