zzso zzso zzso are ubiquitous membrane proteins that convert the energy from zzso and zzso into zzso changes of the zzso region to allow the zzso of zzso against their concentration zzso Despite the large amount of structural and zzso data available for this family, it is still not clear how the energy obtained from zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso In this work, we focus our attention on the consequences of zzso and zzso zzso exit in the zzso zzso system zzso from zzso zzso The prime goal is to identify and map the structural changes occurring during an zzso zzso For that, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study three potential intermediate states (with 10 replicates zzso an zzso an zzso plus zzso zzso and an zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso presenting major zzso are located in the zzso in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso (especially in the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, in one of the simulations with zzso we were able to observe the opening of the zzso zzso accompanied by the zzso of zzso from the ABC signature zzso but not from its corresponding zzso zzso This work, together with several other MD studies, suggests a common communication mechanism both for zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso region, in turn transferred to the zzso zzso via the zzso zzso
