The protein zzso D zzso family consists of three zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso has been the focus of most studies to date, no information is available on the zzso distribution of zzso zzso we examined the mechanism that regulates its zzso distribution in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso in zzso cells indicated that this zzso is predominantly zzso Cell stimulation with the G zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid and zzso plasma membrane zzso of zzso by a mechanism that requires zzso zzso In contrast to the other zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce its zzso from the zzso to the zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that the regulation of the distribution of zzso is distinct from other zzso zzso and suggests that the differential zzso zzso of these signaling molecules regulates their specific signaling zzso
