zzso zzso encodes one of the largest numbers of proteins zzso as parts of the zzso signal zzso and/or zzso zzso Ten of these signal zzso have zzso zzso sensor zzso that contain the sequence signature for zzso zzso One such sensor domain zzso by gene zzso was isolated and zzso The protein was expressed in zzso coli and was isolated as two colored species zzso and zzso The green species is a zzso of the sensor domain with a zzso zzso zzso and the red species is probably a zzso zzso of the sensor domain which might have an zzso zzso bound to the zzso The zzso spectrum of the green species indicates that it has a zzso zzso but its structure is predicted to be zzso to zzso a zzso zzso domain that does not contain zzso The zzso sensor domain represents a previously zzso family of zzso zzso sensor zzso that contain zzso zzso these proteins could be part of an important mechanism for sensing zzso potential or small zzso in the zzso zzso to the sensor zzso we identified in zzso zzso are observed in various bacteria although they occur in larger numbers in the zzso
