Cell cycle checkpoints induced by DNA damage play an integral role in preservation of zzso stability by allowing cells to limit the propagation of deleterious zzso The zzso tumor zzso zzso is crucial for the maintenance of the DNA damage checkpoint function because it elicits cell cycle arrest in response to a variety of zzso zzso Although sporadic loss of RB is characteristic of most zzso and results in the bypass of the DNA damage checkpoint, the consequence of RB loss upon zzso responsiveness has been largely zzso Here, we employed a conditional knockout approach to zzso RB in adult zzso This system enabled us to examine the DNA damage response of adult cells following acute RB zzso Using this system, we demonstrated that loss of RB disrupted the DNA damage checkpoint zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso this bypass was not associated with enhanced repair, but rather the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicate DNA zzso zzso The formation of zzso zzso was due to ongoing replication following zzso treatment in the zzso zzso Additionally, peak zzso zzso occurred in zzso cells undergoing DNA replication in the presence of damage, and these zzso zzso zzso with replication zzso These results demonstrate that acute RB loss abrogates DNA zzso cell cycle arrest to induce zzso zzso zzso Thus, secondary genetic zzso induced by RB loss have implications for the zzso response and the development of genetic zzso
