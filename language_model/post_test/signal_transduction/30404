Identification of novel signal zzso pathways regulating zzso zzso can indicate unique targets for preventive therapies for treatment of chronic inflammatory zzso To aid in this endeavor we report conditions for optimal zzso of primary human zzso coupled with a new model system for assessing their zzso activity in zzso This method can be used as a tool to identify the relevant signal zzso pathways regulating human zzso zzso to zzso in the complex in zzso environment that were previously identified to regulate zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is studied in an adoptive transfer model where human zzso zzso with zzso zzso are transferred to mice followed by initiation of zzso zzso zzso cells at 24 h diminishes the contribution of zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso of relevant regulatory molecules in zzso is critical for understanding the most relevant therapeutic targets for drug zzso
