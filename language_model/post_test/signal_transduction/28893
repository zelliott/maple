This paper describes the zzso genes that are involved in the production of the gas zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso an abundant zzso that is a stress zzso in many marine algae and a few zzso of zzso What is known of the arrangement of the zzso genes in different bacteria that can undertake this reaction is reviewed here, stressing the fact that these genes are probably subject to horizontal gene transfer and that the same functions zzso zzso zzso may be accomplished by very different zzso A surprising number of zzso bacteria are associated with the roots of higher plants, these including strains of zzso and some zzso bacteria in the zzso zzso One newly identified strain that is predicted to make zzso is zzso zzso which is a highly unusual zzso that forms zzso zzso on some tropical zzso in this case, the tree zzso zzso which inhabits zzso The importance of zzso zzso and zzso production is discussed, not only in terms of nutritional acquisition by the bacteria but also in a speculative scheme (the zzso zzso zzso in which the bacteria may make zzso as an zzso to attract other organisms, including zzso and other zzso
