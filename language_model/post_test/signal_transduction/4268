The model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in calf pulmonary artery zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso is coupled to the zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated whether oxidized zzso zzso is the zzso zzso responsible for zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso by application of zzso zzso was used to estimate the zzso zzso content of the zzso store in intact zzso zzso zzso content was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso 0-3 zzso unless zzso zzso content was zzso zzso The effect was specific for increased zzso and was not zzso by depletion of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso produced zzso within the zzso cell, decreases the zzso zzso content of zzso zzso zzso zzso of internal zzso stores by zzso may represent a key mechanism by which some forms of zzso stress inhibit signal zzso in vascular zzso At the plasma zzso zzso is known to inhibit the zzso zzso influx zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso influx, thereby providing the first evidence that activity of the zzso zzso influx channel is sensitive to zzso zzso formed zzso within the zzso
