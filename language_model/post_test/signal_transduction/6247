In rats, during zzso zzso cell development, the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso actively during days zzso of zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso is known to stimulate zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso this zzso In order to identify the molecules involved in zzso cell zzso zzso expressed genes in zzso and zzso zzso isolated from vehicle and zzso zzso rats respectively, were zzso by differential display reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso revealed that the expression of collagen IV zzso zzso IV zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein collagen IV, was down regulated in zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso Studies on stage specific expression of Col IV zzso during zzso cell development revealed that this transcript is abundantly expressed at the stage where zzso cell proliferation is zzso and the expression of this transcript decreased during differentiation of zzso cells, which is associated with loss of zzso These observations suggest that Col IV zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso proliferation in zzso in the presence collagen IV provides additional support for the conclusion that collagen zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso Further studies revealed that active forms of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated protein zzso 1/2 zzso zzso the zzso zzso molecules that are known to mediate zzso protein zzso are present only in zzso forms of zzso cells and are absent in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that collagen zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso
