We analyzed the effect of the stable expressed zzso C virus core protein on zzso zzso expression level and the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso cell expression cell line of the zzso core protein was zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso zzso Both the zzso and protein levels of zzso were not affected in zzso cells, whereas a decreased zzso status of zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was zzso Further, the zzso level of zzso was found to be significantly elevated in zzso zzso 

Our results revealed for the first time that zzso core protein zzso zzso zzso and the increased zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso at the zzso level, which suggesting the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso insulin resistance and provided potential new clues for the prevention and therapy of zzso
