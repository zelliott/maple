zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso is a critical upstream regulator of zzso zzso zzso the central iron regulatory hormone, is zzso from zzso whereas zzso is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso binds the proteins zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso and can be released from the cell membrane zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso significance and the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso In acutely zzso rats with markedly suppressed zzso zzso zzso we detected an early phase increase of serum zzso with no significant change of either zzso zzso or protein levels in zzso zzso Studies in both zzso (a mouse zzso cell line) and zzso (a human zzso cell line) cells showed active zzso zzso zzso that both skeletal muscle and liver could be the source of serum zzso In agreement with the observations in zzso rats, zzso shedding in these cell lines was zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso Our present study showing that zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso cells suppresses zzso shedding and that zzso of zzso in zzso cells markedly enhances this process, suggests that membrane zzso shedding is zzso by zzso The finding that neither zzso nor its zzso zzso was able to alter zzso shedding support the lack of involvement of zzso signaling zzso in this zzso
