zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso is a cell membrane protein that exports excess cholesterol from cells to zzso zzso zzso the major protein in high density zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso protects against cardiovascular zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso promotes cholesterol removal and activates signaling zzso such as zzso zzso 2 zzso that zzso the zzso export activity of zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso of zzso also activates zzso which is independent of the zzso transport function of zzso zzso contains two candidate zzso zzso sites that are required for the zzso zzso of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso suppressed the ability of zzso to induce the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso which was reversed by zzso zzso or zzso Thus, the zzso zzso in zzso functions as an zzso zzso through zzso of zzso These findings zzso zzso as a direct molecular link between the zzso effects of cholesterol export from zzso zzso and suppressed zzso
