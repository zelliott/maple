Learning is an zzso change in behavior in response to environmental zzso In zzso there is a distinct female bias to learn skills that is still unprecedented in other animal zzso Here we have investigated the biological zzso of performance in an zzso learning paradigm in the zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso of zzso reactions associated with food zzso zzso male worms show inferior learning ability relative to zzso zzso learning difference is therefore an ancient evolutionary feature appearing even in relatively simple zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso signaling also exhibit a greatly reduced learning ability in this zzso In addition, zzso of zzso signaling through zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso enhances learning ability beyond that of wild zzso According to our zzso analysis, the effect of zzso on learning acts via zzso zzso zzso production, but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso This implies that the signaling zzso from zzso affecting this learning paradigm branches between zzso production and zzso However, learning capacity of zzso is lowered by zzso zzso in zzso suggesting involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso sex and zzso signaling affect performance in this learning zzso via effects on the zzso of zzso
