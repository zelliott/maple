The zzso zzso signaling is frequently activated in human zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was associated with nuclear zzso of zzso zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso that may activate the zzso zzso through zzso in zzso zzso 

To identify zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso zzso To evaluate the function of zzso and zzso in zzso we zzso zzso zzso FOCUS zzso cells zzso and human zzso 

In zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso was zzso in tumor and zzso zzso compared to normal liver and downstream zzso target genes were also increased in these zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity and proliferation zzso The zzso of zzso signaling in zzso was abolished by a zzso of zzso expression by zzso More important, a specific zzso interaction was observed by zzso experiments, which suggest that the action of zzso was zzso via zzso 

These findings demonstrate a functional interaction between zzso and zzso leading to zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells and may play a role during zzso
