zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States because most patients are diagnosed too late in the course of the disease to be treated zzso Thus, there is a pressing need to more clearly understand how gene expression is regulated in cancer cells and to identify new zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso regulation is thought to occur primarily through zzso directed signaling zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso signaling does play a role in the regulation of zzso entry into zzso and that novel candidate genes in pancreatic cancer could be identified using zzso zzso from the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso with or without a functional zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso expressed whole cell and zzso zzso levels are both poor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for a majority of zzso differential zzso levels are regulated independently in the nucleus, zzso and zzso zzso for most of the remaining zzso zzso levels are regulated via a zzso of the zzso in the nucleus for rapid entry into the zzso zzso a zzso zzso appears to indeed play a role in regulating zzso entry into zzso and zzso a gene list derived from zzso expressed zzso zzso in zzso generated new candidate genes and cell pathways potentially related to pancreatic zzso
