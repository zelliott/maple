zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the signaling components of the zzso T cell zzso zzso The recently solved structure of zzso zzso revealed a unique zzso interface and central zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso with the pairing of the parallel G strands zzso a potential concerted zzso movement for signal zzso Although zzso and zzso each zzso with zzso there are differential zzso zzso requirements for zzso assembly and signaling among T lineage zzso presumably mandated by structural zzso Here we present the solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso is virtually identical to that in zzso the zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso fold, with a zzso zzso front face zzso that is more parallel to the zzso back face than those zzso in zzso and zzso The zzso interface between zzso and zzso is highly zzso among species and of similar character to that in zzso zzso sites in zzso are arranged such that the zzso may point away from the zzso consistent with a model of zzso assembly that allows the zzso chain to be in close contact with the zzso zzso This and many other structural and biological features provide a basis for modeling putative zzso zzso domain zzso The fact that the two clusters of zzso zzso zzso the three zzso segments and the five zzso zzso are presumably centered beneath the G zzso zzso zzso has important implications for zzso zzso
