In the present study, the contribution of zzso toxin zzso zzso to zzso tolerance and zzso zzso zzso in the mouse were zzso Mice were injected once zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso On the 10th day following zzso treatment, continuous subcutaneous infusion of zzso zzso or 200 zzso or zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Control mice were implanted with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were removed 3 days later, and mice were tested for zzso analgesia or zzso zzso density was determined in the whole brain, spinal cord, and zzso Both infusion doses of zzso produced significant tolerance zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso treatment also produced significant tolerance zzso zzso approximately zzso but no zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced the acute potency of zzso and blocked the further development of tolerance by both zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso in brain, cord, or zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso have a minimal role in zzso zzso zzso density regulation in zzso but are critical in zzso acute and chronic functional effects of zzso such as analgesia and zzso
