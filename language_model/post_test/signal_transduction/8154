zzso serve as important zzso regulators of zzso trafficking and cell zzso zzso In addition to their recognition by specific zzso binding zzso present within zzso zzso proteins or membrane integral channels and zzso zzso may affect membrane transport by zzso zzso changes within proteins or by regulating zzso zzso During zzso membrane traffic zzso form part of coincidence detection systems that aid in targeting pools of specific zzso to select zzso transport zzso In this review, we discuss potential mechanisms for zzso selectivity onto the zzso code as well as possible avenues for future zzso
