zzso of insulin producing zzso is a genetically well defined process that involves functions of various zzso zzso zzso Still, the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso and determination of zzso fate are poorly zzso Here we provide the description of a zzso zzso specific zzso as a model to study initial steps of zzso zzso We show that evolutionary zzso upstream sequences of the zzso zzso gene are required and sufficient for regulating expression in zzso prior to the onset of insulin zzso This zzso contains binding sites for zzso zzso factors and two zzso that in zzso studies show interaction with zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso zzso expression and that this zzso depends on the zzso zzso Using genetic approaches we show that zzso is crucial for maintenance but not induction of pancreatic zzso zzso As loss of zzso or zzso independently results in the loss of insulin zzso the data reveal a novel zzso between the two essential regulators of early zzso zzso While we find that the known pancreatic zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso are not required for zzso expression we also show that removal of both zzso selectively eliminates pancreatic specific reporter zzso The data provide evidence for an zzso independent zzso of zzso zzso that requires function of currently not specified zzso binding zzso
