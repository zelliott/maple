The zzso protein regulator for ubiquitous zzso protein of zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso signaling and processes like cell zzso and zzso Although these features imply a role in zzso it is so far unknown how and by which molecular mechanisms zzso could affect a certain tumor zzso By analyzing samples from breast cancer patients, we found high levels of zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso from patients with invasive breast zzso suggesting that zzso contributes to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso invasive breast zzso cells deficient of zzso indeed converted them into more zzso zzso In particular, zzso reduced the growth rate, decreased cell zzso enhanced zzso growth, increased zzso in both zzso migration and wound healing zzso as well as affected the response to zzso growth zzso zzso zzso led to a more rapid and prolonged zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the zzso changes in cell zzso Together, this study indicates that high levels of zzso contribute to the conversion of breast zzso cells into a more zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso
