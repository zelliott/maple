zzso between the zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso were made to examine the zzso targeting signals of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is responsible for the modification of both zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that two forms of the zzso are translated from two zzso zzso in this zzso that they differ by a zzso zzso extension, and that both the long and short forms are imported into zzso zzso of studies to test the ability of various zzso sequences to serve as surrogate zzso targeting signals for passenger protein import in zzso and in zzso showed that the most efficient signal derived from zzso zzso included a combination of sequences from both the zzso extension and the zzso zzso of the shorter form of the zzso The zzso extension itself did not serve as an independent zzso targeting zzso whereas the zzso zzso of the shorter form of zzso zzso did function in this regard, albeit zzso We analyzed the first 48 zzso acids of zzso zzso for elements of primary and secondary structure shared with other known zzso targeting zzso The results lead us to propose that the most efficient signal spans the area around the second zzso of zzso and is consistent with the idea that there is a zzso targeting signal present at the zzso zzso of the shorter form of the zzso and that the zzso extension zzso this signal by extending it to form a larger, more efficient zzso targeting zzso
