zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso binding zzso functions in the formation of polarized zzso structures, in zzso of cell shape, and in cell zzso Although genetic zzso previously have not been available in zzso organisms, studies have attempted to discern zzso functions in organisms, including zzso using dominant active or interfering zzso Here, for the first time, we examine the functions of zzso in developing zzso using zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso cells fail to zzso into a zzso cell shape and cannot maintain a zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies, we find no requirement for zzso in cell division or in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso function is not required for zzso zzso filament assembly in the nurse cells during zzso although it may facilitate this zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that zzso plays a role in zzso interactions between the germ line and the zzso zzso zzso These results confirm the role of zzso in zzso filament assembly and provide new insights into its functions in zzso zzso and regulating zzso signaling zzso
