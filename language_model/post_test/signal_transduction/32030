zzso zzso interaction studies recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso is involved in a broad range of zzso zzso zzso predominantly interact with zzso factors that contain repression domain zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso reported in the literature are quite diverse in zzso yet zzso interact with proteins containing all of the known zzso These data lead us to conclude that the zzso act as general zzso of gene zzso in zzso To investigate this further, we examined interactions between zzso proteins zzso by the moss zzso zzso zzso and components of the zzso signaling zzso As in zzso moss zzso proteins interact with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that they act in both forms of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the involvement of zzso in zzso signaling has been zzso across evolution, since zzso and zzso zzso approximately 450 million years zzso
