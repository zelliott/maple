The nucleus contains a large variety of protein zzso which function in key processes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we review the zzso action of nuclear protein zzso and focus in particular on the underlying signaling zzso It appears that nuclear protein zzso can both mediate and antagonize signaling by protein zzso sometimes as part of feedback zzso Some protein zzso shuttle between the zzso and the nucleus, which enables them to act as signal zzso between both zzso An emerging theme is the contribution of protein zzso to cycles of protein zzso and zzso that steer the assembly and firing of molecular machines in the zzso
