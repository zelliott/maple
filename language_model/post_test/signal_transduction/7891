zzso of the zzso disease gene zzso in humans causes an extreme disorganization of the brain associated with significant reduction in cortical zzso Here we show that deletion or zzso interference zzso of zzso zzso zzso results in a reduction in zzso zzso and causes a variety of zzso zzso and neurological defects throughout zzso Our analysis of the zzso defects suggests that the reduction in zzso number stems from dysfunctional zzso zzso resulting in cell cycle arrest and eventually programmed cell death zzso zzso of the zzso checkpoint gene zzso blocks zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso placing the zzso checkpoint zzso upstream of the programmed cell death zzso These results suggest that zzso may contribute to the zzso pathology of zzso
