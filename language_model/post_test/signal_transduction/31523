Biology has revealed that form follows function or function creates the zzso zzso this law at the cellular level, we may say that the zzso follows function or function creates the zzso The vascular zzso is an accurate illustration of this rule due to its numerous and zzso functions carried out by highly zzso cells, structurally equipped for their zzso zzso a strategic position between the blood and zzso the zzso cell zzso tightly monitors the transport of plasma zzso employing zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso regulates the vascular tone, zzso and zzso a large variety of factors, and is implicated in the regulation of cell cholesterol, zzso zzso signal zzso zzso inflammation and zzso zzso besides the common set of zzso the characteristic features of the zzso are the particularly high number of zzso zzso endowed with numerous zzso zzso channels, the zzso plasma membrane zzso of distinct chemistry, and characteristic zzso zzso In addition, by virtue of their number zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso large surface area zzso zzso and distribution throughout the body, the zzso can perform all the assumed zzso The vascular zzso with its broad spectrum of zzso zzso and zzso functions, can be regarded as a zzso organ and chief governor of body zzso The zzso exists in a high-risk zzso The cells react progressively to aggressive factors, at first by zzso of the zzso functions zzso zzso followed by zzso dysfunction zzso impairment or new zzso if the insults persist (in time or zzso cell damage and death ultimately zzso In conclusion, the zzso are daring cells that have the zzso attributes to adapt to the ever-changing surrounding zzso to use innate mechanisms to confront and defend against insults and to monitor and maintain the body's zzso
