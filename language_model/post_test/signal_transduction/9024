Alzheimer's disease and other zzso have recently been clustered with a group of nervous system disorders termed protein zzso zzso The common element established between these disorders is their requirement for processing by the zzso zzso It is now clear that the individual components of the zzso system, such as zzso and zzso exist in an intricate signaling network that exerts zzso effects on a host of zzso zzso we have zzso to identify new compounds that can specifically regulate individual components of the zzso zzso Here, we hypothesized that chemical manipulation of zzso zzso activity, a target that has not previously been zzso could illuminate a new zzso toward zzso zzso Using a newly developed zzso screening system, we identified zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso led to rapid zzso zzso degradation in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso preserved zzso levels in the same zzso zzso zzso did not result in general protein degradation, nor did it induce a heat shock zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso activity after increasing its expression levels facilitated zzso degradation at lower doses, suggesting that we can combine genetic and zzso manipulation of zzso to control the fate of bound zzso Disease relevance of this strategy was further established when zzso levels were rapidly and substantially reduced in brain tissue from zzso transgenic zzso These findings reveal an entirely novel path toward therapeutic intervention of zzso by zzso of the previously zzso zzso activity of zzso
