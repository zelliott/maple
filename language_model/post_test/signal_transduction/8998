The Met zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates several distinct biological zzso including cell zzso cell invasion, cell survival and zzso zzso zzso is genetically altered through several mechanisms in multiple human zzso these events are zzso related to cancer initiation and zzso identifying Met as a potential therapeutic zzso Recent evidence highlights additional roles for Met in cancer through zzso with other receptors and cell surface zzso In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of mechanisms of interaction between Met, the zzso growth factor zzso family and other cell surface protein families, and how these contribute to signal zzso zzso and drug zzso
