Over the past decade important advances have been made in the treatment of locally advanced zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso Traditionally, chemotherapy has been incorporated in the treatment of zzso either before local treatment as zzso zzso with radiation, or following local treatment as zzso zzso A number of zzso trials and zzso have demonstrated that induction chemotherapy (usually based on the combination of zzso and zzso continuous infusion of zzso followed by local treatment or zzso zzso zzso each zzso survival and results in organ preservation in a significant number of zzso Survival rates appear to be higher when zzso with zzso is zzso Furthermore, accelerated zzso radiation regimens have shown improved local control rates in zzso zzso Recently, new therapeutic strategies such as induction chemotherapy followed by zzso or the incorporation of newer agents such as zzso are under intense investigation and preliminary results are zzso Advances in molecular biology have led to the zzso of molecular mechanisms that initiate and maintain the zzso zzso in zzso The identification of molecular targets has revolutionized our approach to cancer therapy and resulted in the introduction of novel targeted zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso are some of the molecular targets of such therapies in patients with zzso
