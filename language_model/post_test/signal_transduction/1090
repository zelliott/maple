Human zzso normally have a very short zzso and die by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso factor zzso can delay this zzso via increases in the cellular levels of zzso an zzso protein of the zzso family with a rapid turnover zzso Here we have shown that zzso of the zzso zzso decreases the rate of zzso turnover within zzso and zzso significantly delays zzso This led us to determine whether zzso could enhance zzso survival by altering the rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso enhanced zzso stability and delayed zzso by signaling pathways requiring zzso and zzso zzso because zzso of these pathways completely zzso the zzso effect on both zzso stability and zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso acid, significantly accelerated both zzso turnover and zzso Neither the zzso zzso zzso nor the pan zzso zzso zzso had any effect on zzso stability under these zzso These observations indicate that profound changes in the rate of zzso zzso following zzso signaling occur via dynamic changes in the rate of zzso turnover via the zzso
