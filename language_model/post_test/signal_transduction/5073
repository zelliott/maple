zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso contributes to the zzso of inflammation by affecting the nuclear factor zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso and therefore could be a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory zzso The current study evaluated the in zzso role of zzso in protecting the liver against injury and zzso caused by zzso in rats, and the underlying zzso 

A single injection of zzso induced acute zzso and repeated injections were used to induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso efficacy was assessed by comparison of the severity of zzso injury and zzso in zzso rats versus zzso zzso 

zzso significantly protected the liver from injury by reducing the activity of serum zzso zzso and improving the zzso architecture of the zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso by reducing zzso zzso levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso In addition, zzso attenuated zzso stress by increasing the content of zzso zzso These favorable changes were associated with suppressed zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso treatment improved liver zzso in rats that received repeated zzso zzso In zzso zzso attenuated zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and thus prevented zzso of NO in zzso zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso is a novel therapeutic zzso target for the treatment of zzso and liver zzso
