Stem cell factor zzso and its zzso zzso constitute an important signal zzso system regulating cell growth and differentiation in zzso zzso and zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that both zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso duct zzso cells of the rat liver and are highly zzso during zzso of the normally dormant zzso stem cell zzso In the present study, we used zzso and zzso mice, which have zzso of either zzso or zzso to study the possible involvement of the zzso system in the zzso duct zzso zzso duct zzso was performed to induce the proliferation of zzso duct zzso zzso The transcripts for both zzso and zzso were clearly increased after zzso duct zzso in both control and zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and W mice responded to the zzso duct zzso similar to the control mice, by developing new zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified in the fetal zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso zzso system can zzso with the zzso system and stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso system might compensate for the compromised zzso system in the liver of zzso and W zzso The expression of both FL and zzso were significantly increased in zzso zzso liver from both normal and zzso mice, and the transcripts for the zzso zzso were selectively located on zzso duct zzso zzso Based on these results, we zzso the existence of a zzso function between the zzso and the zzso signal zzso systems in zzso cell zzso
