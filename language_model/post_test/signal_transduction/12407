The process of aging is one of the most complex and intriguing biological zzso Aging is a genetically regulated process in which the zzso maximum lifespan potential is zzso while the rate of aging is influenced by environmental factors and zzso Considering the complexity of mechanisms involved in the regulation of aging process, up to this date there isn't a major, unifying theory which could explain zzso As zzso and environmental factors both inevitably influence the aging process, here we present a review on the genetic and zzso regulation of the most important molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the process of zzso Based on the studies on zzso stress, zzso zzso stability, zzso modifications and cellular zzso in animal models and humans, we give an overview of key genetic and molecular pathways related to zzso As most of genetic zzso which influence the aging process also affect zzso we discuss aging in humans as a zzso genetically determined zzso After the age of zzso success, aging zzso zzso which clinically zzso with the onset of most chronic diseases, zzso and zzso As evolution shapes the zzso for zzso success and not for zzso survival, aging could be defined as a protective mechanism which ensures the preservation and progress of species through the zzso zzso and improvement of genetic zzso
