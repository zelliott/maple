zzso iron overload is of major concern in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso damage to zzso stem cell zzso function are major setbacks in treatment for such zzso We therefore aim to investigate the effect of iron overload on zzso in the patients and explore the role of zzso in zzso zzso damage in zzso cells and zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso capacity and zzso level of bone zzso cells were tested before and after iron zzso zzso In zzso we first established an iron overload model of bone zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso zzso level, cell cycle, and zzso were measured by zzso zzso of cells was individually studied by zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso signaling zzso was also detected by Western zzso 

After administering zzso zzso reduced blood zzso increased zzso increased zzso and improved zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the patients, zzso Furthermore, the zzso capacity of zzso from iron overload patient was zzso and zzso level was higher, which were partially recovered following iron zzso zzso In zzso exposure of zzso to zzso ammonium zzso zzso for zzso decreased the ratio of zzso cell from zzso to zzso zzso iron could also induce zzso arrest cell cycle, and decrease function of zzso and zzso which was accompanied by increased zzso level and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso More importantly, zzso zzso or zzso could partially zzso cell injury and inhibit the signaling zzso induced by excessive zzso 

Our study shows that iron overload zzso the zzso by damaging zzso cell and zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso signaling zzso
