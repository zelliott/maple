zzso of zzso has been increasingly associated with the zzso of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and the suppression of zzso zzso may lead to zzso of the progression of zzso in these zzso We sought to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso that has been used for centuries in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions, zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso in zzso and further studied the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern these zzso zzso The methanol extract of PC zzso zzso attenuated zzso increase in production of zzso zzso and NO in zzso cells, a mouse zzso cell line, as well as in primary mouse zzso The zzso protection zzso and zzso revealed that the PC extracts inhibited increases in zzso of these zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The PC extracts significantly decreased release of these zzso and NO from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso mechanisms that govern zzso of the levels of zzso and proteins of these zzso and zzso revealed that the PC extract inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The studies demonstrate that the PC extract effectively zzso zzso production and release of inflammatory zzso and zzso and could be a candidate agent for zzso in neurodegenerative human brain zzso
