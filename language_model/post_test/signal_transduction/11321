zzso cell growth results from the biological balance between soluble zzso factors, their receptors and the zzso signal cascade on the one hand side and from zzso zzso components and their interplay with membrane receptors on the other zzso zzso have recently been recognized not only to play a part in providing shape and zzso strength of zzso and zzso but also to exhibit direct and indirect cell zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the direct zzso role of zzso with special emphasis on the zzso family and on the family of small zzso with zzso repeats zzso zzso actions of zzso by zzso of growth factor activities and growth factor distribution are exemplified by discussing the zzso properties of zzso and the interactions of core proteins of zzso zzso with other growth zzso It is emphasized that the zzso role of zzso on cell proliferation cannot be separated from their participation in tissue organization in general, thereby explaining the diverse and sometimes contradictory reports on the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and zzso
