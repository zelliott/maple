Lung zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso of lung cancer worldwide and its absolute zzso is increasing zzso zzso regulation is one of the most fundamental processes in lung zzso zzso However, zzso functional analyses of multiple zzso factors and their target genes in lung zzso are zzso Thus, the objective of our study was to interpret the mechanisms of human zzso through the regulatory network using the zzso zzso zzso Our results identified the genes zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso leukemia virus integration 1 zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia 1 zzso and nuclear factor of zzso light zzso gene zzso in zzso 1 zzso as hub zzso in the zzso zzso Among these zzso it appears that: zzso promotes the zzso signaling zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but suppresses the cell cycle zzso via zzso of growth arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso 9 zzso expression to induce the zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor, zzso zzso zzso expression to activate zzso signaling and zzso zzso D3 zzso expression to promote the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso expression and zzso the prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and promotes pathways in zzso and zzso promotes zzso insert domain zzso zzso expression to promote the zzso signaling zzso This zzso regulation analysis may provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of lung zzso
