The zzso zzso zzso operates in the heart zzso There are no data on the effect of exercise on the functioning of this zzso in the zzso and it was the aim of the present study to examine this zzso 

The experiments were carried out on male zzso rats, zzso g of body zzso They were divided into three groups: zzso control, zzso run 3 h on a treadmill moving with a speed of 1200 m zzso and set at zzso degrees zzso and zzso trained on a treadmill for 6 zzso The rats were zzso and samples of the left zzso were zzso They were immediately frozen in liquid zzso zzso lipids were extracted and zzso and zzso were isolated by means of thin layer zzso Their fatty acids were identified and zzso by means of zzso zzso In separate heart samples the activity of neutral, zzso zzso and acid zzso was determined using zzso zzso as a zzso 

Thirteen different zzso and zzso were identified based on their fatty acid zzso Exercise markedly reduced the total content of zzso acids and had no effect on the total content of zzso zzso Training did not affect the total content either of zzso or zzso zzso The activity of both neutral zzso and acid zzso was reduced after zzso Training did not affect the activity of neutral zzso and reduced the activity of acid zzso 

It is concluded that zzso prolonged exercise, but not training, markedly affects the operation of the zzso zzso in the zzso
