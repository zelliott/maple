zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso are two zzso signals centrally involved in the zzso of acute lung zzso We have attempted to zzso the effects of these two stimuli on the signal zzso pathways of lung zzso zzso In cultured human lung zzso cells, exposure to zzso alone zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso or degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso alone increased zzso zzso within 1 h and induced zzso alpha degradation within zzso zzso After zzso alone, zzso zzso returned to baseline within 2 h and this corresponded with near complete zzso alpha zzso within 1 h of zzso In contrast, simultaneous exposure to zzso and zzso prolonged zzso zzso up to 4 zzso and zzso alpha degradation up to 2 h after zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso alone did not induce zzso zzso zzso activity, but significantly prolonged zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alone did not activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, but zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that while zzso alone does not affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The mechanism of this effect zzso in part, prolonged degradation of zzso alpha resulting from prolonged zzso of zzso
