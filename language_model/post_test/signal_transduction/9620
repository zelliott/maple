zzso growth factor receptors zzso consist of four signaling family members and one zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso all of which are expressed in the developing zzso Several studies have shown that zzso zzso growth factors zzso affect growth and maturation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso bud zzso in cultured zzso zzso and conditional knockout approaches in whole animals have shown that zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso in kidney zzso are critical for early zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso zzso in zzso precursors or global deletion of zzso interrupts zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling downstream of zzso and zzso is critical for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso appears to act independently of zzso (the major signaling adapter for zzso in regulating zzso zzso Loss of zzso in the zzso leads to many kidney and urinary tract anomalies, including zzso zzso Thus zzso signaling is critical for patterning of virtually all zzso lineages at early and later stages of zzso
