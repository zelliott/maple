zzso signaling elements play important roles in plants, including a central role in zzso zzso We characterized zzso elements from the zzso rice zzso zzso using several complementary zzso zzso analysis reveals relatively simple zzso relationships among the zzso zzso in rice and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso proteins zzso and response regulators zzso display a higher degree of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of several zzso and zzso were examined in rice and generally found to zzso to the zzso of their zzso zzso The functionality of rice zzso zzso was tested in zzso one from a zzso composed of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso response regulator zzso but a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso generally did zzso The expression of genes zzso zzso elements and proteins involved in zzso zzso and degradation was analyzed in rice roots and shoots and in response to zzso Nearly all zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in response to zzso but other zzso signaling elements were not appreciably zzso Furthermore, multiple zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso by zzso zzso acid treatment decreased the expression of several genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected the expression of a few zzso zzso and zzso had only modest zzso Our results support a shared role for zzso elements in zzso zzso signaling in zzso and zzso and reveal how zzso can impact zzso function through modulating gene zzso
