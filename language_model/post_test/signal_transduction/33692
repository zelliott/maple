zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is essential for the repair of a subset of DNA zzso breaks zzso however, its precise role is zzso Here, we show that zzso or zzso of zzso require zzso signaling for repair, and this percentage zzso with increased zzso but not damage zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso are generally repaired more slowly than zzso zzso and zzso signaling is specifically required for zzso repair within zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso or the zzso factors zzso or zzso zzso the requirement for zzso in zzso zzso We propose that zzso signaling temporarily zzso zzso via zzso which is critical for zzso zzso within otherwise zzso zzso In support of this, zzso signaling alters zzso affinity for zzso enriched for zzso zzso These data suggest that the importance of zzso signaling for zzso repair increases as the zzso component of a zzso zzso
