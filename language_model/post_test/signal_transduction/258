zzso zzso a palm species native to the Southeastern United States, is one of the widely used zzso agents in benign zzso zzso In this study, we found for the first time that zzso zzso induced growth arrest of a variety of human leukemia cells including zzso and zzso zzso multiple myeloma cells as measured by zzso conversion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso or zzso protein in different human leukemia cell zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso level of zzso form of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso 3) and zzso induced level of zzso form of zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also reduced after zzso zzso treatment in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso 3 signaling by zzso zzso or zzso family of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso enhanced the ability of zzso to inhibit the growth of zzso and zzso zzso cells, as measured by zzso blue exclusion zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso might be useful for the treatment of individuals with multiple zzso
