The zzso signaling zzso is important in both development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a positive regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso itself can be regulated in zzso by zzso zzso and recent data suggest that in zzso zzso activity can be regulated by zzso zzso We show here that the zzso state and zzso activity of zzso are directly regulated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso or addition of soluble zzso zzso led to a significant and rapid increase in the activity of zzso zzso The increase in zzso activity is the result of decreased zzso zzso because it is abolished by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso sites creates a zzso termed zzso that is significantly more active than zzso and is not activated further upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso is biologically relevant because zzso is more effective than zzso at zzso zzso from a zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso both axis zzso and additional zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso signaling activates zzso by causing transient zzso of critical zzso sites present in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may therefore stimulate a cellular zzso to zzso and activate zzso
