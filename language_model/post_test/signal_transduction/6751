Barrett's esophagus zzso is a zzso condition in the zzso with a rising zzso rate among zzso and an established risk factor for the subsequent progression to zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso that normally lines the zzso zzso BE is characterized by zzso zzso that to some extent resembles the zzso of the lower zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of the esophagus is still zzso For many years, it was zzso that either abnormal differentiation of resident zzso cells in the zzso or zzso of mature zzso zzso provoked by zzso genetic zzso resulted in the BE zzso However, more recent studies suggest that indigenous zzso cells at the zzso junction might, under zzso conditions such as zzso loss or an activated inflammatory response, migrate to the esophagus and initiate zzso cell zzso In this review, we discuss the competing theories of the origins of zzso as well as the role of zzso signaling pathways such as zzso zzso and zzso signaling that have been implicated in the molecular zzso of BE and zzso Additionally, we provide an overview of the zzso landscapes of BE and zzso derived from the results of recently published next generation sequencing zzso zzso Future research should zzso whether zzso on zzso zzso zzso can help in identifying BE patients at highest risk for zzso development, and whether some of the prevalent zzso are zzso leading to improvements in current therapeutic strategies for BE and zzso
