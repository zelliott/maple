The movement of zzso zzso is characterized by its zzso zzso In sea zzso zzso for example, zzso zzso are formed in alternating directions at the base of the zzso and travel toward the tip as continuous zzso The zzso is caused by the orchestrated activity of zzso arms to induce patterned sliding between zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although the mechanism regulating the zzso activity is unknown, previous studies have suggested that the zzso zzso itself is important in the feedback mechanism responsible for the zzso zzso If so, zzso zzso the zzso would be expected to affect the sliding activity of zzso Here we report on experiments with zzso of zzso obtained by inducing sliding in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso not only zzso the zzso activity on and off but also affects the zzso sliding zzso thus supporting the idea that zzso is involved in the zzso mechanism underlying zzso zzso
