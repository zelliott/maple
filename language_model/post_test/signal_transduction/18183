zzso is involved in the regulation of many biological activities such as gene zzso cell zzso and zzso The control of the termination of zzso signaling is as important as the regulation of initiation of signal zzso zzso Three families of proteins involved in the zzso of zzso signaling have been described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso and zzso protein zzso of activated zzso zzso We have analyzed the interplay of two zzso in the signal zzso zzso of zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not act independently but are functionally zzso The zzso of one inhibitor zzso the activity of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to increased zzso levels, whereas increased expression of zzso results in a reduction of zzso zzso after zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso in zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso but not for zzso to exert their zzso activities on zzso signal zzso Besides zzso zzso also interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, our results suggest differences in the function of zzso and zzso and a link between zzso and zzso
