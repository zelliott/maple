Human zzso zzso zzso gene disruption is one of the key features of zzso cervical zzso zzso Though it is thought to prevent progression of zzso the zzso function of zzso protein remains poorly zzso This study shows that expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso cervical cancer cell lines and leads to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of these signaling factors is responsible for the observed sensitivity to zzso upon treatment with zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso experiments clearly show an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso a key regulator of zzso cell death zzso by death zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and a zzso inhibitor protect cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cervical cancer cells from zzso induced by zzso zzso protein zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso abrogates the zzso function of zzso and renders the cell hypersensitive to the zzso zzso signal even below threshold zzso This suggests a novel mechanism for deregulation of cervical zzso cell growth upon zzso zzso which is of great significance in developing therapeutic strategies for intervention of cervical zzso
