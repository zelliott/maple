zzso imaging in live cells is a powerful method for monitoring the dynamics of zzso at an excellent zzso zzso Such an approach, initially limited to a small number of zzso for which specific zzso were available, has become possible for a large number of zzso due to the development of genetically zzso zzso zzso These sensors, which can be introduced into live cells through a transgenic approach, offer the benefits of quantitative imaging, with an extra advantage of zzso In the past decade there has been a drastic expansion in the number of zzso for which genetically zzso sensors are available, and the functional properties of existing sensors are being improved at a dramatic zzso A number of technical improvements have now made the application of genetically zzso sensors in plants rather straightforward, and some of the sensors such as calcium indicator proteins have become standard zzso tools in many plant zzso The use of a handful of zzso has already revealed an amazing specificity of cellular zzso dynamics in plants, which leads us to believe that there are many more discoveries to be made using genetically zzso zzso In this short review, we will zzso the progress made in the past zzso in the development in genetically zzso sensors, and highlight significant discoveries made in plant zzso
