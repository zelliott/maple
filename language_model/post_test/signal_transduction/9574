zzso plaques are characterized by hypoxic even zzso areas and by high zzso of oxidized zzso Moreover, unstable plaques attract a high number of zzso despite the zzso background within these zzso Recently, it was shown that these zzso are positive for zzso This zzso is a part of zzso factor 1 zzso a key zzso factor under zzso zzso date, it is not understood whether the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is involved in protection of zzso under these zzso zzso The present study zzso that zzso causes fundamental changes in the regulation of the zzso in primary human zzso First, both zzso and zzso mediate zzso of zzso zzso Second, treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso is acting in an additive manner on zzso protein zzso Third, zzso alone does not increase zzso zzso but zzso the hypoxic induction of zzso zzso zzso treatment alone was not toxic for zzso under neither zzso nor zzso But, zzso of zzso by zzso expression of a zzso zzso combined with zzso treatment independently of the oxygen tension leads to zzso as determined by zzso zzso and induction of DNA zzso Furthermore, this zzso also mediates the opening of the zzso zzso transition zzso In conclusion, the present data show that zzso regulation is essential for survival of zzso zzso independent of the oxygen zzso zzso this newly characterized mechanism might also have an important influence for the vulnerability of zzso zzso
