zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins in response to specific zzso and growth factors has been investigated primarily in cells of zzso zzso More recently, the zzso and the zzso have also been found to be active in the developing and mature brain, providing evidence for important roles played by these molecules in the control of zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso however, is known about their occurrence and zzso in the aged zzso zzso therefore, investigated the presence of zzso and zzso in zzso brain, and have found that the zzso protein was markedly down regulated with respect to adult zzso while zzso remained zzso We also investigated the potential role of some growth factors in the zzso of the zzso in mature zzso exposing primary zzso cells to zzso zzso factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso Besides zzso which is known to recruit zzso we found that zzso was also zzso zzso by zzso These data are indicative of an important role of zzso and zzso in regulating the zzso status of mature zzso
