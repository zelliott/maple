zzso zzso cancer is associated with a high frequency of zzso and bone is the most common zzso site outside the zzso To clarify its zzso zzso we generated a successive bone zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso following tail vein injection of zzso zzso zzso Compared with parental zzso cells, zzso zzso cells displayed increased zzso but decreased migration or invasion abilities as well as zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets zzso zzso zzso zzso to control zzso gene transcription, and then subsequently regulates the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso cancer invasion in zzso and distant zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was highly correlated with the expression of those downstream markers in clinical tumor zzso Overall, this study reveals a novel mechanism zzso zzso zzso cancer cell zzso into bone, and confirms the significance of zzso transition zzso in formation of bone zzso
