The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso has occupied the attention of zzso for over two zzso Interest arose from the early observation that this soluble protein played key roles in the zzso zzso response to zzso aromatic zzso and in the toxic mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso More recent investigations have provided a fairly clear picture of the primary zzso signaling pathway, from zzso binding to the zzso zzso of genes involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso studies have provided an understanding of the pharmacology of this zzso zzso DNA approaches have identified the zzso sequences through which this factor regulates gene zzso and functional analysis of cloned zzso has allowed the characterization of the major signaling components in this zzso Our objective is to review the zzso zzso role in regulation of zzso metabolism and use this model as a framework for understanding the less zzso mechanism of zzso zzso In addition, it is hoped that this information can serve as a model for future efforts to understand an emerging zzso of related signaling pathways that control biological responses to an array of environmental zzso
