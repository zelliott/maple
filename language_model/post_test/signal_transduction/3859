Using a newly developed, zzso zzso for zzso laser scanning zzso zzso we studied the distribution and zzso changes in zzso zzso concentration zzso in individual zzso zzso by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a rise in zzso whereas no such response was observed in the absence of zzso or in the presence of zzso a zzso plasma membrane zzso channel zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso influx are essential for the increase in zzso in response to zzso stress at less than 10 zzso Analysis of zzso distribution revealed a repetitive zzso zzso zzso originating from the upstream edge of the cell in some populations of zzso which was transmitted to the downstream of the zzso The polarized zzso response induced by zzso might be integral to polarized cellular reactions such as zzso of zzso zzso
