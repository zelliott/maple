zzso cells are a zzso strain of mouse zzso tumor cells that retain many of the properties of zzso cells including expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ability to respond to zzso with increased zzso Recently we noted a dramatic decrease in expression of the zzso zzso Although we do not have an explanation for this decline, we took advantage of it to devise a method that allows for the expression of the zzso human zzso zzso in a zzso cell model that is now practically devoid of zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso can be expressed at variable zzso in zzso cells and that it can stimulate zzso and steroid synthesis as well as activate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show that two naturally occurring zzso of the zzso associated with zzso cell zzso and one zzso associated with zzso cell zzso are zzso active when zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our ability to express the zzso in zzso cells (now practically devoid of zzso zzso provides a novel paradigm to study the cellular and molecular basis of the functions of the zzso in zzso zzso
