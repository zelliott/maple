zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso oxygen species zzso known as zzso that can react with various cellular targets thereby causing cell damage or even cell zzso On the other hand, recent work has demonstrated that zzso also functions as a zzso zzso controlling different essential processes in plants and zzso Because of these opposing functions the cellular level of zzso is likely to be subjected to tight regulation via processes involved in production, distribution and zzso zzso progress has been made exploring the formation and scavenging of zzso whereas little is known about how this signal zzso is transported from its site of origin to the place of action or zzso From work in zzso and bacteria it is clear that the diffusion of zzso across zzso is zzso We have now obtained direct evidence that selected zzso zzso from plants and zzso have the capacity to channel zzso across zzso The main focus of this review is zzso to zzso the most recent evidence for a zzso role of zzso in various pathways in plants and zzso and zzso to discuss the relevance of specific transport of zzso
