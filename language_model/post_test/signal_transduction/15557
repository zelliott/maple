zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso counterparts of zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso of FL B cells has an important role in the progression of FL and might also have an impact on the treatment of zzso zzso is an important zzso of zzso survival signals in zzso Here we studied responses of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in three human FL cell zzso In two of the FL cell lines, zzso protected cells from zzso which was entirely dependent on the zzso of zzso In one of the FL cell lines, zzso induced zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso induced zzso in all three FL cell zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso of zzso or critical downstream zzso targets of zzso instead of blocking zzso zzso in combination with TRAIL or other zzso agents should be considered in the treatment of FL in order to prevent the protective effect of the zzso
