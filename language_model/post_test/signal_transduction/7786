In zzso an zzso distribution of zzso activity that follows cortical rotation in the zzso egg leads to the zzso zzso axis zzso However, how a clear zzso polarity develops from the initial difference in zzso activity still remains zzso We report here that the zzso zzso factor zzso plays an essential role in zzso determination by enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso function causes zzso in the zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso studies show that zzso substantially enhances zzso signaling activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes the formation of a secondary axis on the zzso side when combined with weak zzso activity, whereas zzso alone has little zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso requires zzso for its zzso activity in zzso zzso and protein analyses indicate that zzso is a nuclear protein that physically associates with zzso and efficiently increases the level of zzso in the zzso We discuss the role of zzso as an essential amplifying factor of zzso zzso signaling in embryonic zzso zzso
