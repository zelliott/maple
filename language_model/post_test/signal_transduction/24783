zzso interactions of plasma zzso factor zzso zzso with tissue factor zzso on cell surfaces trigger the zzso signaling zzso At present, it is unclear how these signals influence zzso To zzso this, we have used zzso zzso technology to examine changes in zzso program in human zzso in response to exposure to zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso binding to zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso tissue growth zzso the genes that zzso zzso zzso signaling proteins zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso binding to zzso markedly increased the expression of zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for the gene zzso In addition to zzso zzso also induced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso abolished the zzso expression of these zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso appears not to involve the currently known zzso receptors zzso whereas zzso expression involves the zzso of zzso and possibly an additional zzso Various zzso signaling zzso zzso exhibited different zzso pattern on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso could act as downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso in affecting various biological zzso
