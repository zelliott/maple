In many organisms the coordinated synthesis of membrane lipids is controlled by feedback systems that regulate the zzso of target zzso However, a complete description of the zzso changes that accompany the zzso of membrane zzso has not been zzso To identify zzso signaling networks that coordinate zzso metabolism with gene zzso we zzso the sequential and zzso changes in zzso expression that accompany zzso in zzso metabolism induced by zzso supplementation in zzso This analysis identified six distinct expression responses, which included zzso zzso genes regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein folding zzso and zzso genes regulated by the unfolded protein response pathway, zzso genes regulated by zzso as well as genes involved in zzso zzso zzso stress response, and zzso and zzso acid zzso We also report that the unfolded protein response zzso is rapidly zzso by zzso supplementation and demonstrate that the response of the unfolded protein response zzso to zzso is zzso from the response zzso by zzso These data indicate that altering zzso metabolism produces signals that are relayed through numerous distinct zzso signaling pathways and, zzso produce an integrated zzso zzso We propose that these signals are generated in the zzso by increased flux through the zzso of zzso zzso
