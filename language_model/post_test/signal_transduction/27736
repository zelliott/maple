Recent flow studies indicated that zzso are zzso captured onto and then zzso along the surface through interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso von zzso factor zzso During zzso zzso are assumed to be zzso thereafter becoming firmly zzso and zzso on the zzso In exploring the mechanisms by which zzso become activated during this process, we observed changes in zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso with the real-time zzso adhesive and cohesive process on a zzso surface under flow zzso zzso blood containing zzso loaded with the zzso indicators zzso Red and zzso zzso was zzso over a zzso glass surface in a flow chamber, and changes in zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso based on zzso color changes from red zzso zzso to green zzso zzso during the zzso adhesive and cohesive zzso Under flow conditions with a zzso rate of 1,500 zzso no change in zzso was observed during zzso of zzso but zzso became elevated apparently after zzso firmly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no firm zzso and no zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit firm zzso zzso but completely abolished zzso zzso Although both firm zzso and cohesion of zzso have been thought to require zzso of zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso zzso is a downstream phenomenon and not a prerequisite for firm zzso zzso to a zzso zzso After zzso firmly adhere to the surface, zzso zzso might occur through the zzso signaling from zzso zzso occupied by an adhesive zzso thereby leading to zzso cohesion on the zzso
