Floral zzso involves an ordered set of events coordinated at the plant, zzso organ and cellular zzso This review zzso our current understanding of the input signals, signal zzso and cellular processes that regulate zzso zzso and cell zzso In many species a visible sign of zzso zzso is zzso This is accompanied by zzso of nutrients from the flower to the developing zzso or to other parts of the zzso In other species, petals zzso while still zzso zzso signals for floral zzso also vary across zzso In some species zzso acts as a central regulator, in others floral zzso is zzso insensitive and other growth regulators are zzso Due to the zzso in this coordination and sequence of events across species, identifying suitable models to study zzso zzso has been challenging, and the best candidates are zzso zzso studies provide an overview of the zzso zzso and zzso factors that are activated during zzso zzso in several species including zzso Our understanding of downstream regulators such as zzso genes and zzso is also zzso This gives us insights into possible zzso zzso that regulate initiation of zzso and coordination of cell death zzso It also identifies the gaps in our knowledge such as the role of zzso Finally future prospects for using all this information from model to zzso species to extend zzso life in ornamental species is zzso
