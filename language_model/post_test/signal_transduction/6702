Lately, there is increasing evidence that emphasizes the regulatory functions of zzso which serve as zzso mechanisms after, zzso pathogen zzso to prevent unnecessary tissue zzso zzso processes involving zzso and zzso responses are characterized by high, local zzso zzso followed by resolution and immune zzso Although this is a well-known course of events, extensive attempts to address potential differential effects of zzso in the manner of its availability zzso in the environment do not zzso We demonstrate that high doses of zzso do not induce DC maturation and zzso but instead, induce specific regulatory characteristics in zzso Considering their zzso high doses of zzso extensively induce the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the well-known zzso effect of zzso for zzso production is lost at these conditions, and the DC zzso profile is switched toward an increased zzso ratio upon subsequent stimulation with zzso Furthermore, such zzso are capable of zzso cellular immune responses and zzso of zzso zzso T zzso resulting in reduced cell proliferation and zzso of zzso B zzso Additionally, we find that in this manner, immune regulation zzso by zzso is not mainly a result of increased zzso activity of zzso in zzso but rather, a result of zzso zzso which can be reversed by blocking zzso Altogether, our results identify a novel mechanism by which a zzso environment programs the functional status of zzso to silence ongoing zzso responses to prevent unwanted tissue destruction and zzso
