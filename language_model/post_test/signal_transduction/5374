zzso detects bacterial DNA zzso zzso and elicits both innate and adoptive zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso is expressed in more diverse cell types than initially zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso express zzso and selectively recognize zzso zzso motifs in bacterial DNA and synthetic immune zzso zzso zzso zzso respond to zzso DNA with rapid zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso and surface expression of the zzso molecules zzso and zzso independent of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agents that block zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso A, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso DNA led to markedly enhanced zzso zzso under zzso conditions that was further enhanced when zzso were zzso with zzso zzso The adhesive interactions were blocked by zzso against zzso and, to a lesser degree, by zzso and zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that bacterial DNA promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and indicate the ability of zzso DNA to initiate and/or maintain the inflammatory zzso
