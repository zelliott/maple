Polar cell expansion in zzso zzso is critical for the development and zzso of plant zzso and is modulated by hormonal and zzso signals, yet little is known about signaling in this fundamental process in zzso In contrast to zzso cells, such as zzso tubes and root zzso cells in developing zzso are thought to expand by diffuse zzso In this study, we provide evidence that these cells expand in two zzso with distinct zzso In the early phase, cell expansion can occur in both zzso and zzso or lateral directions and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a mechanism known to control tip zzso The expression of a zzso zzso for zzso zzso inhibited polar cell expansion, whereas the expression of a zzso active zzso zzso caused zzso expansion in the early zzso In the late phase, expansion occurs only in the zzso direction and is not affected by zzso or zzso zzso The transition from the early to the late phase zzso with the zzso of cortical zzso from random to zzso zzso Thus, cell expansion in the late phase is consistent with polar diffuse growth, in which polarity probably is defined by zzso cortical zzso We show that the direction of cell expansion in the early phase is associated with the zzso of diffuse fine cortical zzso in leaf zzso zzso zzso expression specifically inhibited the formation of this zzso but not zzso cables, whereas zzso expression caused zzso distribution of this fine zzso throughout the cell zzso Furthermore, green fluorescent zzso was localized zzso to the cortical region of the cell, where expansion apparently zzso These observations suggest that zzso control of the polar expansion of cells within zzso is analogous to the zzso control of tip growth and of zzso zzso in zzso tubes and root hairs and that the tip growth mechanism also may zzso polar cell expansion in zzso zzso
