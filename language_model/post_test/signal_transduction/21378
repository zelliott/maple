zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso occur most frequently in patients with zzso type 1 and are often zzso Current therapy relies upon radical surgical zzso which often fails to completely remove the zzso To address the need for novel treatment approaches for this disease, we sought to determine if human zzso cell lines are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso of the Ras zzso and its zzso effects on protein zzso R zzso zzso have been shown to dictate cellular zzso to zzso zzso Because zzso zzso possess inherent zzso zzso we hypothesized these tumors would be ideal therapeutic targets for zzso 

Human zzso cell lines were examined for sensitivity to zzso gene zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso These parameters were correlated with zzso zzso following zzso infection and compared with normal human zzso cells zzso without zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines were efficiently zzso supported virus replication and were killed by the zzso zzso zzso including sporadic zzso without zzso zzso In contrast to the highly sensitive zzso cell lines, zzso did not support zzso virus zzso 

zzso are susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso zzso regardless of Ras zzso zzso virus replication in zzso cells appears to be zzso by both cellular expression of zzso zzso and prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell lines was caused by both direct zzso and zzso Our data suggest the use of zzso zzso zzso may represent a novel treatment approach for patients with zzso
