The zzso double bond of the zzso zzso of zzso holds a central position in its zzso zzso and hence the zzso function of this visual zzso To probe the local environment of the zzso element we have prepared the zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso retinal and incorporated these into zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These analog zzso form with much slower zzso and lower efficiency than the native zzso The initial zzso and the signaling activity of the analog zzso were investigated by zzso and zzso zzso and by a G protein zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso formation of the first zzso is strongly zzso by the presence of an zzso zzso but much less by a zzso zzso These results support the current concept of the mechanism of the primary zzso event in zzso An important stronghold of this concept is an zzso movement of the zzso element, which is facilitated by zzso as well as extended positive charge zzso into the zzso segment of the zzso We argue that this mechanism is maintained principally with a zzso zzso at zzso In addition, we show that both an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the zzso cascade and finally yield a zzso state of the zzso The zzso zzso retains about zzso of the G protein zzso rate of native zzso while the zzso zzso behaves like an inverse zzso up to at least 20 degrees C, zzso the protein in a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso region of the zzso and the spatial structure of the binding site are finely zzso in order to achieve a high zzso potential with an efficient zzso to a zzso zzso
