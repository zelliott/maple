The zzso reaction is a zzso event that must be completed by the zzso of many animal species prior to fusion with zzso In zzso zzso in triggered by zzso a zzso component of the egg zzso following zzso zzso zzso promotes a sustained influx of zzso into zzso that is necessary for the zzso zzso Here, we discuss the mechanism by which zzso generates zzso entry, as well as the upstream events leading to this influx and downstream processes that couple it with zzso
