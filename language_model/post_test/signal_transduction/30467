Human zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso when investigated ex zzso exhibit functional properties profoundly different from those of peripheral blood T zzso zzso One prominent feature represents their enhanced sensitivity to zzso stimulation when compared to zzso Given that zzso are zzso to T cell zzso zzso zzso an alternative zzso mode, as zzso by zzso triggering in zzso may be functional in zzso inflammation in zzso This study provides insight into zzso events associated with the high zzso responsiveness of zzso When compared to zzso zzso show an increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Evidence is provided that zzso of this zzso contributes to the enhanced zzso zzso production in zzso Given the importance of zzso stimulation for the initiation of zzso immune responses analysis of zzso pathways induced by zzso receptors may provide valuable information for therapeutic drug zzso
