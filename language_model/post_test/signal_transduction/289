G zzso receptors mediate cellular responses to a wide variety of zzso including taste, light, and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso triggers events leading to zzso The view had long been held that the G zzso signal occurs principally at the plasma zzso Recently, it has been shown that the G protein alpha zzso zzso can promote signaling at zzso and requires two components of the sole zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso contains multiple zzso repeats and also binds to zzso zzso in the zzso state; these observations led us to zzso that zzso may function as a G protein beta zzso at the zzso Here we show an X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain that reveals a zzso zzso resembling that of typical zzso zzso We show further that the zzso domain is sufficient to bind zzso as well as to zzso a potential zzso protein that exists in a complex with zzso The zzso zzso domain together with the intermediate domain zzso the zzso and zzso zzso also contributes to zzso binding and is necessary for zzso to sustain G protein zzso These findings reveal that the zzso zzso domain serves as a scaffold to assemble zzso and zzso whereas the zzso and intermediate zzso are required for proper signaling at the zzso
