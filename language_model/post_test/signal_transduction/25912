zzso A zzso known as an effective zzso agent, is widely used in clinical zzso zzso stem cells may exert zzso effects on the immune system, but the exact mechanisms underlying them remain zzso Here we investigated whether human zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso facilitate in zzso the zzso effects of zzso and we explored the zzso mechanisms that may be zzso 

zzso of T zzso was measured by zzso of zzso zzso and production of zzso and zzso were evaluated by real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction, reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, and zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso was zzso by Western zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were surveyed by flow zzso analysis and Western zzso 

The combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was significantly more powerful than zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone in suppressing zzso and production of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and proliferation of T zzso In addition, zzso expressed a high level of zzso which induced zzso of zzso signaling in T zzso thus reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and N zzso zzso zzso zzso could reverse this zzso 

Human zzso facilitate the zzso effect of zzso on T zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso represents a rationale therapeutic approach aimed to prevent adverse effects of zzso while maintaining its adequate zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso may provide an effective mechanism for the zzso activity of zzso via direct zzso zzso
