The zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso cells zzso signal zzso pathways such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the functional role of the zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso caused a block of proliferation in zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso reproduced this effect in zzso cells and efficiently zzso with proliferation of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso caused the zzso of zzso and zzso the essential zzso cell cycle zzso which was accompanied by a cell cycle arrest of zzso at zzso phase zzso Moreover, zzso retarded tumor growth of zzso in a zzso model in zzso zzso Our data support a critical role of the zzso zzso zzso for proliferation of zzso cells and characterize zzso as a potential target for intervention against zzso zzso
