zzso zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso play an obviously central role in plant structure and metabolism at the cellular and zzso zzso They are involved in the responses to a number of zzso and they act as zzso and zzso zzso molecules that activate specific or zzso zzso zzso thus resulting in important modifications of gene expression and zzso zzso Various zzso reactions and regulations directly link soluble zzso with the production rates of zzso oxygen species, such as zzso zzso or photosynthesis regulation, and, conversely, with zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, stress situations where soluble zzso are involved, such as chilling, zzso injury, or pathogen attack, are related to important changes in zzso oxygen species zzso These zzso or zzso relationships between soluble zzso zzso oxygen species production, and zzso processes are generally confirmed by current zzso zzso and suggest that sugar zzso and zzso gene expression are related to the control of zzso zzso All these links place soluble carbohydrates in a pivotal role in the zzso and zzso balance, and must have constrained the selection of zzso mechanisms involving soluble zzso and preventing zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso Finally, in line with the specific role of zzso in zzso zzso organisms, this role of soluble zzso in zzso stress regulation seems to entail differential effects of zzso and zzso which emphasizes the unresolved issue of characterizing zzso zzso zzso
