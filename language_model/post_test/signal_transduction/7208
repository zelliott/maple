zzso refers to a highly zzso zzso signaling zzso with essential roles in embryonic development and tissue zzso zzso signaling causes human disease, highlighting the importance of zzso zzso zzso signaling ultimately results in the zzso of target zzso which is regulated by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso and a zzso of zzso through differential interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the structures of zzso complexes have been determined, the structures of zzso complexes are zzso Here, using a combination of zzso zzso and cellular approaches, we characterize the structure and function of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso our studies provide molecular insights into how zzso binds zzso with high affinity and competes with zzso such as zzso for binding zzso These studies are important for understanding how zzso functions as both an zzso and a zzso of zzso of zzso target zzso
