zzso signaling can promote tumor formation and development or suppress it, depending on the cellular context and tumor zzso A potential target of this dual effect of zzso is zzso as zzso can inhibit or promote its zzso although the mechanisms underlying this are largely zzso In the present study, we found that mice with zzso deletion of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso to zzso as zzso zzso which have increased zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso exhibited zzso associated with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Application of a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso On the zzso promoter, zzso was mainly associated with zzso zzso whereas zzso was mainly associated with the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso loss caused increased binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with this, knocking down zzso in human zzso caused increased levels of zzso which were zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso human SCC was high in cases with zzso loss and lower when zzso was also zzso We therefore conclude that zzso loss causes zzso zzso via loss of zzso zzso repression and enhanced zzso zzso Since zzso is often zzso in human zzso our data suggest a therapeutic strategy of blocking zzso zzso for zzso zzso
