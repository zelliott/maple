zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of many cardiovascular zzso zzso has been proven to affect a series of zzso pathways and to exert a zzso effect in zzso However, whether it is able to regulate zzso remains largely zzso Here, we report that prolonged zzso zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso exhibited rapid formation of zzso zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso expression and zzso of zzso in response to hydrogen zzso zzso zzso However, prolonged (12 zzso zzso treatment attenuated these effects and was accompanied by a significant increase in zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso restored zzso function and zzso zzso and decreased the extent of zzso caused by prolonged zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso active form of zzso markedly attenuated the increase in zzso induced by short-term (3 zzso zzso treatment and zzso cells to zzso In addition, zzso failed to induce zzso and alleviate zzso in zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso of the essential zzso gene zzso zzso the protective effect of zzso These findings suggest a novel role of zzso in suppressing zzso zzso during zzso stress by zzso the zzso zzso zzso The results also provide insight into how altered zzso and zzso zzso is integrated to control cell survival during zzso stress and may guide strategies to prevent cardiac zzso zzso
