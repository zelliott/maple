Cellular signaling is classically investigated by measuring optical or electrical properties of single or populations of living zzso Here we show that zzso binding to cell surface receptors and subsequent zzso of signaling zzso can be monitored in single, zzso sized native zzso with zzso zzso The zzso are derived from live zzso cells using chemicals or optical zzso They comprise parts of a cell's plasma membrane and zzso and represent the smallest autonomous containers performing cellular signaling reactions thus functioning like minimized zzso Using zzso zzso we measured in individual zzso the different steps of zzso zzso zzso signaling like zzso binding to zzso subsequent zzso zzso and finally zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso Observing cellular signaling reactions in individual zzso opens the door for zzso zzso of cellular functions to the zzso range, zzso single cell analysis, and investigating zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso
