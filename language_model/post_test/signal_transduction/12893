zzso zzso exerts not only zzso but also zzso actions through nuclear zzso receptors zzso Here, we provide a novel paradigm for zzso zzso signaling independent of nuclear zzso zzso zzso a rapid rise in the zzso free zzso concentration zzso through membrane zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso signaling is not prevented by different zzso zzso and cannot directly activate zzso zzso zzso promoter or the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso or NO zzso However, the zzso rise in zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso of zzso promoter and zzso and conversely, it specifically zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter, zzso and NO zzso The zzso zzso of zzso promoter can be prevented by an zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso signaling through membrane zzso is able to specifically zzso zzso signaling pathways with impact on zzso zzso
