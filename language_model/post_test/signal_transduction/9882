zzso leading to massive zzso results in widespread tissue zzso zzso zzso and production of inflammatory zzso and zzso molecules zzso to the vascular zzso Although zzso zzso cell zzso has been extensively zzso very little is known regarding gene zzso changes that occur during the event, particularly in zzso Thus, we employed fluorescent zzso analysis of gene zzso to zzso critical pathways and gene products involved in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso model mimicking the zzso changes seen in human trauma was performed on 10 zzso zzso consisting of zzso blood volume zzso followed by 6 h of full zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso and functional clusters were identified through the use of Database for zzso zzso and Integrated Discovery zzso zzso 

Injured zzso developed profound zzso zzso massive zzso fluid requirements, and microscopic changes of zzso zzso While zzso transcripts were zzso 529 transcripts were zzso DAVID functional zzso analysis revealed 21 significantly altered biological processes that were grouped into 12 distinct functional zzso The transforming growth factor beta zzso family of genes was the most zzso In addition, vascular zzso growth factor zzso signaling members and zzso zzso were also zzso 

Our model identified two major signaling zzso zzso and zzso which undergo early zzso changes in injured zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso may play a crucial role in the development of zzso cell injury leading to increased vascular zzso during zzso
