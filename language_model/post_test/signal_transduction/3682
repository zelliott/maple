Many of the actions of zzso zzso receptors for the transforming growth zzso zzso are zzso by zzso a human zzso protein identified as a tumor zzso gene in pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to induce the zzso of gene expression and cell cycle arrest, characteristic of the zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is also one of the downstream targets required for zzso zzso Here we report that expression of the zzso zzso of various components of the zzso cascade specifically blocked both zzso and zzso gene zzso These zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we find that zzso of zzso causes zzso cells to undergo the zzso changes typical of zzso These findings define a mechanism zzso zzso signals zzso by zzso and zzso cascade are integrated in the nucleus to activate gene expression and identify a new cellular function for zzso
