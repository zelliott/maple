Although zzso zzso promote many zzso responses in plants, little is known about how the hormone interacts with environmental signals at the molecular level for regulating plant zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso of growth by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso at ambient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reverted by elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our finding points to an important role of elevated zzso as a signal allowing higher growth rates of zzso zzso zzso promotes plant growth via a complex zzso network that zzso multiple signaling zzso zzso we discuss how elevated zzso stimulates biomass zzso in a zzso manner by regulating the expression of zzso zzso
