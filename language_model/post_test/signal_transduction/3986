In zzso bacteria, many important processes are controlled by zzso communication, which is zzso by zzso signal molecules produced by the zzso Most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified zzso Signal processing, in most cases, involves either zzso across the zzso membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with zzso zzso zzso of signal in the zzso range or below are frequently sufficient for biological zzso The microbial processes controlled by zzso signaling include the expression of zzso factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of zzso
