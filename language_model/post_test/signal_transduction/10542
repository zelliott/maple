Light zzso massive zzso of major signaling proteins between the zzso compartments of zzso Among them is visual zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso which moves into zzso outer segments during zzso Here, for the first time, we determined the light dependency of zzso zzso which revealed two key features of this zzso First, zzso zzso is triggered when the light intensity approaches a critical threshold corresponding to the upper limits of the normal range of rod zzso Second, the amount of zzso entering rod outer segments under these conditions is zzso to the amount of zzso zzso exceeding it by at least zzso We further showed that it is not the absolute amount of excited zzso but rather the extent of downstream cascade activity that triggers zzso Finally, we demonstrated that the total amount of zzso in the rod cell is nearly zzso higher than previously thought and therefore sufficient to zzso the entire pool of zzso at any level of zzso Thus, zzso movement to the outer segment leads to an increase in the free zzso concentration and thereby may serve as a powerful mechanism of light zzso
