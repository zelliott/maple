zzso reduces food intake by an unspecified zzso Studies show that zzso zzso zzso delivery increases the zzso effects of gastrointestinal zzso stimulation on intake and zzso the zzso response to gastric zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso of the nucleus zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso delivery leaves unspecified the zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso anatomical analysis in rats and mice by zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso shows that zzso zzso zzso are located exclusively within the zzso Here, we investigate 1) whether zzso and gastric zzso affect the same zzso zzso and 2) whether the zzso action of gastric zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five minutes after gastric balloon zzso or sham zzso rats were injected with zzso or vehicle and killed 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso revealed that about zzso of zzso cells also respond to gastric zzso A paradigm was then developed to examine the relationship between zzso and gastric zzso volume on intake zzso At zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso or zzso volume were without zzso When combined, an interaction occurred that significantly reduced food zzso We conclude that 1) zzso zzso in the zzso are primarily located in the zzso at the level of the area zzso a key zzso zzso projection zone of the zzso system; 2) a significant proportion of zzso zzso in the zzso are activated by stomach zzso and 3) zzso delivered to the zzso is sufficient to zzso the zzso effects of an otherwise ineffective volume of gastric zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso acts directly on zzso within the zzso to reduce food intake through an interaction with zzso signal zzso
