The purpose of this zzso study was to investigate the possible role of zzso zzso channels in spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso By incorporating different types of zzso zzso channels and a previous model, this study reproduced typical zzso zzso in zzso Our model could mimic the zzso phenomenon under a wide range of experimental conditions, including resting membrane potential zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso to 1500 zzso temperature (20 to 37 degrees zzso and blocking specific zzso zzso By varying the experimental conditions, the zzso and duration of zzso zzso changed slightly (both zzso while the frequency changed significantly ( approximately zzso This indicates that spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso might be an zzso process, which might be zzso in zzso Moreover, the properties of zzso zzso were found to be related to the dynamics of zzso influx, and not only to a constant zzso zzso calcium channels dynamics should be used in studying zzso zzso This work provides a platform to explore the still unclear mechanism of spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso
