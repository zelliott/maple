High zzso of zzso B virus zzso influences all zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso This study was designed to estimate the overall contribution of host zzso to zzso zzso and investigate the influence of common zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is pivotal in the zzso clearance of zzso 

We first determined familial correlations and zzso zzso proportion of zzso variation that is attributable to additive genetic zzso for zzso zzso using 280 zzso families, including 766 adult zzso zzso Then zzso association analysis was conducted for zzso with a panel of 40 zzso across ten zzso zzso For zzso seven tagging zzso in identified candidate regions were also tested in a further 1011 unrelated individuals with zzso data on zzso zzso over 16 zzso 

After adjustment for zzso zzso and sex, significant correlations for zzso were detected among both siblings and zzso zzso zzso accounted for approximately zzso zzso of the zzso of viral load, whereas zzso zzso and sex together explained less than zzso zzso estimates increased up to zzso after further exclusion of subjects with episodes of liver zzso zzso Our initial zzso association analysis identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 2 zzso gene that were robustly associated with zzso after zzso correction (all zzso The zzso were also associated with the zzso levels of zzso and the persistence of a high zzso of zzso log zzso (all zzso in unrelated zzso 

zzso zzso appears to have substantial zzso zzso in the zzso gene appear to be associated with the zzso of zzso
