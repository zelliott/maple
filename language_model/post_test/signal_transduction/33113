Physical forces of gravity, zzso zzso and movement play a critical role in tissue zzso Yet, little is known about how cells convert these mechanical signals into a chemical zzso This review attempts to place the potential molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, signaling zzso zzso zzso within the context of the structural complexity of living zzso The model presented relies on recent experimental findings, which suggests that cells use zzso architecture for their zzso zzso predicts that cells are hard-wired to respond immediately to mechanical stresses transmitted over cell surface receptors that physically couple the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or to other cells zzso zzso zzso Many signal zzso molecules that are activated by cell binding to growth factors and zzso zzso associate with zzso scaffolds within focal zzso zzso Mechanical signals, therefore, may be integrated with other environmental signals and zzso into a zzso response through zzso changes in scaffold geometry or molecular zzso zzso also provides a mechanism to focus mechanical energy on molecular zzso and to orchestrate and tune the cellular zzso
