zzso is a zzso mainly produced by the stomach and released into zzso affecting energy balance and growth hormone zzso These effects are guided largely by the expression of the zzso zzso growth hormone zzso type zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso However, zzso is expressed in other brain regions, including the zzso where its zzso enhances memory zzso zzso we explore the molecular mechanism underlying the action of zzso on zzso zzso Our data show that zzso is localized in the vicinity of zzso zzso zzso and that its zzso increases delivery of zzso zzso receptors zzso to zzso producing functional modifications at zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhances two different zzso of long-term zzso in the zzso activates the zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso in the zzso enhances zzso synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity by regulating zzso zzso Our study provides insights into mechanisms that may mediate the zzso effect of zzso and suggests a possible link between the regulation of energy metabolism and zzso
