zzso zzso coli strains are able to signal host cells, cause dramatic zzso zzso and adhere intimately to the cell surface in a process known as the attaching and zzso zzso A zzso island of 35 zzso known as the locus of zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for this zzso The LEE encodes an outer membrane zzso called zzso a type III zzso apparatus, and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the region between zzso and zzso revealed a new zzso zzso The product of zzso was demonstrated by using a zzso expression zzso We constructed a zzso zzso in zzso and found that the zzso is incapable of the signal zzso events that lead to zzso of the putative zzso zzso in host cells and that the zzso fails to induce the attaching and zzso zzso These zzso were restored to the zzso by zzso with a zzso containing the cloned zzso zzso We demonstrated by zzso and zzso that the zzso protein is zzso via the type III zzso Thus, we describe a novel locus zzso a zzso protein that is required for attaching and zzso zzso
