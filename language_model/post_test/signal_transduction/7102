zzso zzso and zzso cells are interconnected into a functional network by gap junctions formed primarily by zzso zzso Over the past two decades, it has become clear that zzso is important for the function of zzso and zzso This zzso contributes to the acquisition of peak bone mass and is a major zzso of cortical zzso We review key data from human and mouse zzso on the skeletal consequences of zzso or zzso of the zzso gene zzso and the molecular mechanisms by which zzso regulates the zzso function, and survival of zzso lineage zzso We also discuss putative second zzso that are communicated by zzso gap zzso the role of zzso and the function of zzso as a scaffold for signaling zzso Current knowledge demonstrates that zzso is more than a passive zzso rather, it actively zzso in the generation and zzso of cellular signals that drive skeletal development and zzso
