zzso protein zzso as a therapeutic approach to treat various diseases, especially cancer is currently a fast growing zzso Although many zzso are available, exhibiting remarkable zzso the major challenge is their zzso Here we show that the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in their selectivity against zzso family members, since zzso and zzso are subject to zzso by zzso and zzso however, not by zzso zzso and zzso treatment together with zzso lead to an zzso of zzso stress signaling (as detected by zzso of zzso and zzso In the case of zzso no interference with the zzso zzso is observed, supporting the notion that zzso and zzso interfere with upstream molecules involved in zzso stress zzso We have also tested the protein zzso zzso zzso with respect to cell viability and zzso of zzso zzso activity in the absence and presence of the zzso drug zzso The strongest effect on viability was observed with zzso In contrast to zzso zzso protected cells from zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso activity was cell zzso as zzso zzso was inhibited to different degrees in the cell zzso
