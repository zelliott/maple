zzso signals in immune cells regulate a variety of zzso responses such as cell zzso zzso gene transcription, and zzso zzso Surface zzso stimulation zzso an increase in the concentration of zzso calcium zzso zzso which are derived mainly from two sources, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stores and the zzso zzso The major cascade for zzso entry in immune cells is through zzso zzso entry zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is triggered by depletion of zzso zzso zzso stores, but the molecular mechanism was a long-standing zzso With the recent molecular identification of the zzso zzso sensor zzso interacting zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso channel zzso our understanding of the zzso zzso zzso has increased zzso These advances have now made it possible to shed some light on important questions: what is the zzso significance of zzso and what is its molecular zzso This review focuses on the recent progress in the field and the exciting opportunities for understanding how zzso influences diverse immune zzso
