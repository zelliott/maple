Adult stem cells are responsible for maintaining and repairing zzso during the life of an zzso zzso repair in humans, however, is limited compared to the zzso capabilities of other zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso An understanding of stem cell mechanisms, such as how they are established, their zzso properties, and their recruitment to produce new cells is therefore important for the application of zzso zzso We use zzso zzso zzso following treatment with the zzso drug zzso to investigate these mechanisms in zzso Stem Cell zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for establishing the adult zzso responsible for zzso the zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso fish treated with the zzso zzso zzso develop normal embryonic zzso but fail to zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso By administering zzso at different time points, we show that zzso signaling is only required for zzso prior to zzso treatment and before 48 hours of development, consistent with a role in establishing zzso We then show that zzso of zzso the Kit zzso in transgenic larvae leads to recruitment of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso can rescue zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is required to promote the progression and zzso of the zzso from a zzso zzso This study provides evidence that zzso signaling is required for the establishment of adult zzso during embryonic zzso That this requirement is not shared with the embryonic zzso suggests that embryonic zzso develop directly, without proceeding through the zzso zzso Moreover, the shared requirement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that develops at the zzso transition suggests that these zzso zzso develop from the same adult zzso zzso Lastly, that zzso zzso can recruit the zzso to develop excess zzso raises the possibility that Kit signaling may be involved in zzso recruitment during zzso
