The zzso zzso system consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is able to reduce zzso oxygen species zzso through interactions with the zzso center of zzso which in turn can be reduced by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Among the zzso zzso is zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of zzso into water and zzso The zzso system is active in the vessel wall and functions either as an important zzso zzso or interacts directly with signaling molecules to influence cell growth, zzso and zzso Recent evidence implicates zzso in cardiovascular disease associated with zzso stress, such as cardiac failure, zzso zzso zzso injury, and zzso zzso activity is influenced by many mechanisms, including transcription, zzso interaction, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso models seems to be related to zzso stress and is zzso and zzso Depending on the models of hypertension, zzso system could be zzso or zzso The present review focuses on the role of zzso in vascular biology, describing its zzso activities and biological properties in the media and zzso of the vessel zzso In addition, the zzso role of zzso in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases is zzso
