zzso zzso zzso are birth defects that require surgery and carry significant chronic zzso Our earlier zzso copy number variation zzso study had provided a wealth of candidate zzso To find out whether these candidate zzso are related to important zzso zzso we have performed an extensive literature search coupled with the currently available zzso zzso This has allowed us to assign both zzso and zzso zzso to interrelated pathways known to govern the development of the zzso zzso We have linked 11 candidate genes to the zzso zzso zzso and 17 genes to the zzso zzso Interestingly, candidate genes with similar functions are disrupted by the same type of zzso The gene network we discovered provides evidence that rare zzso in different interrelated genes may lead to similar zzso accounting for genetic zzso in zzso zzso of patients according to the affected zzso and zzso type should eventually improve the diagnosis and the identification of common zzso as therapeutic zzso
