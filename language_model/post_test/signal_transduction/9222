zzso and zzso stresses are major limiting factors of crop yields and cause billions of dollars of losses annually around the zzso It is hoped that understanding at the molecular level how plants respond to adverse conditions and adapt to a changing environment will help in developing plants that can better cope with zzso Acquisition of stress tolerance requires orchestration of a multitude of zzso and zzso changes, and most of these depend on changes in gene zzso Research during the last two decades has established that different stresses cause zzso changes in cellular zzso level, which functions as a zzso in modulating diverse zzso processes that are important for stress zzso In recent years, many zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso factors zzso have been identified in zzso zzso analyses of some of these zzso indicate that they play key roles in stress signaling zzso Here, we review recent progress in this area with emphasis on the roles of zzso and zzso zzso in stress zzso We will discuss emerging zzso in the field, highlight the areas that need further investigation, and present some promising novel zzso tools to address zzso zzso zzso
