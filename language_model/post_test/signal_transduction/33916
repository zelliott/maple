zzso signaling is thought to require assembly of zzso signaling complexes at zzso segments of zzso zzso in which zzso protein zzso are zzso Indeed, zzso a tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family member, forms a complex containing zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular inhibitor of zzso proteins 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso (also called zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso were required for complex assembly and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, these zzso were not activated unless the zzso signaling complex zzso from zzso to the zzso upon zzso degradation of zzso This zzso signaling mechanism may apply to other innate immune zzso accounting for spatial and zzso separation of zzso and zzso zzso
