During zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso exposed to numerous microbial zzso zzso zzso production is an early component of innate immunity and contributes to zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated a synergistic response of respiratory zzso cells to zzso by two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we define a molecular mechanism for the synergistic zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso toxin zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso enters zzso cells more efficiently in the presence of zzso consistent with zzso gaining access to the zzso via toxin zzso Other zzso toxins (including zzso O from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can substitute for zzso in the generation of synergistic zzso zzso with a requirement for pore formation, zzso zzso expressing zzso but not an zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso prime zzso zzso zzso a host zzso zzso zzso is crucial to the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate a role for zzso recognition of zzso in the setting of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that combinations of zzso organisms can activate innate immune pathways previously considered to be reserved for the detection of zzso zzso
