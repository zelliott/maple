There is an obvious urgent need to find effective and safe therapies to prevent both recurrence and progression of zzso zzso In the present study, we report that zzso zzso in human zzso cancer is zzso via zzso of two related zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso B activity, causing a change in the ratio of zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells by inducing zzso and blocking cell cycle progression in the zzso zzso Western zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly increases the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and decreases the levels of zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso thereby contributing to cell cycle zzso In addition, zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso but decreased the levels of zzso and zzso and subsequently triggered zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests that the zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso B system may play important roles in the zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso
