zzso zzso zzso gap junction protein is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the zzso In this work, the expression of zzso in the outer zzso of carp was studied by zzso By light zzso strong zzso zzso was observed in the outer zzso zzso Double labeling experiments on vertical retinal sections showed that zzso zzso were localized beneath cone zzso stained by zzso but not on zzso In addition, few of the zzso of zzso ON type bipolar cells zzso stained by zzso were zzso with zzso in the retinal zzso In isolated cell zzso zzso was clearly expressed on the zzso of zzso ON type bipolar cells zzso but the expression was much less on zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were found in the zzso of isolated horizontal cells zzso by zzso zzso driven by cones, including zzso and zzso cells, but not in those of cells driven by rods zzso zzso At the zzso level, reaction product was found in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso cone zzso but not in zzso cell zzso zzso rod zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso were also zzso These results suggest that zzso could be specifically involved in zzso of the cone signal zzso in the outer zzso of zzso
