zzso (target of zzso complex 1) has a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and zzso A wide range of signals, including zzso zzso is known to activate zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso as zzso of zzso in response to zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso gene expression suppressed the zzso effect of zzso acids on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso in zzso cells activated zzso in the absence of zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso zzso blocked the zzso effects of zzso acids on zzso zzso studies in zzso also show that zzso zzso regulate cell growth, zzso and animal viability during zzso Our studies establish a function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in response to zzso acid zzso
