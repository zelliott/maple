We explored whether the delay that occurs between a rise in plasma insulin and the increase of zzso disposal occurs before, at, or downstream of steps that are believed to be part of the insulin signaling zzso zzso muscle zzso were obtained from 16 zzso subjects before, and 20 and 180 zzso after plasma insulin levels had been zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Although plasma insulin had reached zzso of its final concentration within 10 zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso associated with insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso B zzso zzso in the muscle zzso at 20 zzso had reached only 60, 48, 34 and zzso respectively of those at 180 zzso This suggests a delay before the level of zzso and little or no delay between zzso and zzso zzso The observation that zzso zzso activity and zzso disposal at 20 zzso had both only reached zzso of the respective values at 180 zzso suggests an additional delay downstream of the investigated signaling zzso
