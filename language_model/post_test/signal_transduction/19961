The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso disease zzso and its genetic absence reduces zzso levels in zzso zzso However, its functional role in modulating zzso zzso remains to be zzso 

To this end, we generated triple transgenic mice zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated their zzso 

Compared with controls, zzso mice zzso zzso zzso an zzso of memory deficits, zzso and tangle zzso The zzso in zzso was secondary to an zzso of zzso pathway, whereas zzso zzso resulted from an zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso study confirmed the involvement of this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which was independent of the effect on zzso 

Our findings highlight the novel functional role that zzso zzso plays in zzso zzso zzso zzso They provide critical zzso evidence to justify testing selective zzso zzso for zzso zzso
