We have reported previously that zzso a natural zzso compound, zzso zzso through a zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells and that zzso NO zzso zzso is one of the target molecules of zzso in zzso Recently, it has been suggested that the zzso effects of NO are due to its direct zzso of zzso zzso especially zzso In this study, we investigated whether mouse zzso zzso cells, which express zzso but not zzso respond to zzso with zzso outgrowth through the mechanism observed in zzso cells, to assess the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso cells expressed all three types of NO zzso zzso and zzso was zzso as the main component in Western zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso outgrowth and zzso of zzso which were significantly blocked by a zzso zzso zzso Both a soluble zzso zzso inhibitor and a zzso inhibitor also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso induced sustained zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso In fact, the zzso zzso outgrowth was completely inhibited by a specific zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso inhibitor abolished zzso zzso as well as zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso outgrowth through an zzso signaling zzso followed by zzso zzso without zzso zzso in zzso cells and that zzso downstream to zzso which may be mainly zzso is very important for the signaling zzso to induce zzso by zzso
