Abstract zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that belongs to zzso zzso It plays a significant role in the synthesis and maturation of zzso cells, zzso of zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso signaling has been described in several biological zzso a zzso resource documenting these molecular reactions induced by zzso is not publicly zzso In the current study, we have manually zzso the molecular reactions and interactions induced by zzso from literature zzso We have documented 40 unique molecules involved in 18 zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso 7 zzso events, and 4 zzso zzso zzso We have also zzso 23 genes reported to be zzso regulated under zzso zzso We have enabled the data availability in standard exchange formats from zzso a zzso for signaling zzso We believe that this will help in the identification of potential therapeutic targets in zzso zzso
