zzso is a neurotransmitter that alters the zzso zzso To date, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of zzso in hormone zzso have remained largely zzso In this study, we report that zzso activates zzso C zzso zzso in an zzso manner in zzso zzso cells, and that zzso with either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase in calcium zzso Also, zzso zzso binds to zzso through the zzso zzso 223 domain upon zzso zzso Moreover, calcium increase is alleviated in the cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso as compared with cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the activities of either zzso or zzso results in a significant diminution of the zzso release of zzso hormone zzso In addition, the results of our zzso zzso experiment confirm that zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso stimulates the release of zzso through the zzso zzso pathway, via the zzso of zzso calcium zzso
