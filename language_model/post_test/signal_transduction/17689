zzso zzso involves concerted movements and growth of distinct zzso zzso We show that zzso membrane enlargement is critical for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and is independently controlled by the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso membrane overgrowth in grainy head zzso generates branches that are too long and tortuous without affecting zzso integrity, whereas zzso head zzso limits zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso tube zzso and we find that it zzso zzso head activity zzso thereby controlling zzso membrane expansion to attain its key role in zzso We zzso a zzso model for zzso in zzso first, induction of cell movement and zzso membrane growth, and second, zzso of zzso head to limit zzso zzso ensuring that branches reach and attain their characteristic zzso
