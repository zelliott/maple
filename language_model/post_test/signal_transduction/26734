The relationship between bacterial infection and collagen production was investigated using human zzso zzso with the promoter of zzso , which encodes the zzso chain of human type I zzso linked to a zzso zzso The cells were used to assess the gene promoter activity of zzso following bacterial zzso The zzso promoter was activated by stimulation with fixed zzso coli in a zzso manner, but not by fixed zzso zzso Enhancement of collagen production was observed in the zzso zzso compared to those without zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso B clearly blocked the zzso promoter activity zzso by zzso while zzso against human zzso and human transforming growth zzso zzso zzso type II did zzso These results indicate that zzso can directly interact with zzso expressed on the surface of zzso and can further induce human type I collagen gene expression and collagen production in these zzso These data also suggest that infection by zzso bacteria may cause zzso
