zzso zzso production of tumor necrosis factor zzso requires the recruitment of two pairs of zzso to the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso The contribution of one pair - zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso - to zzso expression is not well zzso To clarify this issue, we studied zzso knockout bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had decreased zzso protein expression even at times when zzso zzso levels were normal, suggesting impaired zzso zzso with this idea, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso decreased translation of a reporter controlled by the zzso 3' untranslated region, while zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased translation of this zzso Also consistent with a role for zzso in zzso translation, zzso zzso of zzso a zzso involved in this process, was impaired in zzso zzso zzso did not increase translation of the zzso 3' untranslated region reporter when expressed in zzso zzso However, zzso that lacked functional zzso produced reduced levels of zzso protein in response to zzso despite normal amounts of the zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed equivalent reductions in zzso protein and zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso signals have a previously zzso cell zzso role in regulating zzso zzso
