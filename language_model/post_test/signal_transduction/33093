The role of marine fish oil zzso zzso fatty acids in the prevention of fatal zzso zzso has been established in experimental zzso Prevention of zzso arising at the onset of zzso and zzso is important because if zzso they result in sudden cardiac zzso Animals supplemented with fish oils in their diet developed little or no zzso zzso after zzso was zzso Similar effects have also been observed in cultured zzso zzso Several mechanisms have been proposed and studied to explain the zzso effects of fish oil zzso fatty zzso but to date, no zzso mechanism has been zzso The sequence of action of these mechanisms and whether more than one mechanism is involved is also not zzso Some of the mechanisms suggested to explain the zzso action of fish oils include the incorporation and modification of cell membrane structure by zzso zzso fatty zzso their direct effect on calcium channels and zzso and their role in zzso zzso Other mechanisms that are currently being investigated include the role of zzso zzso fatty acids in cell zzso zzso through zzso and their effect on various zzso and zzso This article reviews these mechanisms and the zzso studies using zzso zzso fatty zzso
