zzso bone zzso could revolutionize the clinical management of many bone and musculoskeletal zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso can regulate the differentiation of zzso stem cells into cartilage, bone, zzso and fat zzso Early data documented the zzso potential of zzso and zzso However, prior to this work that summarized several of our recent studies, no comprehensive analysis had been undertaken to characterize relative zzso activity of all zzso Using zzso zzso expressing 14 zzso we have demonstrated that, besides zzso and zzso zzso and zzso exhibit the highest zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso We further demonstrated that several zzso may exert synergistic effect on zzso zzso and that zzso zzso produce a distinct set of molecular fingerprints during zzso zzso The reported work should expand our current understanding of zzso functions during zzso zzso It is conceivable that zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, 6, 7, and 9) may be used to formulate synergistic pairs among themselves and/or with other less zzso zzso for zzso bone zzso in clinical zzso
