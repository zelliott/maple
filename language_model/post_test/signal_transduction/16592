The mechanism of zzso has been extensively characterized over the past decade, but little is known about alternative forms of regulated cell zzso Although stimulation of the zzso zzso family triggers a zzso zzso zzso pathway, we demonstrated that in the absence of zzso zzso signaling it is capable of zzso a common zzso death pathway, which we term zzso We showed that zzso is characterized by zzso cell death zzso and zzso of zzso We identified a specific and potent zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso which blocks a critical step in zzso We demonstrated that zzso contributes to delayed mouse zzso brain injury in zzso through a mechanism distinct from that of zzso and offers a new therapeutic target for stroke with an extended window for zzso Our study identifies a previously zzso basic zzso zzso with potentially broad relevance to human zzso
