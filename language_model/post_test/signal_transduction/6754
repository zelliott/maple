zzso cellular function and therefore zzso survival is determined by the sensitive and accurate convergence of energy and zzso abundance to cell growth and zzso Among other factors, this integration is coupled by the target of zzso zzso pathway, which is able to sense zzso energy and oxygen availability and also growth factor zzso Indeed, zzso signaling regulates cell energy zzso by zzso anabolic and zzso processes for zzso zzso named zzso in zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that exists in two different complexes, zzso and zzso Recently, studies are suggesting that zzso of those complexes promote disease and disrupted zzso such as aging, obesity and related disorders and even zzso The zzso linking zzso to energy and zzso zzso included the zzso At central level zzso regulates food intake and body weight being involved in the mechanism by which signals such as zzso and zzso exert its zzso At peripheral level it influences zzso and zzso in different zzso including the zzso zzso chronic nutritional zzso of zzso signaling has been implicated in the development of beta cell mass expansion and on insulin zzso zzso of zzso and other molecular zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso as well as their zzso is crucial to know how organisms maintain optimal zzso This review summarizes the role of zzso zzso complex in cellular energy zzso evidenced in the last years, focusing on the zzso pathways where it is involved and the importance of this zzso sensor in cellular and whole body energy zzso zzso the exact role of zzso zzso may provide new cues for therapeutic intervention in zzso
