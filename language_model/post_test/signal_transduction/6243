zzso zzso factors play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes including cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and POINTED is required for zzso appropriate responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso compete for regulatory regions of common target zzso with the ultimate outcome likely influenced by zzso interactions with binding partners such as zzso Previous work in cultured cells has led us to propose that zzso zzso the zzso activity of both zzso and zzso although its effects on POINTED remain zzso Here we describe a new layer of complexity to this regulatory hierarchy zzso zzso expression is itself directly regulated by the opposing action of zzso and zzso In addition, we report that zzso can antagonize POINTED function during eye zzso a finding that suggests zzso operates as a dual positive and negative regulator of zzso signaling in zzso Together our results lead us to propose that a combination of zzso and zzso interactions between zzso zzso and POINTED establishes a complex regulatory circuit that ensures that both zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso occur appropriately according to specific zzso zzso
