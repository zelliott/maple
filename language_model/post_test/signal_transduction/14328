The Sleeping Beauty zzso zzso zzso screen is a powerful tool to facilitate the discovery of cancer genes that drive zzso in mouse zzso In this study, we sought to identify genes that functionally cooperate with sonic zzso signaling to initiate zzso zzso a tumor of the zzso By combining zzso zzso with zzso zzso mice zzso we observed an increased frequency of zzso and decreased zzso survival compared with zzso zzso From an analysis of 85 tumors, we identified 77 common zzso sites that map to 56 genes potentially driving increased zzso The common zzso site genes identified in the zzso screen were mapped to human zzso which were used to select zzso and corresponding expression data from an independent set of previously described human zzso samples, and surprisingly were capable of accurately zzso known molecular zzso of zzso thereby defining common regulatory networks underlying all forms of zzso irrespective of zzso We performed a network analysis to discover the likely mechanisms of action of zzso and used an in zzso model to confirm a role for a highly ranked candidate zzso zzso in promoting zzso zzso Our analysis implicates candidate cancer genes in the deregulation of zzso and zzso zzso and reveals a strong signature of zzso regulation that will have broad impact on expression programs in zzso These networks provide functional insights into the complex biology of human zzso and identify potential avenues for intervention common to all clinical zzso
