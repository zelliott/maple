zzso receptors zzso are known to regulate zzso refinement and zzso zzso However, because zzso are abundantly present as zzso zzso zzso during development, the precise role of the individual zzso zzso and zzso in these processes has not been zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso provide a unique opportunity to address this problem, because the expression of both zzso and zzso (but not zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso were introduced into these naturally zzso zzso at 4 zzso and zzso recordings at 11 zzso confirmed that synaptic zzso receptors and zzso receptors were formed, zzso Analysis of the zzso architecture showed that introduction of zzso but not zzso dramatically increased the number of secondary and zzso zzso branches of zzso Whole cell zzso recordings further indicated that the newly formed branches in zzso zzso were able to establish functional zzso because the frequency of miniature zzso synaptic currents was zzso Using previously described zzso we also found that disruption of the interaction between zzso and zzso dramatically impaired zzso branch formation in zzso The differential role of the zzso and zzso zzso and the requirement for zzso in regulating branch formation was zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that the association between zzso and zzso is needed for zzso branch formation in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The dominated zzso expression and the limited interactions of this zzso with the signaling protein zzso may contribute to the restricted zzso zzso development in the adult zzso
