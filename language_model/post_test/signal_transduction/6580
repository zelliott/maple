To assess the general effects of protein zzso C zzso zzso on cell membrane zzso mobility in human zzso zzso zzso zzso the lateral diffusion of zzso zzso wheat germ zzso zzso membrane zzso was measured using zzso recovery after zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso the zzso with different zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The membrane effects of zzso zzso zzso another possible membrane zzso were also zzso We found that zzso treatment zzso than or equal to 10 zzso increased the zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso The mobile fraction zzso remained constant, around zzso With zzso no effect on the diffusion was zzso The increase in lateral mobility due to cell stimulation with zzso was totally inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but only partly with zzso zzso (2000 zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso mobility in zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso of zzso mediates zzso mobility of zzso receptors in zzso a reaction that seems to be critically dependent on formation of zzso oxygen zzso The results indicate that zzso formation of zzso zzso upon zzso stimulation may have a general effect on zzso zzso
