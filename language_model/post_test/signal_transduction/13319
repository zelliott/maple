zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in an increase in the zzso level of copper zzso zzso zzso expression both locally and zzso zzso of the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso expression indicated that zzso acid worked as a potent zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas salicylic acid and zzso acid caused a strong reduction of the zzso zzso zzso without having any effect on the zzso zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso decreased hydrogen zzso zzso levels in all the zzso as evidenced in zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, inhibitor zzso of wounded zzso resulted in a lower zzso of zzso both at the wound site and in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso by zzso after zzso of resistant zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso resulted in the development of extended zzso zzso with extensive cell damage occurring in zzso and cortical zzso zzso These results, besides stressing the zzso by key signaling molecules in zzso zzso regulation, demonstrate that local and systemic zzso induction is essential for zzso production in response to wounding and indicate the relevance of these zzso in protection against zzso
