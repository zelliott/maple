Fibrosis of normal zzso often accompanies radiation treatment of zzso zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso is thought to play a major role in zzso zzso and has prompted the development and assessment of low molecular weight zzso of the zzso Previous studies with zzso have shown it to inhibit zzso signaling in zzso and protect mice from zzso leg contraction (a model for soft tissue zzso The current study confirms these findings for zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso treatment from 7 zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso exposure provided significant protection against zzso leg contraction in mice 3 and 4 months zzso zzso zzso treatment was shown to zzso zzso signaling molecules taken from zzso skin including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter, zzso a zzso of zzso may serve as a suitable zzso for monitoring the efficacy of zzso should it be evaluated in a clinical setting for protection against zzso zzso
