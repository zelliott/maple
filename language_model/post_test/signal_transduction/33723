In this article, we review the evidence that dietary protein has a positive influence on bone health, reduces hip fracture risk, and promotes zzso recovery, and we consider the zzso zzso and zzso bases of the interactions that link protein and calcium zzso including effects via IGF-1 and zzso In addition, we consider the roles of zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso dietary protein intake to zzso change as well as the central role of zzso receptors zzso in the control of calcium zzso Finally, we consider how recently identified zzso zzso zzso receptors from class 3 of the zzso coupled zzso zzso including, zzso the zzso itself may contribute to the impact of dietary protein on zzso
