zzso of zzso signaling is considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for many zzso However, rational zzso approaches to cell based drug screens for zzso agents have historically been compromised by the notorious absence of suitable control zzso 

In order to address this fundamental problem, we have developed zzso a zzso screening platform to identify specific zzso of this zzso zzso relies on the zzso of zzso cell lines that have been engineered to sustain zzso independent survival of the parental zzso cells, and that are individually zzso with different fluorescent zzso zzso in the first of these two lines cell survival in the absence of zzso is dependent on the expression of activated zzso the cells expressing zzso zzso signaling display zzso independent growth and survival in an zzso zzso Small molecules can then be screened in these lines to identify zzso that rescue zzso zzso 

zzso measures differential cell survival using zzso live cell imaging and permits selective zzso of zzso signaling to be zzso zzso is a platform technology suitable for the identification of small zzso zzso of zzso zzso survival zzso
