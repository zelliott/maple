The zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor virus zzso and zzso sheep zzso zzso are the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pulmonary zzso zzso respectively, characterized by zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins of these related zzso act as zzso in that they can transform zzso and zzso cell lines in zzso In addition, viral zzso expression of the zzso proteins for these viruses causes tumors in zzso Here, we investigated what signaling pathways are required for the zzso transformation in zzso We have previously found that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso transformation of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we found that the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso transformation in zzso rat kidney zzso cells, but the zzso inhibitor zzso drastically enhanced zzso which is quite similar to zzso zzso Small molecular zzso and dominant negative versions of zzso and zzso indicated a role for both of these molecules in transformation by either zzso These results indicate that the signaling pathways for zzso and zzso transformation are quite similar, consistent with the notion that these proteins do not determine the zzso of the tumors for these zzso
