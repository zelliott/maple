The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso among all zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso receptors zzso with the capacity for zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso is important for zzso dissemination to or replication within the zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso as well as known zzso signature motifs in zzso zzso II and TM III to determine the impact on cell surface zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The region between zzso acids zzso and zzso of the C zzso was found to be important for zzso and zzso zzso although not essential for zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the N zzso of zzso resulted in loss of cell surface zzso Within TM II, an zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso demonstrating a role, as in other cellular and viral zzso of TM II in zzso zzso In TM III, the zzso (but not the zzso zzso of the zzso motif (the counterpart of the common zzso motif in cellular zzso was found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated into zzso zzso showed that disruption of zzso signaling for a viral zzso zzso resulted in a reduced capacity to zzso to or replicate in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was found to partially compensate for the lack of zzso in zzso suggesting zzso biological roles of the zzso gene zzso
