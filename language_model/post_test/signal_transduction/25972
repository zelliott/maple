Previously we have found that zzso treatment of zebra zzso during zzso stages of vocal development alters song patterns produced in zzso Such persistently altered behavior must be attributable to changes in zzso zzso responsible for zzso We are currently working to identify the nature of such zzso changes, and to understand how they contribute to altered vocal zzso One possibility is that zzso zzso exposure results in altered expression of elements of zzso signaling zzso To test this hypothesis we have studied effects of the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso in zebra zzso zzso 

We found that late zzso zzso treatment caused a long-term global zzso of both levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso across brain regions, while repeated zzso treatment in adults produced few long-term changes in the zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that the zebra zzso zzso system is particularly sensitive to zzso zzso exposure during the critical period of song learning and provide insight into susceptible brain zzso
