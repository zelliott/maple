The zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso are commonly used as zzso drugs that inhibit cholesterol zzso An zzso effect, as a zzso function of certain zzso has been zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso one of the natural zzso on cell zzso cell cycle, invasive activity, and molecular expressions associated with zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and DNA synthesis in zzso and zzso cells from head and neck zzso cell zzso The addition of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of cell growth and migration into the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes occurred after treatment with zzso demonstrating loss of cell zzso and disruption of zzso filaments in zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell proliferation seemed to be associated with cell cycle arrest and increased expression of zzso zzso and activated zzso The expression of zzso a counter zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was decreased by treatment with zzso The zzso effect of zzso was inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that molecular changes resulting from treatment with zzso included the zzso of cell cycle regulators and zzso factors and the zzso of zzso molecules and cell proliferation zzso Of zzso genes induced by zzso treatment, a significant depletion of zzso zzso was confirmed using western zzso zzso These results imply that zzso has the potential to be effective for the prevention of the growth and zzso of cancer zzso
