zzso zzso are the most abundant molecules present in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso responsible for multiple forms of zzso Among the prominent biological activities displayed by the major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso functions such as the protein zzso C zzso signaling zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which activate the zzso zzso To address the question as to which structural domain of zzso zzso is responsible for dramatic zzso of zzso transient zzso zzso the chemically zzso defined zzso domain of corresponding zzso and zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso The results presented here demonstrate that the unusual zzso domain of zzso zzso is primarily responsible for zzso of zzso transient zzso zzso
