Previously, we have found that zzso zzso were essential for zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling during zzso zzso differentiation zzso However, it was not identified as to which of the membrane zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso Using small zzso zzso interference zzso we successfully suppressed the zzso protein zzso In cells zzso zzso with zzso expressing small interfering zzso zzso fragment, no zzso protein or zzso was zzso On the other hand, removal of zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of IGF-1 zzso in zzso zzso on plasma zzso IGF-1 zzso signal zzso and induced cellular differentiation were normal in zzso cells with only zzso zzso Furthermore, these IGF-1 zzso signaling events were still sensitive to the zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso zzso are sufficient for IGF-1 zzso signaling and the recruitment of signal molecules by zzso is not essential for IGF-1 zzso zzso
