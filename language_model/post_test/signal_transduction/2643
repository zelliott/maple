The zzso protein zzso zzso has been shown to play an important role in long-term zzso zzso in the zzso but little is known about the function of zzso in long-term depression zzso We have combined zzso and genetic approaches to demonstrate that zzso activity is required for both zzso zzso and zzso and that a specific zzso zzso of type I regulatory zzso zzso zzso is zzso Mice carrying a zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso beta were established by use of gene targeting in embryonic stem zzso zzso slices from zzso mice show a severe deficit in zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is also evident at the lateral zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso beta zzso zzso Despite a zzso increase in the related zzso alpha protein and a lack of zzso changes in total zzso activity, the zzso function in these mice is not zzso suggesting a unique role for zzso zzso Since the late phase of zzso zzso also requires zzso but is normal in zzso beta zzso mice, our data further suggest that different forms of synaptic plasticity are likely to employ different combinations of regulatory and zzso zzso
