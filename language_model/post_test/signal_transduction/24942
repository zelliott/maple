Control of energy metabolism by increases of zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a fundamental mechanism to meet the zzso demand imposed by heart zzso but the machinery underlying propagation of zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso release channels zzso to the zzso remains zzso Using zzso cardiac zzso cells we investigated the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso spikes that often appeared as zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso Rapid increases in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were synchronized to the rising phase of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of global zzso were in the zzso range, but the rate of zzso increases was as large as it was in the presence of 30 zzso global zzso Furthermore, zzso increases of zzso were relatively insensitive to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso rises of zzso appear to result from large and rapid increases of zzso zzso The falling phase of zzso spikes was followed by a rapid zzso of zzso zzso slowed down relaxation of zzso zzso whereas zzso A had no effect, suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso accounts for rapid reversal of the zzso response with little contribution from the zzso transition zzso Thus, rapid zzso of zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso evoked by zzso local zzso signals allow zzso to respond rapidly to single zzso spikes in cardiac zzso
