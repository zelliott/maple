Following the discovery of insulin 85 zzso ago and the realization thereafter that in some individuals, zzso lose their responsiveness to this hormone, an enormous zzso effort began to dissect the cellular mechanisms of insulin action and define abnormalities in the zzso zzso A clear goal through the years has been to unravel the insulin signal zzso network regulating zzso zzso This line of investigation has provided tremendous insight into the physiology and zzso surrounding the cellular processes controlled by zzso Between the plasma membrane insulin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso many events participate in the zzso of the insulin zzso In this review, we detail our current state of knowledge on the intricate insulin signaling network responsible for zzso transport in peripheral zzso and skeletal muscle zzso In particular, we identify signaling connections spanning the insulin zzso and zzso In addition, we discuss zzso mechanics and membrane zzso and fusion mechanisms zzso involved in the cellular zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso On the whole, this review highlights the considerable progress in our understanding of insulin signaling in health and disease as we rapidly approach the zzso anniversary of zzso zzso
