zzso malaria is a severe zzso condition associated with the interaction of high numbers of infected zzso to human brain zzso without invasion into the zzso The result is coma and zzso with death in more than zzso of zzso Because the brain zzso is at the interface of these zzso we investigated the global gene responses of human brain zzso after the interaction with zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso The most significantly zzso transcripts were found in gene zzso groups zzso the immune response, zzso and zzso inflammatory response, zzso zzso and signal zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was central to the regulation of the P zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for example, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased more than zzso suggesting an important role of zzso barrier zzso zzso in the innate defense during P zzso zzso zzso zzso However, some of these zzso molecules could have zzso effects on brain tissue and thus on zzso zzso The inflammatory pathways were validated by direct measurement of proteins in brain zzso zzso This study zzso the strong inflammatory component of human brain zzso contributing to cerebral zzso
