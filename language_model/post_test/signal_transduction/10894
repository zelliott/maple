The molecular mechanism of anemia that is zzso to zzso human zzso zzso in zzso patients without underlying zzso factors has not been investigated fully in zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso cells (1 zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso patients who were responsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso The patients with known causes of EPO zzso were eliminated from the current zzso The cells were cultured in zzso PRO 34 liquid zzso supplemented with zzso zzso stem cell factor, and zzso colony stimulating factor for 7 d and then transferred to a zzso zzso culture medium for performing burst forming zzso zzso colony zzso zzso of zzso zzso domain 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso was assessed with Western zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso zzso or scrambled zzso were included in the culture zzso and its effects were zzso The number of circulating zzso cells was not statistically different among the three groups, and their proliferation rates were similar for 7 d in zzso However, zzso colonies were significantly decreased in zzso patients compared with zzso and control zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso was significantly increased, whereas that of zzso was reduced in zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso zzso in culture suppressed zzso protein expression associated with zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso and partial recovery of zzso zzso In zzso zzso patients, the EPO signaling zzso is attenuated as a result of zzso of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso activity, and zzso may be a novel target zzso to sensitize EPO action in these zzso
