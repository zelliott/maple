The zzso zzso family of zzso proteins has important instructional roles in zzso zzso Despite zzso being modified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso far from its site of synthesis and programs cellular zzso depending on its local zzso We show that in the receiving cells of the zzso wing zzso disc, zzso zzso spreads across many more cell diameters than the wild type and this spreading leads to the zzso of low but not high threshold zzso zzso zzso forms become zzso through the zzso plasma zzso while zzso zzso enters through the zzso cell surface - in all cases via a zzso zzso Full zzso of the zzso zzso and the spread of zzso throughout the zzso zzso depend on the ability of zzso zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither zzso modifications nor zzso function are required to activate the targets that respond to low levels of zzso All these data show that the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso is important both for precise zzso spreading through the zzso surface and for correct zzso zzso
