zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso mediates its actions through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso the zzso region of zzso that is involved in zzso zzso we prepared zzso fusion proteins between various combinations of its seven zzso zzso zzso zzso binding studies show that in zzso zzso one and two zzso acids zzso are sufficient to achieve zzso zzso Either domain alone is insufficient to achieve this zzso However, zzso analysis reveals that despite the binding capabilities of this zzso the zzso is five fold lower than zzso binding to the full zzso zzso We find that addition of domain three to this minimal site restores high affinity zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso one and two are sufficient to achieve interactions of zzso with zzso Growth Factor zzso
