zzso is an zzso zzso cell surface protein containing a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso As a zzso zzso displays a strong association with zzso A zzso a member of the plant zzso zzso Treatment of several cell lines with zzso caused zzso zzso of a major cellular zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated that this protein corresponded to zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by recruitment of zzso and was inhibited by zzso a selective inhibitor of the zzso family zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso associated with zzso and was activated upon treatment of cells with zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso was markedly enhanced in zzso zzso cells and was zzso in zzso coli cells zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso form of zzso in zzso cells affected cell zzso and had a dominant negative effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso Together, the data indicate that zzso is a major zzso of zzso and has an important role in cell signaling via zzso Considering the various biological activities of zzso the study of zzso may have major therapeutic zzso
