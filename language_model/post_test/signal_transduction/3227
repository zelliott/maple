Previous study has suggested that distinct populations of zzso cells exist in the anterior zzso blood islands zzso and zzso zzso blood islands zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, details for differentiation programs of these two populations have not been zzso In the present study, we examined the role of zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor signals in the regulation of zzso cell differentiation in the zzso marginal zone and zzso marginal zone zzso that are the sources of zzso cells in the zzso and zzso We found that regulation of zzso activity is essential for the differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso but is not required for the differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso zzso activity of the zzso signal is necessary for differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso but is not involved in the differentiation of zzso cells in the zzso zzso results reveal that distinct mechanisms are involved in the zzso zzso and zzso cell differentiation in the zzso and zzso
