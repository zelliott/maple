zzso plasticity in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso is necessary for vessel zzso repair and adaptation to vascular changes associated with zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso including zzso and zzso zzso As zzso has been reported to have zzso protective effects, we investigated its role in zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated the novel finding that zzso promoted zzso differentiation as measured by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and contraction in collagen zzso zzso induced zzso differentiation through stimulation of zzso and zzso We made the novel finding that low or high dose zzso had an initially different mechanism on induction of zzso We found that low dose zzso zzso differentiation through zzso zzso of zzso whereas high dose zzso zzso differentiation through zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, allowing zzso of zzso The health effects of zzso in cardiovascular diseases, cancer and longevity are an area of active zzso We have demonstrated a supplemental avenue zzso zzso may promote health by maintaining and enhancing plasticity of the zzso
