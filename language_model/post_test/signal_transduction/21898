The transforming growth zzso zzso zzso encompasses the zzso and receptors for zzso bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso Cellular response to zzso is zzso and may be controlled by specificity and/or zzso of expression of these zzso zzso Several pathways within this family have been implicated in the zzso zzso and renewal of zzso stem cells zzso however, their roles and redundancies at the molecular level are poorly understood in the rare zzso Here we have characterized the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso We demonstrate a remarkable likeness between these two cell types with regard to expression of the majority of receptors and zzso necessary for the zzso of signals from zzso zzso and zzso We have also evaluated the response of these two cell types to various zzso in proliferation zzso In this regard, primary cells and the zzso line behave similarly, revealing a zzso effect of zzso that is similar to that of zzso in bulk cultures and no effect of zzso on zzso Signaling studies that verify the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso confirm zzso responses to these zzso In addition to providing a thorough characterization of zzso zzso expression in zzso our results define the zzso line as an appropriate model for molecular characterization of zzso zzso
