zzso is a type 1 zzso zzso that is mainly expressed in the zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso is correlated with the zzso potential of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso however, the exact regulatory mechanism of zzso expression has yet to be zzso Here, we provide the first report of the zzso regulatory mechanism under zzso an essential feature of the tumor zzso and a driving force of cancer zzso Our data revealed that zzso was significantly induced by hypoxic stimulation through a zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in some pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso whereas other pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso exhibited little response to zzso Interestingly, these zzso cells have highly zzso zzso motifs within the zzso responsive element zzso zzso a binding site for zzso Thus, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso at zzso on the hypoxic induction of zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso followed by additional hypoxic incubation resulted in the restoration of hypoxic zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso from patients with zzso showed higher zzso status as compared to those from zzso zzso and zzso was also correlated with zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggested that the zzso hypoxic signal zzso contributes to zzso zzso and DNA zzso of zzso could be a zzso of the hypoxic zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso
