The progressive loss of zzso zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso has been proposed to result from the combined effects of damage to zzso and failure of zzso A common feature of zzso zzso is the presence of zzso precursors zzso blocked at a zzso zzso However, the zzso basis for zzso of zzso repair is incompletely zzso To identify novel regulators of zzso zzso potentially zzso during repair, we performed a zzso screen of zzso zzso zzso genes expressed in zzso zzso zzso We report that approximately 50 zzso zzso genes show dynamic expression during repair and that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso is specific to zzso not zzso white zzso We report that zzso signaling is active during zzso development and zzso in zzso Moreover, we observed similar regulation of zzso in the developing human zzso and zzso of zzso Data mining revealed elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso transcripts and proteins within zzso zzso indicating zzso of the zzso in this pathological zzso We show that zzso of zzso signaling in zzso results in profound delay of both zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso conditional zzso of zzso in the zzso lineage in zzso and zzso findings from zzso mice, which lack one functional copy of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Evidence of zzso zzso activity in human zzso zzso suggests that its zzso might contribute to inefficient zzso repair in human neurological zzso
