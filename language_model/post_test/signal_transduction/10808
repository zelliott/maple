zzso growth, tumor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso are all enhanced in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells isolated from zzso mice show elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso suggesting that zzso can control the zzso of zzso responses by controlling zzso levels or zzso We now show that zzso signaling is required for the enhanced tumor growth and zzso seen in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells exhibit enhanced migration and proliferation in response to zzso in zzso and this zzso requires zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 than zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, signaling via zzso is required to mediate the elevated responses to zzso observed in zzso zzso cells and zzso rings in zzso These data confirm that zzso signaling via zzso is enhanced in zzso mice and suggests that this increase may mediate the enhanced zzso and tumor growth observed in these mice in zzso
