The zzso zzso is an zzso factor that also plays a regulatory role in zzso zzso food zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso tissue is the primary source of zzso it is also expressed in other zzso and zzso including the zzso However, there is no information on whether zzso as described previously for other zzso such as zzso and zzso could regulate this zzso Likewise, the molecular basis of zzso actions remains largely zzso Here we show that administration of zzso to dispersed rat anterior zzso cells increased zzso release in both the short (4 zzso and long (24 zzso term, decreased zzso levels of the zzso of the zzso regulator zzso and increased free zzso zzso concentration in single zzso By means of a pharmacological approach, we found that the zzso action of zzso occurs through a zzso zzso mechanism and that the zzso zzso zzso A pathway, the zzso zzso pathway, protein zzso C, and zzso zzso entry through zzso zzso zzso channels are essential players in zzso the effects of zzso on zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time a regulatory role for zzso on zzso function and provide novel insights on the zzso mechanisms activated by this zzso
