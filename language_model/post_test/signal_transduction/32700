Since the discovery of the phenomenon of neural induction by zzso and Mangold in 1924, considerable effort has been invested in identifying the signals produced by the organizer that are responsible for diverting the fate of cells from zzso to zzso zzso progress has been made only recently by the finding in zzso that zzso is a neural inhibitor and zzso zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso are zzso by the zzso However, recent results in the chick point to the existence of other, upstream events required before zzso zzso zzso neural zzso Here we take a critical view of the evidence for and against the view that zzso zzso is a sufficient trigger for neural induction in different zzso
