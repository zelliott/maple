The zzso of type I zzso signaling is a major component of host defense against viral infection, but it is not typically associated with immune responses to zzso bacterial zzso Using mouse and human airway zzso cells, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso activates type I zzso zzso which contributes to its zzso as a respiratory zzso This response was dependent on the expression of protein A and, more specifically, the zzso domain, a short zzso region zzso by DNA that consists of repeated zzso sequences that are the basis of an internationally used zzso typing zzso zzso A was zzso by airway zzso cells and subsequently induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso which are incapable of responding to type I zzso were substantially protected against lethal zzso zzso pneumonia compared with zzso control zzso The profound zzso consequences of zzso zzso particularly in the zzso may help to explain the conservation of multiple copies of the zzso domain of protein A in zzso zzso strains and the importance of protein A as a zzso factor in the zzso of zzso zzso
