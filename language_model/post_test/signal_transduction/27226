zzso development requires the coordinated expression of nuclear and zzso zzso A hypothesized signal from the zzso couples the zzso of certain nuclear genes zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso We have previously described an zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a zzso in the signal zzso zzso zzso such nuclear and zzso gene zzso Here we show that zzso zzso are also defective in establishing zzso zzso zzso zzso develop normally in the dark, but, based on zzso criteria and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the differentiation of zzso to zzso are retarded in their ability to zzso zzso we propose that the zzso gene plays an important role in the transition from zzso to zzso growth, suggesting an important zzso role for the zzso signaling zzso during zzso zzso
