zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso However, the contribution of zzso to this condition has not been definitely zzso In this study, we investigated whether threshold concentration of zzso enhances cerebrovascular smooth muscle zzso contraction to zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso contraction was measured in zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso and particulate zzso of zzso cells were examined for zzso and zzso zzso with specific zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone did not produce any significant contraction, but it markedly zzso the magnitude zzso of zzso and rate zzso of zzso of contraction in response to zzso which was attenuated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the contraction was also inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso by zzso indicating that the action of zzso was zzso by the zzso type A zzso zzso with zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and intact zzso zzso zzso also caused zzso of zzso expression in zzso of zzso cells exposed to zzso for 10 and 60 zzso but did not markedly change the distribution of zzso Thus, in zzso threshold concentration of zzso zzso contraction induced by zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso This process may contribute to the pathological contraction of cerebral arteries observed after zzso zzso
