zzso growth zzso zzso signaling pathways regulate a number of zzso functions during zzso zzso and wound healing, including zzso survival, and zzso zzso can induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso which has critical roles in promoting zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso for zzso with important roles in the survival and zzso of zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso the expression of zzso in immortalized zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is required for full induction of zzso protein and zzso in response to zzso This regulation was not observed in zzso primary zzso indicating that coordinate regulation of zzso by zzso and zzso is a property of immortalized zzso zzso did not regulate zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the combined zzso effects of zzso and zzso on zzso were suppressed by a zzso family zzso zzso zzso indicating involvement of a zzso zzso These findings provide early evidence of a role for zzso in zzso zzso induction of zzso in immortalized or transformed zzso during skin zzso
