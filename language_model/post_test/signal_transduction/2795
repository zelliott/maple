zzso and zzso cells appear zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso in structures known as blood zzso This observation has led to the suggestion that these two zzso lineages share a common zzso Recently, we have shown in the zzso zzso zzso that a single cell in the zzso marginal zone of the early zzso can give rise to both zzso and blood cells as well as to other zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso and Fishman, zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weinstein, zzso zzso and Fishman, zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso that affects both the zzso and zzso lineages at a very early zzso The zzso the zzso lining of the heart, is missing in zzso zzso This deletion is selective as evidenced by the presence of other zzso cells, for example those lining the main vessels of the zzso Early cardiac zzso proceeds normally even in the absence of the zzso The zzso cells form a tube that is demarcated into chambers, beats zzso but exhibits a reduced zzso This functional deficit is likely due to the absence of the zzso cells, although it may be a direct effect of the zzso on the zzso zzso Cell transplantation studies reveal that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso consistent with the possibility that zzso is part of a signal zzso zzso In addition, the number of blood cells is greatly reduced in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso show no expression of zzso or zzso two key zzso zzso factors that are first expressed during early zzso These results show that zzso is involved in the genesis and early diversification of the zzso and blood zzso possibly by affecting a common zzso cell zzso
