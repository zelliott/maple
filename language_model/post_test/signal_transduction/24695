It has been shown previously in T cells that stimulation of protein zzso C or the T cell zzso zzso leads to a rapid and persistent zzso of zzso as measured by a dramatic increase in the amount of bound zzso These stimuli are also known to induce the expression of the T zzso growth factor, zzso zzso an essential growth factor for the immune zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso has been demonstrated in several cell types but involvement of protein zzso C as an upstream zzso of zzso appears to be unique to T zzso In this study we show that zzso acts as a component of the protein zzso C and T cell zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso controlling zzso gene zzso In the zzso T cell line zzso zzso active zzso greatly zzso the zzso zzso and T cell zzso zzso induced production of zzso as measured both by biological zzso for the zzso and by the use of a reporter zzso Active zzso also partially replaces the requirement for protein zzso C zzso in zzso with a calcium zzso to induce production of zzso Furthermore, using a dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso function is essential for induction of zzso expression in response to protein zzso C or T cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins is thus a necessary but not sufficient event in the induction of zzso zzso Ras proteins are therefore pivotal zzso molecules in T cell zzso
