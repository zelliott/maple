During embryonic development, zzso molecules known as zzso act in a zzso manner to provide zzso information to responding zzso In the early zzso zzso graded zzso by members of the zzso family zzso the formation of zzso and zzso thereby patterning the zzso into three germ zzso zzso zzso has also been implicated in the establishment of the zzso axis of the zzso Although one can zzso the existence of zzso zzso by comparing gene expression patterns in zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso is diminished or zzso real understanding can only come from directly observing the zzso One approach is to determine local zzso zzso in the zzso but this is technically challenging, and the presence of zzso might cause the effective concentration of a zzso to differ from its actual zzso We have therefore taken two approaches to zzso a direct response to zzso zzso In the first, we have used transgenic zzso to study the nuclear zzso of a zzso fusion zzso and in the second we have used zzso zzso zzso to zzso the formation of a complex between zzso and zzso This has allowed us to zzso in living zzso the formation of a graded distribution of zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the formation of the zzso in time and space, and our results not only confirm that zzso zzso patterns the zzso into three germ zzso but also shed light on its role in patterning the zzso axis and highlight unexpected complexities of zzso zzso
