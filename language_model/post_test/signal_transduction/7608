zzso zzso is an important opportunistic bacterial zzso causing infections of respiratory and other organ systems in zzso hosts that may invade and zzso in zzso zzso cells to induce zzso Previous studies suggest that oral bacteria, especially zzso zzso zzso may enhance zzso zzso invasion into respiratory zzso cells to augment tissue zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in respiratory zzso cells via the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso signaling zzso The activated zzso zzso the downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This process was accompanied by zzso of zzso molecular zzso death promoter zzso and zzso activity zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso was affected by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to greater cell death compared with zzso zzso challenge zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of respiratory zzso zzso with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory zzso
