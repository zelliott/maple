The zzso zzso system in zzso zzso zzso which is composed of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso response regulator, controls the expression of all of the photosynthesis zzso either directly or zzso in response to changes in oxygen zzso In zzso under zzso conditions it is the zzso zzso c zzso which generates an zzso signal preventing the zzso of activated zzso Using zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrate in zzso that the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by apparently increasing the intrinsic zzso zzso activity, which zzso zzso zzso without zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is required for the enhancement of zzso zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a significantly greater ability to zzso zzso than does truncated zzso lacking the zzso zzso This is at least in part due to the lower zzso rate of the truncated zzso relative to the full-length zzso This finding provides evidence that the sensing domain zzso zzso of zzso plays an important role not only in zzso sensing the state of the zzso zzso but also in maintaining the correct zzso of zzso providing optimal zzso zzso
