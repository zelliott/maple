We examined the effects of zzso medium on the gene expression changes in human zzso stem cells zzso during the in zzso culture using a DNA zzso zzso In this study, we cultured zzso with two kinds of zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso fetal bovine zzso or 2) zzso zzso medium developed for zzso stem cells zzso and compared zzso zzso cell zzso and gene expression changes until 50 days zzso zzso analysis was performed with zzso zzso Human Genome zzso Plus zzso zzso zzso proliferation was significantly higher in zzso medium than in zzso zzso The cell zzso of zzso cultured with zzso was not significantly changed in 50 days zzso The gene expression changes in zzso during the in zzso culture were significantly higher in zzso than in zzso After 50 days culture, 1991 genes were significantly changed the expression levels compared with 3 days in zzso but not zzso The expressions of genes related to cell cycle, cancer, zzso and cell growth were significantly changed by zzso for 50 days zzso It was also changed by zzso that the expressions of genes related to the signaling pathways contain various growth factors, such as IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may be useful to obtain an enough number of zzso cells for tissue engineered medical devices in zzso however, it should be recognized that zzso would alter the expressions of genes related to a variety of signaling pathways in zzso if the culture period would be extended to obtain a large number of zzso
