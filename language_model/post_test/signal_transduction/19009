zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso protein synthesis through zzso target of zzso zzso signaling and is used as an zzso in the treatment of organ rejection in transplant zzso Recently, the zzso properties of zzso have been zzso for cardiovascular benefit as zzso impregnated with zzso effectively reduce coronary zzso We report here a novel role of this drug in protection against zzso zzso zzso Adult male zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso The hearts were subjected to 20 zzso of global zzso and 30 zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The blocker of zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso 100 zzso was given 10 zzso before zzso zzso size in the zzso treated group was zzso zzso zzso and was reduced to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mice zzso decrease, P zzso zzso zzso blocked the protective effect zzso area zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso limiting effect of zzso was not associated with improved recovery of zzso zzso We further examined the effect of zzso in protection against necrosis and zzso in adult zzso subjected to simulated zzso and zzso zzso treated with zzso in doses from zzso zzso demonstrated significantly lower zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso supporting the protective role of drug in the intact zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso potent zzso effect against zzso zzso through opening of zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso may be a novel therapeutic strategy to limit zzso zzso and zzso following zzso injury in the zzso
