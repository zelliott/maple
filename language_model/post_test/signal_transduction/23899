The number of possible T cell zzso outcomes resulting from T cell zzso zzso engagement suggests that the zzso is able to zzso activate a myriad of signaling pathways depending on the nature of the zzso The complex structural organization of the zzso itself could zzso this diversity of zzso Assembly and zzso studies have helped us to shed some light on the initiation of zzso zzso The zzso is composed of zzso and zzso zzso Changes in the interaction between zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and in the interaction of these zzso with the zzso zzso could be the triggering mechanism that zzso the first zzso zzso One of the hallmarks of these early changes in zzso zzso is the induced recruitment of the adapter protein zzso to a zzso sequence of the zzso tail of zzso but there may be zzso According to our most recent zzso the zzso is organized in pre-existing clusters within plasma membrane zzso exhibiting a complexity above and beyond that of zzso composition zzso How the presence of zzso in clusters influences zzso zzso and propagation of zzso signals is something that has yet to be zzso
