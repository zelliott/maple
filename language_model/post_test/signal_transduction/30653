zzso production of zzso zzso the zzso causes bilateral columns of embryonic segments to zzso This process involves a molecular zzso zzso zzso signal is translated into a zzso periodic pattern by a complex zzso zzso system within the zzso zzso zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in both the clock and zzso mechanisms, but how the zzso zzso can perform these two functions simultaneously remains zzso Here, we use a yellow fluorescent protein zzso real-time imaging system in mouse zzso to demonstrate that clock zzso are independent of zzso protein zzso In contrast, we show that the zzso zzso is established through a nuclear zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso of nuclear zzso defines the size of the zzso field and controls key aspects of zzso maturation and segment formation, emphasizing the central role of zzso zzso in this zzso
