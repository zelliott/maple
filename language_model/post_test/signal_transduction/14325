zzso are important regulators of organ zzso Although their role in systemic zzso has been extensively zzso their impact on pulmonary vessels remains less zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of hypoxic pulmonary zzso zzso via fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso This is underscored by the prominent zzso effect of zzso on pulmonary arteries and strongly reduced zzso in zzso mice and zzso mice upon pharmacological treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, mass zzso zzso revealed a clear increase of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid in hypoxic lungs of zzso zzso We have identified pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells as the source responsible for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, either zzso mice or zzso mice treated with zzso inhibitor zzso are protected against zzso pulmonary hypertension and the zzso vascular zzso in the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is an important zzso of zzso and is involved in the generation of pulmonary zzso
