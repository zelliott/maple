zzso a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso factor family, was first identified as a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signals based on the interaction of zzso with the zzso tail of zzso and with the zzso associated zzso in zzso However, the functions of zzso in zzso remain zzso 

We show that zzso mice exhibit severe zzso and are defective in zzso zzso In zzso culture experiments revealed that zzso precursor cells derived from zzso mice are unable to differentiate to functional zzso in response to zzso differentiation factor zzso In bone zzso of zzso mice, the number of zzso immature B cells is markedly reduced while the ratio of zzso to zzso cells is not zzso In contrast, development of zzso is not zzso Furthermore, zzso mice are defective in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

The results identify zzso as an essential component of zzso zzso pathway, and also show that zzso plays pivotal roles in immune and inflammatory systems in zzso
