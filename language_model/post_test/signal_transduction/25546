The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the correlation with the zzso status of downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso protein 1 zzso were analyzed and zzso signaling was evaluated in lung zzso zzso analysis of 140 cases revealed zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso but much less in small cell zzso Combined analysis with zzso revealed that when zzso is zzso at least one of the zzso or zzso zzso was activated in zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso of zzso cell lung zzso zzso For each zzso the zzso of the zzso vary among zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso regardless of zzso status, and zzso of these showed zzso of downstream zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was frequently accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of entire zzso through zzso was observed in 50% of zzso harboring zzso zzso including zzso cell zzso zzso By zzso analysis, zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso in general, but zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso in zzso and with zzso zzso in zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was present in defined subset of zzso zzso zzso axis is frequently activated in zzso and zzso activated through zzso by zzso zzso even in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are possible zzso of zzso zzso in SCC and zzso zzso
