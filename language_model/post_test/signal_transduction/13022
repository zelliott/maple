zzso cell death zzso plays a critical role in the maintenance of zzso and peripheral tolerance in the immune system, and is zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression and the interaction between zzso and zzso In the present study, we examined the role of the zzso system in zzso using T cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso blocked T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in the T cell zzso zzso and zzso gene expression and mouse zzso promoter activity following zzso stimulation were suppressed by zzso zzso zzso or point zzso of the zzso site in the zzso promoter region did not suppress zzso zzso promoter activity zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso activity induced by zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was essential for zzso expression and zzso The initial zzso zzso steps following zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were not altered by zzso These data suggest that the zzso system has some regulatory function at an intermediate step between the initial zzso zzso steps and zzso zzso in zzso
