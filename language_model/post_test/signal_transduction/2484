zzso acutely stimulates protein synthesis in zzso cells, and this involves zzso of the process of zzso zzso zzso translation is a complex zzso process zzso by proteins termed translation zzso Several translation factors are regulated in response to insulin, often as a consequence of changes in their states of zzso The initiation factor zzso binds to the cap structure at the zzso of the zzso and mediates assembly of an zzso complex termed zzso Assembly of this complex can be regulated by zzso proteins zzso which inhibit zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso This regulatory mechanism is likely to be especially important for the control of the translation of specific zzso whose zzso regions zzso are rich in secondary zzso zzso of another class of zzso those with zzso containing zzso tracts is also activated by insulin and this, like zzso of the zzso appears to involve the zzso zzso zzso which leads to zzso of the 70 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso stimulation of translation may involve zzso of initiation factor zzso which is required for all initiation zzso This effect is dependent upon zzso zzso and may involve the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso leading to its zzso zzso zzso can also be activated by insulin, and this is associated with the zzso and zzso of zzso factor zzso probably as a consequence of the zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso Thus multiple zzso pathways acting on different steps in translation are involved in the zzso of this process by insulin and lead both to general zzso of translation and to the selective regulation of specific zzso
