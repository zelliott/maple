zzso expression of the zzso zzso contributes to the genesis of many human zzso yet strategies to exploit this for a rational zzso therapy are zzso zzso promotes cell growth and zzso and alters cellular metabolism to enhance the provision of precursors for zzso and cellular zzso Here we show in human and zzso cell lines that zzso levels of zzso establish a dependence on zzso zzso 5 zzso also known as zzso for maintaining zzso zzso and for cell zzso zzso is an upstream regulator of zzso and limits protein synthesis via zzso of the zzso target of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso also maintains expression of zzso respiratory chain complexes and respiratory capacity, which is required for efficient zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a collapse of cellular zzso levels in cells expressing zzso zzso inducing multiple zzso responses as a secondary zzso zzso of zzso zzso survival in zzso mouse models of zzso zzso demonstrating that targeting cellular energy zzso is a valid therapeutic strategy to eliminate zzso cells that express zzso zzso
