zzso zzso occurs upon degradation of its inhibitor zzso and requires prior zzso of the inhibitor by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is governed by its zzso zzso zzso Signaling defects due to zzso zzso in zzso have been correlated to its inability to either become zzso or bind zzso zzso Because the relative contribution of these events to signaling had remained unknown, we have studied zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso that either impair signaling or cause zzso zzso zzso Certain zzso zzso neither bound zzso nor were they zzso by zzso zzso an zzso zzso into those zzso zzso restored their zzso and created zzso zzso zzso zzso without repairing the zzso zzso zzso activity therefore arises downstream of zzso binding but upstream of zzso Such zzso activity reveals a zzso function for zzso beyond that of a mere zzso zzso We propose that this signal processing may involve zzso zzso interactions as suggested by the enhanced affinity of zzso zzso from zzso active zzso
