Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso a smooth muscle fate in primary neural crest cells in zzso By crossing a conditional zzso of the type II zzso zzso with the neural zzso zzso zzso we have addressed the in zzso requirement for zzso signaling in smooth muscle zzso and zzso We find that elimination of the zzso zzso does not alter neural crest cell zzso to a smooth muscle fate in the zzso or cardiac zzso and that a smooth muscle fate is not realized by trunk neural crest cells in either control or zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso exhibit with complete zzso two very specific and mechanistically distinct cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and interrupted zzso arch zzso zzso organ defects such as those seen in models of zzso syndrome were not observed, arguing against an early zzso of the cardiac neural crest cell zzso We zzso that zzso is an essential zzso signal for the neural crest cell lineage in specific aspects of cardiovascular development, although one that is not required for smooth muscle zzso
