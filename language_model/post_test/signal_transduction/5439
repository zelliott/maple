The zzso secondary zzso arises by outgrowth from the oral side of the paired zzso processes zzso the primitive oral zzso zzso growth depends on zzso interactions between the oral zzso and the underlying zzso zzso Previous studies have implicated sonic zzso zzso as an important zzso signal for regulating zzso zzso However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which zzso regulates zzso development in zzso have not been directly zzso due in part to early embryonic zzso of mice lacking zzso or other essential components of the zzso signaling zzso Using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the developing zzso zzso we show that the zzso expressed zzso signals directly to the zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso cell proliferation through maintenance of zzso D1 zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso signaling specifically regulates the expression of the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso in the developing zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso signaling regulates zzso zzso and zzso expression in the developing zzso zzso and that specific zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso indirectly affects zzso zzso cell zzso Together with previous reports that the zzso expressed zzso signals to the zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso expression and cell zzso these data demonstrate that zzso signaling plays a central role in zzso the zzso zzso interactions controlling zzso zzso
