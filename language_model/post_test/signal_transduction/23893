The objective of this study was to characterize zzso the zzso interaction between zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of synaptic zzso zzso 

The in zzso zzso relation of zzso was determined through zzso zzso zzso zzso received a single intravenous dose of 10 zzso zzso in the absence and the presence of a zzso plasma concentration of zzso The zzso response in the zzso to zzso frequency band was used as the zzso end zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in a mean zzso plasma concentration of 66 zzso 3 zzso A significant zzso interaction with zzso was zzso zzso inhibited zzso clearance by 20 zzso 7 zzso from the original value of 89 zzso 6 zzso However, no changes in plasma protein binding of both drugs were zzso The zzso relation of zzso was described by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso estimates of zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These values were not significantly different in the presence of zzso zzso that may explain the lack of zzso were identified by a zzso interaction model that separates the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso High efficiency of signal zzso and the presence of a baseline response were shown to diminish the degree of zzso 

We conclude that the in zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is additive rather than zzso This strongly suggests that zzso zzso of the zzso activity of a zzso inhibitor by a zzso does not offer a therapeutic zzso
