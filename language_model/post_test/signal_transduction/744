The sophisticated chemical responses of plants to environmental stimuli have profound implications for the development of remote sensing zzso Recent advances in the investigation of these responses have demonstrated that plants can be developed as reliable reporters of numerous environmental stimuli including soil and water conditions, light levels, temperature, mechanical damage, insect zzso exposure to zzso those that affect animals and zzso exposure to airborne zzso Researchers are just beginning to understand the full range of plant zzso responses to these and other zzso These responses often have measurable zzso and molecular components that are readily zzso Other responses zzso internal zzso zzso are less readily zzso although sensing devices are being zzso Plant volatile zzso zzso are particularly promising modes of plant reporting that can provide highly specific information regarding a diverse range of environmental variables on short time zzso but new approaches are needed for sensing these responses zzso Modern molecular techniques promise to allow us to refine plant sensing and reporting, greatly enhancing the potential utility of plants as zzso zzso basic research aimed at characterizing the zzso zzso and molecular responses of plants to environmental stimuli (including airborne zzso insects and zzso zzso are essential to achieving that zzso
