Our previous study revealed that plasma zzso levels were lower in pregnant women with zzso diabetes zzso than zzso independent of zzso zzso We examined whether central zzso zzso energy and zzso zzso via altering insulin resistance, insulin zzso or zzso zzso in diabetic zzso 

zzso zzso type 2 zzso rats were zzso infused with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or saline zzso zzso via zzso zzso respectively, for zzso 

Central zzso improved insulin signaling zzso but not zzso in the zzso Central zzso did not alter serum zzso levels in diabetic rats whereas the levels were higher in zzso rats than diabetic zzso Body weight at the 2nd week was lowered in the zzso group due to decreased food intake in the first two weeks compared to the zzso group and energy expenditure was not significantly different among the treatment groups of diabetic zzso zzso zzso treatment nullified the central zzso zzso zzso increased whole body zzso disposal rates in zzso zzso clamp compared to zzso and lowered zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso blocked the zzso effect on insulin resistance zzso In zzso clamp study, the area under the curve of insulin in first and second phase were significantly higher in the zzso group than the zzso group without zzso insulin sensitivity at the zzso state, whereas the increase in serum insulin levels was blocked in the zzso zzso Central zzso also increased zzso mass by increasing zzso zzso 

Central zzso improved zzso zzso by increasing insulin zzso and insulin sensitivity at zzso through the zzso in diabetic zzso zzso zzso is a positive zzso of zzso zzso by delivering the zzso signals into the zzso
