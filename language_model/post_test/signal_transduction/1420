A set of early response genes has been identified whose zzso in zzso is rapidly induced in response to growth zzso zzso members of this group, zzso and zzso zzso products that form a zzso and have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cell zzso It is thought that other early response genes also zzso critical zzso of the cell's response to external zzso We have used zzso zzso cells as a model system to test the hypothesis that different zzso signals induce distinct patterns of expression of early response zzso Our results indicate that membrane zzso induced either by zzso zzso or by the neurotransmitter analog zzso activates a program of gene expression distinct from that activated by nerve growth factor or zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso whereas zzso is zzso with zzso and zzso after growth factor zzso membrane zzso activates zzso and zzso without stimulating zzso zzso may therefore form zzso complexes with alternative zzso under different stimulation zzso zzso and zzso which zzso putative zzso factors, also show markedly different responses to growth factors and zzso We conclude that multiple zzso signal zzso pathways control early response gene zzso Our findings also indicate that the diversity and specificity of cellular response to environmental change can be accounted for by the differential zzso induction of a relatively small number of early response zzso
