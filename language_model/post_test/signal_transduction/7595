zzso are critically involved in host defense and tissue zzso zzso signal mechanisms controlling zzso activities are poorly zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in mouse and human zzso was zzso quickly after zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso the zzso expression level was zzso correlated with inflammatory zzso productions of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice displayed increased zzso activities to zzso zzso and were hypersensitive to zzso acute lung damage with increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that the enhanced inflammatory activity of zzso caused by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The increased migration ability of zzso zzso was zzso by the decreased zzso zzso and zzso which was directly regulated by zzso zzso zzso Thus, our findings identify a previously zzso function of zzso as an intrinsic negative regulator for zzso zzso zzso production and migration through multiple signal zzso
