The zzso zzso zzso factor is zzso in most human cases of T cell acute zzso leukemia zzso often downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are also common in zzso We generated a conditional zzso model of zzso in which zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso and disease, and withdrawal of zzso results in zzso zzso and tumor zzso However, we found that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso or expression of a zzso active zzso zzso rendered tumors independent of the zzso zzso and promoted disease progression after zzso zzso Moreover, zzso suppresses zzso zzso levels, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso promotes tumor zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso is sufficient for tumor maintenance in this model, even after loss of survival signals driven by the zzso zzso
