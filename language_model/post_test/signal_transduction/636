zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a multitude of protein zzso The zzso is zzso expressed in zzso cells, where it functions in a variety of cellular zzso including cell cycle zzso zzso transcription, and viral zzso While the importance of zzso in the zzso life cycle is zzso the regulatory mechanisms zzso its numerous functions remain zzso In this review, we focus on the various roles of zzso in the zzso cell, with particular attention on its functions through the stages of the cell cycle and during the decision to undergo cell zzso We highlight how these roles are controlled in part through direct zzso regulation by zzso and how the zzso activity of zzso can be hijacked in the case of viral zzso Finally, we discuss possible ways in which these functions are integrated to allow the cell to respond appropriately in the presence of multiple zzso
