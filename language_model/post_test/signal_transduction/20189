The efficient removal of dead cells is an important process in animal development and zzso Cell corpses are often engulfed by professional zzso such as zzso However, in some zzso with limited accessibility to circulating cells, zzso is carried out by neighboring zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Here, we investigate the mechanism of corpse clearance in the zzso zzso zzso a tissue that is closed to circulating zzso In zzso egg chambers, dying zzso cells are engulfed by the surrounding zzso zzso zzso by unknown zzso We show that the zzso zzso is activated and required in engulfing zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso is also required in engulfing zzso cells, and activates the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso zzso in zzso cells is sufficient to induce death of the underlying zzso suggesting that there is coordination between the zzso and zzso zzso to promote zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso the need for zzso in zzso The induction of zzso and zzso in zzso cells occurs independently of zzso activity in the zzso indicating that at least two pathways are necessary to coordinate zzso cell death with zzso by the zzso zzso
