zzso and zzso are zzso tumors originating from the developing sympathetic peripheral nervous zzso zzso are usually benign, while zzso have a variable prognosis and include very aggressive zzso Examples exist of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso progressing to zzso Little is known of the molecular differences between the tumor zzso Here we report that zzso zzso a putative extra cellular inhibitor of the zzso pathway, showed a strongly differential expression between zzso and zzso zzso analyses of 109 zzso tumors revealed that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso but only zzso in zzso Low zzso expression in zzso correlated with a poor zzso The expression of zzso in the tumor series and in zzso cell lines was zzso correlated with the expression of the zzso zzso Analysis of 2 zzso cell lines with zzso activity of zzso showed that zzso is zzso by zzso We subsequently generated cell lines with zzso expression of zzso which revealed an zzso effect of zzso on zzso High zzso expression in the benign zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso might contribute to the strongly different clinical behavior of both zzso tumor zzso
