zzso sequences from the zzso domain of zzso zzso are known to regulate activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Here we show that peptides from the type 1 repeats of zzso also stimulate zzso zzso function in melanoma zzso zzso of soluble zzso 246 zzso enhances spreading of zzso melanoma cells on several zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso zzso and native zzso This activity requires the zzso zzso and is independent of zzso sequences in the type 1 zzso zzso type 1 repeats expressed as a zzso zzso fusion protein also enhance spreading on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the soluble zzso 246 stimulates organization of zzso and increases zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso In contrast, direct zzso of melanoma cells on immobilized zzso 246 zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function by the type 1 repeat zzso differs from that induced by zzso zzso peptides in that zzso zzso zzso are required and zzso toxin does not inhibit the former zzso Thus, the type 1 repeats contain a second sequence of zzso that can enhance zzso zzso zzso and these two sequences stimulate recognition of both zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso
