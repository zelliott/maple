The zzso region of the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso of G protein zzso The roles of individual zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso analysis of the zzso acids in this zzso zzso studies on zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso cells showed that zzso zzso of the zzso acids in positions zzso of the third loop had no major effect on signal zzso However, deletion zzso that removed zzso or affected its position relative to zzso zzso VI significantly impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso abolished the ability of the zzso to mediate zzso zzso production, whereas its replacement with basic or polar zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with polar zzso had relatively minor effects on zzso zzso signal generation, but its replacement by zzso acid reduced, and by positively charged zzso zzso zzso significantly increased, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso receptors were impaired in parallel with the reduction in their signaling zzso These findings have identified zzso and zzso as the critical zzso in the zzso region of the third zzso loop of the zzso for zzso zzso They also suggest that an zzso zzso acid corresponding to zzso of the zzso is a general requirement for zzso of other G zzso receptors by their zzso zzso
