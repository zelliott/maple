We have previously reported that serum zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso Since the mechanism of zzso signaling is unknown, we have investigated the possibility that zzso like other zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso might induce migration of zzso by G protein zzso We report here that zzso of zzso with zzso toxin zzso inhibited zzso zzso while incubation with zzso toxin zzso did zzso zzso and zzso both zzso of protein zzso C zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso at zzso that were effective in zzso zzso resulted in transient zzso of zzso calcium concentration zzso and incubation of cells with zzso markedly inhibited the zzso of zzso in response to zzso This suggests that both zzso and the rise in zzso are zzso by G proteins of the zzso zzso The increase in zzso induced in zzso by zzso was comparable to that zzso by zzso and was zzso greater than that induced by optimal zzso of zzso zzso members such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all failed to zzso zzso zzso influx and zzso in zzso This suggests that zzso uses a distinct zzso that is coupled to zzso G zzso
