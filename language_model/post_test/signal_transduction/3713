The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is activated during zzso and has the capacity to activate zzso DNA fragmentation in isolated zzso This study examined the zzso zzso the functional relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso family; and zzso whether zzso of zzso zzso is sufficient to commit zzso a cell to zzso zzso In three different leukemia cell lines, we showed that agents that directly zzso zzso or indirectly inhibit zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso zzso protected cells from zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso however, prevented zzso of zzso activity as revealed by zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso by cell zzso and also by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity without zzso was also demonstrated in two zzso derived from the zzso zzso leukemia in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selective for zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso activity is one of several upstream signals required for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to commit zzso a cell to zzso death under conditions where zzso of zzso is zzso
