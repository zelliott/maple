Alzheimer's disease zzso is a significant and growing health problem in the aging zzso Although definitive mechanisms of zzso remain zzso genetic and zzso clues have implicated the proteins zzso zzso and zzso as key players in zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to familial zzso and although zzso is not zzso in zzso zzso pathology is a hallmark of the zzso zzso transport deficits are a common feature of several neurodegenerative disorders and may represent a point of intersection of zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the contribution of zzso as opposed to zzso zzso to zzso transport defects in the context of zzso loss, we used a mouse model zzso deficient for zzso zzso zzso and expressing zzso human zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso mice exhibited early zzso pathology and zzso transport deficits that preceded development of these zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso These deficits were associated with reduced zzso zzso defective learning and memory and impaired synaptic zzso The combination of these effects accelerated zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results strongly support a zzso role for zzso and zzso in zzso transport and zzso survival and function and zzso their zzso as a contributor to zzso zzso
