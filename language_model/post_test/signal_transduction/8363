Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear receptors display complex opposing and overlapping functions and a wide range of pharmacological and molecular genetic tools have been used to dissect their specific zzso zzso bound zzso has been shown to repress zzso Response zzso zzso zzso and several lines of evidence point to the importance of zzso repressive actions in both cardiovascular and cancer zzso 

In this report we have employed transient zzso and zzso reporter gene technology to study the zzso effects of zzso and two derivatives zzso We demonstrate for the first time that the classical dominant negative deletion of the zzso zzso 2, zzso domain of zzso show enhanced repression of zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso We propose that the mechanism for the phenomenon is increased zzso zzso and DNA binding upon zzso binding zzso with zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated zzso dominant negative action of a DNA zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso This activity was abolished upon zzso of zzso suggesting a role for zzso competition in the absence of DNA zzso 

These findings are important in understanding the wide spectrum of molecular interactions in which zzso and zzso have opposing biological roles and suggest novel zzso for the design of different functional classes of nuclear zzso zzso zzso
