The mechanisms regulating the emergence of zzso zzso remain poorly zzso zzso zzso analyses looking for genes expressed in human zzso led to the identification of zzso as a candidate gene conceivably involved in this zzso Analysis of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso trafficking showed that despite pronounced zzso it was subjected to zzso nuclear export followed by zzso degradation in the zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso based on either forced expression or zzso zzso of zzso we provide evidence that the protein promotes zzso over zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso to zzso zzso an increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso with these findings, enforced zzso expression in humanized mice fosters the emergence of zzso zzso zzso enhances subsequent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso provokes a global shift of zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso development, zzso zzso zzso and leads to zzso zzso of B zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso with the zzso signaling zzso to foster the emergence of zzso zzso and drive subsequent zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso
