zzso basic protein zzso which helps form compact zzso zzso is a major protein expressed during zzso zzso zzso zzso basic protein expression is regulated mainly at the zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso factor zzso can activate the zzso zzso Data from the laboratory also indicate that zzso is expressed highly in both growing and differentiated zzso Because this is true, we wanted to understand how zzso activity is regulated such that it increases zzso gene zzso only in zzso zzso zzso is one major way to regulate zzso factor zzso Our results show that there is more zzso binding to the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso is also more zzso in zzso zzso than in precursor zzso Using zzso of different zzso we found that the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can increase zzso zzso when the cells are treated for 1 zzso and can decrease zzso zzso with long treatment (12 zzso The increased zzso of zzso induced by zzso in short treatments could be abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso This indicates that zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 453 and zzso which are zzso by zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso regulates zzso zzso only in zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that, in zzso zzso zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso This zzso is important for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
