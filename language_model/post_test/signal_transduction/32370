The tube protein plays an essential role in the signal zzso zzso that establishes zzso polarity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of each of four tube zzso revealed a substitution or zzso in the zzso half of the zzso This portion of the tube protein is also zzso zzso as demonstrated by isolation and sequencing of the zzso zzso tube zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso transformation experiments demonstrated that the zzso domain alone provides substantial levels of gene zzso zzso zzso only the zzso domain restore zzso polarity to zzso lacking any maternal tube zzso In the zzso domain, sequence conservation is concentrated in the five zzso zzso Although the zzso domain by itself provides no rescue of the tube maternal effect zzso it is necessary for zzso levels of tube zzso This domain is thus likely to play an ancillary role in axis zzso
