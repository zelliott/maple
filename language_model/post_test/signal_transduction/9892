zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade occurs in a variety of human zzso where it sustains tumor cell proliferation and zzso zzso blockade of this zzso exerts zzso activity by triggering zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso of the zzso pathway, but only a fraction of them respond in zzso to the zzso action of zzso and zzso zzso zzso possibly because of the described negative feedback loop on zzso which zzso the signaling zzso zzso affected by the multiple zzso zzso syndrome zzso develop zzso zzso showing increased activated zzso In this study, we comparatively investigated the zzso potential of the novel dual zzso inhibitor zzso and the single zzso inhibitor zzso on rat zzso zzso cells in primary zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso both upstream and downstream of zzso thereby preventing the negative feedback zzso zzso was more effective than zzso in reducing cell viability of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso and zzso zzso and triggered zzso Because zzso is caused by a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso inhibitor zzso we investigated the relationship between this zzso and response to zzso zzso The levels of zzso positively correlate with the response to zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso which increases zzso amount, shows synergistic zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso may represent an effective therapeutic zzso for zzso zzso and that zzso levels represent a potential predictor of response to dual zzso zzso
