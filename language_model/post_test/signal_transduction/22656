The zzso signal zzso pathway, which can be activated by zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in normal embryonic development and in zzso transformation of the zzso zzso and zzso Here we zzso for the first time, that zzso and zzso signaling also function in cells of the zzso zzso analysis showed that primary zzso and smooth muscle cell cultures, of both mouse and human origin, express members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of an expression zzso for zzso into primary zzso cells increased both the free pool of zzso and the zzso from a zzso reporter gene zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso also zzso proliferation of primary zzso cell zzso These data show that zzso and zzso proteins can regulate signal zzso via zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling may feature in normal differentiation of the zzso as well as in pathological settings where zzso and smooth muscle proliferation is zzso
