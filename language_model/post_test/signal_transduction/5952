In the accessory zzso bulb zzso sensory zzso expressing a given zzso zzso zzso gene send divergent projections to many zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso link to multiple zzso via zzso primary zzso We used calcium imaging and paired zzso zzso recording to track zzso action zzso zzso in rat zzso primary zzso In cells loaded with 150 zzso zzso Orange, zzso spikes zzso zzso zzso over the entire primary zzso tree, and the relative zzso zzso zzso increased along all branches from zzso to zzso zzso was zzso on zzso zzso in 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso commands evoked zzso zzso zzso that declined steeply with zzso In paired zzso zzso zzso recordings, zzso zzso were zzso up to approximately 200 zzso from the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso decayed zzso zzso modeling indicated that the large zzso zzso zzso are consistent with active, not passive, zzso zzso tracing in the zzso has suggested zzso connectivity with individual zzso cell zzso zzso projecting only to zzso targeted by sensory zzso expressing the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso primary zzso ensures fast, reliable communication between zzso cells and their zzso zzso binding them into functional zzso in accordance with their zzso zzso
