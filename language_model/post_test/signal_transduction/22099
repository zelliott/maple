Several bone protective factors are reported to exhibit zzso activities on bone formation coupled with zzso effects on bone zzso one such factor is vitamin zzso Vitamin K species zzso zzso and zzso zzso have long been associated with bone protective activities and are receiving intense interest as nutritional supplements for the prevention or zzso of bone disease in zzso However, the mechanisms of vitamin K action on the skeleton are poorly zzso zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is essential for zzso formation and zzso By contrast, zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso differentiation and function, prompting us to speculate that zzso zzso may represent a novel class of dual zzso and zzso zzso We now show that vitamin zzso action on zzso and zzso formation and activity is accomplished by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, vitamin zzso prevented repression by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of zzso signaling induced by either transforming growth factor zzso zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso Vitamin zzso further antagonized zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data provide a novel mechanism to explain the dual zzso and zzso activities of vitamin zzso and may further support the concept that pharmacological zzso of zzso signal zzso may constitute an effective mechanism for zzso pathological bone loss and for promoting bone zzso
