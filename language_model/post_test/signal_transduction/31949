Mechanical stimuli play important roles in regulating zzso zzso but seldom studies have focused on when and how mechanical stimuli should be zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso was increased by delayed dynamic zzso stress initiated at the 8th day of zzso zzso The current work is to further study the possibility of using delayed mechanical stress to relay zzso initiated by zzso zzso Mechanical stimulation was delivered from day 8 to day 14 of zzso zzso It showed that delayed zzso stress not only zzso gene expression and protein synthesis of zzso zzso but also zzso the zzso zzso gene transcription, protein expression and the subsequent zzso even when zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, mechanical stress also promoted protein zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso the zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso with zzso significantly affected the zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were zzso by delayed loading in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also increased, but in a zzso zzso It indicates that delayed zzso stress can be used as an effective substitute for zzso supplement in inducing zzso zzso
