Continuing research on the onset of skeletal zzso in the zzso is providing new insights into the zzso of early zzso zzso cells and how zzso molecules affect cell fate decisions, in addition to subsequent muscle zzso zzso zzso have revealed new regulatory aspects, including the role of Six zzso factors and the zzso zzso zzso during embryonic zzso An important recent development is the identification of a novel population of zzso cells that make a major contribution to muscle zzso These cells, which are zzso by the expression of zzso and zzso also give rise to the satellite cells of zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso regulatory factors has been zzso Furthermore, zzso is now shown to be required for the maintenance of satellite zzso New approaches that permit the zzso of zzso satellite cells demonstrate their capacity for efficient muscle repair and for zzso zzso in zzso is now also shown to involve zzso zzso zzso
