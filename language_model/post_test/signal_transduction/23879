zzso a zzso zzso from a Korean snake zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso the proliferation of bovine zzso zzso zzso cells induced by basic zzso growth factor zzso We investigated zzso mechanism of zzso of zzso cell proliferation by examining changes in the zzso and zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso at focal zzso and induced cells to be rounded and zzso but it did not alter zzso structures in the early stage of cells being zzso zzso of zzso also demonstrated that focal zzso were zzso by zzso In zzso zzso cells, focal zzso zzso zzso was zzso and expression of zzso and zzso was zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed in decreased amounts or zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso While zzso cells proliferated normally on plates coated with zzso cells treated with zzso eventually underwent zzso These observations strongly suggest that zzso zzso focal contacts to zzso cells by competing with the zzso zzso zzso for direct binding to zzso zzso on the cell surface, eventually leading to zzso
