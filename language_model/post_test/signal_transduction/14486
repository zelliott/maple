The zzso signaling zzso has been recently suggested to have controversial functions in models of acute and chronic zzso Our group and others have reported previously that the complement split product zzso alters zzso innate immunity and cell signaling during the onset of zzso and is involved in zzso zzso We report in this study that in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in increased mortality in septic mice accompanied by strongly elevated serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso as well as decreased zzso burst activity in blood zzso zzso zzso in zzso resulted in significant increases in zzso generation of various zzso zzso in zzso whereas the opposite effect was observed in zzso zzso burst and zzso activity was significantly attenuated in both zzso and zzso when zzso zzso was zzso In addition, zzso zzso resulted in strongly elevated zzso generation of zzso and zzso in zzso when these cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso burst activity as well as zzso zzso in zzso were strongly reduced when zzso zzso was zzso Our data suggest that the zzso signaling zzso controls various zzso effects on zzso and zzso innate immunity and exerts an overall protective effect during experimental zzso
