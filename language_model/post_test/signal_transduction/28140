The zzso protein zzso zzso exists as a zzso complex zzso a zzso alpha zzso and zzso beta and gamma zzso Under conditions of zzso exercise, zzso heat zzso and low zzso zzso is activated zzso by rising cellular zzso and by zzso of the zzso alpha zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso controls cellular functions in response to zzso acids and growth zzso Recent reports including our study have demonstrated the possible interplay between zzso and zzso signaling zzso supporting a model in which zzso dysfunction caused by the zzso zzso or zzso depletion zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso a downstream zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso may stimulate zzso zzso via zzso pathway, in part, by serving both as a zzso fuel through zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso This hypothesis may support an idea in which zzso zzso zzso function, in part by regulating zzso function and zzso Further understanding of the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways would provide new insights into relationship between nutrients and cellular zzso
