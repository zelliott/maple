zzso zzso is a zzso zzso predominantly by zzso zzso Although zzso is primarily associated with the induction of tissue zzso the other biological functions of zzso including its zzso functions, have yet to be thoroughly zzso zzso proliferation and migration play essential roles in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso can increase the migration and expression of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso ligament zzso zzso but has no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression led to cell migration, which was attenuated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso for zzso The zzso cell migration was also attenuated by its tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso increase of the migration and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression and cell migration was further confirmed by zzso of zzso zzso A nuclear factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso also suppressed the cell migration and zzso expression enhanced by zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso nuclear zzso as well as zzso binding zzso Our results suggest that zzso enhances the migration of zzso zzso by increasing zzso expression through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
