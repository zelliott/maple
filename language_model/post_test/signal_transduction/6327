The zzso signaling zzso is zzso activated in many tumor types, including those of the zzso in which zzso accumulates in cell zzso and acts as a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso in the zzso gene are rare in prostate cancer, we have looked for altered expression of other components of the zzso signaling zzso in prostate cancer zzso Here we determined the expression levels of zzso family genes in cultured human prostate cells and prostate cancer cell zzso We found that zzso expression is elevated in zzso prostate cancer cell zzso Additional analysis indicated that zzso expression is also elevated in high-grade zzso tumors and in zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso media led to increased zzso zzso which was zzso by the synthetic zzso zzso This repression was inhibited by the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulate zzso expression through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity and cell growth in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cells and inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso However, expression of stabilized zzso did not prevent the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso Our observations are consistent with a model in which zzso depletion activates zzso signals that inhibit zzso but not zzso cell zzso
