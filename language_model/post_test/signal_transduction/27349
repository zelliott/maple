zzso and co-workers cloned in 1994 a second zzso zzso zzso zzso that could be activated by zzso but not by zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso induced stimulation of zzso cells is linked to zzso zzso We have found by zzso analysis that zzso cells of zzso and zzso origin express both zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso zzso and the zzso activated zzso zzso mediate apparently the same effects in human vascular zzso zzso Both, the zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso or zzso and the zzso of the zzso with zzso or zzso induced zzso calcium zzso and a subsequent release of von zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso As a consequence, it can be concluded that zzso cells have two different receptors zzso the same cellular responses after zzso
