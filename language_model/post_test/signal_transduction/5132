The innate immune system of fish is the primary defense against acute zzso The marine zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a potential marine fish model for zzso but little is known about the innate immune system of this small zzso In this study, suppression zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso expressed immune genes in the liver of zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso Among the zzso genes identified, based on zzso zzso search of the zzso zzso clones in the zzso libraries, 38 zzso were involved in the immune zzso Besides, genes involved in biological regulations zzso cellular metabolism zzso general response to stimuli zzso cellular component organization zzso signal zzso zzso and transport process zzso were also zzso Ten complement component genes involved in four zzso pathways were zzso zzso zzso and exhibited different patterns of zzso between the control and challenged zzso The results reported upon here support the feasibility of developing zzso zzso as a marine model fish to understand the basic biological processes related to immune function and for zzso zzso zzso of this study established a genetic platform for studying immune function using zzso zzso
