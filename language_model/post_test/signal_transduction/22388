zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso tumor that is generally unresponsive or only zzso responsive to the currently available zzso zzso Thus, novel therapeutic strategies and agents are urgently needed to treat this aggressive zzso zzso a component of turmeric zzso zzso has been shown to have a diversity of zzso zzso We show here that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso progression in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells via induction of zzso The ability of zzso cells to zzso and induce zzso was also significantly attenuated by zzso accompanied by the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, our data also demonstrated that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells were due to its dual zzso of both zzso target of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso pathways through a crossed zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Most importantly, zzso effectively prevented the in zzso growth and zzso of zzso zzso in nude mice, as revealed by the induction of cell zzso and reduction of zzso density in tumor zzso In addition, we further assessed the nature zzso status of both zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso and confirmed the concurrent high zzso of these two pathways in zzso for the first zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that further clinical investigation is warranted to apply zzso as a novel zzso regimen for zzso because of its dual suppression of both zzso and zzso zzso
