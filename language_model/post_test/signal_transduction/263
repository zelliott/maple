The application of zzso techniques to zzso research provides an opportunity for a greater understanding of nervous system structure and zzso As increasing amounts of zzso data become available, it is necessary to formulate methods to integrate these data in a meaningful way to obtain a more comprehensive picture of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso methods can be used to make biologically relevant predictions from large zzso data zzso Here, we applied an integrated zzso and systems biology approach to characterize the zzso zzso nerve zzso For this, we carried out zzso analyses of zzso enriched zzso and generated a zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso We combined these with other zzso analyses to generate a core list of 117 zzso zzso and used graph zzso zzso to predict 92 additional components and a zzso complex containing 17 zzso Some of these predictions were validated zzso indicating that the zzso analyses can identify novel proteins and complexes in a zzso zzso We conclude that the combination of techniques zzso data integration, and zzso zzso used in this study are useful in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of functional zzso especially zzso entities and/or interactions in the zzso nerve zzso
