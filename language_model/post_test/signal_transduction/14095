zzso zzso zzso and their product zzso zzso have been reported to regulate zzso and survival of liver zzso zzso liver diseases are characterized by zzso levels of zzso zzso inducing liver zzso It is unknown whether zzso and/or zzso play a role in this zzso zzso Here, we investigated the putative involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso rat zzso were exposed to zzso acid zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and/or specific zzso of zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso and necrosis were zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso without inducing zzso zzso increased the zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of all five zzso receptors were detected in zzso of which zzso and zzso appear most zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso also significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso however, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso pathway, this was dependent on zzso and not zzso Our results indicate that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in part by interfering with zzso zzso signaling and zzso of zzso
