The transient zzso potential channel zzso family includes more than 30 zzso they participate in various zzso dependent zzso zzso are functionally diverse involving zzso chemical and mechanical zzso which zzso the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers and/or regulates principal zzso functions during zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso has not been zzso 

Here we document with zzso western zzso and zzso analysis the presence of zzso in human zzso We also examined the participation of this channel in zzso function using specific zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso did not significantly alter human zzso zzso In contrast, zzso induced the zzso reaction in human zzso This induction was inhibited about zzso by zzso (20 zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso either by temperature or zzso induced zzso increases in human zzso measured by zzso in populations or individual zzso cells, effect that was also inhibited by zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso reaction was not inhibited by zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso zzso triggers this process by a different signaling zzso 

This is the first report dealing with the presence of a zzso sensitive channel zzso in human zzso This channel could be involved in cell signaling events such as zzso or zzso
