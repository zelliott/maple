zzso is associated with zzso colon zzso in zzso but the zzso of growth promotion is not zzso This study investigates the expression profile of a key component of the insulin signaling pathway, the insulin zzso zzso in zzso tumors in comparison to normal zzso zzso and the effects of dietary zzso Male zzso rats harboring zzso zzso were randomly allocated to three high fat diet groups: beef zzso zzso corn oil zzso fish oil zzso or a low fat corn oil zzso diet for 16 zzso zzso tumors and zzso were analyzed for zzso protein by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also analyzed by zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso protein level was significantly greater zzso zzso or zzso in tumors than in zzso zzso in each diet group, and varied zzso zzso or zzso among the tumors in the order zzso zzso assessment of the tumors as compared to the normal zzso confirmed the elevated expression of zzso protein in the tumor cells compared to normal zzso zzso was noted in the nuclear zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso protein levels were lower zzso zzso or zzso in the saturated fat diet group zzso than the three zzso fat diet groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcript levels did not differ between zzso tumors and zzso and no significant diet effect was zzso These results demonstrate that steady state levels of zzso are elevated in zzso tumors above that of normal zzso in zzso irrespective of the dietary zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso transcript levels did not reflect any significant diet effect and remained relatively steady between the tumor and normal zzso indicating altered post zzso regulation of zzso in tumor zzso compared to normal zzso
