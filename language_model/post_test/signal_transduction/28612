We examined the role of programmed cell death zzso pathways in retinal zzso caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso hallmarks of programmed cell death, specifically zzso zzso and zzso of the dying zzso cells by neighboring retinal zzso zzso However, genetic mosaic analysis of adult zzso lacking zzso zzso and grim show that these zzso zzso are not required for zzso zzso We showed previously that zzso expression of either zzso or hid triggers rapid zzso in adult zzso and this is completely suppressed by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso does not suppress zzso retinal zzso although a small delay in the rate of zzso is observed in low zzso temperature zzso zzso does not alter the zzso characteristics of zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso or a zzso form of the zzso zzso even when zzso with zzso does not dramatically alter the time course of zzso zzso These results establish that the pathways responsible for zzso in development do not play a major role in adult retinal zzso caused by zzso
