In cardiac and skeletal muscles, insulin regulates the zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso via the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso studies propose an zzso zzso of zzso from zzso pools to the plasma membrane zzso similar to zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso To characterize zzso zzso zzso in intact cells, Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be located both zzso zzso least zzso compartments than zzso and at the zzso Upon stimulation with insulin, zzso zzso to a PM zzso similar to that of zzso the increase in PM zzso content, as zzso by zzso zzso amounted to zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso zzso and zzso (as evidenced by insulin zzso in a similar time frame as that for zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells, and the zzso increase in PM zzso correlated with increased zzso zzso By contrast, zzso expression in zzso cells and the zzso increase in PM zzso were not paralleled by a rise in zzso zzso suggesting that in these cells, such increase requires additional zzso or a protein zzso zzso Taken together, this study is the first to present zzso evidence for zzso zzso and shows this process to resemble zzso zzso
