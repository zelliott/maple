We previously showed that the zzso junction protein zzso zzso not only suppresses zzso of zzso in contact with each other, but also, unexpectedly, of single zzso Here we show that PG zzso results in zzso zzso zzso disruption of mature focal zzso and cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso cells onto zzso deposited by zzso cells partially restored normal cell zzso and inhibited zzso cell zzso In over 70 zzso molecules whose expression we previously showed to be altered in zzso cells, a substantial decrease in zzso zzso in zzso cells stood zzso zzso of PG into zzso cells restored zzso zzso and zzso zzso was reversed by zzso zzso cells onto zzso zzso surprisingly, based on previously reported roles for PG in regulating gene transcription, zzso cells exhibited an increase, not a decrease, in zzso promoter zzso Instead, PG was required for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited an increase in activated zzso one of the zzso controlled by zzso a zzso reversed by zzso zzso cells on zzso deposited by zzso zzso zzso cells also exhibited zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso We propose a novel role for PG in regulating cell zzso through distinct zzso and zzso zzso influenced in part by zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso
