During development, an zzso zzso many rounds of pattern formation, generating zzso complexity with each ensuing round of cell division and zzso The instructions for executing this process are zzso in the zzso zzso that direct the expression of zzso zzso factors and signaling zzso Each zzso factor binding site within a zzso module contributes information about when, where, or how much a gene is turned on, and by zzso the zzso driving a given zzso all the zzso governing expression of the gene can be accurately zzso Furthermore, by mapping the output of each gene to the zzso of other zzso it is possible to reverse engineer zzso circuits and even whole zzso At this higher level of organization, common zzso strategies for specifying zzso fields, zzso down regulatory states, and driving development forward zzso
