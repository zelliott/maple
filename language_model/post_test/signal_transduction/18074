Individual members of the zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso families of proteins have zzso effects in regulating alternative zzso Although zzso A1 accumulates predominantly in the nucleus, it zzso continuously between the nucleus and the zzso Some but not all zzso proteins also undergo zzso zzso which is affected by zzso of their zzso zzso zzso The signaling mechanisms that control the zzso zzso of these proteins are zzso We show that exposure of zzso and zzso transformed green monkey kidney zzso cells to stress stimuli such as zzso shock or zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso results in a marked zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with an increase in its zzso These effects are zzso by the zzso pathway, and moreover, zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for the induction of zzso A1 zzso zzso The zzso increase in the zzso levels of zzso zzso proteins and the zzso decrease in their nuclear abundance are paralleled by changes in the alternative zzso pattern of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the intriguing possibility that signaling mechanisms regulate zzso zzso in zzso by influencing the zzso distribution of zzso zzso
