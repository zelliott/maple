Recently, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso was found to be prominently associated with zzso of the zzso loop of the heart zzso zzso zzso system zzso We investigated if the zzso zzso is activated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso destined to undergo zzso and whether blockade of the zzso in zzso can modify early zzso zzso 

We investigated the time course of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso rat heart as well as the binding activity of zzso proteins to the zzso of the zzso gene zzso We further compared the effects of in zzso blockade of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso with the in zzso blockade of zzso zzso by the specific zzso blocker zzso zzso on certain aspects of early zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso zzso 1, 3, zzso and 6 and zzso proteins are zzso zzso as early as zzso zzso zzso and that zzso 1, 3, and zzso remain activated up to 7 days zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed a strong binding activity of zzso proteins to the zzso of zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso zzso The binding was significantly reduced in rat hearts previously treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments identified zzso 3 and zzso as specifically interacting with the zzso Both zzso and zzso blockade resulted in significant zzso of the increase of protein zzso 1 activity and decrease in zzso level of zzso that may zzso early zzso dysfunction, as well as partial zzso of early zzso of zzso gene expression that may zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, while blockade of zzso significantly ameliorated zzso changes in zzso zzso border zone, blockade of zzso increased zzso 

The study provides compelling evidence in favor of the linkage of the zzso zzso with the zzso II zzso loop and zzso a mechanism by which selective zzso of a set of zzso proteins zzso zzso of the gene zzso program intrinsic to zzso zzso It also suggests that drugs that inhibit zzso zzso may provide a new approach to modify zzso zzso This needs to be confirmed in long term in zzso studies in the zzso zzso
