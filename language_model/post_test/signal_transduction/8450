The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gastric zzso with soybean zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso and prevents zzso in the cerebral zzso during experimental zzso zzso rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 10 rats each: sham operation plus vehicle zzso middle cerebral artery zzso plus vehicle zzso zzso plus low dose soybean zzso (10 zzso and zzso plus high dose soybean zzso zzso zzso The vehicle zzso 10 zzso and soybean zzso were administered by gastric zzso for 28 d prior to sham or zzso operation and for 7 d zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of components of the zzso signaling system zzso and zzso were measured by in zzso zzso and western zzso respectively, whereas zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso at both the zzso and protein levels, and also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso and zzso expression levels but decreased zzso These results identify a possible mechanism by which soybean zzso zzso zzso in zzso
