zzso syndrome is a zzso disorder caused predominantly by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso for zzso family zzso A characteristic feature of zzso syndrome is zzso zzso duct zzso We described previously that mice doubly zzso for zzso and zzso zzso are an excellent model for zzso zzso However, our previous study did not establish whether zzso duct paucity in zzso double zzso mice resulted from impaired differentiation of zzso duct precursor cells, or from defects in zzso duct zzso 

Here we characterize embryonic zzso tract formation in our previously described zzso double zzso zzso syndrome model, and describe another mouse model of zzso duct paucity resulting from zzso deletion of the zzso zzso 

Our data support a model in which zzso duct paucity in zzso zzso loss of function zzso mice results from defects in zzso duct zzso rather than cell fate zzso
