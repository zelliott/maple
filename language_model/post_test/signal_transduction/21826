zzso lip with or without zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso birth zzso in zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso two members of the zzso family of signaling zzso were found associated with zzso in human and mice, zzso To investigate whether zzso and zzso directly regulate facial development, we analyzed their zzso expression patterns and found that both zzso and zzso are expressed in the facial zzso at critical stages of zzso zzso during mouse zzso Whereas zzso zzso is mainly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso zzso During lip fusion, zzso but not zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso between the fusing zzso and lateral zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that expression of zzso a transgenic reporter of zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathway, is specifically activated in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso lateral zzso and zzso processes prior to lip zzso During lip fusion, the zzso zzso between the zzso and lateral zzso processes as well as the facial zzso directly beneath the fusing zzso strongly expresses zzso These data, together with the zzso lip zzso in zzso humans and zzso zzso mice, indicate that zzso and zzso signal through the zzso zzso signaling zzso to regulate zzso development and lip zzso
