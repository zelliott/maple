zzso zzso is a common process that leads to the progression of various types of kidney zzso We used an integrated zzso and experimental systems biology approach to identify protein zzso that regulate gene expression changes in the zzso of human zzso virus zzso transgenic mice zzso zzso which have both zzso zzso and zzso We identified zzso interacting protein zzso 2 zzso as a key regulator of kidney zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso of zzso mice and in those of patients with various kidney zzso zzso infection increased the protein zzso of zzso by promoting zzso stress, which inhibited the seven in zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso induced zzso and the expression of zzso transition markers in kidney zzso cells by zzso the zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso family member 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso improved zzso function and attenuated zzso and kidney zzso in zzso mice, as well as in other zzso models of kidney zzso We therefore conclude that zzso is a potential target for zzso zzso
