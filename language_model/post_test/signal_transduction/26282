To investigate the regulation of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulated protein zzso zzso with both a zzso zzso member I zzso suppression and zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

After identification and zzso the constructed zzso zzso was zzso into zzso The zzso cell was also explored as zzso The growth curve was drawn to indicate the proliferation effect of zzso zzso was performed to investigate the expression of zzso Western zzso analysis was used to investigate the expression of protein zzso zzso in zzso 

The proliferation rate of zzso was inhibited by zzso compared with both empty zzso and zzso zzso The amount of zzso was parallel in both zzso and zzso cell but affected by zzso zzso The amount of zzso was decreased after zzso zzso The optimum concentration of zzso effect on zzso was 50 zzso 

Both zzso and zzso play roles in the zzso zzso
