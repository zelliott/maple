zzso zzso in zzso gene expression control the transition of neural stem cells zzso from predominantly zzso to predominantly zzso zzso of zzso but how this switch occurs is zzso Here, we show that zzso gene 1 zzso an zzso zzso zzso factor, is required for the repression of zzso commitment and the maintenance of zzso in a state that permits them to respond to zzso zzso Loss of zzso in zzso in conditional zzso zzso mice results in precocious zzso zzso such that cells in the zzso zone differentiate into zzso zzso before the onset of zzso As a result, there is a dramatic failure of zzso and zzso differentiation in these zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso also prevents zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, proteins implicated in the maintenance of stem cells, including zzso zzso and zzso are dramatically reduced in the zzso zones of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is required to repress zzso differentiation in zzso as a means of permitting zzso cell differentiation in response to zzso signals, suggesting that zzso regulates the switch from zzso to zzso
