Increased serum levels of zzso and other zzso zzso have been found in patients with major depression and several other psychiatric zzso In zzso these zzso produce symptoms commonly referred to as zzso zzso Some of these, including reduced feeding and decreased social and exploratory behavior, are reminiscent of those seen in depressed zzso zzso of these effects is complicated by the malaise caused by acute injections of zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is unclear whether zzso are involved in the zzso of depressive zzso 

We used a panel of behavioral zzso to assess zzso and zzso mice for anxiety and zzso zzso 

We show that deletion of either zzso or zzso leads to an zzso response in the forced swim test and that mice lacking zzso demonstrate a hedonic response in a zzso drinking test compared with zzso zzso In addition, deletion of zzso leads to decreased fear zzso There were no differences in behavior in anxiety tests for either zzso zzso 

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso can induce zzso symptoms even in the absence of malaise and demonstrate that both zzso zzso can be involved in this zzso
