Signaling proteins driving the proliferation of stem and zzso cells are often zzso by zzso zzso receptors represent a rare zzso they promote cell proliferation in the zzso zzso and function as tumor zzso by controlling cell migration and zzso invasive zzso We show that cell migration and proliferation are controlled independently by the zzso zzso zzso regulated cell positioning is zzso and zzso via zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso activity regulates cell proliferation through an zzso D1 zzso zzso D1 regulation becomes zzso from zzso signaling during the progression from zzso to colon zzso in humans, allowing continued proliferation with invasive zzso The zzso of zzso signaling pathways enables the selective zzso of the zzso effect without affecting the tumor zzso function and identifies a pharmacological strategy to suppress zzso zzso
