The zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of energy zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene are associated with childhood zzso How zzso binds to its zzso has rarely been zzso In the present study, we systematically zzso all ten zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and measured the cell surface expression levels as well as zzso binding and signaling properties of these zzso Our results showed that of the 19 zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, all were expressed on the cell surface, although some zzso had decreased levels of cell surface zzso We showed that with the zzso analog zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for binding and zzso Further experiments using other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso showed that different zzso induce or select different zzso In zzso we showed that zzso zzso in zzso 1 and 3 are important for zzso binding whereas the zzso zzso in zzso 2 and 7 are important for both zzso binding and zzso
