The signaling zzso zzso has been implicated in attenuating acute lung injury zzso zzso signaling is terminated by its zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso could be targeted to enhance zzso lung zzso To address this hypothesis, we exposed mice to zzso mechanical ventilation to induce zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso repression of zzso and zzso transcript and protein levels during zzso To examine the contention that zzso repression represents an zzso zzso response, we performed functional studies with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso treatment (1 zzso zzso zzso was associated with significant increases in zzso survival time zzso zzso 395 zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso mice for zzso or zzso revealed a selective zzso in zzso mice, including attenuated pulmonary zzso and improved gas exchange during zzso in conjunction with elevated zzso levels in the zzso zzso Furthermore, studies in genetic models for zzso receptors implicated the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso of lung inflammation was abolished in mice with zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Our newly identified zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in lung protection during zzso opens possibilities for combined therapies targeted to this protein zzso
