A highly zzso cell line designated as UK zzso was established in a surgically removed human pancreatic zzso and characterized as having many of the zzso and zzso zzso commonly found in pancreatic zzso 

The cell line was characterized by its zzso growth rate in zzso culture and soft zzso zzso in nude mice, and zzso zzso Furthermore, the status of zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso expression were zzso The characteristics of UK zzso were compared with those of other commonly used pancreatic zzso cell zzso 

zzso UK zzso cells could be zzso to zzso in growth factor free zzso media, indicating a growth factor independent zzso UK zzso 1 cells grew in soft zzso and rapidly formed tumors in nude zzso This cell line possesses a zzso at zzso 12 of the zzso gene that is commonly found in pancreatic zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso showed that two zzso of zzso tumor zzso gene were present in UK zzso However, sequencing analysis revealed a zzso in one zzso at zzso 8, zzso 273 zzso to zzso zzso to zzso Additional growth zzso indicated that the cell line was insensitive to negative growth regulation induced by zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso signaling zzso showed that UK zzso did not express appreciable levels of the zzso zzso type I, II, or III zzso but did express zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an zzso deletion indicating a possible loss of zzso for zzso as well as other zzso deletions and zzso 

This study indicates that UK zzso is a highly zzso cell line possessing a zzso complex pattern of zzso that may be used as a model to further the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the development of pancreatic zzso
