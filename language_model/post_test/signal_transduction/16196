zzso stem cells are able to zzso and to differentiate into all adult cell zzso Many studies report data describing these cells, and characterize them in molecular zzso zzso learning yields zzso that can accurately identify zzso stem cells, but there is a lack of studies yielding minimal sets of best zzso zzso We assembled gene expression data of zzso stem cells and zzso cells from the zzso After zzso and zzso we applied machine learning, zzso samples into zzso and zzso with high zzso zzso Furthermore, to identify minimal sets of best zzso we used three zzso information gain, random forests and a wrapper of genetic zzso and support zzso machine zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso work best in combination with each zzso zzso and enrichment analyses show that they cover the zzso variety of processes implicated in zzso The zzso wrapper yields best zzso no matter which zzso method is zzso The consensus best zzso based on the three methods is zzso implicated in zzso just zzso The best zzso based on the zzso wrapper approach alone is zzso possibly a missing link between zzso and some standard surface markers of unknown function processed by the zzso zzso
