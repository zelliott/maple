zzso a tomato zzso has been reported to possess zzso properties against human zzso However, the mechanism of its action against leukemia remains zzso In this study, the therapeutic potential of zzso against zzso cells was evaluated in zzso and in zzso Cell viability experiments showed that zzso had significant zzso effects on the human leukemia cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and the cells were found to be in the zzso zzso zzso phase of cell zzso In addition, zzso induced both zzso and zzso cell zzso in a cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure led to a loss of the zzso membrane potential, and this finding was consistent with that observed on zzso of the zzso and zzso short form zzso zzso Exposure to zzso also triggered the release of the zzso factor zzso from the zzso into the nucleus and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso tumor growth without causing loss of body weight in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso test showed that the reduced tumor growth in the zzso mice was a result of increased zzso which was associated with increased zzso of zzso in the nucleus and decreased zzso expression ex zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a candidate for leukemia zzso
