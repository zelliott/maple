It has been proposed that one route of behavioral evolution involves novel regulation of zzso zzso zzso division of labor in honey bee zzso a highly derived behavioral system, involves the performance of different zzso tasks by different groups of zzso Older bees acquire the zzso food by zzso for zzso and zzso and the younger zzso bees feed larvae processed zzso The transition from hive work to zzso has been shown to be socially regulated and associated both with decreases in abdominal zzso stores and with increases in brain expression of genes implicated in feeding behavior in zzso zzso Here we show that division of labor is influenced by a zzso regulator of food intake and energy balance in solitary species, the zzso growth factor signaling zzso zzso zzso had higher levels of zzso gene expression in the brain and abdomen than did zzso despite their low zzso zzso These differences are likely nutritionally zzso because zzso that induced low zzso stores in young bees also zzso these zzso Changes in zzso also zzso influenced the timing of behavioral zzso zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso delayed the onset of zzso in a seasonally dependent zzso In addition, zzso analyses of zzso data revealed that nurses and zzso differ in brain energy metabolism gene zzso but the differences are opposite predictions based on their zzso zzso These results suggest that changes in the regulation of the zzso zzso are associated with social zzso
