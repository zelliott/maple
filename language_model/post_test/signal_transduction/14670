The zzso zzso is zzso regulated by a diverse array of proteins during zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso have been ascribed opposite general zzso activities, zzso zzso zzso and stabilization, respectively, both of which can be inhibited by zzso Here, using three human cell models, we depleted cells of zzso and/or zzso by expression of interfering hairpin zzso and we analyzed the resulting zzso We found that the zzso levels of zzso and zzso have opposite and zzso activities that largely govern the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso array at zzso zzso and zzso were also found to be the downstream targets of zzso and zzso protein zzso IV and zzso zzso respectively, that control the demonstrated zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, to address mechanisms regulating zzso zzso in response to cell signals, we developed a system for zzso gene product zzso This approach revealed that zzso zzso of zzso is both necessary and sufficient for zzso of zzso in response to the multifaceted signaling event of stimulation of the T cell zzso zzso complex, which activates several signal zzso zzso
