To examine the region critical for differentiation in the human zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso with zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso expressed high affinity zzso on the cell zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso induced zzso C zzso transcripts in zzso expressing zzso zzso Several zzso zzso plasmids were then zzso into zzso cells and the zzso were examined for zzso expression and the ability to induce zzso C zzso transcripts upon stimulation with zzso and zzso Although all zzso zzso tested expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso which contains only 8 zzso acids in the zzso domain, did not respond to zzso and zzso with zzso C zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expressing an internally deleted zzso in which the deleted region has been identified as the critical region for growth signal zzso in the previous study, failed to induce zzso C zzso transcripts with zzso and zzso These results indicate that the critical region for the differentiation signal in the zzso is identical to that for the growth zzso suggesting that zzso may share, at least partly, a common signal zzso for both growth and zzso
