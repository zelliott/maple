zzso zzso is a zzso that regulates the zzso zzso and survival of zzso zzso zzso EPO has recently been demonstrated to have a zzso role by zzso zzso signals through the zzso zzso zzso in various zzso including brain, liver, and zzso We have previously examined pancreatic zzso line zzso cells for the expression of zzso by real-time zzso and determined that these cells were protected by EPO against zzso zzso The precise underlying zzso mechanisms in pancreatic zzso are poorly zzso The purpose of this study is to examine zzso zzso expression in the zzso pancreatic zzso line and the zzso zzso related with its zzso effect in zzso zzso 

we examined the expression of zzso by western zzso We investigate the role of zzso in the survival of these cells, and whether the zzso zzso is involved in this protective zzso 

zzso cells expressed zzso and, in the presence of certain zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso human zzso zzso significantly improved the impaired insulin zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid zzso of zzso and increased expression of zzso The protective zzso effect of zzso was significantly abolished by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso is expressed in pancreatic zzso line zzso cells and suggest that EPO may act as a survival factor requiring the zzso zzso
