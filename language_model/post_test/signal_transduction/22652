The zzso factor zzso plays a critical role in immune and inflammatory zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of the zzso promoter and an zzso artificial promoter was drastically reduced in zzso zzso cells, independently of the signaling zzso through which zzso was zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was restored in zzso by the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that both zzso and zzso formed a stable zzso nuclear zzso This interaction did not need DNA zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an important zzso in the zzso cascade of zzso target zzso
