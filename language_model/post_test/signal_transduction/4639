zzso protein sorting is zzso by interactions between proteins and zzso One mechanism that contributes to sorting involves patches of zzso termed zzso zzso which are different from their surroundings in zzso and protein zzso Although the nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso collaborate with each other at the plasma membrane to bind zzso these two receptors are zzso separately and activate different cellular zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso in membrane zzso may play a role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso both reside in zzso zzso zzso yet they responded differently to a variety of zzso The zzso zzso caused increased association of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso but a decrease in zzso When zzso were induced to zzso and attach to zzso by in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was bound to zzso in zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso yet zzso zzso zzso was entirely absent in zzso under conditions where activated zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso partition into membrane zzso by different mechanisms, and that the fraction of zzso that associates with zzso is zzso but does not directly form signaling zzso Rather, by attracting zzso to zzso zzso zzso may mediate other processes such as zzso zzso
