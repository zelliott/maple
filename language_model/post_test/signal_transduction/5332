zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor expressed in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue that zzso regulates skeletal muscle zzso zzso mice have a dramatic increase in muscle mass, reduction in fat mass, and resistance to zzso and genetic zzso To determine how zzso deletion causes reduced zzso and resistance to zzso we analyzed zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity in zzso mice fed a standard zzso Despite reduced zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, zzso mice had no change in the rate of whole body zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice had increased zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity as measured by indirect zzso zzso and insulin tolerance tests, and zzso zzso To determine whether these zzso effects were due primarily to the loss of myostatin signaling in muscle or zzso zzso we compared two transgenic mouse lines carrying a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso expressed specifically in zzso or skeletal zzso We found that zzso of myostatin signaling in zzso tissue had no effect on body zzso weight gain, or zzso and insulin tolerance in mice fed a standard diet or a high-fat zzso In contrast, zzso of myostatin signaling in skeletal muscle, like zzso zzso resulted in increased lean mass, decreased fat mass, improved zzso metabolism on standard and high-fat zzso and resistance to zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso mice have an increase in insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso and that the reduction in zzso tissue mass in zzso mice is an indirect result of zzso changes in skeletal zzso These data suggest that increasing muscle mass by administration of myostatin zzso may be a promising therapeutic target for treating patients with obesity or zzso
