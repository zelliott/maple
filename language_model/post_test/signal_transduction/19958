zzso a stable and predictable program of neural cell fate in zzso cells in zzso is an important goal for utilizing these cells for modeling human disease zzso However, the extent to which in zzso neural zzso zzso in zzso neural zzso remains to be fully zzso We previously demonstrated that in the mouse zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso promotes definitive neural stem cell zzso development through the zzso of the zzso factor zzso Here, we asked whether zzso is similarly required during neural lineage development of embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso gene expression is rapidly zzso in mouse zzso cells cultured in a zzso zzso environment, compared to zzso cells in a standard zzso maintenance environment, and is zzso by zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso cells in maintenance conditions, containing serum and leukemia zzso factor zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso a marker found in neural precursors and to promote definitive zzso colony zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells using zzso did not affect the initial transition of zzso cells to a neural cell fate, but did diminish the ability of these neural cells to develop further into definitive zzso Thus, our findings using zzso cells are zzso with evidence from mouse zzso and support a model, zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso which promotes the development of definitive zzso subsequent to an initial neural zzso event that is independent of this zzso
