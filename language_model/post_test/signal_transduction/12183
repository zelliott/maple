During development, zzso growth rates are precisely regulated to provide zzso control over zzso The precise zzso regulation of zzso growth is a key step in the formation of functional zzso and the proper patterning of the nervous zzso The rate of zzso zzso is increased by factors such as zzso and nerve growth factor zzso which stimulate zzso outgrowth using incompletely defined zzso To clarify the mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso growth, we explored the role of local protein zzso We found that zzso protein translation is required for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso To identify the mechanism of zzso zzso we examined the zzso complex, a zzso zzso We found that the zzso complex, like local translation, is required for zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to developing zzso and zzso and zzso trigger its local zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso These results identify a new role for local translation and the zzso complex in zzso zzso
