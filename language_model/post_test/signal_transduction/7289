zzso nutrition zzso is a zzso nutritional support for a large population of hospitalized zzso and lipids make a substantial contribution to their energy and essential fatty acid zzso zzso A challenge in the care of these infants is that their zzso needs require prolonged zzso support that increases the risk of zzso liver disease zzso In recent years, the emergence of new zzso zzso zzso containing different source lipids and zzso profiles has created nutritional alternatives to the zzso soybean zzso zzso emulsion zzso The limited zzso introduction of the zzso zzso emulsion zzso has generated promising results in infants with zzso and spawned a renewed interest in how zzso and zzso zzso in particular, contribute to this zzso Studies suggest that the zzso load and constituents, such as specific zzso ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vitamin E content, may be zzso There is an existing literature describing the molecular mechanisms zzso these specific nutrients affect zzso metabolism and function via zzso and zzso acid sensing nuclear zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso liver X zzso and zzso X zzso yet virtually no information as to how they interact and zzso liver function in the context of zzso in pediatric patients or animal zzso This article will review the recent development of zzso zzso zzso and their influence on zzso and highlight some of the emerging molecular mechanisms that may explain the effects on liver function and zzso
