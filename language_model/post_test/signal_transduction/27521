In an attempt to characterize the mechanisms that are operative at the early stages of the induction of zzso by zzso a component of the traditional Chinese medicine zzso we examined the effects of zzso on plasma membrane potential, as determined by monitoring the zzso by cells of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso cells, in human zzso leukemia zzso cells, and in human colon zzso zzso cells but not in normal human zzso for example, zzso cells and zzso and not in zzso leukemia zzso and zzso zzso Treatment for 3 h with zzso at zzso M caused a decrease in the plasma membrane potential in several lines of human tumor cells but not in zzso leukemia zzso No changes in zzso membrane potential, as monitored with the fluorescent dye zzso and no release of zzso c were observed within at least 6 h after the start of treatment with zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in human leukemia zzso cells that had been zzso with zzso for zzso prevented zzso zzso but had no significant effect on the change in plasma membrane potential induced by zzso Since zzso specifically zzso the zzso of human but not zzso tumor cells, and since this zzso leads to a change in zzso concentration of zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso in human tumor cells selectively via zzso of the zzso which acts upstream of the zzso zzso
