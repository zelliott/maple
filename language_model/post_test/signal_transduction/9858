A subset of precursors in the embryonic mouse zzso and in zzso expresses a higher level of the zzso zzso zzso than neighboring zzso We reported previously that the functional significance of high zzso expression was enhanced zzso activity, resulting in an increase in survival, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso amplifying zzso zzso can interact with a number of signaling zzso but the zzso factors that are required for specific effects of elevated zzso expression have not been zzso In this study we addressed the contributions of signaling via zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso precursors or following transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso by zzso zzso could still increase survival and proliferation but could not increase zzso We also found that elevated zzso expression induced the expression of zzso receptors zzso in zzso zzso Several zzso factors, including zzso can induce zzso expression by cortical zzso and we found that zzso zzso allowed them to respond to a zzso concentration of zzso to induce zzso In precursors that lack the zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso did not increase zzso expression or zzso though it could still stimulate zzso These findings suggest that a subset of precursors in the embryonic zzso that express an elevated level of zzso can respond to lower zzso of zzso than neighboring zzso resulting in an increase in their expression of zzso Signaling via zzso is required for their zzso
