zzso zzso is a primary zzso bone tumor with a high propensity for local recurrence and distant zzso We previously showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed in zzso migration and invasion of the zzso cell line zzso zzso we hypothesized zzso also has in zzso zzso activity against zzso We used the zzso cell line as a model to study the effect of zzso by stable zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso was verified by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso In soft zzso zzso zzso cells formed fewer and smaller colonies than control zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced in zzso tumor growth of zzso cells in nude zzso zzso also decreased in zzso cellular zzso in a scratch wound zzso In a spontaneous pulmonary zzso model, zzso reduced both the size and number of lung zzso zzso The reduction in cellular zzso by zzso was associated with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest zzso zzso signaling reflects an important underlying mechanism of zzso zzso zzso strategies to suppress zzso signaling in zzso cells may lead to a reduction in local or systemic disease zzso
