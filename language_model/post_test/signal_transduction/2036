zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso zzso immune zzso However, the specific cell types that produce zzso in response to zzso and the cellular factors that regulate zzso zzso production have not been fully zzso The present studies were undertaken to characterize the cell populations that produce zzso after zzso challenge in the zzso of mice and to determine the regulatory factors that zzso zzso production of zzso Our studies show that the levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein production peak at 6 and 8 zzso respectively, after systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells are natural killer zzso cells zzso and zzso are zzso cells zzso Most of the remaining zzso cells are T cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso factor after zzso challenge, with zzso provided by zzso zzso and B7 zzso zzso is a major inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Unlike intact zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, the class II major zzso complex did not play a functional role in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent stimulus for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as B7 zzso are zzso expressed in the mouse zzso Of the factors zzso zzso serves as the most potent zzso with zzso for zzso production, followed by zzso and B7 zzso These data demonstrate that zzso cells and zzso cells are the most abundant zzso cells in the mouse zzso after zzso challenge and that zzso and zzso are key functional regulators of zzso zzso zzso
