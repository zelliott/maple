zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and acts as a neurotransmitter in the nervous zzso In the zzso we previously reported that the zzso distribution of the subset of zzso differs between the ON and OFF zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso activates zzso and zzso the zzso function of the mouse zzso We also examined if signal processing by zzso is zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso activated both zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, responses in zzso zzso cells were greater than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso cells showed that the response of zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso Further, zzso increased zzso acid zzso zzso zzso currents zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso signals suppressed OFF zzso cells but activated ON zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso signal processing of the ON and OFF pathways in a zzso manner through zzso
