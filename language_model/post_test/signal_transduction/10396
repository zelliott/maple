zzso functions in checkpoint zzso and DNA repair following DNA zzso To address the zzso role of zzso we disrupted the zzso gene in zzso zzso mice zzso many zzso of zzso mice, including growth zzso male infertility, immune zzso zzso instability, DNA repair zzso and radiation zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso and zzso form a positive feedback loop, with zzso directly zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso binds zzso zzso through its zzso domain and zzso through its zzso zzso Through these zzso zzso accumulates activated zzso zzso the sites of DNA damage, zzso further zzso zzso of zzso and the amplification of DNA damage zzso In the absence of zzso many downstream zzso signaling events are zzso These results suggest that zzso as a signal amplifier of the zzso pathway, is vital in controlling proper DNA damage response and maintaining zzso zzso
