zzso is a 30 zzso G protein in the Ras zzso whose discovery was based on its pronounced zzso by the zzso zzso It binds to zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso We report that zzso binds to the peripheral zzso zzso protein zzso a protein of unknown function that binds to zzso zzso protein zzso and the peripheral zzso zzso zzso in turn binds to the zzso metal zzso zzso an iron import zzso We have identified a signaling cascade in zzso zzso stimulation of zzso receptors activates zzso leading to zzso and zzso of zzso which, via zzso and zzso zzso zzso iron zzso As selective iron zzso prevents zzso zzso in cortical cultures, the zzso zzso signaling cascade also appears to mediate zzso zzso
