zzso with local zzso cues direct cell zzso A versatile method to study cell response to a protein consists of patterning the protein cue on a zzso and zzso the distribution of cells between patterned and zzso zzso Here, we define the concepts of zzso zzso affinity to describe cell choices, and of zzso reference surface zzso to clarify that the choice is made relative to a zzso Furthermore, we report a method to systematically tune the zzso and show that it can dominate the experimental cell response to a protein zzso The cell response to a cue can be switched from strong preference to strong zzso by only changing the zzso Using zzso zzso we patterned the zzso zzso proteins zzso or zzso adjacent to a series of zzso with different ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are of high affinity and of zzso for cells, zzso zzso zzso or primary zzso seeded on zzso with a high affinity zzso zzso % zzso did not respond to a printed protein of interest, and zzso on zzso of low affinity zzso % zzso the cells preferred the printed protein even in the absence of a specific zzso However, when testing cell response to a standardized series of zzso varying from high to low zzso a specific response curve was obtained that was unique to each cell zzso zzso zzso for intermediate zzso with moderate zzso the cell response to the cue was dependent on the zzso of biologically relevant zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Our results establish that choices made by cells in response to a zzso cue must take into account, and be interpreted in the context of, the zzso The use of a series of zzso with varying zzso affinity reveals specific response zzso of cells to a cue that can be compared zzso and that may help gain new insights into cellular responses to zzso zzso
