In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso concentration zzso on zzso zzso processes were investigated in rat gastric zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso reduction resulted in zzso an increase of zzso zzso free calcium concentration zzso zzso an enhancement of both zzso and zzso calcium responses, zzso an improved filling state of zzso calcium stores, zzso an increase of both zzso and zzso acid zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso acid zzso were not zzso The effects of high zzso were opposite to the described results, except that high zzso was able to decrease significantly zzso zzso levels and acid zzso These findings indicate a zzso role of zzso on the zzso zzso processes and acid zzso properties in rat zzso zzso These effects seemed to be zzso by regulating zzso calcium loading capacity of zzso stores, zzso the zzso of the calcium influx pathway, and zzso the formation of zzso
