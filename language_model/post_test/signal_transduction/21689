zzso is a complicated regulating factor for zzso proliferation and an important zzso of zzso Although zzso zzso activity can markedly promote wound healing because zzso mediates the role of transforming growth zzso in zzso cell proliferation and inducing cell zzso there has been no report on whether zzso is expressed during wound healing and the relationship between its expression and wound zzso By establishing animal models of normal and zzso wound healing and using zzso in zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction, we found that zzso was expressed after wounding and reached its peak on day 9 and then significantly zzso zzso was present in all repair cells, and was especially prominent in zzso Compared with the control side, the zzso side showed a lower expression of zzso on zzso days zzso but higher on day 15, and not significantly different after the wound was zzso The expression of zzso was in contrast to the zzso and cellular proliferation was similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso index was significantly higher on the zzso side on days zzso compared with the control zzso In zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso could reverse the zzso role of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis found that zzso also diminished zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso These results suggest that there is not only obvious expression of this regulatory protein but there is also a significant change in the levels of zzso during wound zzso Its in zzso expression pattern and experiments in zzso suggest that zzso may be involved in tissue repair by zzso zzso zzso zzso can reduce zzso and increase zzso zzso resulting in elevated zzso activity, resulting in diminished cell zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso
