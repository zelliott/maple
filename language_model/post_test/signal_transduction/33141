zzso zzso play critical roles in zzso zzso zzso of transient zzso of zzso calcium zzso activates protein zzso regulates zzso and influences zzso and zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso exhibit a zzso period in culture; removing zzso zzso during this period affects several aspects of zzso zzso However, both the mechanisms that generate natural fluctuations in zzso and the signals they zzso are not well zzso zzso transient and repeated zzso of zzso in embryonic zzso spinal zzso have been observed over periods up to 5 h in zzso and in zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generate two distinctive types of spontaneous zzso zzso calcium spikes and calcium zzso We have investigated the mechanisms by which they are generated and their roles in directing zzso zzso zzso are generated by spontaneous action zzso and thus are rapidly zzso throughout entire zzso zzso entry triggers zzso release from zzso stores, and spikes have a characteristic double exponential zzso In contrast, the generation of waves does not involve conventional zzso zzso channels, but an unknown zzso entry zzso that can be blocked by zzso at a higher concentration than required to block classical zzso zzso zzso Waves rise and zzso slowly, and unlike zzso are local zzso However both spikes and waves are abolished by removal of zzso zzso zzso the zzso and frequency of spikes decrease while the zzso and frequency of waves are zzso To study the roles of zzso zzso we have zzso zzso in spinal zzso throughout an extended period of early development, and find that spikes and waves are expressed at distinct zzso zzso differentiation is altered when they are eliminated by preventing zzso zzso By zzso different frequency patterns of zzso zzso we demonstrate that natural spike activity is sufficient to promote normal neurotransmitter expression and channel zzso while wave activity at growth cones is sufficient to regulate zzso zzso On the other hand, suppression of spontaneous zzso zzso with zzso a rapid zzso zzso indicates that they are also necessary to direct zzso zzso zzso appear to zzso information in their zzso Thus, they act like action zzso although they are zzso times longer in duration and less frequent and implement an intrinsic development zzso
