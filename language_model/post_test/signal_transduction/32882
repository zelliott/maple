The effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium concentration were determined in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso receptors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso confirmed that the binding profiles of the zzso receptors were similar to those of the native zzso zzso displaced zzso binding to zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso had a zzso value of zzso at zzso but a zzso at zzso zzso zzso experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native zzso zzso of both receptors resulted in stimulation of zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso A comparison of the functional data at zzso showed that a similar potency order zzso zzso was obtained in all three zzso However, at zzso whilst the potency orders for calcium zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were similar zzso zzso or zzso zzso the order was reversed for stimulation of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by zzso toxin zzso suggesting zzso to a zzso zzso However, the calcium zzso induced by zzso at zzso was not fully inhibited by zzso suggesting an interaction with a zzso of the zzso zzso Our results with zzso toxin also suggested that, in the zzso binding zzso zzso displays some zzso zzso Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at zzso zzso 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native zzso We also have preliminary evidence that zzso displays zzso activity in our cell line and that zzso may traffic between different zzso sensitive zzso
