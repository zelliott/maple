Early in zzso development, the processes of zzso lead to the formation of the three germ zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mechanisms leading to the segregation of the zzso and zzso are not well zzso In zzso stage zzso zzso single marginal cells can give rise to both zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The guts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso p zzso By the late zzso stage, however, single marginal cells generally give rise to either zzso or zzso To investigate this segregation of the zzso into cells with either zzso or zzso zzso we analyzed the role of zzso signaling in this zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the marginal domain of zzso stage zzso and that this expression is dependent on zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling from an early stage leads to a reduction of zzso cells, as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso We further find that this reduction in zzso formation by the zzso of zzso signaling is preceded by a reduction in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso two genes necessary for zzso formation zzso et zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso Reiter et zzso zzso Development zzso Kikuchi et zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso signaling in bon zzso zzso leads to a further reduction in zzso cells, also arguing for a zzso role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso signaling plays a role in the formation of the zzso possibly in its segregation from the zzso
