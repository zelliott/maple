The role of zzso in the mechanism of zzso release was investigated in isolated rat pancreatic zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso and zzso increase in zzso production which paralleled the time course of zzso zzso The addition of zzso to zzso cells zzso with 100 zzso zzso produced a lag in the fall in zzso levels, which was preceded by a prompt fall in zzso zzso and zzso zzso A threshold concentration of zzso amplified the modest action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells was markedly enhanced by zzso These collective findings support the hypothesis that zzso alone is not an adequate zzso to mediate pancreatic zzso release, but does serve to zzso the actions of zzso
