We previously reported that reducing the expression of the gap junction protein zzso zzso in mice restricts zzso zzso formation after acute vascular injury by limiting the inflammatory response and the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells zzso toward the damaged zzso zzso populations isolated from zzso coronary artery exhibit distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the normal media, whereas zzso are recovered in higher proportion from zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they participate in the zzso zzso Here, we further investigate the relationship between zzso expression and zzso zzso using zzso coronary artery zzso zzso was highly expressed in normal media of zzso coronary artery in zzso whereas zzso was barely zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso and zzso was markedly zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso expressed zzso and zzso In zzso zzso expression was increased and zzso was zzso We confirmed that zzso treated with zzso growth zzso acquire an R zzso This was accompanied by an zzso of zzso and a loss of zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso change was prevented by a reduction of zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso retained their typical zzso appearance and the expression of zzso muscle zzso a well-known zzso differentiation marker, whereas the expression of zzso a typical marker of zzso was zzso In conclusion, limiting zzso expression in zzso prevents zzso growth zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may be an additional target for local delivery strategies aimed at reducing zzso
