zzso of zzso and deletion due to zzso are two of the mechanisms involved in peripheral zzso To clarify the relationship between these two phenomena we have used an in zzso system of T cell zzso zzso The recognition of zzso displayed by zzso class zzso T cells zzso zzso partial signals in zzso T cell zzso This leads to a blunted zzso calcium zzso and the T cells become unable to zzso in response to further challenge with professional zzso These T cells are unable to produce zzso but retain the ability to release zzso In the present study, we report that for some T cell zzso the zzso outcome of zzso recognition on T cells is cell zzso For susceptible T cell zzso the number of cells that die is zzso to the zzso zzso This cell death resulted from zzso zzso interactions between the T cells, in that zzso zzso expression was detected following overnight culture of T cells with zzso and zzso zzso zzso protected from zzso Most notably, following zzso protection from zzso the rescued T cells remained unable to respond to zzso with zzso professional zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso can be separated as consequences of partial T cell zzso
