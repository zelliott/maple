Memory and zzso zzso T cells have unique regulatory pathways for zzso zzso A memory cell specific regulatory zzso was revealed using zzso to trigger the zzso Upon stimulation by bacterial zzso like zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso signaling is impaired leading to zzso tolerance zzso In the present report, we show that memory cell zzso results from the zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso away from the zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso is excluded from both zzso membrane zzso and the zzso zzso thus blocking downstream zzso We also show that the mechanism underlying memory cell zzso must involve zzso zzso given that the suppression of zzso activity restores the movement of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Thus, zzso including microbial zzso may zzso memory responses by targeting the organizational structure of memory cell signaling zzso
