zzso of zzso by collagen leads to zzso of a zzso zzso cascade resulting in zzso and zzso We have recently shown that this zzso involves rapid zzso zzso of an zzso zzso gamma chain, which contains an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso enabling interaction with the tandem zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso lies upstream of zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the present study we sought to test directly the role of the zzso interaction and the role of the zzso zzso in collagen zzso signaling using mouse zzso We demonstrate that the zzso action of a zzso zzso zzso is zzso inhibited by the zzso of the tandem zzso zzso of zzso and abolished in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso response is abolished by the zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso and inhibited in zzso zzso In contrast, the calcium response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not significantly altered under these zzso These results provide direct evidence of the functional importance of zzso and zzso in collagen zzso signaling and support the zzso as a model for the study of proteins involved in this zzso
