The zzso gene family encodes large zzso receptors that are components of an zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso To assess the role of the zzso zzso we generated zzso mice by gene zzso zzso zzso for this zzso developed zzso and zzso zzso adults were viable and zzso However, the zzso zzso displayed genetic interactions with a targeted zzso of the related zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of both the zzso and zzso genes often displayed a more severe zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso double zzso zzso displayed severe defects in zzso vascular zzso Analysis of the expression patterns of genes zzso zzso for zzso family receptors indicated that only the zzso gene is expressed in a pattern consistent with that expected for a gene zzso a zzso for the zzso and zzso receptors in the early embryonic zzso These results reveal an essential role for the zzso signaling zzso in regulating embryonic vascular zzso and zzso and indicate that whereas the zzso gene is not essential during embryonic development, the zzso and zzso genes have partially overlapping roles during zzso in zzso
