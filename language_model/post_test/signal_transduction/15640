zzso zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins involved in zzso Using zzso zzso in zzso we created two deletions that removed the entire zzso gene and part of the zzso zzso resulting in no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were viable, but had defects in zzso zzso deficient synaptic transmission, impaired zzso entry and enhanced zzso zzso The impaired zzso entry was sufficient to account for reduced neurotransmitter zzso We hypothesized that zzso either zzso zzso channels, or that it regulates the zzso zzso as described in other zzso To determine whether zzso interacts with zzso with zzso effects on zzso channels, we first characterized a zzso zzso and found that zzso was zzso for synaptic transmission and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained present in a zzso zzso We conclude that the effects of zzso are not due to an interaction with zzso Using flies that were zzso for a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso cacophony zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso we show a synergistic effect between these proteins in neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso zzso were rescued by a zzso cacophony zzso Overall, zzso zzso zzso entry through a functional interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso this interaction regulates zzso and zzso zzso
