The use of human embryonic stem cells zzso as a source of zzso zzso for Parkinson's disease cell therapy will require the development of simple and reliable cell differentiation zzso The use of cell zzso added zzso signaling factors, or transgenic approaches to drive zzso differentiation could lead to additional regulatory as well as cell production delays for these zzso Because the zzso cell lineage seems to require limited or no signaling for its formation, we tested the ability of zzso to differentiate to form zzso zzso in a simple zzso suspension culture zzso zzso and zzso zzso were differentiated as suspension zzso and neural zzso and zzso were zzso after 2-4 zzso zzso zzso responded appropriately to zzso zzso This differentiation was inhibited by early exposure to bone zzso protein zzso but a pulse of zzso from days 5 to 9 caused induction of peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso demonstrated the expression of multiple markers of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso were killed by zzso zzso a zzso zzso Upon zzso these cells released zzso and other catecholamines in response to zzso zzso Surviving zzso zzso derived from the cells differentiated in zzso suspension cultures, were detected 8 weeks after transplantation into zzso rat zzso This work suggests that zzso can differentiate in simple zzso suspension cultures to produce the large number of cells required for transplantation zzso
