The balance of bone zzso protein zzso transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso signals regulates the early lineage segregation of human embryonic stem cells zzso Here we demonstrate that a combination of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals promotes highly efficient neural induction from both human zzso and induced zzso stem cells zzso The combination of small molecules had effects on both cell survival and purity of neural zzso under conditions of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso floating zzso culture, for all seven zzso stem cell lines that we zzso including three zzso and four zzso zzso Small zzso compounds are stable and cost effective, so our findings provide a promising strategy for controlled production of zzso in zzso zzso
