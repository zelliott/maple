zzso is an important age-related bone disease characterized by increased bone turnover with insufficient bone formation relative to bone zzso According to the current understanding of this disorder, zzso and anabolic drugs have been developed for therapeutic zzso Another therapeutic approach consists of zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso and clinical studies provided evidence that zzso (in the form of zzso zzso beneficial effects on bone mass and resistance in animal models of bone loss and in zzso zzso These effects are zzso in part by the pharmacological actions of zzso on bone zzso by reducing bone zzso and maintaining or increasing bone zzso Current pharmacological studies showed that zzso activates multiple signaling pathways in bone cells to achieve its pharmacological zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso in zzso or zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these pathways results in the zzso of key molecules such as zzso and zzso that control bone zzso and to the regulation of genes promoting zzso cell zzso differentiation and zzso This review focuses on the more recent knowledge of zzso signaling in bone cells and describes how the resulting pharmacological actions on bone metabolism have important therapeutic implications in the treatment of age-related bone loss and possibly other zzso
