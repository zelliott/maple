zzso of cells of the zzso lineage is a crucial step in the sensing of zzso by the immune zzso zzso present in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell walls have been shown to act as zzso for different receptors leading to different stimulating zzso some of which need zzso zzso However, among these zzso couples, none has been shown to discriminate the zzso zzso zzso zzso We explored the role of zzso which binds zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are specifically and prominently expressed at the surface of zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso Using a mouse cell line and zzso cells from knockout mice, we demonstrated a specific enhancement of the cellular response to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso which depended on zzso zzso However, zzso was not required for recognition and zzso of zzso In contrast, using zzso differentiated zzso we observed that the presence of zzso was required for efficient zzso and zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed at the level of zzso containing zzso zzso were shown to be associated in differentiated zzso after incubation with this sole zzso These data suggest that zzso differently sense zzso zzso and zzso zzso through a mechanism involving zzso and zzso which probably associate for binding of zzso expressing zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso cell wall zzso
