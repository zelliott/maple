The ability to induce the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso was examined by deleting 178 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this deletion zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso resulted in the induction of growth zzso zzso zzso zzso cells proliferated only in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso cells zzso with the long form of the human zzso were able to zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso or human zzso zzso expressing the zzso deletion zzso contained numerous zzso proteins in the absence of stimulation with either zzso or zzso zzso Growth factor stimulation increased the number of proteins zzso and the intensity of zzso These proteins included zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso cells with the zzso deletion zzso induced growth zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso In addition to the induction of a growth zzso state, the expression of the zzso deletion zzso also suppressed the zzso that occurs when zzso cells are cultured in the absence of growth factors such as zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso can be achieved by deletion of the zzso binding domain and that this zzso leads to the zzso zzso of the zzso as determined by the ability of the zzso to induce growth zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso
