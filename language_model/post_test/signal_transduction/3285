The final number of zzso cells reached during the zzso periods determines zzso production capacity in zzso It is well known that zzso is the major zzso cell zzso however, little is known about the signal zzso pathways that regulate the proliferation of zzso zzso The hypothesis of this investigation was that zzso regulates proliferation through a zzso pathway, and zzso zzso mechanisms counteract zzso zzso zzso The present study was performed in zzso rat zzso cell zzso The results presented zzso show that zzso in addition to increasing zzso zzso and zzso levels, increases zzso levels, probably contributing to improving zzso zzso Furthermore, the decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in the presence of zzso emphasizes the participation of zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation by the effect of zzso and zzso point to the relevance of the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso activity of zzso On the other hand, by zzso zzso several interesting observations were zzso zzso of zzso produced an increase in zzso zzso a decrease in zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso cell zzso The decrease in zzso cell proliferation was accompanied by an increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso it is concluded that zzso regulates zzso cell proliferation with the participation of a zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may be involved in the detention of proliferation by, at least in part, a decrease in zzso signaling and an increase in zzso zzso
