wingless zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso zzso play critical roles in the generation of embryonic zzso In the developing zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a single row of cells in each segment, but it influences cell identities in all rows of zzso cells in the zzso to zzso zzso zzso signaling promotes zzso of two distinct aspects of the zzso zzso zzso the diversity of zzso types present in the anterior zzso belt and the smooth or naked zzso zzso the zzso surface of the zzso We have manipulated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to explore the mechanism by which a single zzso signaling zzso can promote these distinctly different cell zzso We present evidence consistent with the idea that naked zzso cell fate is specified by a cellular zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso Since these pathways are zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso we propose that at least two discrete classes of zzso for zzso may exist, each zzso a different cellular zzso We also find that broad zzso protein distribution across many cell diameters is required for the generation of zzso diversity, suggesting that zzso transport of the zzso protein is an essential feature of pattern formation within the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that an 85 zzso acid region not zzso in zzso zzso is zzso for zzso function and we discuss structural features of the zzso protein required for its distinct biological zzso
