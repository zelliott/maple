zzso systems are activated in heart failure, and it is believed that interaction between such systems may be important during progression of this zzso We have previously shown that failing hearts have increased levels of the zzso related zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso and zzso A, a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effects of zzso A on zzso and a potential interaction with zzso changes in cell signaling and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso to zzso zzso rats, and the cells were treated with zzso zzso A or a combination zzso Our main findings were: zzso zzso A treatment reduced the zzso increase in zzso zzso perimeter and zzso organization and was accompanied by a substantially decreased zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was markedly enhanced by zzso zzso zzso A markedly induced zzso gene zzso while zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso representing zzso of zzso and zzso A signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso abolished the effects of zzso A on zzso changes in cell zzso perimeter and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso A markedly zzso zzso changes in zzso reflecting a potentially important role for both zzso A and the zzso zzso in regulation of zzso zzso
