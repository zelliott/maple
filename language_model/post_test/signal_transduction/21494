zzso is an important zzso zzso that responds to zzso zzso expression on tumors and zzso zzso Human natural killer cells express zzso and require the zzso zzso zzso to initiate their full zzso zzso However, zzso has no zzso zzso zzso motif and thus the mechanism of recruiting zzso zzso proteins is zzso We show here that binding of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso could not by itself trigger zzso zzso and that binding of an intermediate consisting of the zzso binding partner zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was sufficient to initiate zzso zzso For full calcium release and zzso to occur, both zzso and zzso had to bind to zzso These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by which zzso mediates zzso and provides a framework for evaluating zzso by other zzso complexes that lack zzso zzso zzso zzso
