The zzso zzso channel mediates the zzso of water in zzso collecting ducts in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso expression is induced not only by the zzso zzso binding protein zzso factor of activated T cells zzso zzso stress response but also by the zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression by the zzso zzso can occur in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed the existence of functional zzso binding sites within the zzso zzso promoter responsible for regulation of zzso by zzso proteins and zzso zzso to the notion that zzso is the only zzso family member regulated by zzso we found that zzso promotes the nuclear zzso of zzso proteins for the subsequent induction of zzso zzso zzso activity was also found to be involved in the induction of zzso expression by zzso thus further defining the signaling mechanisms that zzso the zzso zzso stress response zzso The coordinate regulation of zzso expression by both zzso stress and calcium signaling appears to provide a means to integrate diverse zzso signals into optimal cellular zzso
