zzso maturation is governed by zzso cell zzso zzso affinity and the extent of zzso zzso zzso provided by zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso also influence the fate of immature zzso The mechanism by which differences in zzso zzso zzso unique zzso responses of zzso and the influence of zzso molecules on these signaling processes is not fully zzso To better understand the role of a key second messenger, zzso in governing zzso zzso we measured the zzso free calcium concentration zzso response to changes in zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso stimulation zzso either zzso or zzso zzso changes depending on zzso the maturation state of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the participation of specific zzso zzso zzso signaling within immature but not mature zzso could be modulated by the zzso of zzso zzso Low zzso interactions induced zzso calcium responses, whereas high zzso engagement initiated zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso participation converted the calcium response to low zzso zzso engagement from a zzso to zzso zzso These data suggest that calcium plays a central role in zzso the nature of the zzso signal received by zzso and, consequently, a role in zzso zzso
