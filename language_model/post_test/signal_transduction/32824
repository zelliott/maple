The present study aimed to examine the zzso expression pattern of human oral zzso zzso at the protein and zzso zzso The zzso expression was measured by a zzso method and the protein production was determined by an zzso zzso In freshly isolated oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha and basic zzso growth factor were zzso at the protein and zzso level, whereas zzso growth factor, zzso zzso growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha were found only at the zzso zzso There were no zzso signals of zzso and zzso The zzso production at the protein level was independent of prior stimulation with zzso zzso zzso Our results show that human oral zzso - under zzso conditions - produce a zzso pattern quite similar to that of zzso zzso which may have implications for further functional zzso
