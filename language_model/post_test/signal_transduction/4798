The role of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso in cellular function remains zzso By zzso recent data, we propose here that local dynamic zzso in the form of zzso zzso serve as zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso distinguishable from zzso zzso due to zzso leakage of the electron transfer chain zzso Individual zzso flashes are zzso zzso bursts that are zzso to a single zzso or local zzso zzso As a zzso universal zzso activity, it occurs in intact cells, in ex zzso beating hearts, and even in living zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso flashes are ignited by transient openings of a type of zzso zzso transition pore zzso and their zzso is richly regulated by an array of factors that zzso on either the zzso or zzso Emerging evidence has shown that zzso flashes decode dietary and zzso status or exercise, gauge zzso stress zzso during zzso after zzso or zzso and constitute early zzso signals that initiate zzso stress-related zzso in a zzso zzso That they make only a zzso contribution to global zzso zzso to the high efficiency of local zzso zzso However, the exact mechanisms underlying zzso flash formation, regulation and function remain zzso Future investigation is warranted to uncover the cellular logic and molecular pathways of local dynamic zzso signaling in heart muscle cells and many other cell zzso
