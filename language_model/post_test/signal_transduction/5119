zzso play an important role in regulating the life and death of zzso They provide the cell with energy via zzso zzso but can quickly turn into zzso zzso in response to stress by zzso zzso zzso zzso releasing zzso zzso and producing zzso oxygen zzso Due to their zzso requirement, cardiac zzso are abundant in zzso and as a result, particularly vulnerable to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with zzso dysfunction and cell zzso zzso future therapies will focus on preserving zzso integrity and function in hopes of minimizing the impact of zzso zzso zzso It is well established that zzso zzso activates both necrosis and zzso and that blocking either process reduces the levels of zzso However, recent studies have demonstrated that zzso in zzso dynamics or clearance of zzso via zzso also can contribute to cell death in the zzso In this review, we will discuss these new developments and their impact on the role of cardiac zzso in cell death following zzso in the zzso
