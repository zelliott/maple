The importance of zzso zzso factors in regulating different aspects of cellular zzso and zzso has become zzso zzso zzso B has been shown to zzso and zzso members of zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and its upstream regulator, zzso zzso zzso are involved in rapid action of zzso zzso in different cells and zzso The aim of the present study was to analyze the zzso zzso in rat zzso In response to zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso increased but with distinct zzso regulating the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso induced zzso zzso suggesting that zzso receptors mediate this effect of zzso zzso injection of zzso caused a decrease in the zzso of zzso of zzso and attenuated zzso of its downstream target zzso at zzso and at zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso of zzso showed a kinetic pattern distinct from that of zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso in rat zzso is functioning even at the lack of zzso hormones and responses to zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso through a zzso sensitive way, presumably involving zzso The present work shows that zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso indicating that the regulation of this zzso factor is a more complex event in zzso cells requiring further zzso
