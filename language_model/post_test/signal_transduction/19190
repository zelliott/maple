Ion channel function is fundamental to the existence of zzso In zzso the coordinate activities of zzso zzso channels zzso cellular zzso and control zzso communication, cardiac zzso zzso and skeletal muscle zzso However, despite decades of research and linkage of zzso channel dysfunction with zzso zzso and zzso little progress has been made toward understanding the fundamental processes that regulate this family of zzso Here, we have identified zzso as a zzso regulatory platform for zzso channels in zzso We found that zzso targeted critical structural and regulatory proteins to excitable zzso in the heart and zzso Animal models harboring zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso cellular zzso and whole animal zzso Moreover, we identified a regulatory mechanism for zzso channels, via direct zzso by zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso our data define an unexpected but indispensable molecular platform that determines membrane zzso in the mouse heart and zzso
