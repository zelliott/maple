zzso is a cell surface zzso that zzso cell death signals when zzso by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso In this study, we examined the potential of zzso to contribute to zzso zzso injury and zzso as they occur in the human zzso disease multiple sclerosis zzso zzso study of central nervous system zzso tissue from zzso subjects demonstrated elevated zzso expression on zzso in chronic active and chronic silent zzso zzso compared with zzso in control tissue from subjects with or without other zzso zzso In such zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed intense zzso to zzso zzso In zzso zzso cell cultures prepared from human adult zzso zzso zzso expression was restricted to zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or with the zzso induced rapid OL cell membrane zzso assessed by zzso release and zzso blue zzso and subsequent cell zzso In contrast to the activity of zzso in other cellular systems, dying zzso did not exhibit evidence of zzso assessed zzso and by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for DNA zzso Other stimuli such as zzso were capable of inducing rapid zzso in zzso zzso directed at other surface molecules expressed on zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso Our results suggest that zzso signaling might contribute in a novel zzso manner to zzso OL injury in zzso
