zzso zzso is characterized by increased circulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso apart from its role in fluid and zzso zzso has also been implicated in insulin resistance and zzso zzso The impact of zzso as a potential risk factor for zzso cardiovascular injury in diabetes zzso however, remains to be zzso We have therefore studied native and modified zzso zzso and its underlying molecular mechanisms in human zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso Native zzso zzso isolated from healthy volunteers, was subjected to in zzso modification with zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso zzso for preparation of zzso and oxidized zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso in both a zzso and zzso zzso Native and zzso zzso zzso zzso were almost zzso more potent in zzso zzso release than zzso II zzso zzso These forms of zzso significantly zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso partially through scavenger zzso class B type I, as evident from the effect of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso oxidized zzso significantly attenuated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso hormone zzso Moreover, treatment with specific pharmacological zzso zzso zzso zzso provided supporting evidence that zzso irrespective of zzso presumably recruited zzso zzso and zzso for steroid hormone release through zzso of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates a novel insight into zzso mechanism of zzso zzso synthesis through zzso regulation of zzso acute regulatory protein zzso and zzso expression in human zzso zzso cell zzso
