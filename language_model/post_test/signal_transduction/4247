We have identified another zzso zzso protein zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are derived from alternative zzso of the zzso alpha locus previously shown to zzso two zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Hyde, zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion genes show that zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells of the zzso and taste structures, including a subset of zzso and zzso zzso and in cells of the central nervous system, including zzso in the zzso zzso These data are consistent with a variety of roles for zzso zzso including zzso a subset of zzso and zzso responses in zzso and supports the idea that some zzso responses use G zzso receptors and the second zzso zzso zzso
