The steroid hormone zzso is crucial for zzso cell death, proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso we delineate a molecular zzso linking zzso zzso to cell cycle regulation in the zzso developing zzso We present evidence that the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso provides a crucial link between the zzso steroid hormone zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We identified zzso as a strong zzso of a wing zzso generated by zzso of the zzso cell cycle inhibitor zzso We demonstrate that zzso is required for cell cycle zzso zzso zzso clones have reduced cell cycles and are removed by zzso while zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell cycle arrest in the zone of zzso cells in the wing zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso acts to repress zzso zzso We also show that zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso consistent with the identification of the zzso zzso as a dominant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our studies have revealed a novel mechanism for cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso links steroid hormone signals to zzso zzso and the regulation of crucial cell cycle zzso
