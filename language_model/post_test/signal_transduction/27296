zzso zzso proteins are essential zzso components of zzso signaling pathways and are regulated by zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso and not the related protein zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso and is directly zzso by the complex on zzso zzso zzso of zzso with receptors and zzso requires zzso of zzso I by zzso II and is zzso by the zzso I zzso zzso of the zzso sites generates a dominant negative zzso that blocks zzso zzso responses, zzso associates with zzso and fails to accumulate in the nucleus in response to zzso zzso Thus, transient association and zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso is necessary for nuclear zzso and initiation of zzso
