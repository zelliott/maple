The zzso coli zzso regulatory system is a paradigm of zzso signal zzso zzso by the well-documented zzso zzso by which the expression of the major outer membrane zzso zzso and zzso is regulated in response to the medium zzso Although it is clear that the zzso zzso is the major player in the zzso of zzso it has been assumed for some time that there may be an alternative zzso that can zzso zzso under certain in zzso and in zzso zzso In this study, to address this long-standing issue, extensive genetic studies were done with certain zzso zzso including delta zzso zzso and delta zzso as well as delta zzso Here, for the first time, genetic evidence is provided that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso and an as yet unidentified sensor zzso can serve as alternative in zzso zzso for zzso even in the zzso zzso A model for the alternative zzso signaling zzso involved in the zzso of zzso is zzso
