Identification of the role of biological pathways in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso has led to the development of targeted agents for its treatment, in particular those that inhibit the vascular zzso growth factor pathway, and zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is central to zzso pathways that regulate cellular growth, proliferation and survival, and this paper focuses on the two currently licensed zzso zzso zzso and zzso These agents are administered via different routes (intravenously and orally, respectively), and this has an impact on their zzso intravenous zzso is not affected by variable zzso in the gastrointestinal tract or by food zzso unlike the orally administered zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is administered weekly, whereas zzso is currently approved for daily zzso In general, intravenous administration is likely to ensure better control of plasma drug zzso greater treatment zzso and more regular monitoring of toxicity and therapeutic response, although it can be uncomfortable and inconvenient for zzso zzso administration is preferred by patients for its zzso but can be associated with zzso adherence to treatment, and poor and variable zzso zzso and zzso have both been associated with improved outcomes in patients with zzso but, as reviewed in this paper, the zzso characteristics of these agents differ in many zzso
