Solar ultraviolet zzso zzso causes damages on human skin and premature skin aging zzso zzso reduction of type I collagen in zzso is widely considered primarily induction of zzso appearance of zzso zzso Type I zzso synthesis is reduced under zzso zzso by blocking transforming growth zzso zzso zzso more specifically, it is zzso of zzso type II zzso zzso beta zzso zzso preventing zzso loss of T beta zzso results decreased type I collagen reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso is an alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose effect on skin tissue is scarcely zzso We investigated the protective effects of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso against reduction of type I zzso synthesis of zzso zzso of T beta zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was obtained from zzso of zzso culture zzso The levels of T beta zzso and type I zzso zzso in human zzso zzso were measured by quantitative real-time zzso and T beta zzso protein levels were zzso by western zzso T beta zzso type I zzso and type I collagen proteins in human zzso zzso or zzso mouse skin were detected by zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited down regulation of T beta zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso human zzso zzso consequently recover reduced type I zzso zzso These results indicate zzso zzso zzso type I zzso synthesis by suppression of zzso signaling pathway, and zzso of zzso zzso has zzso effect on zzso reduction of type I zzso zzso While short period zzso zzso decreased both T beta zzso and type I zzso protein levels in zzso mouse skin, topical application of zzso of zzso zzso prevented this zzso zzso formation in zzso mouse skin surface was accelerated by continuous 5 month zzso zzso along with a reduction of type I collagen in the zzso but this change was prevented by topical application of zzso of zzso zzso From this experimental data, it is suggested that zzso of zzso zzso is effective for suppression of wrinkle formation in zzso skin by zzso of type I zzso synthesis zzso
