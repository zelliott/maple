The biological role of zzso zzso zzso remains obscure in spite of numerous attempts to solve this zzso It is known that zzso contrary to zzso accumulates in human cultured cells treated with zzso zzso alpha or zzso Since zzso are considered as zzso regulators, we assumed that different cell status may be associated with varying zzso levels of zzso zzso human cell line zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso to differentiate to zzso cells in culture exhibits a profound loss of zzso zzso Here we have shown a zzso increase in zzso concentration in zzso cells induced by zzso similar to the effect of zzso while the zzso concentration remained zzso On the contrary, in cells undergoing zzso induced by zzso a zzso II zzso the zzso concentration considerably zzso while the zzso concentration zzso These findings combined with earlier results suggest an involvement of the zzso ratio in signal zzso pathways controlling the cell zzso
