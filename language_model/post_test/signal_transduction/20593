Clinical trial and zzso data support that the cardiovascular effects of zzso are complex, including a mixture of both potentially beneficial and harmful zzso In animal models, zzso protects females from vascular injury and zzso zzso These effects are zzso by zzso receptors zzso which, when bound to estrogen, can bind to DNA to directly regulate zzso zzso can also activate several cellular zzso by inducing a rapid zzso signaling zzso However, the biological significance of this rapid signaling zzso has been zzso 

In the present study, we develop a novel transgenic mouse in which rapid signaling is blocked by zzso of a zzso that prevents zzso from interacting with the scaffold protein zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of ex zzso treated mouse zzso demonstrates that rapid zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso gene regulatory zzso zzso of zzso interactions also eliminates the ability of zzso to stimulate cultured zzso cell migration and to inhibit cultured vascular smooth muscle cell zzso The importance of these findings is underscored by in zzso experiments demonstrating loss of zzso protection against vascular injury in the zzso zzso mouse after carotid artery wire zzso 

Taken together, these results support the concept that zzso zzso zzso signaling contributes to the zzso regulatory functions of zzso and is essential for many of the zzso effects of zzso These findings also identify the rapid zzso signaling zzso as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic zzso
