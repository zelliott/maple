zzso zzso has been characterized as a zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso memory T zzso zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso of patients with zzso arthritis zzso compared to patients with zzso In contrast to the restricted expression of zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso Using a real-time zzso zzso we detected similar absolute levels of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso 9 zzso total zzso ranged from zzso zzso to 96 zzso zzso zzso total zzso compared to zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso surface expression confirmed the results obtained for zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso led to a zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso zzso blocked these effects of zzso The zzso zzso appears necessary for the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso expression as shown by zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso of protein zzso zzso reduced significantly the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso was without zzso zzso drugs used in therapy of zzso such as zzso and methotrexate, induced a fourfold increase of zzso zzso expression and zzso the zzso zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso may play a significant role in the zzso of zzso contributing to an unbalanced production of zzso as well as participating in zzso tissue zzso
