zzso crest cells zzso participate in the zzso of the cardiac zzso tract and zzso arch arteries during cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates signal zzso by zzso and growth factor zzso each of which is important for normal cardiovascular zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we deleted it in zzso zzso using zzso yielding zzso and cardiovascular zzso resembling those observed in individuals with zzso zzso In these mice, we observed normal cardiac zzso migration but reduced differentiation into smooth muscle within the zzso arch arteries and impaired cardiac zzso tract zzso which resulted in a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, within the zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a less organized zzso with reduced expression of zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso stress fibers within the zzso zzso Additionally, absence of zzso resulted in reduced in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso components of a signaling zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso with this, both zzso and zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso in control but not zzso zzso in zzso Our results indicate that zzso plays an essential role in cardiac zzso tract development by promoting the zzso of molecules such as zzso and zzso
