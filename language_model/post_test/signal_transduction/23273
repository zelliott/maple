In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso A zzso isolated from zzso rotunda, on zzso and zzso in zzso human zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso of the executioner zzso by PA was found to be zzso zzso activity was significantly elevated at the 5 zzso level of PA treatment and progressed to a zzso zzso However, no significant elevated level was detected on zzso These findings suggest that PA activated zzso but not zzso Numerous zzso of PA treated zzso cells stained brightly by zzso zzso zzso through High Content zzso This result further confirmed that PA induced zzso cell death was zzso through zzso of zzso and eventually led to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with PA resulted in a strong zzso of zzso zzso which was consistent with a decrease in nuclear levels of zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso Besides that, we also showed that PA significantly inhibited the invasion of zzso cells in a zzso manner through reducing the zzso of zzso of zzso cells gelatin zzso zzso Our findings not only provide the effects of zzso but may also be important in the design of therapeutic protocols that involve targeting of either zzso or zzso
