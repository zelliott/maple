zzso water is in the liquid state, bacteria will exist as zzso which are complex communities of cells that are cemented zzso Although frequently associated with disease and zzso zzso are also important for engineering applications, such as zzso zzso and microbial fuel zzso Here, we review approaches to alter genetic circuits and cell signaling towards controlling zzso formation, and emphasize utilizing these tools for engineering zzso Based on a better understanding of the genetic basis of zzso formation, we find that zzso might be controlled by manipulating zzso signals, and that they might be dispersed using zzso zzso signals and zzso zzso could also be formed at specific locations where they might be engineered to make chemicals or treat human zzso
