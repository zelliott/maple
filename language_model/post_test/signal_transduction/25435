Development of visual system zzso requires the formation of precise synaptic connections between zzso in the zzso and zzso For example, zzso from retinal zzso cells zzso form zzso onto zzso within zzso of the lateral zzso nucleus zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso leaflet zzso zzso classes of zzso project to these zzso the zzso is zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso zzso To explore potential mechanisms regulating zzso zzso zzso we sought to identify zzso expressed targeting molecules in these zzso zzso One candidate targeting zzso enriched in the zzso and zzso during zzso circuit formation was the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling of zzso zzso in zzso mice lacking functional zzso zzso revealed reduced patterns of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in adjacent zzso zzso zzso Using genetic reporter mice, we further demonstrated that zzso zzso were from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from zzso zzso and layer VI cortical zzso correctly targeted the zzso in zzso zzso Together, these data reveal that zzso is essential for the targeting of zzso zzso by functionally distinct classes of zzso
