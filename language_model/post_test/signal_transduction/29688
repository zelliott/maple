zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is a notable feature of a large minority of cases of zzso melanoma, an aggressive and increasingly common zzso The identification of target genes downstream from this zzso is therefore crucial to our understanding of the zzso The zzso domain zzso factor zzso has been implicated in control of proliferation and melanoma survival, and its expression is strongly zzso in zzso We show here that in zzso zzso is expressed in zzso but not in embryonic day zzso zzso and that its expression is directly controlled by the zzso signaling zzso in melanoma cell lines and in transgenic zzso Moreover, silent interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression in melanoma cells zzso zzso results in significantly decreased zzso These results, together with the observation that zzso signaling also zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso is a focus for the convergence of two key zzso signaling pathways that are linked to cell zzso
