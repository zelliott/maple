To determine whether zzso zzso activity is essential for cell proliferation in response to zzso stimulation and to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on cell division and on processes that regulate cell cycle zzso 

Cell proliferation was zzso using a zzso method to determine the number of viable zzso zzso zzso of proteins was determined by zzso analysis, and expression of the proteins was analyzed by zzso zzso activity was determined by measuring the total zzso zzso 

When zzso were treated with zzso a prolonged and continuous zzso exposure was required for both zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso However, there was a long lag period between the zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso the maximum zzso activity was reached 8 h after zzso zzso but no cell proliferation was observed in the cells exposed to zzso for 8 zzso Using zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso we further demonstrated that zzso accounts for the zzso of total zzso zzso and cell proliferation zzso by zzso The role of zzso linking to the cell cycle was then determined by the zzso of zzso action on zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso both zzso zzso synthesis and zzso the nuclear import of the zzso from the zzso whereas it zzso the nuclear export of zzso to the zzso without affecting synthesis of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso completely zzso the zzso activity on zzso both at the synthetic level and at the level of zzso and the zzso zzso blocks the nuclear export of zzso 

These data indicate that zzso ultimately leads to zzso of the cell cycle machinery to induce cell proliferation zzso by zzso It does so by zzso zzso expression and by zzso the nuclear import of the zzso and nuclear export of the zzso inhibitor zzso to the zzso site, the zzso
