The effect of zzso shock on zzso was examined in isolated zzso of zzso a marine zzso using the molecular probe zzso zzso exposure to a reduced zzso caused an increase in cell zzso activity related to the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could contribute to this zzso zzso since zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso C and D could constitute key zzso in the mechanism since their zzso by specific agents altered the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso acid and zzso from the zzso zzso as well as calcium could participate in the zzso As regulatory volume decrease zzso exhibited by zzso zzso following zzso stimulation involves similar features, a potential role of zzso in volume regulation is zzso In particular, zzso could serve zzso by contributing to zzso release since this latter process similarly appeared to be zzso zzso and related to the zzso zzso This study provides the first evidence of a zzso zzso that could aim at volume constancy in a marine zzso fish cell zzso
