zzso T helper cells are playing critical roles in host defense to pathogens and in the maintenance of immune zzso zzso zzso cells, upon zzso recognition, receive signals to differentiate into distinct zzso T helper cell zzso characterized by their pattern of zzso production and specific immune zzso A tight balance between these different zzso ensures proper control of the immune zzso There is increasing evidence revealing an important role for zzso signaling in the regulation of zzso helper cell differentiation or function in the zzso However, the exact mechanisms involved remain unclear and appear zzso In this review, we zzso current knowledge and discuss recent advances in the field to reconcile different views on the role of zzso signaling in the differentiation of functional T helper zzso
