zzso zzso is an inevitable outcome of all kinds of progressive chronic kidney disease zzso Emerging data indicate that zzso can zzso kidney zzso by reducing the zzso infiltrates and zzso of extra cellular zzso zzso However, the cellular mechanism that regulates those changes has not been well understood zzso In this study, we revealed the persistent zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso zzso and zzso but rarely in injured zzso zzso cells, zzso T cells, zzso or zzso cells, during the development of kidney zzso Administration of zzso to unilateral zzso obstruction zzso mice significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso which decreased the inflammatory responses and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso presented less inflammatory activity than vehicle zzso In zzso study confirmed that zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso of cultured zzso zzso zzso which was induced by the stimulation of zzso Further experiment revealed that zzso did not directly inhibit the zzso of zzso cells with zzso acid zzso Our findings clarified that zzso can zzso kidney zzso by blocking the zzso signaling in zzso zzso and zzso
