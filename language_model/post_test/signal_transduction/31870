Clinical evidence indicates that zzso of zzso receptors zzso is mutually exclusive with zzso of zzso zzso in lung and colon zzso We have validated these observations using genetically engineered mouse zzso However, development of pancreatic zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso are totally dependent on zzso zzso Similar results were obtained using human pancreatic tumor cell zzso zzso were also essential even in the context of pancreatic injury and absence of zzso Only loss of zzso made pancreatic tumors independent of zzso zzso Additional zzso of zzso and zzso effectively prevented proliferation of zzso derived from these zzso pancreatic zzso These findings may provide the bases for more rational approaches to treat pancreatic tumors in the zzso
