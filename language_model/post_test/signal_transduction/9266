zzso signaling has been recognized as a key zzso to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of zzso stem cells zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso was designed to achieve the efficient zzso zzso recognition for the ex zzso proliferation of a bone zzso cell population containing zzso zzso A was chemically zzso onto zzso glass zzso followed by zzso a zzso zzso protein of zzso and zzso domain zzso through the zzso binding between protein A and zzso zzso zzso A zzso was suppressed for the zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso ones, indicating the zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso Mouse lineage negative cells zzso were cultured on the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells of an zzso population was significantly proliferated on the zzso zzso 6 days after culture, whereas no proliferation was observed for the zzso zzso in a random manner or zzso ones with a zzso signaling zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso of zzso increased the efficiency of zzso to recognize the zzso zzso resulting in the promoted ex zzso proliferation of the zzso zzso
