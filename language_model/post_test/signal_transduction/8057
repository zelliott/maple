We have previously demonstrated that zzso blockade with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the survival of zzso zzso rat to mouse zzso zzso Here, we examine whether signaling through the zzso zzso is required for the zzso therapy to prolong zzso zzso graft survival using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice received a cellular zzso zzso zzso under the left kidney capsule and four experimental groups were zzso Group I: zzso zzso group II: recipient mice were treated with three doses of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on days 0, 2 and 4; group zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso every other day for 8 zzso and finally group zzso mice received the combined treatment that consisted of zzso plus zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso transplanted in control zzso mice showed a median survival time zzso of 17 zzso zzso days, whereas zzso treatment led to a significant zzso of graft survival zzso 154 zzso zzso P zzso zzso The administration of zzso alone significantly accelerated graft rejection compared to zzso controls zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the combined administration of zzso and zzso reversed the protective effect obtained with zzso alone zzso zzso 154 zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Overall, our data indicate that the zzso zzso is required for the achievement of prolonged graft survival in zzso mice in a setting of rat to mouse zzso zzso zzso
