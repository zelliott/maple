Selective zzso of zzso zzso were developed to improve the safety of zzso therapy in patients at elevated risk for gastrointestinal complications which are thought to be caused primarily by depression of zzso derived zzso zzso They were not expected to be more zzso analgesics than compounds acting on both zzso the traditional zzso zzso zzso drugs zzso While these predictions were generally supported by clinical evidence, an elevated rate of severe cardiovascular complications was observed in zzso controlled trials of three chemically distinct zzso selective zzso The cardiovascular hazard is zzso explained by the depression of zzso dependent zzso formed in zzso and zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso contribute to zzso pressure zzso A drug development strategy more closely linking research into the biology of the drug target with clinical drug development may have allowed earlier recognition of these mechanisms and the cardiovascular risk of zzso zzso Open questions are zzso whether the gastrointestinal benefit of zzso selective compounds drugs can be zzso by identifying individuals at risk and excluding them from zzso zzso whether the risk extends to zzso zzso and whether alternative strategies to zzso therapy with a more advantageous zzso profile can be zzso
