zzso zzso is a mushroom extract derived from zzso cultivated zzso of the patented zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso which contains as its main zzso ingredient a family of zzso with zzso charge properties and molecular zzso zzso zzso is used as a dietary supplement by cancer patients and by individuals diagnosed with various chronic zzso Laboratory studies have shown that zzso zzso enhances immune functions and also zzso cellular responses to external zzso Recently, zzso zzso was also reported to exert potent zzso effects, evident by suppression of cell proliferation and induction of zzso in zzso zzso We investigate the mechanisms by which zzso zzso elicits these zzso 

Human leukemia zzso and zzso cells were incubated with increasing doses of zzso extracts of zzso zzso Control and treated cells were harvested at various times and analyzed for changes in: zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso cell cycle phase transition, zzso induction of zzso zzso expression of cell cycle, zzso and zzso regulatory zzso 

zzso extracts of zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso and zzso cells, accompanied by a cell zzso disruption of the zzso and zzso zzso of cell cycle zzso A more pronounced growth suppression was observed in treated zzso cells, which was correlated with zzso and zzso down regulation of the zzso protein zzso diminution in the expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso increase in zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso from its native zzso form to the zzso truncated zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso cells also showed a substantial decrease in zzso and to a lesser degree zzso forms of zzso factor zzso which was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso also zzso an increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso decrease in the expression of activated form of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso in the expression of zzso and zzso signaling regulatory proteins in human leukemia cells, the net result being suppression of proliferation and increase in zzso These findings may contribute to the reported clinical and overall health effects of zzso zzso
