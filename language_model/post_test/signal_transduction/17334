The zzso growth factor zzso is involved in breast and zzso cancer zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the coding region and short zzso borders of the insulin zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso genes in 12 cell lines derived from breast cancer zzso 14 cell lines derived from zzso and 33 primary zzso The zzso zzso identified in BC were 3 in zzso 1 of which zzso was novel and with a zzso potential as predicted by in zzso analysis and 6 in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and 18 in zzso were identified in the zzso zzso These included 11 novel zzso zzso detected exclusively in zzso which included 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso potential as predicted by in zzso analysis, 2 zzso predicted to generate a truncated zzso 1 zzso zzso and 3 silent zzso In the zzso samples we also identified 7 novel zzso zzso including 4 zzso zzso which included 2 zzso and zzso with a zzso potential as predicted by in zzso analysis, 2 frame zzso zzso and 1 silent zzso Most of the novel zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso or zzso functions and could be relevant to breast and zzso zzso
