The avian inner ear possesses a remarkable capacity for the zzso of sensory receptors after acoustic trauma or zzso Most replacement hair cells are created by renewed cell division within the sensory zzso although some new hair cells may also arise through zzso zzso Current data indicate that zzso supporting cells play an essential role in zzso by serving as zzso zzso In order to become zzso however, supporting cells may need to undergo partial zzso In this review, I describe molecules that are expressed by supporting cells in the avian zzso Although a number of these molecules are likely to be critical to the maintenance of the supporting cell zzso we presently know very little about zzso changes in supporting cells during the early phase of zzso
