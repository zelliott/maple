zzso is known to prime zzso for zzso zzso in response to zzso and other zzso We have employed the technique of zzso zzso to study the potential role of zzso the common zzso of the beta zzso family of zzso zzso in the regulation of the respiratory burst, as measured by zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso primed zzso to activate the respiratory burst after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso (1 zzso but not zzso zzso factor zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso was enhanced zzso zzso and zzso respectively, following zzso zzso zzso of the respiratory burst by direct engagement of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso experiments, where zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso was increased 15-, zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso was both accelerated and more intense in zzso after zzso of zzso Major zzso zzso products include proteins with approximate molecular masses of 40, 70, and 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso respiratory burst by zzso zzso whether or not zzso was zzso These results affirm the importance of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso functions and demonstrate that zzso engagement per zzso is sufficient to prime zzso for zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso zzso
