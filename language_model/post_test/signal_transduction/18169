Although the heart is one of the target zzso of insulin, it is still unknown whether the effect of insulin on cardiac muscle is preserved in essential hypertension, where insulin resistance has been observed in skeletal zzso 

We evaluated cardiac zzso zzso and the early steps of insulin zzso in spontaneously zzso zzso zzso weeks old) and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g per zzso was assessed by zzso zzso After an overnight fast, 16 zzso rats and 17 zzso underwent a zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso intravenous zzso infusion of insulin (10 zzso per zzso or saline zzso zzso was zzso followed by an zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso to measure cardiac zzso zzso 

During saline infusion, cardiac zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso rats (85 zzso 18 versus 8 zzso 3 zzso per zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, insulin was able to markedly increase cardiac zzso zzso in zzso rats whereas this insulin action was entirely abolished in zzso thus, the cardiac zzso zzso became similar in the two rat strains zzso zzso 16 versus 82 zzso 16 zzso per zzso not zzso More importantly, during saline infusion zzso showed a significantly higher zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso coupled to enhanced association of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and to an increased zzso zzso activity compared to zzso zzso As expected, insulin exposure evoked an zzso of its zzso cascade in zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso the hormone failed to activate zzso molecular zzso 

Our data indicate that the heart of zzso shows an zzso of the zzso steps of insulin zzso which cannot be further increased by the exposure to the zzso This zzso may account for the marked increase of zzso cardiac zzso zzso and the loss of zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso
