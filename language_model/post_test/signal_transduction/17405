zzso immune zzso is a major complication of zzso therapy zzso for zzso infection and can cause a devastating immune zzso inflammatory syndrome zzso in the zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso in this population is not well zzso We found zzso protein and zzso zzso cells in the brain of an individual with zzso zzso was also present in the zzso of individuals zzso controlled on zzso Hence we examined if zzso protein could directly activate T zzso zzso zzso zzso 94 genes and induced zzso of 11 zzso particularly zzso of zzso signaling pathways supporting the development of a zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso in T zzso zzso entered the T cells rapidly by zzso zzso and localized to both the zzso and the zzso zzso activated T cells through a zzso zzso dependent upon vascular zzso growth factor zzso and downstream secondary signaling pathways but independent of the zzso zzso However, zzso stimulation of T cells did not induce zzso proliferation but increased viral zzso This study demonstrates zzso role as a zzso factor, by driving zzso zzso and contributing to zzso zzso This supports the necessity of an zzso therapy in conjunction with ART and identifies multiple zzso pathways to prevent zzso zzso zzso
