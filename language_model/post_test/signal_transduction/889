zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso in mice shares zzso features with a zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of acute cellular zzso rejection in a strain of mice with a targeted gene disruption of the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso protein zzso These mice have been shown to have markedly impaired zzso zzso 

The zzso and normal mice were transplanted with 2 zzso of fetal zzso zzso cell clusters zzso under the left kidney zzso On days 3, 6 or 12 after transplantation the mice were killed and the zzso either prepared for zzso or real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The number of remaining zzso and zzso cells with different zzso characteristics was assessed zzso zzso used for quantitative zzso were zzso for content of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

On day 3, the rejection process was initiated in both zzso and normal mice as characterized by a moderate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and occasional zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was lower but still zzso in the zzso mice, when compared with control zzso By day 6, rejection was almost completed in all animals with only few zzso zzso 12 days after transplantation all zzso were completely destroyed and heavily infiltrated by zzso zzso numbers of zzso and zzso and occasional zzso cells were also zzso 

zzso zzso rejection was found to persist in zzso zzso Despite a relatively lower expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso area, both the time course and zzso pattern of the rejection were essentially similar to that found in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be a crucial component of acute cellular zzso zzso
