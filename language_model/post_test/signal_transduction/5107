zzso zzso muscular zzso type zzso zzso is a zzso disease associated with severe disability and shortened zzso Previous studies have shown reduced zzso and restored skeletal muscle zzso following treatment with zzso an zzso II type I zzso zzso We therefore evaluated the effect of zzso treatment in the zzso zzso mouse model of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and control mice were treated with zzso or zzso for 12 weeks from 6 weeks of zzso zzso measures included zzso and zzso muscle strength by Grip zzso zzso and quantitative muscle zzso zzso zzso effects on transforming growth factor zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways were evaluated with Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso treatment was associated with significant impressive improvement in muscle strength and zzso of zzso Administration of zzso inhibited zzso signaling pathway, resulting in decreased serum zzso level and reduced downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activated zzso zzso a key negative regulator of zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment inhibited the zzso cascade as shown by decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 in the treated zzso 

zzso a commonly prescribed US Food and Drug zzso medication for hypertension, demonstrated clinical improvement and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso mouse model of zzso via zzso and zzso signaling zzso The results of this study support pursuing a clinical trial of zzso treatment in children with zzso
