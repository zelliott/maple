The role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso remains to be zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso and to clarify the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

This study investigated zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso status of zzso promoter zzso in 12 zzso and compared the findings with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso traditional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was moderately decreased in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso of zzso but zzso zzso of zzso was lost in only zzso zzso of zzso No zzso zzso was detected in any of 12 zzso and only one zzso was found to be positive for zzso gene zzso Complete zzso of zzso promoter zzso was found in zzso zzso of zzso but in no zzso or zzso 

zzso of zzso promoter zzso instead of zzso involving zzso and zzso contributes to moderate zzso of zzso zzso in a subset of zzso
