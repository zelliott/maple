The roots of many plant species are known to use zzso zzso in the form of , as a cue to initiate localized root proliferation within zzso patches of zzso We report here that, at zzso zzso and in a zzso manner, zzso zzso is also able to elicit complex changes in zzso root zzso zzso is perceived specifically at the primary root tip and zzso zzso activity in the root zzso zzso but does not interfere with lateral root initiation or zzso Only some time after emergence do lateral roots acquire zzso sensitivity, indicating that their ability to respond to zzso is zzso zzso Comparisons between different zzso zzso revealed a remarkable degree of natural variation in zzso sensitivity, with zzso being the most zzso The zzso zzso transport zzso had reduced zzso sensitivity, suggesting a possible interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, two zzso zzso at the zzso locus zzso and zzso were hypersensitive to zzso A pharmacological approach, using zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to provide evidence of a role for their plant zzso in sensing zzso zzso We discuss the mechanism of zzso sensing and the possible ecological significance of the observed zzso changes in root zzso
