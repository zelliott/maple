zzso necrosis zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso released from activated zzso in response to particulate debris greatly impact zzso bone loss and zzso implant zzso In the present study, we found that a major zzso component of green tea, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso release in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The zzso stimulation of zzso released zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and zzso substantially suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of signaling zzso showed that zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso degradation, and consequently the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In a mouse zzso zzso model, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso by suppressing zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a potential candidate compound for zzso prevention and treatment as well as zzso loosening after total replacement zzso
