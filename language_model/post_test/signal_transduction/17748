zzso zzso prevents cell zzso and promotes survival, but the involved mechanisms have not been completely zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso survival mechanisms, none of the 3 chains of the zzso zzso zzso expresses a binding site for zzso zzso However, zzso does express a zzso zzso By using an zzso natural killer zzso cell line, followed by validation of the results in fresh human zzso cells, we identified zzso as a critical zzso essential for zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso treatment impaired zzso cellular viability and induced prominent zzso as effectively as suppression of zzso zzso function by zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso markedly suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso is upstream of zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso active zzso zzso reversed this loss of zzso function caused by zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso appears to regulate zzso zzso which controls zzso activity during zzso zzso More important, we observed zzso zzso by zzso and found that it zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso This conclusion came from experiments in which zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso active zzso zzso zzso activity not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results constitute the first report of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal cascade controlled by zzso that mediates zzso cell zzso
