Although zzso zzso has been associated with insulin resistance, little is known regarding the effects of zzso on insulin sensitivity in humans in zzso Here, we show that zzso infusion increases zzso disposal without affecting the complete suppression of zzso zzso production during a zzso clamp in healthy zzso Because skeletal muscle accounts for most of the zzso zzso disposal in zzso we examined the zzso by which zzso may affect muscle metabolism using zzso zzso zzso treatment increased fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso rapidly and markedly increased zzso protein zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso of zzso zzso cellular zzso events, we conducted experiments using zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso The effects described above were zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that acute zzso treatment enhances zzso zzso disposal in humans in zzso while the effects of zzso on zzso and fatty acid metabolism in zzso appear to be zzso by zzso
