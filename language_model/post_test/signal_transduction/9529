Previous studies have identified the zzso role that the programmed death 1 zzso zzso plays during chronic zzso zzso of this zzso results in rescue of zzso zzso T cells, as well as reduction of viral loads in mice chronically infected with zzso zzso virus zzso We tested the effect of combining zzso zzso 1 zzso blockade with an zzso regimen that zzso zzso zzso during chronic zzso zzso There is a boosting effect in the rescue of zzso zzso T cell responses after dual treatment with zzso blockade and zzso zzso zzso when the amount and timing of zzso zzso are carefully zzso When zzso zzso are given together with a single low dose of zzso zzso zzso there is an enhanced and stable expansion of zzso zzso T zzso zzso when blocking zzso to zzso are given with a repetitive high dose of zzso there is an initial synergistic expansion of zzso zzso T cells by day 7, followed by dramatic zzso by day zzso zzso control paralleled zzso T cell zzso after dual zzso By day 7 zzso viral zzso were lower in both of the combined regimens zzso with zzso blockade zzso However, whereas the high dose of zzso plus zzso blockade resulted in rebound of viral zzso to original levels, the low dose of zzso plus zzso blockade resulted in a stable reduction of viral zzso These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully manipulating the balance between zzso and zzso signals to enhance T cell responses during chronic zzso
