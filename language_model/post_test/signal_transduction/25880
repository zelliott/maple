zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso protein has previously been implicated in the signaling of various zzso zzso receptors including the zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso and zzso all important components in the signaling cascade governing T cell function and zzso A zzso knockout mouse was recently generated and the aim of the current study was to address the importance of zzso zzso on T cell development and zzso 

zzso knockout mice did not display any major changes in zzso development despite an zzso zzso signaling pattern, including increased zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso The loss of zzso expression did however affect peripheral zzso zzso cells resulting in an increased zzso response to zzso stimulation and an elevated zzso production of zzso zzso zzso This suggests a zzso skewing of the zzso knockout immune system, seemingly caused by an altered zzso signaling zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso appears to play an important modulating role on zzso zzso thus regulating the peripheral zzso zzso cell zzso
