The zzso process that characterizes idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso is commonly considered the result of a zzso injury to the zzso zzso followed by an uncontrolled proliferation of zzso However, based on considerable scientific evidence, it has been recently hypothesized that zzso might be considered a zzso disorder of the lung because this disease exhibits several zzso features similar to zzso Indeed, zzso and genetic zzso altered zzso communications, uncontrolled zzso and abnormal zzso of specific signal zzso pathways are biological hallmarks that characterize the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso remains a disease marked by a survival of 3 years, and little therapeutic progress has been made in the last few years, underlining the urgent need to improve research and to change our approach to the comprehension of this zzso The concept of zzso as a zzso disease may be helpful in identifying new zzso mechanisms that can be borrowed from cancer biology, potentially leading to different and more effective therapeutic zzso Such vision will hopefully increase the awareness of this disease among the public and the scientific zzso
