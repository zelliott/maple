Previous studies indicated that zzso zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and increased zzso activity in zzso zzso cells of healthy zzso We hypothesized that these processes might be reflected in the expression of zzso soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso activity, which signal the initial and final steps of the zzso pathway, zzso We found that healthy carriers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso activity than zzso controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity was similar in women with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration was significantly higher in women with zzso than in controls and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso During zzso four of 80 zzso zzso carriers developed breast zzso These women showed a significantly higher zzso activity and somewhat higher zzso zzso than the other 76 zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All tumors were negative for zzso hormone zzso but showed a high zzso zzso This study was limited by the short-term follow-up zzso 27 zzso range, zzso which resulted in a small sample zzso Women with zzso and zzso zzso that had undergone zzso bilateral zzso zzso showed significantly lower zzso compared with those without surgery zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether zzso and zzso zzso may be useful for identifying healthy zzso carriers with high risk of developing breast zzso moreover, zzso zzso may serve as effective tools for assessing risk before and after zzso
