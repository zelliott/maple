To obtain an zzso zzso against human growth hormone receptors zzso we prepared zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso exhibited binding activity to intact human zzso cells and effectively zzso the receptors in cell zzso zzso competitively inhibited zzso growth hormone zzso binding to the zzso The zzso activity of zzso was assessed in terms of zzso zzso zzso degradation, and zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso alone did not cause zzso or degradation of zzso but a zzso dilution of zzso fluid almost completely inhibited zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso and degradation of surface zzso Moreover, zzso alone did not stimulate the zzso of zzso used as an indicator of zzso zzso zzso zzso but almost completely inhibited zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as a specific zzso of zzso
