Since people in zzso countries spend most of their time indoors, the effects of indoor zzso such as volatile organic compounds become more and more zzso zzso and zzso are among the most abundant compounds in the highly zzso group of indoor volatile organic zzso In order to understand their effects on lung zzso cells zzso representing zzso first line of defense, we chose a global zzso and a targeted zzso approach in order to detect adverse outcome pathways caused by exposure to zzso and zzso Using a zzso approach, 93 of 469 detected protein spots were found to be zzso expressed after exposure to zzso and 79 of these spots were identified by zzso zzso analysis revealed an enrichment of proteins involved in zzso and zzso stress response zzso The occurrence of zzso stress at zzso toxic zzso of zzso and zzso was confirmed by the zzso of the stress related proteins zzso and zzso The changes in metabolism were validated by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealing significant changes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The molecular zzso identified as a result of zzso and zzso exposure demonstrate the zzso effect of zzso toxic zzso on lung zzso zzso The data provided here will allow for a targeted validation in in zzso zzso
