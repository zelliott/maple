Two wheat varieties zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso acid zzso or zzso and then artificially zzso with zzso suspension of zzso zzso to study its influence in reducing zzso zzso zzso infection by regulating zzso gene zzso zzso was found to improve the plant defense against zzso as its zzso application resulted in decrease in zzso of infection zzso in both susceptible and resistant varieties following pathogen zzso zzso profiling of wheat zzso genes at different days after zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso positively induced zzso gene expression in both varieties with greater induction of expression in resistant variety than the susceptible one zzso zzso Different zzso expression of three wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed with their increased expression at zzso in the boot emergence stage which is most susceptible to zzso and then slowly declined gradually at 3, 7 and 15 zzso in both the zzso Except zzso higher expression of other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso showed higher response zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso boot emergence stage as also evident by decrease of zzso in both zzso The results of determination of specific activity of zzso by inhibitor zzso were found to be consistent with those of transcript zzso These findings suggest that zzso acid zzso may act as a potential zzso of induced resistance against zzso zzso of wheat by zzso zzso gene zzso
