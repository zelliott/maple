The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso commonly promotes zzso instability in many zzso Although most studies of zzso focus on its role in zzso some recent work identified unexpected zzso activities of zzso Among these, a role for zzso zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso in zzso cells has highlighted a role in regulating cellular responsiveness to growth factors and mechanical zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso involves interactions with multiple partner proteins and is not well zzso particularly in zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso at the zzso body in zzso zzso requires interactions with zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso are important zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso binding is required for zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso of zzso activity reduces interaction between zzso and its zzso zzso Finally, zzso derivatives of zzso impaired for zzso binding and/or zzso zzso cause defects in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results define zzso as important regulators of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
