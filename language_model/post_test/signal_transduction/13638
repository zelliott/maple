zzso injections into the central nucleus of the zzso zzso inhibit food intake but this response is lost quickly on feeding a high fat zzso The purpose of the studies described in this manuscript was to identify the potential mechanism for the development of this insulin zzso High fat diets zzso induced zzso zzso and blocked the stimulation of zzso but not zzso zzso in the zzso in response to zzso insulin zzso zzso of zzso acid onto the zzso had identical effects to zzso on zzso expression and insulin signaling in the zzso zzso insulin also induced an increase in zzso zzso in the zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso Feeding zzso but not zzso zzso infusions reversed the zzso zzso signaling response to zzso zzso These data, which show the independence of zzso and zzso signaling responses to insulin in the zzso and the effect of insulin signaling in the zzso on zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso might also have a significant role in regulating zzso responses to dietary zzso
