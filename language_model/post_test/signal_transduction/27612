zzso a 98 zzso acid protein zzso by the fungus zzso zzso zzso a hypersensitive response and systemic acquired resistance in tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso zzso The mode of action of zzso has been studied using tobacco cell zzso The recognition of this zzso by a plasma membrane zzso leads to a cascade of events including protein zzso calcium influx, zzso and zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso of a zzso zzso responsible for active oxygen species zzso production and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, and zzso of two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The organization of the zzso responses reveals that the earliest steps of the signal zzso zzso involve plasma membrane zzso Their zzso generates a complex network of second zzso which triggers the specific zzso zzso This study may contribute to our understanding of plant signaling processes because zzso and a variety of signals including hormones, zzso factors, light, gravity and stresses share some common zzso elements and zzso
