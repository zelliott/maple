Whether zzso zzso cells are a distinct lineage derived from committed zzso precursors or arise from zzso B-2 cells in response to zzso zzso and other, unknown signals remains zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso cells can derive from adult precursors expressing an appropriate specificity when the zzso zzso is zzso zzso specificity determines whether a B cell expressing zzso zzso has a zzso zzso or marginal zone zzso zzso zzso cells share many zzso characteristics of zzso cells and, like them, appear to develop in response to T independent type 2 zzso Because zzso B cell zzso fail to express terminal zzso zzso zzso and for other reasons, they are likely to express a repertoire that allows selection into the zzso zzso As it is selected by zzso the zzso repertoire tends to be zzso This potentially dangerous repertoire is also useful, as zzso cells are essential for resistance to several pathogens and they play an important role in zzso zzso The zzso zzso can function as a negative regulator of zzso signaling that may help prevent inappropriate zzso of zzso zzso zzso
