This review describes some of the properties of zzso acid zzso in its functions as a locally zzso differentiation factor for the developing nervous zzso The emphasis is on the characterization of the zzso zzso that zzso and zzso zzso and which determine local zzso zzso These zzso create regions of zzso and zzso zzso signaling in the zzso One mechanism by which zzso can act as a differentiation agent is through the induction of growth factors and their zzso zzso of growth factor receptors in neural zzso cells can lead to growth factor dependency, and the zzso zzso fate of the cell will depend on the local availability of growth zzso Because zzso activates the early events of cell zzso which then induce zzso differentiation programs, zzso may be called a master differentiation zzso
