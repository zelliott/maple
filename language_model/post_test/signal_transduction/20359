zzso mediate dual zzso and zzso shuttling zzso While the former is required for zzso zzso linked to insulin zzso the role of the latter in zzso cell function has not been well zzso primarily because the molecular identity of the zzso zzso zzso were elusive and the selectivity of their zzso was zzso This study focuses on zzso the recently discovered zzso zzso zzso that is linked to zzso zzso in zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso either of zzso zzso using a zzso construct zzso or of its activity, by a dominant negative construct zzso enhanced zzso zzso influx and blocked zzso induced by zzso or by cell zzso In addition, zzso regulated zzso but not zzso changes, in zzso rate, zzso membrane potential and zzso resting zzso zzso zzso controlled the rate and zzso of zzso zzso changes induced by zzso or high zzso indicating that zzso is a critical and rate limiting component in the cross talk between zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso expression was followed by a delay in zzso insulin zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso shapes zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals thereby regulating the zzso pattern of insulin zzso in zzso zzso
