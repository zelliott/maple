To compare the varieties and contents of the main zzso information molecules in zzso from zzso zzso zzso area zzso of the rats in different sexual cycles and the zzso rats treated by zzso so as to observe the similarities and differences of zzso neuroendocrine signal zzso zzso under the zzso and pathological status, and to explore the mechanisms of neuroendocrine signal zzso of zzso therapeutic effect in zzso zzso 

The stereo zzso technique and zzso zzso of the rat brain nucleus were adopted for collecting the zzso zzso zzso of the female rats with normal sexual cycle, and also for collecting the zzso zzso of zzso rats after zzso treatment as acupuncture zzso zzso After being respectively zzso into zzso of the zzso rats, the influence of the different zzso on zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso level was zzso The contents of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of each group were detected by zzso or high performance liquid zzso and then the varieties and contents of these substances in the zzso of each group were compared and zzso 

The contents of neural active substances including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso from the zzso zzso during different stages of sexual cycle showed some regular zzso After the zzso was zzso respectively into the zzso of the zzso rats, the changes of animal zzso zzso cells and serum zzso level showed the similar zzso cycle characteristics as normal zzso the changes of zzso zzso cells and serum zzso level of the zzso rats without zzso treatment showed the zzso effects following the zzso of zzso in the zzso 

The information molecules in the zzso from zzso of rats in normal sexual cycle or zzso rats include classical zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso may zzso the release and synthesis of these information molecules to zzso the zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a neuroendocrine signal carrier of acupuncture effects for acupuncture signal zzso from one individual to zzso This may provide a new thinking and method for studying acupuncture signal zzso of the acupuncture therapeutic effects on zzso zzso
