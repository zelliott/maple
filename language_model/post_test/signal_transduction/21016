zzso is an orphan zzso that belongs to a family of zzso zzso receptors for either zzso growth factor zzso or zzso differentiation factor zzso Because zzso of the zzso zzso is frequently associated with an aggressive clinical course of certain human zzso the zzso protein is an attractive target for zzso Indeed, certain zzso zzso zzso to zzso effectively inhibit tumor growth in animal models and in clinical trials, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely zzso To study this question, we generated a large battery of zzso to zzso that were classified zzso Whereas most zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso their zzso effect correlated with its accelerated zzso zzso One group of zzso zzso zzso II zzso was zzso by the most zzso site of zzso and inhibited in trans binding of zzso and zzso to their direct zzso The zzso effect was due to acceleration of zzso zzso and it resulted in the reduction of the ability of zzso to zzso the zzso signals of zzso and zzso These results identify two potential mechanisms of zzso therapy: acceleration of zzso zzso by zzso and blocking of zzso between zzso and growth factor zzso
