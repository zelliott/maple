Like the zzso zzso the zzso adult zzso is constantly replenished by zzso zzso stem cells zzso Although it is well known that adult zzso arise from adult zzso zzso zzso relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that Broad zzso hormone signaling regulates zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso temporally during the zzso transition stage, and br loss of function blocks zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is required for zzso to develop into functional zzso zzso br zzso drives zzso toward premature zzso In addition, we found that zzso and zzso zzso signaling function in parallel pathways to regulate zzso zzso Our results reveal a molecular mechanism zzso zzso hormone signaling directly regulates stem cells to generate adult cells during zzso
