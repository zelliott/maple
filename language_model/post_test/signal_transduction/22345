An zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been observed to decrease zzso and insulin levels in animal models, but the cellular mechanisms by which insulin action is enhanced in zzso are not precisely zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso to zzso gene expression and cellular signaling through the insulin zzso in skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso male zzso mice were zzso to a diet zzso mixed with zzso zzso zzso or diet alone for 8 zzso Food zzso zzso zzso and insulin were assessed over the study, and at study zzso zzso zzso muscle was obtained to assess insulin signaling parameters and gene zzso Animals zzso to zzso zzso were shown to have enhanced insulin sensitivity and increased insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso activity and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle when compared to control animals zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression for insulin signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not increased, although a relative increase in protein abundance was noted with zzso zzso zzso Gene expression for specific zzso proteins and specific zzso zzso activity, in addition to skeletal muscle zzso activity, zzso zzso activity, was significantly decreased in mice zzso to zzso zzso relative to zzso Thus, the data demonstrate that zzso zzso increases insulin sensitivity and enhances insulin zzso signaling in an animal model of insulin zzso zzso zzso may zzso skeletal muscle protein degradation and zzso activity as a possible mode of zzso
