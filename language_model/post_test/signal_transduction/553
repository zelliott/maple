Growth hormone zzso is found in the zzso and zzso of the chick zzso where it appears to act as a growth and differentiation factor, having zzso effects on retinal zzso cells zzso Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of the zzso effect of zzso in chick zzso zzso treatment of zzso reduces zzso levels, while raising zzso levels, consistent with a role for zzso signaling pathways in the zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso by zzso with zzso zzso is accompanied by an increase in zzso and zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso zzso also appears to be a major zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso in these cells, supporting the view that zzso and zzso zzso are major zzso agents for zzso and that pathways that activate both zzso and zzso are important for the zzso actions of zzso in these zzso These pathways involve the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso involves downstream zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso pathways appear to zzso on the zzso of zzso response element binding protein zzso which is able to initiate zzso of zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that the action of zzso in the zzso of embryonic zzso involves pathways common to with other zzso and that zzso can be considered to be a growth and differentiation factor in the development of the embryonic zzso We have also investigated the relationship between the overlapping zzso effects of zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso two functionally closely related zzso We find that simultaneous zzso of zzso and IGF-1 does not increase the level of zzso in the cultures above that achieved by zzso of zzso zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso actions of zzso in the developing zzso are likely zzso in large part through the action of zzso
