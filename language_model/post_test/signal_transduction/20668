Giant cell tumor of bone zzso is an aggressive bone tumor consisting of zzso zzso giant cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso The signaling mechanism involved in zzso zzso cell zzso differentiation is not fully zzso Previous work in our lab reported that zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso a master zzso factor in skeletal development, which in turn zzso zzso expression and prevents terminal zzso differentiation in these zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the upstream regulation of zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells obtained from patient zzso we demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling plays an essential role in bone development and promotes differentiation of immature zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso stimulates zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso expression and increased zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso through zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our study also confirmed that zzso zzso activates downstream zzso signaling and pharmacological zzso of the zzso signaling zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso differentiation in these zzso Our results indicate a significant role of zzso signaling in zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso
