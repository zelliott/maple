Active metabolism regulates zzso cell death via zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso of zzso but the link between zzso activity and zzso is poorly zzso Here we identify zzso A zzso as the key zzso signal that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by directly zzso zzso We found that zzso directly binds to the zzso regulatory domain in the absence of zzso to activate zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso zzso not only in zzso zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso These findings uncover a direct mechanism of zzso regulation by metabolism and further highlight the importance of metabolism in preserving zzso zzso
