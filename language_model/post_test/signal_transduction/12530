The large zzso zzso zzso or BK channel has a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso the onset of BK during development zzso with increased hearing sensitivity and zzso frequency tuning in zzso whereas its role is less clear in zzso zzso To gain insights into BK function in zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso combined with mass zzso were used to reveal 174 putative zzso from zzso and zzso zzso of mouse zzso Eleven zzso were verified using zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso These proteins were zzso with BK in sensory and zzso zzso A zzso approach was used to mine databases to reveal zzso partners and the zzso protein network, as well as to determine previous zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso The search for zzso partners using the zzso molecular interaction database produced a putative global network of 160 zzso connected with 188 edges that contained 12 major zzso Additional mining of databases revealed that more than 50% of primary zzso had prior affiliations with zzso and zzso zzso Although a majority of zzso are found in either the zzso or membrane and contribute to cellular processes that primarily involve metabolism zzso and zzso zzso at least zzso are zzso Among the zzso are zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso that, when reduced with zzso alter zzso expression in zzso zzso Studies of zzso in zzso revealed zzso in sensory cells, whereas zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso cloned from zzso revealed a BK zzso zzso The studies described zzso provide insights into zzso functions that include not only cell zzso but also cell signaling and zzso and involve proteins concerned with zzso regulation, structure, and hearing zzso
