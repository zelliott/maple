Some major zzso processes in zzso zzso cells, zzso in response to zzso zzso are modulated via zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso and accelerated proliferation of zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these regulatory zzso Generation of zzso in cultured rat zzso cells was inhibited by selective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed zzso synthesis of DNA in zzso cells, but 1 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso to suppress zzso incorporation or zzso generation paralleled zzso values for zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with either zzso alone or with zzso alone increased significantly in zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells, assessed by zzso zzso activity ratio, and the zzso effects were zzso zzso indicate that in zzso cells a zzso pool that is zzso by zzso activates zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso another zzso pool that is zzso by zzso activates another zzso zzso or zzso which suppresses proliferation of zzso zzso We propose that in zzso cells, a zzso zzso that regulates zzso is determined by activity of zzso whereas another zzso zzso is directed by activity of zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso within one cell type zzso distinct zzso signaling zzso
