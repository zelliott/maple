The abnormal zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is strongly related to the development of diabetic complications by affecting the metabolism and functions of zzso and zzso These disturbances could modify the cell response to hormones and growth factors, including zzso growth zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation and the mechanism of the effect in two cell lines, a human embryonic kidney cell line zzso and a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso rendered these cells resistant to the zzso action of zzso and this was associated with stronger and prolonged zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The synergistic effect of zzso with zzso in zzso of zzso was completely abolished by zzso but not by a specific zzso zzso zzso or a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by expression of a dominant negative form of zzso did not reduce the enhancing effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso of a zzso inactive form of zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and partial zzso of the enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso induced by zzso of zzso and zzso These results suggested that the zzso of zzso milieu induced by zzso through a zzso and zzso zzso resulted in the modification of cell response to zzso for zzso growth arrest, which may be one of the crucial mechanisms for zzso to promote the development of chronic clinical complications in zzso
