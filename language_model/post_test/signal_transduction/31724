Although high zzso density is considered one of the strongest risk factors for invasive breast cancer, the genes involved in modulating this clinical feature are zzso zzso of high zzso density share key zzso features with zzso components within zzso zzso of tumor zzso specifically low zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso a zzso zzso that zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and immune zzso is greatly zzso in multiple cell types of zzso zzso associated with high zzso density and tumor zzso Using both in zzso and in zzso zzso we show that zzso repression is necessary and sufficient to zzso the zzso zzso observed in high zzso density and tumor zzso zzso with a functional role for this coordinated program in zzso we observe that clinical outcomes are strongly associated with zzso zzso 

zzso simultaneously controls zzso content and zzso zzso and is zzso zzso in multiple cell types within tumor and high zzso density zzso suggesting that zzso of this zzso program is an early event in zzso zzso of zzso and extent of zzso density are both modifiable factors that provide potential for zzso
