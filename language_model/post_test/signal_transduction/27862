Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been expressed as full-length proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both proteins zzso to generate the corresponding active zzso and both are lethal to the zzso zzso zzso is due to zzso activity since the expression of the inactive zzso forms of both zzso does not result in an obvious zzso zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso of the zzso protein zzso a known inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso another zzso zzso does not prevent the cell death induced by either zzso However, zzso is itself zzso by both zzso and zzso at two adjacent recognition sites, zzso and zzso respectively, immediately downstream from the zzso zzso domain, a region of zzso which is essential for its zzso zzso similar zzso of zzso by zzso has been demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso key elements of the zzso zzso can be reliably zzso in zzso zzso opening the way to exploit zzso in order to study the control of zzso Furthermore, the activity of zzso although not zzso can be demonstrated in zzso using zzso zzso This offers the possibility of using zzso strains of zzso to screen for chemical zzso either in zzso or in zzso
