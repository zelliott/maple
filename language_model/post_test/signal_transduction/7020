zzso affects the majority of patients with advanced cancer and is associated with a reduction in treatment zzso response to therapy, and duration of zzso One impediment towards the effective treatment of zzso is a validated zzso zzso 

41 patients with zzso upper gastrointestinal zzso or pancreatic cancer underwent zzso for zzso based on weight-loss zzso and/or low zzso zzso Four diagnostic criteria were used zzso zzso zzso and zzso All patients underwent biopsy of the zzso zzso Analysis included zzso for zzso size and type, protein and zzso acid zzso Western blots for markers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Compared with zzso cancer patients, patients with zzso or zzso mean muscle zzso diameter was reduced by about zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant difference in zzso diameter was observed if patients had zzso zzso Regardless of zzso there was no difference in zzso number or proportion of zzso type across all zzso heavy chain zzso Mean muscle protein content was reduced and the ratio of zzso decreased in patients with either zzso or zzso Compared with zzso patients, zzso protein levels were increased in patients with zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were zzso There were no differences in zzso or zzso levels across any of the zzso 

Muscle zzso size, zzso composition and zzso zzso can vary according to whether the diagnostic criteria for zzso are based on weight loss alone, a measure of low zzso alone or a combination of the zzso For intervention trials where the primary zzso is a change in muscle mass or function, use of combined diagnostic criteria may allow identification of a more homogeneous patient zzso reduce the sample size required and enhance the time scale within which trials can be zzso
