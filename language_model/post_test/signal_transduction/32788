The recently discovered family of zzso zzso of G protein zzso proteins acts as zzso zzso proteins which bind to alpha zzso of zzso G zzso We previously showed that a zzso zzso zzso speeds up the zzso and zzso zzso of the G zzso inward zzso zzso channel zzso upon zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Nakata, zzso (1997) Nature zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a full-length rat zzso of another zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso study revealed that zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso cells within zzso cell layer of zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso protein binds zzso to zzso zzso and zzso When zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso accelerate G zzso zzso of zzso zzso clearly accelerated zzso of zzso current similarly with zzso but the acceleration effect of zzso was significantly weaker than that of zzso These acceleration properties of zzso proteins may play important roles in the rapid regulation of zzso zzso and the cellular responses to short-lived zzso
