Plants adjust their development in relation to the availability of zzso zzso This zzso signaling between root and zzso Aside from the well-known systemic signaling processes zzso by zzso zzso and zzso new pathways involving zzso hormones have recently been zzso The zzso zzso zzso controls shoot branching through the zzso of zzso in the zzso The zzso gene affects the production of an zzso unknown zzso substance in roots that promotes shoot zzso Novel local and systemic mechanisms that control zzso root development in response to nitrogen and zzso zzso were recently zzso zzso the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to transport zzso drew for the first time a functional link between zzso root development, and nitrate availability in zzso The study of plant response to zzso zzso allowed the identification of a systemic mobile zzso Deciphering and zzso these signaling pathways at the zzso level provide a new perspective for understanding how plants regulate their development in response to environmental zzso
