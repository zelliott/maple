There is growing evidence linking zzso in zzso signaling in the prefrontal zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are richly zzso by zzso fibers and express high levels of zzso zzso zzso It is zzso however, how zzso of these receptors zzso cellular zzso To help fill this zzso whole cell zzso and zzso zzso studies of acutely isolated layer zzso prefrontal zzso zzso were zzso The vast majority zzso of these zzso had zzso levels of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Bath application of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso channels were a particularly prominent target of this signaling zzso The zzso channel zzso was blocked by disruption of zzso signaling or by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or depletion of zzso zzso stores also blocked this zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was robustly expressed in zzso from zzso knockout zzso These findings argue that zzso receptors couple through zzso proteins to trigger a zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso and its blockade by zzso zzso could have wide-ranging effects on synaptic integration and long-term gene expression in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso
