Exposure to persistent organic pollutants, such as zzso zzso zzso can lead to chronic inflammation and the development of vascular zzso Because cell zzso molecules zzso of the cerebrovascular zzso regulate zzso of inflammatory cells into the brain, we have explored the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso can zzso zzso in brain zzso zzso Exposure to zzso increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso as well as elevated zzso of zzso to brain zzso zzso These effects were zzso by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso or disruption of zzso zzso by cholesterol depleting agents blocked zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso by zzso interference did not affect zzso of zzso and zzso in brain zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso of the present study indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling mechanisms regulate the expression of zzso in brain zzso cells and zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Due to its role in zzso zzso induction of zzso may contribute to zzso cerebrovascular disorders and zzso effects in the zzso
