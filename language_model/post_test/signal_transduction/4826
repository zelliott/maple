In many cases, zzso acquire distinct identities as their zzso navigate toward target cells and encounter zzso signaling zzso These molecules generate retrograde signals that activate zzso gene zzso zzso by which zzso convert the complex milieu of signaling molecules into retrograde signals are not fully zzso Here, we examine retrograde signaling mechanisms that specify zzso identity in the zzso zzso which zzso sensory information from the face to the zzso We find that zzso zzso requires the sequential action of two zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the translation of zzso localized zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the cell body, where it is zzso to a zzso active form by zzso signaling zzso and mediates the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, local translation functions as a mechanism by which zzso signals are converted into a retrograde signal that elicits a specific zzso zzso
