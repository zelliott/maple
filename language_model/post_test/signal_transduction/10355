The zzso regulator of G protein zzso zzso proteins were first identified as zzso zzso proteins zzso for zzso G zzso however, it was later found that they can also regulate G zzso interactions in other ways that are still not well zzso There is increasing evidence that some of the effects of zzso proteins occur due to their ability to interact with zzso zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss recent evidence that supports the idea that zzso proteins can bind to proteins other than zzso such as G protein coupled receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we will investigate novel zzso binding partners zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the formation of zzso scaffolds or govern zzso protein availability and/or zzso
