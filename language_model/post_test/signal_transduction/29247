zzso zzso zzso is an early signaling zzso that regulates cell growth and cell cycle zzso zzso is activated immediately after growth factor zzso stimulation (at the zzso zzso and again in late zzso The two ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential during embryonic development and are thought to control cell zzso Nonetheless, it is presently unknown at which point each is activated during the cell cycle and whether or not they both control zzso zzso We found that zzso was activated first in zzso followed by a minor zzso activity zzso In late zzso zzso zzso preceded that of zzso which showed the maximum activity at this zzso zzso zzso required Ras activity, whereas zzso was first activated by zzso zzso and then further induced by active zzso zzso with zzso and zzso activity diminished the zzso of downstream zzso with different zzso with a selective action of zzso in blocking early zzso zzso We show that zzso of either zzso or zzso reduced cell cycle zzso These results reveal that zzso and zzso present distinct zzso requirements and zzso in zzso phase, with a selective action of zzso at the zzso phase zzso Nevertheless, zzso and zzso both regulate zzso zzso
