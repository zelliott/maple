The first crystal structures of intact T cell receptors zzso bound to class I zzso zzso zzso were determined in zzso Since then, further structures of class I zzso complexes have explored the degree of structural zzso in the zzso system and the structural basis for positive and negative zzso The recent determination of class II and zzso class I zzso structures, as well as those of accessory molecules zzso zzso has pushed our knowledge of zzso interactions into new zzso shedding light on clinical zzso such as graft rejection and zzso zzso Furthermore, the determination of zzso structures lays the foundation for a more comprehensive structural description of the zzso zzso signaling events and those zzso that arise in the zzso zzso While these telling zzso of the zzso interaction are composed mainly from zzso crystal structures, a full description of the biological snapshots in T cell signaling requires additional zzso methods that record the dynamics of the zzso To this end, surface zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have furnished both affinities and zzso of the zzso zzso In the past year, zzso zzso and molecular biological data describing zzso interactions have zzso coalesced into a burgeoning well of understanding that promises to deliver further insights into T cell zzso The coming years will, through a more intimate union of structural and kinetic data, allow many pressing questions to be zzso such as how zzso zzso is affected by zzso binding and what is the mechanism of zzso signaling in both early and late stages of T cell engagement with zzso zzso
