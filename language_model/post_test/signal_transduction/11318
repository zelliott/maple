In mice, three zzso genes are thought to mediate sonic zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso studies and analysis of zzso zzso for each gene have indicated that the zzso proteins have different zzso In particular, zzso appears to be a zzso zzso and zzso and zzso have zzso zzso To determine the precise functional differences between zzso and zzso we have expressed zzso in place of zzso from the zzso zzso locus in zzso zzso a low level of zzso can rescue all the zzso signaling defects in zzso zzso however, only in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that only the zzso function of zzso is actually required, and indicates that in specific situations, zzso can zzso the ability of zzso to activate target zzso Furthermore, expression of both copies of zzso in place of zzso does not disrupt spinal zzso zzso but does result in new zzso defects that lead to zzso We show that the defects are enhanced when zzso function is reduced, demonstrating that an important difference between zzso and zzso is the ability of zzso to antagonize zzso zzso
