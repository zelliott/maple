zzso crest is induced at the junction of zzso zzso and neural plate by the mutual interaction of these zzso In previous studies, zzso has been shown to pattern the zzso zzso and zzso can induce neural crest cells from the neural zzso In this study, we show that zzso expressed zzso which encodes a zzso zzso is required for the zzso and/or maintenance of zzso expression in this zzso and is thus indirectly required for neural crest induction by zzso at the zzso plate zzso zzso zzso in the zzso additionally zzso neural crest formation in this zzso so that neural crest generation by zzso is restricted to the zzso
