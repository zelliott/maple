zzso is a zzso whose administration in large doses causes coma and death of the exposed animals, but whether and in what degree these whole body effects are related to the death of zzso cells is not zzso Since the downstream effects of zzso in cultured zzso cells appear to be partly zzso by zzso of several putative zzso mechanisms characteristic for the zzso program, we speculated that zzso zzso may be zzso In this study, zzso zzso cells grown in zzso serum were exposed to 5 zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso for 96 h and tested for the appearance of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction and zzso DNA zzso at different times of zzso In cultures exposed to either 5 zzso or 10 zzso zzso about zzso of the cells were found to enter zzso at 48 h of exposure, and the number of zzso cells rose to zzso at 72 zzso and to 50% at 96 h of exposure, zzso The first zzso signal purportedly involved in zzso zzso of zzso was transient and appeared already after 3-6 h of zzso zzso with pronounced manifestation of zzso (at 72 h and even more at 96 h of zzso was an increased transfer of the zzso factor zzso from zzso nucleus as revealed by zzso zzso The number of cells affected by zzso zzso was markedly reduced by incubation with a zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso is a result of a complex interplay of at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso with zzso being possibly involved in the induction of zzso and generation of toxic levels of NO in the zzso
