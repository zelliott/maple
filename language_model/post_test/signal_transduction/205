zzso is a highly zzso trait that appears to be influenced by multiple zzso zzso linkage studies have highlighted the zzso region zzso as a quantitative trait locus for zzso We have previously published evidence suggesting that the zzso gene from this region is associated with zzso in zzso The product of this gene activates the zzso zzso the gene for which is also located within this zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of genetic zzso in zzso on bone density in zzso zzso variation within the zzso gene region was determined using 9 single zzso zzso zzso in a discovery cohort of zzso female zzso Of the 9 zzso one was found to be zzso with the others representing 3 distinct linkage zzso zzso zzso Using zzso software, significant associations were found between two of these zzso blocks and zzso zzso of the spine and hip zzso The zzso block zzso by the zzso zzso showed zzso association, with the more common G zzso at zzso associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso for zzso in a replication cohort of zzso zzso women confirmed an association with zzso zzso zzso Again, the G zzso was found to be associated with a reduced hip and spine zzso zzso These results support the implication of the zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that one or more genes in this zzso may be responsible for the linkage observed between zzso and zzso
