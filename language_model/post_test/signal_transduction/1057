zzso zzso zzso cells undergo an orderly process of terminal differentiation that is characterized by specific molecular and zzso changes, including expression of the zzso envelope protein zzso zzso progress has been made in characterizing the upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso sites for zzso zzso protein 1) and zzso zzso factors were shown to be important for zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso terminal differentiation is often characterized by decreased or lack of zzso zzso Recently, a zzso construct of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, where zzso stands for zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit zzso expression in immortalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of expression or zzso of other zzso has also been demonstrated zzso zzso zzso and zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso and zzso in immortalized zzso lines that had lost expression of these zzso zzso zzso of these proteins restored zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in these zzso zzso and calcium zzso induced exchange of zzso and zzso occupancy at the zzso sites of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso expression were not dependent on zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso promoter activity directly resulted from changes in zzso protein zzso We concluded that zzso and zzso are important regulators of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso
