zzso genes are expressed in the presence of an external zzso Individual cells may exhibit either a zzso or graded response to such zzso It has been hypothesized that the chemical zzso of zzso zzso interactions can account for both these scenarios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso To explore this question, we have conducted work based on the experimental results of zzso et zzso zzso zzso 4 (10) zzso zzso In these experiments, three upstream zzso binding sites control zzso of the zzso zzso which codes for the zzso zzso The experimental data show a zzso response for this zzso We consider the effects of fluctuations in zzso binding on the response of the zzso Our modeling results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data, and illustrate how the zzso and graded responses can stem from the same underlying zzso
