The zzso zzso zzso contains neural precursor cells which can be easily harvested from a minimally invasive zzso zzso making them a valuable cell source to study human neural cell lineages in health and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso and treatment of zzso disorders and also in the regulation of zzso neural precursor cell fate in zzso and in zzso In this study, we examined the impact of decreased zzso activity on the fate of adult human zzso neural precursors in zzso zzso zzso was achieved using zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso to eliminate potential zzso effects on cell fate due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the number of neural precursor cells in zzso cell cultures through a reduction in zzso zzso proliferation was not associated with a reduction in cell survival but was accompanied by a reduction in zzso expression and a substantial increase in the expression of the zzso differentiation markers zzso and zzso zzso after 10 days in zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso promotes the early stages of zzso differentiation in cultures of adult human neural precursors and provide insights into the mechanisms by which zzso in zzso signaling affect adult human zzso a cellular process strongly suspected to play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso
