The zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso involved in the regulation of numerous zzso processes during development and in response to environmental zzso zzso activity is controlled by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays a prominent role upon zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso zzso the unique zzso zzso in zzso zzso activates zzso signaling through the zzso of the zzso zzso 

In a dominant zzso screen for new components of the zzso in zzso we have identified an zzso series of the zzso zzso Our genetic and zzso results demonstrate that zzso is zzso for normal development and host resistance to systemic bacterial infection but plays a zzso role as a zzso acting in parallel to zzso in zzso zzso zzso upon zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In contrast to zzso it seems that in zzso both zzso zzso and zzso are required to induce zzso upon zzso or zzso zzso
