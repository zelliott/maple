zzso X syndrome zzso the most common inherited zzso of intellectual disability and zzso spectrum disorders, is caused by loss of the fragile X mental zzso 1 zzso gene product zzso an zzso zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso targets have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso disease model, but zzso is highly zzso in function and the full spectrum of zzso targets has yet to be zzso In this study, screens for zzso neural proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal strong zzso of two synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our recent work has shown that zzso and zzso act as zzso regulating zzso zzso upstream of zzso signal zzso in multiple zzso pathways that drive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit altered zzso zzso with changes in both zzso zzso zzso abundance and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso Similarly, a parallel zzso signaling zzso zzso belly zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso are depressed at zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the retrograde zzso zzso Glass bottom boat zzso and downstream signaling via zzso of the zzso factor MAD zzso seem not to be zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso zzso were genetically reduced to control levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso correction restored both zzso zzso and Jeb zzso zzso and zzso synaptic architecture and transmission strength back to zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso controlling zzso signaling during zzso and that loss of this regulation causes synaptic structure and function defects characterizing the zzso disease zzso
