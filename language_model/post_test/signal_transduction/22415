zzso between zzso zzso molecules and the zzso is a key aspect of tissue zzso that is zzso by cortical signaling at adhesive zzso One such signal is the zzso zzso zzso zzso which acts in several pathways at zzso zzso including zzso signaling zzso We now present two new insights into zzso zzso zzso zzso we report that upstream protein zzso zzso zzso activity is required to stimulate zzso zzso signaling at zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso selectively reduced the activity of zzso zzso zzso at zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso could not stimulate zzso signaling in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso treatment zzso the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity is required for the dynamic regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified a role for zzso zzso signaling in supporting zzso zzso tension by targeting zzso zzso zzso The linear shape of the zzso junctions was lost in zzso and zzso cells, and zzso zzso selectively affected the zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso signaling is a possible upstream regulator of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso
