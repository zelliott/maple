zzso of zzso stress resistance are crucial zzso factors for survival and proliferation of zzso pathogens within the human zzso In this study we have identified and functionally characterized the role of zzso zzso in zzso stress resistance of zzso zzso causing zzso zzso and regulation of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was essential for the zzso regulation of zzso under zzso stress zzso A gene deletion study revealed that zzso was required for cells to counteract zzso stress, but not other zzso damaging zzso zzso was found to be essential for the induction of zzso response to zzso stress with concurrent repression of zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso zzso zzso was modulated by both low and high doses of zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso zzso specific zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso were essential for recycling of oxidized zzso In addition to its role in zzso sensing and response zzso was also found to be required for a zzso function in promoting zzso cell swelling and growth zzso Finally we showed the importance of zzso in zzso zzso by demonstrating its requirement for full zzso using a mouse infection zzso
