In cells of higher zzso double strand breaks zzso induced in the DNA after exposure to zzso radiation zzso are rapidly rejoined by a zzso of zzso end joining zzso that requires DNA dependent protein zzso zzso and is therefore termed here zzso When this zzso is chemically or genetically zzso cells still remove the majority of zzso using an alternative, backup zzso operating independently of the zzso zzso group of genes and with an order of magnitude slower zzso zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso in the functional coordination of zzso and zzso using as a model end joining by cell extracts of restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso Although DNA end joining is inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of zzso the degree of zzso depends on the ratio between DNA ends and zzso suggesting that binding of inactive zzso to DNA ends not only blocks processing by zzso but also prevents the function of zzso zzso end joining under conditions of incomplete zzso or in cells lacking zzso is attributed to the function of zzso operating on DNA ends free of zzso Thus, zzso suppresses alternative pathways of end joining by efficiently binding DNA ends and zzso them to zzso
