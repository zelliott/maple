zzso are zzso in zzso tissue structures that can be used as platforms for zzso and pathological zzso They provide zzso zzso in which different cell types can be zzso in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ zzso Blood vessels are an integral part of all zzso in the human zzso Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of zzso since generated zzso will require a blood or zzso zzso Here, we have engineered three-dimensional zzso of vascular tissue inside zzso by injecting a mixture of human zzso vein zzso cells, human embryonic stem zzso zzso (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle zzso and rat tail collagen I into a zzso zzso channel with dimensions 500 zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso Over the course of 12 zzso the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the zzso zzso examination of tube zzso by zzso zzso revealed a mature zzso zzso with complete zzso zzso at zzso contacts and zzso incorporated inside the zzso zzso We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a zzso zzso against transforming growth zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso is essential for normal vascular zzso deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective zzso and zzso and zzso in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic zzso In the engineered zzso zzso of zzso signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher zzso highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso we have developed zzso three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell zzso In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue zzso to advance the development of zzso
