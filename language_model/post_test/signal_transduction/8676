zzso chains are essential to the structure, expression and signaling of T cell zzso Here, we extend to human zzso our previous data in mouse zzso showing that, in T cells, zzso processing of the zzso zzso sequence of zzso chains generate distinct zzso species that can be identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This was shown first by showing the processing of a fusion protein of zzso and the zzso domain of mouse zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found in human zzso chains zzso from the surface of zzso cells or zzso blasts of human blood T zzso zzso of zzso chains from 27 different species shows that their zzso sequences share a strong zzso nature, despite the large differences in terms of length and zzso even among closely related zzso Our results suggest that generation of zzso chain zzso with different zzso sequence and zzso is a general zzso Thus, as previously observed in the zzso the relative abundance of zzso chain species might regulate zzso structure and function, including the strength of the interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso chains from 7 out of 27 species studied have putative zzso zzso or zzso motifs in their zzso zzso zzso Their location, plus the conservation of zzso involved in domain organization, the interactions with other zzso zzso or the zzso and signal triggering add new data useful to establish a zzso zzso for the interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
