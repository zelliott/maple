G zzso receptors zzso are the key elements of a highly regulated zzso machinery that generates different signaling outcomes to hormones and zzso Until recently, it was assumed that diverse zzso of a given zzso differ only in their ability to alter the balance between the OFF and the ON state of the zzso However, it has now become evident that their zzso mechanisms are more complex and that receptors presumably display distinguishable active zzso states, which are induced by different zzso and correlate to specific signaling zzso The use of different labeling strategies to insert fluorescent labels into zzso zzso zzso or into receptors in intact cells, has made it possible to sense zzso zzso via changes in their zzso Here, we zzso recent progress in the analysis of zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso acquired using modern zzso and zzso zzso
