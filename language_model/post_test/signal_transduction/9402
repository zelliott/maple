zzso mast cell zzso are increased on the airway smooth muscle in asthma where they may zzso muscle functions and thus contribute to airway zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

To determine the effects of human lung mast cells on the zzso and zzso functions of airway smooth muscle cells from donors with and without zzso 

Freshly isolated human lung mast cells were zzso with zzso Culture zzso were collected after 2 and 24 h and the mast cells zzso The zzso were added to zzso zzso airway smooth muscle cells for up to 48 zzso Released zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso proliferation was zzso by zzso zzso incorporation and cell zzso and zzso zzso by zzso 

zzso cell zzso zzso reduced zzso and increased zzso and zzso production from both zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso reversed these zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso release from both muscle cell types but increased zzso release by zzso zzso The zzso zzso also reduced zzso but not zzso muscle cell DNA synthesis and zzso cell numbers over 5 days through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not involved in reducing the zzso 

zzso cell zzso and newly zzso products zzso modulated the zzso and zzso functions of airway smooth muscle cells from donors with and without zzso Thus, mast cells may zzso their own recruitment and airway smooth muscle functions locally in zzso
