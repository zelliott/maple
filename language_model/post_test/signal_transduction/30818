Modular zzso zzso zzso are giant bacterial zzso that zzso many zzso of therapeutic zzso In contrast to zzso that provide zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso lack integrated AT zzso and exhibit unusual zzso features with poorly understood functions in zzso zzso This has retarded insight into the assembly of products such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso evolved in a fundamentally different fashion from zzso systems, through horizontal recruitment and assembly of zzso zzso zzso zzso The insights obtained from analysis of these zzso mosaics will facilitate both the discovery of novel zzso by zzso mining, as we demonstrate for the zzso of zzso zzso and the extraction of chemical information from short zzso zzso products, as we show using zzso DNA of marine zzso Our data also suggest new strategies for zzso zzso zzso pathways and engineering zzso zzso
