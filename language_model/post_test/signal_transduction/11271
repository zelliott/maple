Reversal of long term zzso zzso may function to increase the flexibility and storage capacity of zzso zzso however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely zzso We show that zzso induced by low frequency stimulation zzso (2 zzso 10 zzso 1200 zzso was zzso and dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to reverse zzso was zzso by a brief application of zzso This zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the reversal of zzso by zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was specifically prevented by protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso A but not by the zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, by using zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso is associated with a persistent zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso a protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso but not at zzso zzso a zzso of zzso protein zzso This effect was zzso by zzso zzso or zzso and was specifically prevented by zzso zzso Also, the increased zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and the decreased zzso activity seen with zzso were overcome by zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso through an zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso acid receptors and zzso in the zzso region of the zzso
