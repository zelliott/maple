The zzso zzso which encodes a winged zzso zzso regulator, is expressed in the zzso layer of developing and mature gastrointestinal zzso zzso mice exhibit various defects not only in the zzso layer of the gastrointestinal tract but also in zzso zzso zzso In the small zzso of zzso mice, the formation of zzso patches is affected, particularly in the zzso zzso This zzso is shown to be due to the delayed formation of zzso patches organizing centers as revealed by the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso days zzso zzso patch defects are zzso with the significantly decreased expression of zzso zzso in the zzso region of fetal zzso zzso is suggested to regulate the responsiveness of fetal zzso zzso cells to zzso signals zzso by zzso during zzso patch zzso In addition, zzso outgrowth of zzso patches due to defects in zzso zzso components of zzso patches are seen in zzso zzso Because of the functional similarities of zzso zzso patches to those seen in zzso experimental zzso this zzso is suggested to involve zzso zzso zzso Together, the data suggest that zzso might be involved in cellular responses of zzso zzso zzso dependent upon the zzso zzso zzso
