zzso is an zzso zzso protein often associated with zzso zzso in zzso In this study, the ability of zzso to zzso zzso spreading and zzso activities of zzso was zzso zzso was found to have pronounced zzso effects on the cell attachment and spreading promoted by zzso zzso was also found to inhibit the zzso of a variety of cell types on zzso zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso rat pulmonary zzso smooth muscle cells zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells was inhibited by the presence of zzso bound to zzso zzso chamber zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso displayed reduced zzso distance of movement and persistence time on zzso zzso Similarly, the incorporation of zzso into zzso type I collagen gels inhibited the invasion of zzso cushion zzso cells zzso from cultured embryonic heart zzso By contrast, incorporation of zzso into collagen gels lacking zzso had no effect on the migration of zzso cushion zzso These results suggest that the zzso effects of zzso might be zzso zzso Furthermore, such effects are zzso specific, in that the migration of zzso zzso and zzso cells on zzso zzso is not responsive to zzso Additional studies found that the mechanism for the zzso effects of zzso does not involve zzso of interactions between zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso However, zzso was found to inhibit zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso and to suppress zzso of zzso heavy zzso This ability to influence signal zzso zzso that zzso the zzso motor complex might be the basis for the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso
