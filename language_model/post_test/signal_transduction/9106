zzso zzso zzso cells are interconnected via zzso and electrical zzso and represent a major class of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso connections among zzso cells are critical for regulating network zzso in the mature zzso However, it is unclear whether synaptic connections among zzso zzso also play a central role in the generation of patterned zzso activity in the immature brain, which is thought to zzso the formation of zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso time course of zzso of zzso cell in mouse visual zzso In layer zzso zzso we recorded from two or three zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso to study the development of electrical and chemical synaptic interactions from zzso day 3 zzso to zzso We detected no evidence for functional connectivity for zzso or zzso pairs at zzso However, by zzso we found that zzso of zzso pairs were zzso zzso and zzso of pairs were connected via zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso pairs had established functional electrical zzso and zzso of zzso pairs were connected via zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso cells showed a similar zzso time line, but no electrical zzso was detected for zzso zzso We found that zzso of electrical and zzso connections of zzso cells takes place in the same zzso Together, our results suggest that chemical and electrical connections among zzso cells can contribute to patterned zzso activity only by the end of the first zzso zzso
