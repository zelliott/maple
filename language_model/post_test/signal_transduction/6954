zzso and zzso comprise a large family of zzso pairs controlling cell guidance in nervous, zzso and vascular zzso How zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso trafficking, and vascular zzso cell branching is linked to zzso function, central to most directed movement, remains zzso Here we show that on developing zzso zzso controls surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso whereas its zzso by zzso in trans regulates individual zzso zzso catch zzso Loss of zzso expression reduces zzso zzso zzso thereby diminishing zzso whereas zzso zzso shortens individual zzso bond lifetimes under force to reduce zzso zzso both decreased expression of zzso during zzso progression and a zzso zzso zzso zzso enhance zzso movement toward the zzso thus enforcing the orchestrated zzso trafficking required for effective immune repertoire zzso Our results demonstrate zzso molecular features of zzso zzso with broad implications for many cellular zzso
