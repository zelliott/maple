zzso zzso zzso are able to distinguish two different zzso of the zzso human T zzso This zzso split is accompanied by functional zzso In this report we have analyzed the capabilities of zzso zzso of zzso human T cells to use zzso 2 zzso and zzso as growth zzso We have found that both cell zzso are able to zzso after stimulation with zzso in the presence of zzso added zzso or zzso However, the response to zzso of zzso cells was comparatively lower than the response of zzso zzso Both cell zzso showed a good response to zzso plus adherent cells zzso but when zzso was present in the culture only the zzso cells showed an enhancement in the zzso zzso while proliferation of the zzso T cell subset was zzso Similar effects were seen, however, in the response to zzso or zzso cells to zzso plus zzso Although the precise mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso is not known, the results obtained suggest that zzso could interfere in some way with the zzso of zzso to the proliferation of the zzso T cell zzso
