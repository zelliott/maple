The aim of this study was to assess whether an zzso zzso zzso blocker, zzso or an zzso zzso zzso blocker, zzso influences nuclear factor zzso beta zzso pathway, free radical generation, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso system in hearts obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso The study was performed on rats divided into groups: 1) zzso 2) saline + zzso (15 zzso 3) zzso (1 zzso zzso + zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso 5) zzso (3 zzso zzso + zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were injected zzso 30 zzso before zzso zzso In rats, zzso caused a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso It also decreased tissue protein level and improved tissue zzso status zzso zzso zzso Only a dose of 1 zzso decreased zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso lowered zzso zzso and protein concentration zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso p zzso zzso respectively), however, it did not affect zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso influenced zzso increase in zzso zzso level and zzso of zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso is more effective in zzso free radical generation and improving heart zzso properties than zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso is not incorporated in zzso and zzso influence on zzso zzso
