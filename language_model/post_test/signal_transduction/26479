zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be induced in cells by different stimuli such as zzso zzso or deprivation of zzso zzso has zzso properties and may be involved in zzso modulating zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso which carry the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with different zzso zzso strains revealed that the zzso activity of zzso which zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso was sufficient to induce zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso toxin B, another bacterial inhibitor of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and toxin B both increased zzso activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso expression could not be linked to the zzso of an individual zzso zzso by these zzso However, forced expression of zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso proved necessary for profound zzso induction by toxin zzso zzso studies and gel shift analyses defined binding of upstream zzso factor zzso 1 and 2 to a zzso zzso binding site zzso in the zzso promoter as a crucial step of its zzso In addition we could show that zzso and zzso are essential for zzso as well as toxin B induced zzso zzso These findings define a novel way of zzso promoter zzso zzso by bacterial toxins and differentiate it from those zzso by zzso or deprivation of zzso
