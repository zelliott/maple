The mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing human brain are poorly zzso despite being a major cause of chronic zzso zzso Recent work in the zzso zzso zzso has shown that zzso causes discrete zzso zzso errors in certain zzso and zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso zzso would have similar effects in a zzso nervous zzso We have found that zzso hypoxic injury zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso leading to errors in which zzso zzso fail to cross the zzso The zzso defects result from zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and are zzso by chemical zzso of the zzso zzso or by expression of zzso active zzso Further, we found that blocking zzso zzso by zzso helped prevent the guidance zzso We identified zzso as a target of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso rescued the guidance zzso and showed that the zzso zzso is expressed in a pattern complementary to the zzso zzso By targeting a zzso active form of zzso to specific zzso we found that zzso mediates the zzso errors via a zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso used to improve zzso outcomes in zzso zzso protects against zzso errors by preventing zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the zzso in response to zzso and they support a potential zzso role for zzso
