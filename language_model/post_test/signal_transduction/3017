Despite its clinical importance, the molecular biology of zzso zzso control is at best partially zzso and the literature remains zzso The most recent description that zzso zzso is integrated into actively expressed host genes has further zzso the zzso This lack of molecular understanding zzso our efforts to identify therapeutic compounds or strategies that could reactivate zzso zzso infection in patients, a prerequisite for the zzso of zzso zzso Currently, many therapeutic development efforts operate under the assumption that a restrictive zzso code could govern zzso infection and that either dissipation of the zzso restrictions or zzso zzso could be sufficient to trigger zzso zzso We here present data that suggest an zzso higher level of molecular zzso During a zzso drug screening effort, we identified zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso infected primary T cells and T cell zzso In either system, zzso inhibited zzso zzso despite high levels of induced zzso zzso This finding suggests the presence of a gatekeeper zzso activity that controls zzso zzso infection even in the presence of high levels of zzso zzso Potential therapeutic stimuli that do not target this gatekeeper zzso will likely fail to trigger efficient zzso zzso zzso
