While it is generally believed that the zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso for self zzso zzso complex zzso determines a zzso fate, how the cell discriminates between a stimulus that causes positive selection zzso and one that causes negative selection zzso is zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso are produced in the zzso and that they antagonize deletion caused by zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso during zzso selection, we examined zzso development in organ cultures in which zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso production in zzso from zzso transgenic mice resulted in the zzso and zzso loss of zzso that normally recognize self zzso with sufficient zzso to result in positive zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso production caused an increase in zzso only in zzso zzso bearing transgenic zzso that recognized self zzso These results indicate that the balance of zzso and zzso zzso signaling influences the zzso zzso development by allowing cells with zzso zzso for self zzso to zzso
