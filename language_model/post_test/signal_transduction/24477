zzso zzso in zzso gene cause the zzso syndrome zzso a genetic disease with increased risk of zzso Recently, zzso zzso have been identified in one-third of sporadic lung zzso indicating that zzso gene zzso is critical in tumors other than those of the zzso zzso However, the in zzso zzso of zzso and its role in cancer development have not been completely zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso protein in zzso lung zzso cells leads to zzso zzso To examine changes in gene expression profiles subsequent to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, we used zzso zzso We detected deregulation of 100 genes involved in cell zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso modification of the expression of well-known zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso suggests that growth suppression in zzso cells zzso zzso may be zzso by zzso In addition, zzso zzso indicates that zzso could be involved in the zzso molecular zzso Thus, our results give some insights into the understanding of how zzso zzso contributes to lung zzso
