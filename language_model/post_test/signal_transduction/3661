zzso zzso lung diseases that impair pulmonary zzso while increasing the levels of zzso carbon dioxide zzso are a documented risk factor for the development of lung cancer in smokers and zzso Using established cell lines derived from human small cell lung cancer zzso and zzso cell lung zzso our experiments demonstrated that elevated CO2 zzso in the range of those found in the diseased lung selectively zzso the proliferation of zzso but not zzso or zzso cell zzso The zzso response of zzso cells involved zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the stimulation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unrelated to changes in zzso zzso We concluded that CO2 is an important zzso zzso for zzso which may contribute significantly to the high lung cancer burden observed in individuals with chronic lung disease, by the zzso of zzso which play a central role as downstream zzso of many growth zzso zzso zzso
