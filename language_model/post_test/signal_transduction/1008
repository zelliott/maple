A key question yet to be resolved concerns the structure and function relationship of the zzso zzso How does zzso recognition by the zzso chains result in the zzso of distinct signal zzso pathways by the zzso zzso To investigate which part of the zzso chain is involved in zzso zzso we exchanged different zzso of the constant regions of the zzso chain with the corresponding zzso chain zzso We show here that zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso chain zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso together with a zzso zzso zzso chain, were 10 times more sensitive to zzso stimulation compared to cells expressing zzso zzso This zzso zzso of the zzso chain was observed in two different zzso One specific for an zzso zzso and one for an zzso zzso We found that this zzso zzso zzso had normal association with zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the effect of the zzso zzso chain in transgenic T cells, we made zzso zzso transgenic mice expressing either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso Similar to what was observed in zzso cells, transgenic zzso T cells showed a zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Further studies may help us understand the effect of increased zzso signaling on zzso and may lead to the identification of signaling molecules that can be targeted to stop the progression of zzso disorders such as multiple zzso
