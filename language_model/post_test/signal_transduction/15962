Many zzso use sex zzso to find their zzso in the zzso Their antennae are well developed with lateral branches to receive the zzso zzso However, how these structures have evolved remains zzso because the mechanism of development of these antennae has not been studied at a molecular zzso To zzso the zzso mechanism of this type of zzso we observed zzso cell zzso cell death and zzso patterning gene expression in the zzso antenna of the silk zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and almost ubiquitous zzso occur during early zzso stages and appear to shape the lateral branch zzso zzso patterning genes are expressed in a pattern largely zzso among insects with zzso antennae until the late 5th zzso zzso but most of them change their expression dramatically to a pattern zzso the lateral branch during zzso These findings imply that although zzso zzso is patterned by zzso mechanisms before zzso most of the zzso patterning genes are zzso to form the lateral branch during zzso We propose that the acquisition of a new regulatory circuit of zzso patterning genes may have been an important event during evolution of the sensory antenna with lateral branches in the zzso
