zzso development constitutes a central model for the study of tissue and organ zzso yet, the mechanisms that regulate the patterning of limb zzso have been left zzso zzso patterning in the forming limb is tightly regulated in order to ensure sufficient gas exchange and zzso supply to the developing zzso Once zzso is zzso limb zzso zzso two seemingly opposing zzso vessel zzso from regions that undergo zzso zzso and vessel zzso During the latter, vessels that surround the zzso undergo an extensive zzso forming a stereotypical enriched network that is zzso from the zzso In this study, we provide evidence for the zzso of the condensing zzso of the forming skeleton in regulating limb vascular zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso experiments in limb bud zzso firmly established zzso as the signal by which the condensing zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso observed in limbs where zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso were blocked in limb bud zzso suggested that zzso which is zzso by the condensing zzso regulates limb zzso via a direct long-range zzso Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso expression in the condensing zzso This study establishes zzso expression in the condensing zzso as the mechanism by which the skeleton patterns limb zzso
