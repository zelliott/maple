In zzso zzso the maintenance of zzso zzso I arrest prior to the surge of zzso that stimulates zzso maturation depends on a high level of zzso within the zzso In mouse and zzso the zzso is generated in the zzso and this requires the activity of a zzso active, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso To examine if human zzso zzso arrest depends on a similar pathway, we used zzso and Western zzso to look at whether human zzso express the same components for maintaining arrest as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 3, which is the major zzso zzso required for maintaining zzso arrest in the mouse zzso was also zzso as was zzso zzso To determine if this zzso is functional in the human zzso we examined the effect of injecting a zzso zzso against zzso on zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso resumption of human zzso that were maintained at the zzso I stage using a zzso zzso These results demonstrate that human zzso maintain zzso arrest prior to the zzso surge using a signaling zzso similar to that of zzso zzso
