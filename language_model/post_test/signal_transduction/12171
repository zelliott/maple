The zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular regulation of zzso function, we generated a series of zzso zzso against the extra cellular domain zzso of zzso and selected a zzso zzso zzso that recognizes cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso dependent zzso reporter zzso and antagonized zzso dependent zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso domain zzso identified zzso 243 in the first zzso domain of zzso as a critical zzso for zzso zzso implicating this domain in regulating the sensitivity of zzso to zzso In agreement with this notion, zzso directly disrupted the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and a truncated form of the zzso zzso containing only repeats 1 and zzso Finally, we found that zzso completely protected zzso from zzso dependent zzso Together, these results identify the first zzso domain as a novel regulatory domain for zzso binding to zzso and show that zzso against the first zzso domain of zzso can be used to zzso this zzso
