The inflammatory response initiated upon burn injury is also associated with extensive zzso zzso While there is a significant body of literature on the characterization of these changes at the zzso level, little is known on the mechanisms of zzso especially with respect to the role of gene zzso We have zzso analyzed changes in gene expression in rat zzso during the first 7 d after zzso total body surface area burn injury using zzso zzso A total of zzso genes were significantly altered in expression at 1, 2, 4, and 7 d after burn injury compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso based on gene zzso terms indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso response accounted for more than zzso of the significantly altered zzso Fisher zzso difference zzso testing of the zzso zzso expressed genes indicated that over zzso of the genes demonstrated significant changes in expression either on d 1 or on d 7 zzso The gene expression trends were zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and fatty acids 24 h zzso but not at later time zzso This suggests that fatty acids are used, at least in part, in the liver as energy zzso for the first 4 d after zzso Our data also suggest that long-term regulation of energy zzso zzso in the liver following burn injury is primarily at the zzso zzso zzso relevance networks of significantly expressed genes indicate the involvement of key small molecules in the zzso response to zzso total body surface area burn zzso
