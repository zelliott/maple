The development of new zzso agents and concepts of radiation therapy, administered as primary, zzso and zzso therapy, has led to new perspectives in breast cancer zzso Apart from conventional chemotherapy, recently developed novel agents interfere with molecular mechanisms that are altered in cancer zzso Those targets are not necessarily breast zzso In this review we will focus on novel agents with potential or already proved benefit to breast cancer zzso Promising strategies include zzso of growth factor zzso blocking of tumor zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso and zzso of invasion and zzso 

Reports of relevant studies obtained from a search of zzso and studies referenced in those reports were zzso 

Apart from zzso other further developed compounds show promising results in clinical studies as a second generation of growth factor zzso Different approaches in zzso therapy are under zzso and clinical zzso zzso zzso agents show synergistic effects with zzso in a clinical zzso zzso Other compounds that target zzso 90, zzso zzso and zzso zzso target zzso zzso pathways being lethal to tumor cells only but not to normal zzso suggesting a zzso way of zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrating promising results in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso currently under clinical investigation preliminarily show hopeful results in patients with advanced breast zzso Furthermore, recent progress in defining the zzso zzso of tumor zzso has rejuvenated the interest in cancer zzso 

Typical dose escalation studies leading to the highest clinically still tolerated dose do not appear to be equally appropriate for the zzso of efficiency of those compounds as for conventional zzso zzso Rather, escalation up to an amount of therapeutic agent that is sufficient for maximum target zzso should be zzso where classical measures of zzso such as complete or partial zzso are replaced both by time to progression and treatment failure as an appropriate measure of the efficacy of an zzso
