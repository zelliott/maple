Much excitement has arisen from the observation that zzso in zzso signaling can dramatically extend lifespan in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, there are tantalizing hints that the zzso zzso in mice may have similar zzso In addition to dramatic effects on zzso zzso zzso signaling also promotes changes in stress resistance, metabolism and zzso Which, if any, of the various zzso of insulin zzso zzso are relevant to zzso What are the genes that function in collaboration with insulin to prolong zzso These questions are at the heart of current research in zzso zzso zzso Two main theories exist as to the mechanism behind zzso effects on zzso zzso One theory is that insulin programs zzso parameters that prolong or reduce zzso The other theory is that insulin determines the cell's ability to endure zzso stress from zzso thereby determining the rate of zzso However, these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and several studies seem to support a role for zzso Here, we review recently published reports investigating the mechanisms behind zzso dramatic effect on zzso We also spotlight several zzso zzso genes that are now known to interact with insulin signaling to determine zzso These insights into pathways affecting zzso lifespan may provide a basis for developing strategies for pharmacological manipulation of human zzso
