We previously demonstrated the expression of bitter taste receptors of the type 2 family zzso and the zzso of the G protein zzso zzso in the zzso gastrointestinal zzso tract and in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we characterized mechanisms of zzso zzso induced by two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso cell line zzso Both DB and zzso induced a marked increase in zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso blocked the increase in zzso induced by either DB or zzso but, in contrast, did not prevent the effect induced by zzso zzso blocked the transient increase in zzso induced by zzso but did not zzso the zzso increase zzso by DB or zzso These results indicate that zzso influx mediates the increase in zzso induced by DB and zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso for 30 zzso inhibited the increase in zzso zzso by DB or zzso Furthermore, exposure to the zzso zzso opener BAY K zzso zzso the increase in zzso induced by DB and zzso zzso with DB also induced a marked increase in the release of zzso from zzso cells, an effect also zzso by prior exposure to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso our results demonstrate that bitter zzso increase zzso and zzso release through zzso influx zzso by the opening of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
