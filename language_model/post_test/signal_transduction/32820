The processes by which the zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso the signals of its zzso zzso zzso are incompletely zzso We used a zzso zzso system to identify zzso interacting proteins that may participate in zzso signal zzso We found that the protein zzso the human zzso of the mouse transplantation zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso domain of zzso in zzso The zzso end of zzso contained the zzso interacting zzso zzso also bound to zzso in a human breast cell zzso Two zzso zzso transcripts were detected in normal human zzso zzso including those of the heart, zzso zzso brain, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso These same transcripts were also detected in zzso zzso human tumor cell lines derived from breast and lung zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso resulted in suppression of colony formation of the zzso zzso human breast cancer cell line, zzso a decreased rate of cell growth, and induction of zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso may play a role in regulation of proliferation of zzso expressing zzso
