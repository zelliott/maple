The reported increase in zzso activity of hearts from transgenic mice zzso zzso the human beta zzso zzso zzso was explained by spontaneously active beta zzso that stimulate the zzso cascade in the absence of an zzso In order to examine altered zzso function on a cellular level, we have investigated zzso calcium current zzso and cell zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and wild type animals zzso served as zzso 

zzso zzso density was measured by zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso was assessed by standard zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso was measured as cell zzso in zzso zzso and as force of contraction in zzso zzso left zzso 

zzso of beta zzso was confirmed by an almost zzso increase in zzso zzso The beta zzso zzso ratio in zzso mice was zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice were similar in size as judged by membrane zzso and two zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso (with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso response to zzso (1 zzso was almost zzso Cell zzso was not different in zzso zzso but smaller in maximum zzso when comparing zzso to control zzso zzso force of contraction in left zzso did not differ between zzso and zzso at any age zzso In zzso left zzso the zzso response to zzso was also zzso whereas responses to high zzso or zzso (1 zzso were present but zzso The rate of spontaneous beating of right zzso was elevated in zzso zzso 

Since only spontaneous beating rate but neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso activity were zzso our data fail to reveal evidence for spontaneously active, stimulating beta zzso in left atrium and zzso A zzso deficit unrelated to the zzso zzso is evident in zzso zzso and left zzso
