zzso zzso of skeletal muscle is a common clinical problem and its exact mechanisms have not been fully zzso Previous studies suggested that disuse muscle zzso is realized through the zzso of one or more cell signaling zzso but studies have shown that disuse zzso is the zzso of the zzso caused extensive decomposition of the zzso The present researches for disuse zzso mainly focus on regulatory role in the upstream signaling molecules zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso and a plurality of signal zzso zzso or zzso and zzso then through the zzso to influence the metabolism of zzso But regulation of expression of zzso and zzso still to be zzso zzso in disuse zzso also needs to be further studied with zzso confirmation and functional gene zzso The paper summarized recent original articles about the researches of skeletal muscle disuse zzso and reviewed the various signal pathways and related zzso protein metabolism of disuse muscle zzso
