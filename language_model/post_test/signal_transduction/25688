The zzso signaling zzso has been involved in the downstream zzso effects of zzso in the zzso of cognitive deficits and related brain activity in zzso as well as in response to treatment with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been associated with their respective protein expression and with zzso zzso and brain function, including zzso Given the strong potential for their relationship, we investigated the interaction of these zzso on multiple molecular and in zzso zzso associated with this signaling zzso We measured zzso and zzso proteins and zzso in human peripheral blood zzso cells, functional zzso zzso response during zzso control, behavioral accuracy during sustained attention, and response to 8 zzso of treatment with zzso in a total of 190 healthy subjects and 66 patients with zzso In healthy subjects, we found that the interaction between the T zzso of zzso zzso and the A zzso of zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso protein levels and reduced zzso of zzso as well as with altered zzso response and reduced behavioral accuracy during zzso zzso On the other hand, interaction of these two zzso was associated with greater improvement of Positive and zzso zzso zzso scores in patients with schizophrenia after treatment with zzso The present results indicate that these functional zzso are zzso associated with multiple zzso of relevance to zzso Our results also lend support to further investigation of this downstream molecular zzso in the zzso and treatment of this zzso
