zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which plays an important role in the immune system by regulating proliferation and differentiation of a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso These biological effects are zzso via binding of zzso to specific zzso high affinity zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses high affinity binding sites when zzso in zzso cells, its zzso domain lacks consensus motifs for known signal zzso molecules such as a zzso zzso In this study, we use a DNA deletion approach to explore the mechanism of signal zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso expressed in a zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso Using this system, we have identified the critical region of the zzso domain of human zzso for human zzso zzso of a growth signal in these zzso Our data indicate that the critical region for signal zzso is located between zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This region is highly zzso between mouse and human zzso but lacks zzso with other zzso zzso Our studies additionally demonstrate that the zzso domain is not essential for forming high affinity zzso sites nor for zzso zzso
