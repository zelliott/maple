zzso oxide zzso has emerged as a key signaling zzso in plant secondary zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular basis of NO signaling in zzso secondary zzso zzso of plant cells, we determined the contents of zzso salicylic acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso suspension cells treated with the zzso prepared from cell walls of zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso induced NO burst, zzso zzso and zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso production was suppressed by zzso oxide specific scavenger zzso indicating that NO was essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso NO burst, and zzso zzso though the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso in transgenic cells was blocked by zzso which suggested that zzso acted downstream of NO and its zzso was controlled by zzso External application of NO via its donor sodium zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and the zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso which indicated that NO induced zzso production through a zzso signal zzso in the transgenic zzso zzso application of zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso and reversed the zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso in transgenic cells, which indicated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso in the cells and that zzso might be used as a substitute for zzso to mediate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was, therefore, concluded that NO might mediate the zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso signal pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and transgenic zzso cells zzso
