The zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts major zzso actions through three distinct zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso Among these three zzso the zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in zzso zzso and mediates the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso To investigate the functional roles of zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene targeting was used to create a mouse model lacking the zzso zzso gene zzso Under resting conditions, circulating zzso of zzso and zzso were lower in zzso mice compared with zzso mice zzso The normal increase in circulating zzso levels in response to zzso administration of zzso was impaired in zzso mice, while zzso zzso zzso release in the zzso mice was not significantly different from that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso release from primary cultured zzso cells in zzso mice was also zzso Furthermore, the increase in zzso after a forced swim stress was significantly suppressed in zzso zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that the zzso zzso plays a crucial role in regulating zzso axis zzso It does this by maintaining zzso and zzso levels, not only under stress but also under zzso zzso
