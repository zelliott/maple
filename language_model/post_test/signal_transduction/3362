zzso oxygen species zzso act as signal molecules for a variety of processes in zzso However, many questions about the roles of zzso in plants remain to be zzso Here, we report the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso signaling in barley zzso zzso zzso zzso The production of hydrogen zzso zzso a type of zzso was induced by zzso in zzso cells but suppressed by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso appeared to promote the induction of zzso by zzso In contrast, antioxidants suppressed the induction of zzso zzso zzso seems to function in zzso and zzso zzso and in regulation of zzso production, in zzso zzso To identify the target of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso between zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and their roles in zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso had little effect on the degradation of zzso the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but it promoted the production of the zzso zzso zzso which acts downstream of zzso and involves induction of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso suppressed the production of zzso zzso which is induced by zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso From these zzso we concluded that zzso released the repression of zzso zzso by zzso and consequently promoted the production of zzso zzso thus suggesting that the zzso generated by zzso in zzso cells is a signal zzso that zzso zzso zzso
