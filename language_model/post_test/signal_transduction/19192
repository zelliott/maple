zzso valve formation is crucial for embryonic and adult heart zzso zzso zzso constitute the most common zzso cardiac zzso but little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating valve formation and zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal integration establish a zzso field between 2 chamber zzso zzso zzso occurs through the zzso of zzso zzso transition zzso exclusively in prospective valve zzso Mice with zzso zzso zzso activity zzso express zzso and zzso They also display an activated zzso gene program in zzso and a partial zzso zzso in zzso that becomes invasive upon zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso transformation and invasion, whereas zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso stabilizing zzso and promoting zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signals is consistent with zzso signaling being attenuated after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso extends zzso expression to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso deletion abrogates zzso zzso gene zzso and extends zzso expression to the zzso zzso This embryonic zzso relationship may be relevant in adult valve disease, in which decreased zzso signaling causes valve zzso cell formation, fibrosis, and zzso
