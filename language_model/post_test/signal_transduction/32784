Cell zzso responses to the leukemia zzso factor zzso 6 zzso family are zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the signal zzso zzso or of two zzso molecules followed by zzso of the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso In order to dissect the contribution of zzso and zzso individually, zzso molecules consisting of the zzso domain of the zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso and various zzso forms of the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso were expressed in embryonic stem zzso cells to test for suppression of zzso or in a zzso plasma zzso cell line to assess for induction of zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso sites were zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso which lacked intact Box 3 zzso zzso showed decreased zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso activity and suppress zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso within the Box 3 region of the zzso abolished zzso suppression of differentiation without affecting the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, distinct zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and differentiation suppressing zzso
