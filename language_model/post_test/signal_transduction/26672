zzso zzso is zzso and has two validated zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso regulatory zzso 2 zzso negative regulators of zzso by zzso zzso zzso We investigated the role of swimming training on cardiac zzso expression related to zzso 

Female zzso rats were assigned to three groups: sedentary zzso training 1 zzso moderate zzso and training 2 zzso high zzso zzso consisted of 60 zzso of zzso five times per week for 10 zzso with zzso body zzso zzso consisted of the same protocol of zzso until the eighth week; in the ninth week, rats trained for two times a day, and in the 10th week, rats trained for three times a zzso zzso and zzso gene expression analysis was performed by real-time zzso chain reaction in heart zzso We assessed markers of training, the cardiac zzso ratio, cardiac protein expression of zzso zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso 

The cardiac zzso ratio increased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso protein expression was increased zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso correlated with zzso The zzso target zzso protein level decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso which consequently favored an increase in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the gene expression of zzso the other zzso target, was reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and there was an increase in protein expression of components of the zzso signaling zzso in the trained zzso 

This study showed that zzso training promotes an increase in the expression of zzso and that this may be related to zzso cardiac zzso by indirect regulation of the zzso zzso and direct regulation of its targets that zzso in an increase in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso
