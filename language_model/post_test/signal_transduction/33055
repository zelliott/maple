Changes in environmental conditions such as the addition of growth factors or zzso of cells in culture first affect immediate response zzso We have shown previously that short wavelength zzso zzso zzso elicits massive zzso of several growth factor zzso zzso At the level of the immediate response gene zzso these pathways activate the zzso factor complex serum response factor zzso which mediates part of the zzso zzso zzso These studies have, however, suggested that more that one zzso is required for full zzso responsiveness of zzso Using appropriate promoter zzso and zzso zzso response element zzso protein zzso we now find that zzso zzso zzso depends also on the zzso at position zzso of the zzso promoter and on the functionality of a zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso at zzso 133 and 63, respectively, preceded by and dependent on zzso of zzso and of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso 2 are also activated by zzso zzso does not, at least not zzso participate in this zzso zzso to zzso and zzso as it is not zzso dependent, and zzso is a poor zzso for zzso zzso 2 in zzso On the basis of resistance to the growth factor zzso inhibitor zzso and of several types of zzso experiments, the zzso zzso zzso represents an as yet zzso route of zzso signal zzso independent of zzso growth factor receptors and different from the zzso zzso zzso
