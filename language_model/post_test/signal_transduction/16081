zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with pulmonary hypertension and zzso Administration of zzso oxide zzso alone remains ineffective in zzso zzso We investigated in near zzso zzso with and without zzso the role of zzso zzso zzso the zzso activated by NO in increasing zzso zzso zzso and the role of zzso zzso 5, the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was surgically created in fetal zzso at 85 days of zzso Pulmonary zzso were assessed by means of pressure and blood flow zzso zzso zzso In zzso we tested drugs on rings of isolated pulmonary zzso 

In zzso sodium zzso a direct NO zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both zzso 5 blockers, reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by sodium zzso and the zzso of zzso 5 by zzso were less effective in zzso zzso In zzso the stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso 5 by zzso were less effective in pulmonary vascular rings from zzso zzso The zzso zzso in rings from zzso animals was higher when associated with the zzso 5 inhibitor zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso 5 play a role in controlling pulmonary vascular tone in fetal zzso with or without zzso Both zzso seem to be impaired in fetal zzso with zzso
