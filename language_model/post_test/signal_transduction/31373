To examine the role of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 5 and zzso of zzso signaling zzso in the zzso between growth hormone and insulin zzso signaling in fat zzso 

zzso differentiated zzso zzso were exposed to zzso growth hormone zzso or both of these growth factors, and the zzso of zzso proteins and zzso protein zzso was examined using zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso was assessed by Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso transport was also zzso 

We observed that zzso not zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso in a manner that was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or new protein zzso zzso strongly induced zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had a much less potent effect on zzso zzso zzso Because zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we examined the zzso between these signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso However, zzso did not block the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did not block the zzso induction of zzso activity or of increased zzso zzso We observed that neither new protein synthesis nor zzso of zzso 1 and 2 were required for the zzso of zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that blocking the induction of the zzso protein has no effect on the zzso of zzso signaling and support recent studies suggesting that zzso proteins have additional zzso In addition, these studies demonstrate that zzso zzso expression is insufficient to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in zzso
