Once considered simply as the main source of zzso zzso are now implicated in the control of many additional aspects of cell zzso such as calcium zzso and pathology, as in injury incurred on zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso accompanied by low-level zzso production, but they can respond to elevated zzso zzso by increasing their own zzso production, a phenomenon termed zzso zzso release zzso Two modes of zzso have been zzso In the first mode of zzso enhanced zzso leads to zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso yielding a short-lived burst of zzso originating from the zzso electron transport chain zzso The second mode of zzso is zzso independent but is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso in the zzso triggers opening of the inner zzso membrane zzso channel zzso resulting in a brief increase in zzso zzso Both modes of zzso have been shown to transmit localized zzso zzso throughout the cardiac cell in the form of zzso or waves but are zzso distinct and may involve different zzso that serve as second zzso In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of these different modes of zzso
