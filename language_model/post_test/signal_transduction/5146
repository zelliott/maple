In many zzso including brain, zzso action is predominantly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, leading to changes in gene zzso However, zzso can also exert rapid actions on electrical activity of zzso zzso Here, we investigate whether both responses occur in a single cell type, focusing on three specific populations known to be influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso nucleus in female zzso We performed zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso after in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we carried out in zzso zzso in slices from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein driven by the zzso or zzso zzso promoters as well as from zzso mice to assess acute electrical responses to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed zzso in zzso mice, rising to zzso after zzso zzso All zzso zzso also showed a rapid increase in firing rate after zzso zzso In contrast, very few zzso zzso zzso showed zzso in response to zzso and none showed a change in electrical zzso Finally, in the zzso nucleus, most zzso zzso responded to zzso treatment with an increase in zzso but only zzso zzso showed changes in electrical activity in response to zzso These observations show that zzso recruits different combinations of electrical and zzso responses in zzso depending upon their anatomical location and zzso This may be critical in establishing appropriate responses to zzso under different zzso zzso
