zzso zzso zzso account for approximately zzso of zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso We have shown previously that zzso surface expression of a zzso fusion protein zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases activity of a zzso zzso zzso We show here that human zzso zzso incorporated into this fusion protein attenuated or abolished zzso zzso zzso Point zzso and zzso showed that zzso current expression requires integrity of a region encompassing the putative coiled zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso Whereas these zzso zzso did not exhibit dominant negative zzso zzso of a fusion protein expressing the interacting zzso zzso tail of zzso did suppress zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso fusion protein moderately activated zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological profile of the current has been zzso zzso expression of the zzso fusion in zzso cells was also associated with zzso of zzso channels and increased zzso zzso
