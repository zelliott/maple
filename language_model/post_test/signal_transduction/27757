To explore the zzso by which zzso C zzso 2 zzso in B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso we have studied the function of zzso 2 zzso in B cells deficient in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2 domain zzso resulted in the complete loss of zzso zzso zzso generation upon zzso zzso A possible explanation for the zzso requirement was provided by findings that this zzso abrogates the association of zzso 2 with an zzso protein zzso Moreover, expression of a zzso form zzso 2) with zzso zzso required zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso Together, our results suggest a central role for the zzso domain in directing zzso 2 into the close proximity of zzso signaling complex by its association with zzso zzso zzso 2 becomes zzso zzso and thereby zzso
