zzso zzso released from plant cell walls by pathogen zzso induce a variety of host defense zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso increase resistance to the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso salicylic acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that about 50% of the genes regulated by zzso including genes zzso zzso involved in secondary zzso show a similar change of expression during zzso zzso zzso In particular, expression of zzso zzso zzso is strongly zzso by both zzso and infection independently of zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatments do not enhance resistance to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso or in zzso after pathogen and zzso a zzso with severely impaired zzso expression in response to zzso zzso to zzso the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced resistance to zzso zzso in a zzso manner, independently of zzso zzso and zzso This work suggests, therefore, that zzso released from the cell wall during pathogen infection contribute to zzso resistance against zzso pathogens through a signaling zzso also activated by zzso molecular pattern zzso
