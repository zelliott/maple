zzso zzso is a zzso protein that can be shed, and act as a circulating hormone and zzso several signaling zzso There also exists a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso protein zzso zzso in both human and zzso The potential zzso gene zzso has been recently found to participate in the progression of several different human zzso In the current study, we undertook to study the expression and activity of zzso in lung cancer cell line zzso zzso expression was studied by using zzso and western zzso zzso of zzso on cell growth and zzso were assessed using zzso and scratch zzso zzso and the zzso was assessed by zzso zzso signaling zzso activity was measured by western zzso We established that the zzso was zzso expressed in zzso cells, but the expression level is lower compared with normal lung zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso could inhibit the cell zzso zzso and induce zzso in a zzso zzso Also, we report zzso could inhibit zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathway, and it is involved in zzso growth zzso These studies indicate zzso works as a potential tumor zzso in lung cancer, and suggest that the zzso tumor zzso activities could be zzso through its zzso zzso These results suggest the use of zzso or zzso as potential strategy for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for lung zzso
