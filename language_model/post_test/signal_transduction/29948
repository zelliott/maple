zzso zzso of zzso zzso code zzso a compound that mimics the zzso effects of zzso zzso in the zzso range in zzso but has the advantage of blocking zzso transport and retaining its efficacy in zzso tumor cells, were tested for their ability to induce zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso and, especially, the new lead zzso compounds zzso and zzso reduce the growth and integrity of zzso zzso zzso cells more effectively than zzso suggesting that various zzso group zzso at zzso may enhance the zzso of the parent zzso zzso DNA zzso a late marker of zzso is similarly induced in a zzso manner by increasing zzso of zzso and zzso at 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an early event required for cells committed to zzso is detected within 3-6 zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso In zzso with the fact that the zzso 9 and 3 cascade is responsible for zzso zzso the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are induced by zzso in the same zzso and zzso manners and to the same zzso degrees in both the zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Interestingly, a zzso pulse treatment is sufficient for zzso and zzso to zzso induce zzso and zzso activities at 6 zzso The release of zzso zzso c zzso c) is also detected within zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso a finding consistent with the fact that zzso c is the zzso trigger that activates zzso Moreover, zzso zzso induce zzso c release, zzso and zzso activities and zzso zzso in relation with their abilities to decrease tumor cell growth and integrity, zzso and zzso being consistently the most zzso Since zzso zzso 2 and 8 may both act upstream of zzso to promote zzso c release, it is significant to show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities at 6 and 9 zzso zzso During zzso treatment, the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso totally blocks zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso does not prevent zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity is an upstream event critical for the zzso of the downstream zzso 9 and 3 zzso including the zzso amplification loop through zzso However, these zzso and zzso zzso fail to alter zzso zzso c release, suggesting that zzso might also target zzso independently from zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which block the induction of zzso c release and zzso zzso and -9 activities by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all fail to inhibit zzso zzso c release and zzso zzso and -9 activities, suggesting that the zzso signaling zzso is not involved in the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso trigger zzso in zzso zzso
