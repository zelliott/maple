The selection of a suitable scaffold material is important for zzso tissue zzso as the characteristics of zzso can potentially influence cell proliferation and zzso We compared the effects of different scaffolds on zzso zzso based on dental pulp stem cells zzso and investigated the regulatory mechanisms of zzso differentiation of zzso by these zzso Five different scaffolds were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ceramic bovine bone zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured on zzso and zzso exhibited higher levels of alkaline zzso zzso activity and zzso expression of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than those cultured on the other three zzso Further, the zzso levels of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cultured on zzso and zzso were also significantly enhanced compared with the other three zzso and their zzso significantly inhibited zzso differentiation as assessed by zzso activity and zzso expression of zzso and zzso The zzso experiment confirmed these results and showed a large amount of zzso zzso complex zzso including zzso zzso and zzso only in the zzso and zzso zzso The results indicated that natural zzso scaffolds zzso and zzso have potential as attractive scaffolds for zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso through the zzso signaling zzso
