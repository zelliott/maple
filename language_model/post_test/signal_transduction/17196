zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a pivotal role in several zzso signaling zzso that are involved in gene transcription, zzso zzso energy zzso cell cycle regulation, and zzso This zzso has zzso functions, and the importance of its activity has recently been shown in zzso and zzso In addition to its regulatory function in several zzso events, changes in zzso activity have been associated with many psychiatric and neurodegenerative zzso such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and zzso zzso zzso the reports of its involvement in several zzso it has become increasingly apparent that zzso might be a common therapeutic target for different classes of psychiatric drugs, and also that the zzso ratio may be a useful zzso to determine the zzso changes that might occur during zzso zzso Although zzso is commonly described as a key zzso in a plethora of signaling zzso originally it was identified as playing an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso given its ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso Acting as a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso which results in a decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso synthesis and storage, while its zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso and increase in zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso muscle and zzso zzso levels are reduced by zzso treatment, and this effect seems to be related to an effect of drugs on zzso zzso zzso zzso is also abundantly found in zzso where it is considered a major energy source, required for a variety of its functions, including the release zzso Recently, analysis of zzso from patients with late-life major depression showed that active forms of zzso expression were zzso by continuous treatment with zzso Here, we hypothesized that the zzso of zzso in zzso might be used as a peripheral zzso of zzso zzso Since it has been recently demonstrated that the zzso of zzso activity causes changes in zzso stores, the zzso levels in zzso could be used to zzso the effects of drugs that have this zzso as a target, or diseases where its activity is zzso In conclusion, we hypothesized that the determination of zzso peripherally may be useful to indicate a change in the activity of this zzso providing a faster and zzso approach to guide the therapeutic procedures for the zzso
