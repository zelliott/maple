zzso mediate the perception of zzso signals and the zzso of defenses during insect zzso zzso changes in a plant's zzso zzso but how these changes are regulated remains zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso makes zzso zzso highly susceptible to insect zzso suggesting that defense zzso is under the direct control of zzso zzso Using zzso we characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We predicted the targets of zzso zzso zzso in the genes related to zzso signaling zzso acid, zzso and zzso known to mediate resistance responses, and we measured the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso transcripts and zzso levels in zzso experiments with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso severely altered the induced transcript zzso of 8 of the 10 zzso reduced zzso and enhanced zzso levels after zzso Adding zzso completely restored the insect resistance of zzso zzso zzso plants had zzso rates, growth, and zzso output indistinguishable from that of zzso plants, suggesting zzso primary zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso plants to zzso is due to altered zzso signaling and that zzso play a central role in zzso the large-scale zzso changes that occur after zzso zzso Given the diversity of zzso that are zzso after insect attack and the recent demonstration of the ability of zzso zzso to silence transcript zzso in zzso larvae zzso the zzso responses of plants may also function as direct zzso
