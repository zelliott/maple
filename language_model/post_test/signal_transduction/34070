The zzso of zzso signaling in the hearts of zzso zzso zzso simulated zzso rats has not been zzso In the present study, we adopted the rat tail suspension for 4 zzso to simulate zzso then the effects of simulated zzso on zzso signaling were zzso Mean zzso blood pressure zzso left zzso pressure zzso zzso function zzso and zzso function zzso were monitored in the course of the in zzso zzso Single rat zzso zzso was obtained by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contraction, and zzso production in response to zzso stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso stimulation with zzso were measured, and zzso protein was also zzso Compared with the control group, no significant changes were found in heart weight, body weight and zzso while zzso and zzso were significantly zzso The zzso decrease, zzso increase, and zzso in response to zzso administration were significantly attenuated in the zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso induced zzso contraction and zzso production in zzso of zzso in the zzso rats were significantly zzso The biologically active zzso zzso zzso zzso in the heart, was zzso Both the increased zzso induced contraction and zzso production in response to zzso were also significantly attenuated in the simulated zzso zzso Above results indicated that impaired function of zzso zzso causes zzso zzso which may be partly responsible for the depression of cardiac zzso
