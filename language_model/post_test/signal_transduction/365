zzso of zzso acid receptors zzso in adult zzso have been poorly zzso Here we investigated potential zzso action of zzso zzso an zzso zzso available for the treatment of acute zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso protected zzso zzso in rat zzso slice culture from injury zzso by zzso zzso without affecting production of zzso oxide, a key zzso of cell zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by another zzso zzso zzso but not by a zzso X zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso with zzso We observed zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso slice culture and also found that zzso increased tissue level of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso and the zzso effect of zzso was suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso These results reveal a novel action of zzso zzso by enhancement of zzso zzso Finally, oral administration of zzso prevented zzso cell loss in the zzso zzso induced by local injection of zzso in mice, indicating that zzso are a promising target of zzso for neurodegenerative zzso
