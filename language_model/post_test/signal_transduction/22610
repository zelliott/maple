zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and activated T cells by an unknown zzso zzso is a novel function for a zzso zzso moreover, given the ubiquitous distribution of the zzso zzso recognized by zzso it is not clear how zzso to and signaling by zzso is zzso We have determined that zzso binds to a restricted set of T cell surface zzso and that only zzso zzso and zzso appear to directly participate in zzso zzso To determine whether these specific zzso interact zzso or independently to deliver the zzso death zzso we examined the cell surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso binding to human T cell lines and human zzso We found that zzso binding resulted in a dramatic zzso of these zzso into zzso membrane zzso on the cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso on large islands on zzso zzso protruding from the cell zzso These islands also included zzso zzso In addition, the exposure of zzso on the surface of zzso cells occurred very zzso zzso and zzso zzso in small patches away from the membrane zzso which excluded zzso zzso zzso segregation was not seen on cells that did not die in response to zzso including mature zzso suggesting that spatial zzso of receptors into specific zzso is required for triggering zzso
