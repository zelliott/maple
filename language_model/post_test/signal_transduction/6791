zzso of zzso B virus zzso with zzso C virus zzso is quite common, leading to an increase in morbidity and zzso As such, zzso vaccination is recommended in zzso zzso However, zzso vaccine responses in zzso individuals are often blunted compared with zzso zzso The mechanism for this failure of vaccine response in zzso subjects remains zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and function of an zzso zzso killer cell zzso zzso zzso G member 1 zzso in the regulation of zzso T cells and zzso vaccine responses during zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso was zzso on zzso T cells from zzso zzso vaccine zzso compared with zzso vaccine zzso The capacity of zzso T cells to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso associated with the level of zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso signaling resulted in a significant improvement in zzso T cell proliferation and zzso production in zzso zzso vaccine zzso in response to zzso zzso Moreover, blockade of zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso and decreased the expression of cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso which subsequently enhanced the expression of zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell responses to zzso and zzso a state of immune zzso in individuals with zzso infection, raising the possibility that blocking this zzso zzso might improve zzso vaccine responses in the setting of chronic viral zzso
