The zzso zzso zzso has been recently shown to protect pancreatic beta cells from toxic zzso zzso through interaction with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, expression of the zzso zzso zzso in the mouse pancreatic beta cell line zzso led us to investigate its possible functional role in these zzso By using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide evidence for a functional zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso of both receptors is necessary for the protective action of zzso on zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso and are zzso at the plasma zzso Thus, the zzso response in beta cells is controlled by the formation of a functional complex between zzso and zzso
