Several lines of in zzso evidence suggest the potential role of zzso in zzso and collagen deposition, two crucial steps in the wound healing zzso In this report, we examined the role of zzso in the skin wound healing process utilizing zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso wounding induced zzso zzso and protein expression by zzso zzso and T cells, with a zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso gene zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso zzso mice exhibited an accelerated wound healing as evidenced by rapid wound closure and zzso tissue zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mice exhibited enhanced zzso with zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression in wound sites, compared with zzso mice, despite a reduction in the zzso zzso zzso and T zzso zzso zzso mice also exhibited accelerated collagen deposition with enhanced production of zzso protein in wound sites, compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, the absence of zzso zzso the zzso signaling pathway, as evidenced by increases in the levels of total and zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in the levels of zzso These results demonstrate that there is zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in the wound healing zzso
