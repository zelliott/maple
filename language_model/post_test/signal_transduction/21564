Most human zzso express zzso zzso on the cell surface, and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso of these zzso In contrast, zzso surface expression of zzso is suppressed in zzso zzso We report here the use of a combination of sodium zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso for restoration of the surface zzso zzso We observed a large increase of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This was due to induction of zzso surface expression and increased zzso to zzso death signaling after zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression by specific zzso also effectively increased surface zzso expression following zzso zzso zzso of the surface zzso levels was based on an increase in the efficiency of zzso to the cell surface and stabilization of zzso protein on the cell surface, rather than on acceleration of the zzso gene zzso Data obtained demonstrate that the combination of zzso with zzso of zzso may affect the target cancer cells via induction of zzso death zzso
