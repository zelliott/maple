In this study we investigated zzso effects of zzso through regulation of zzso zzso zzso signaling in a chronic zzso pain model induced by chronic zzso injury zzso of the zzso zzso 

The von Frey and zzso tests were performed to assess the degree of mechanical and zzso changes zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the expressions of zzso Western zzso zzso were used to evaluate the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso administration of zzso zzso 80 zzso could prevent the development of mechanical zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso administration of zzso decreased the mean zzso of zzso in the zzso horn and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling maybe the targets for the zzso effects of zzso on a chronic zzso pain model induced by chronic zzso injury of the zzso zzso
