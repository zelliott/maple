zzso zzso regulates plant development, mediates defense responses, and zzso zzso zzso as zzso Previously, we isolated the zzso zzso that partially suppressed zzso zzso to zzso and found that zzso zzso was involved in zzso signaling and zzso regulated zzso zzso of root growth in zzso In this study it was shown that zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso or in wild type treated with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso whereas it was induced by an application of zzso zzso It was also shown that the zzso zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso were induced slightly by zzso in the zzso zzso relative to wild zzso Furthermore, the expression level of zzso zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso which are components of the zzso zzso complexes that mediate the zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower in the zzso zzso than that in wild zzso These results suggested that zzso affects zzso zzso zzso by regulating the zzso zzso zzso genes and this regulation might be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
