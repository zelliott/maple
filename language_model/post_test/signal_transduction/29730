zzso factor zzso serves for cellular zzso survival, differentiation and transformation and is recognized as an important factor in cancer development, including zzso zzso zzso The purpose of present study is to determine the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso which is previously reported by us to be expressed only in the early stage of human zzso showing zzso zzso Of 5 human zzso cell lines zzso only zzso cells revealed zzso and protein expression as well as zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso construct (including zzso zzso full promoter zzso into zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso showed that high promoter activity was observed only in zzso cells without zzso and that this promoter activity was still observed when a shorter zzso zzso zzso promoter construct was zzso The zzso zzso promoter region contained 3 zzso sites, and zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso cells without zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso construct was suppressed with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso but not with zzso and zzso potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was also observed at protein expression level and in zzso activity of zzso Taken together, this study suggests that the zzso zzso is involved in the expression of zzso in zzso cells and may represent a new functional role of zzso for zzso zzso
