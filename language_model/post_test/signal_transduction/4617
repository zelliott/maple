zzso strategies for bone zzso involve the selection of suitable zzso growth factors, and cell types to mimic the cellular zzso where molecular and mechanical signals control the reconstruction of bone zzso The zzso of basic zzso growth factor zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso allows to prepare a zzso zzso able to interact with bone cells in a very specific zzso The biological activity of zzso evaluated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso shows that zzso immobilized on zzso provides the right signals to cells stimulating crucial zzso mechanisms of zzso proliferation and zzso
