The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso play a key role in regulating cell zzso zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso by the addition of a zzso zzso is critical for cellular zzso and signaling zzso This study investigates the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cell zzso proliferation and zzso using zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso which zzso the availability of zzso zzso zzso proliferation was assessed using an zzso of viable cell number and measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso was determined using the zzso pull-down zzso zzso was performed to study the effects on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth factor and zzso zzso proliferation and induced zzso These effects of zzso were attenuated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso toxin that specifically targets zzso also inhibited zzso incorporation and promoted zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression of zzso prevented zzso zzso and inhibited the zzso of zzso and the survival protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit zzso proliferation and promote zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that targeting zzso proteins with statins or zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic strategy in human zzso zzso zzso
