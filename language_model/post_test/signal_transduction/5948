zzso growth factor beta zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso proliferation in zzso and is suggested to be a key negative regulator of liver zzso To directly address the role of zzso signaling in liver zzso in zzso the zzso type II zzso gene zzso was selectively deleted in zzso by crossing zzso zzso conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing zzso under control of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso knockout zzso mice were zzso to the growth zzso effects of zzso The peak of DNA synthesis after zzso partial zzso occurred earlier zzso zzso 48 zzso and was zzso higher in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso entry by zzso zzso zzso coincided with the zzso of zzso protein and the early zzso of zzso D1 and zzso zzso However, by 120 hours after partial zzso zzso proliferation was back to baseline in both control and zzso zzso zzso zzso liver showed evidence of increased signaling by zzso A and persistent activity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A signaling by the specific inhibitor zzso resulted in increased zzso proliferation at 120 hours, particularly in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso regulates zzso to S phase transition of zzso but intact signaling by zzso is not required for termination of liver zzso Increased signaling by zzso A may compensate to regulate liver zzso when signaling through the zzso zzso is zzso and may be a principal factor in the termination of liver zzso
