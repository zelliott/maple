Signal zzso initiated by zzso and zzso was studied in zzso human zzso cells and in normal human bone cells zzso in the presence of zzso of signal zzso events, using zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso production as an end zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells and normal zzso with zzso increased zzso protein level several fold in the zzso zzso This effect of zzso was zzso by increased de zzso synthesis because zzso level increased to the same extent as protein level and zzso treatment had very little effect on zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso production was inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso with zzso a protein zzso C zzso or with zzso a zzso protein zzso inhibitor in both zzso cells and normal zzso In addition, zzso with zzso acid, an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso cells or zzso with zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso or zzso changes in zzso protein levels in the presence of zzso and zzso were associated with corresponding changes in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso and zzso increase zzso expression via distinct zzso signal zzso zzso
