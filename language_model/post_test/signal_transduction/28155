zzso or programmed cell death, is a vital zzso process to eliminate damaged or unwanted zzso zzso in zzso promote tumor formation and make cancer cells resistant to zzso This review provides an overview of recent advances in the understanding of zzso in human cancer zzso 

Recent studies revealed that the zzso machinery in humans consists of a molecular network of a large number of zzso These proteins regulate a cascade of events in zzso commitment and execution stages of zzso through multiple parallel zzso zzso of the basic mechanisms of zzso has shed light on how zzso is zzso in human cancer zzso zzso strategies based on zzso have also been designed to selectively target tumor zzso 

zzso the basic mechanisms of zzso and determining how cancer cells evade zzso will afford discoveries of new molecular targets and better cancer zzso
