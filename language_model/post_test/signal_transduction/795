The zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso In higher zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso direct zzso and nuclear zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso Recently, controversy has surrounded the role of zzso in zzso skeletal muscle cell zzso Here we examined the ability of zzso mice to undergo skeletal muscle zzso growth following mechanical overload zzso stimulation or zzso growth zzso zzso zzso Two distinct models of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, which show a approximately 50% reduction in total zzso and zzso zzso mice crossed with a zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso which show a greater than zzso loss of total zzso only in skeletal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice show essentially no defects in muscle growth in response to IGF-1 treatment or zzso zzso although zzso zzso mice show a zzso zzso in total fiber number in the zzso and a mild secondary reduction in growth, consistent with a zzso zzso in zzso Both groups of zzso mice show normal increases in zzso zzso following zzso or IGF-1 zzso However, zzso zzso switching was dramatically impaired in zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter transgenic mice failed to show a correlation between zzso or zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso We conclude that zzso expression is important during zzso and zzso zzso but not for muscle growth in response to zzso zzso
