zzso brain injury, a silent epidemic of modern societies, is a largely neglected area in drug development and no drug is currently available for the treatment of patients suffering from brain zzso Despite this grim situation, much progress has been made over the last two decades in closely related medical zzso such as spinal zzso injury, giving rise to a more optimistic approach to drug development in brain zzso Fundamental insights have been gained with animal models of central nervous system zzso trauma and spinal zzso zzso zzso drug candidates have been identified and two of these have progressed to clinical development for spinal zzso injury zzso If successful, these drug candidates may be used to treat brain trauma zzso zzso progress has also been made in understanding the fundamental molecular mechanism underlying irreversible zzso growth arrest in the injured zzso of higher zzso From these studies, we have learned that the zzso zzso bulb, previously regarded as a marker for failure of zzso growth, is not zzso but dynamic and, therefore, amenable to zzso zzso With the development of modified magnetic resonance imaging methods, zzso tracts can be zzso in the living human brain and such imaging methods will soon be used to evaluate the zzso potential of drug zzso These significant advances are expected to fundamentally change the often hopeless situation of brain trauma patients and will be the first step towards overcoming the silent epidemic of brain zzso
