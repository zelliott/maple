zzso zzso levels are modulated by hormones and zzso with specific effects on zzso and zzso To understand how the same second zzso conveys different information, zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso into zzso were used to monitor zzso in adult rat zzso zzso zzso was not found in native zzso but was strongly expressed in infected zzso In whole cell zzso experiments, the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso current observed only in infected cells, which was thus identified as the zzso current zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso although the zzso efficiency was approximately 5 times lower than with zzso However, zzso and zzso exerted a similar zzso increase of the zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso with a higher sensitivity for zzso indicated that this difference is caused by the zzso of a localized fraction of zzso channels by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso blockade with zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso dramatically zzso zzso and zzso zzso A similar zzso of zzso stimulation occurred when zzso was zzso whereas zzso zzso had a smaller effect (by zzso zzso and zzso increased total zzso and zzso activities in zzso although this effect was insensitive to zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso stimulation of zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso levels are zzso regulated by a negative feedback involving zzso stimulation of zzso zzso
