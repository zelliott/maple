Although inappropriate zzso of the zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso zzso zzso the role of this signaling in liver zzso remains zzso To investigate this issue, we constructed a zzso mouse strain, zzso in which zzso 14 of the zzso gene zzso zzso coli zzso is flanked by zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at high zzso zzso zzso units zzso per zzso zzso the zzso gene in the liver and resulted in marked zzso zzso zzso and rapid zzso zzso signaling zzso was demonstrated by nuclear and zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and by the induction of zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2) in the zzso To test a long-term zzso effect, we zzso mice with lower doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso compatible with both survival and persistence of zzso zzso In these conditions, zzso of mice developed zzso zzso signaling was strongly activated in these zzso zzso The zzso were well, zzso or poorly zzso Indeed, their zzso and molecular features zzso human zzso Thus, deletion of zzso in the liver provides a valuable model of human zzso and, in this model, zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso is required for liver zzso
