zzso is a complex process requiring coordination of directional zzso and an increase in zzso cell size to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso dynamics during zzso is poorly zzso However, it is known that zzso thickness is related to the abundance of zzso zzso expressed on the zzso zzso Here we identify zzso an zzso zzso and severing zzso as a downstream target of zzso signaling in rat zzso cells zzso In isolated zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso and its upstream regulators, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and recruitment to the leading edge of the plasma zzso These changes are associated with rapid membrane expansion yielding a zzso increase in SC size within 30 zzso zzso zzso increase zzso of zzso zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso but fail to increase in size possibly due to stabilization of unusually long focal zzso zzso zzso zzso with sensory zzso do not zzso zzso analysis reveals that they unsuccessfully segregate or engage zzso and form only zzso zzso zzso After 48 h of zzso with zzso zzso zzso do not align or zzso on zzso and often form zzso with the underlying zzso This study identifies zzso and its upstream regulators, zzso and zzso as end targets of a zzso signaling zzso and demonstrates that zzso is necessary for dynamic changes in the zzso needed for zzso engagement and zzso by zzso
