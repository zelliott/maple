An inhibitor was found in the culture fluid of zzso zzso zzso which could inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity occurred in stationary phase culture zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor did not influence the cell growth and the zzso production by zzso zzso zzso when the zzso inhibitor was added into culture zzso The induced expression of zzso in the reporter strain zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by this zzso zzso whereas zzso could be relieved by increasing the auto zzso zzso The zzso sensing of zzso zzso was inhibited presumably by zzso the inducing activity of zzso zzso but not by zzso the production of zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the structure of the zzso inhibitor was different from that of zzso zzso
