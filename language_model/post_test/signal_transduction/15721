zzso zzso have been demonstrated to protect cells from zzso cell zzso zzso we show for the first time that zzso and zzso increase zzso production by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protect cells against zzso induced zzso oxygen species zzso formation and zzso Treatment with both compounds doubled CBS expression through zzso target of zzso zzso and increased zzso production in cultured rat smooth muscle zzso In addition, zzso and zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso zzso The beneficial effect of both compounds was minimized by zzso of their zzso and by pharmacological zzso of CBS or its zzso by zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso of CBS by zzso zzso also protected cells from zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso liver and heart prior to 24 h of zzso at zzso followed by 30 zzso of zzso at zzso zzso the expression of CBS, strongly reduced zzso activity and maintained the zzso pH compared to zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso protect cells against zzso induced damage by increasing zzso production zzso through zzso Our data identify a novel molecular link between zzso zzso and the zzso pathway, which may profoundly affect our understanding of the biological effects of zzso zzso
