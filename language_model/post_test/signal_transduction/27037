zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors in which the five known zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced with zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells zzso and zzso signaling parameters compared with cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones were chosen expressing similar numbers of receptors and zzso analysis of zzso binding showed high and low affinity binding of equal affinities for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of proteins to a much lesser degree in cells expressing zzso relative to cells expressing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso of zzso Surprisingly, cells expressing zzso or zzso showed little difference in dose response of zzso zzso incorporation or zzso stimulation of zzso protein zzso zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso growth of cells expressing zzso to the same extent as it did for cells expressing zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells failed to elicit an increase in zzso zzso activity or to stimulate zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that a significant proportion of zzso zzso signaling can occur through receptors with altered capacity to interact with zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso
