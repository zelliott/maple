Various studies, mostly in the past 5 years, have demonstrated that, in addition to their zzso function in regulating electrical zzso zzso zzso channels participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso can directly activate zzso linked to cellular zzso zzso serve as cell zzso molecules or components of the zzso and their activity can alter the expression of specific zzso Here, I review these findings and discuss the extent to which the molecular mechanisms of such zzso are zzso
