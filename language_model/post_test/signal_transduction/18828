In zzso rod outer segments zzso is suggested to be modulated by zzso zzso We aimed at zzso this hypothesis by recording saturated zzso in the rat zzso after single and double flashes of light and determining the time zzso to the beginning of the signal zzso The time course of zzso after a flash was calculated from a change of the spatial zzso concentration profile recorded in the space between the zzso After single flashes zzso increased zzso with the zzso of flash intensity, confirming the assumption that zzso is determined by zzso of a single species zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso was shortened up to zzso if the test flash was preceded by a conditioning zzso The zzso depended on the reduction of zzso induced by the zzso The data suggest that the zzso gain determining the amount of activated zzso is regulated by a zzso mechanism in a short time period zzso zzso after the test zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso reduced the gain up to zzso compared to its value in a zzso zzso The relation between zzso gain and zzso revealed a zzso value close to the dark level of zzso
