zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso involved in zzso iron zzso is activated in a zzso or zzso manner in part by the zzso system zzso zzso of either the zzso or the zzso gene resulted in a marked reduction of zzso zzso at the zzso promoter in zzso zzso however, it was observed that significant levels of zzso expression were maintained in the zzso suggesting that an additional zzso is involved in zzso A zzso search of the zzso zzso zzso sequence revealed a second zzso system, zzso by zzso and zzso that shares similarity with zzso and zzso zzso we have designated these genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso promoter expression demonstrated that zzso activity was fully abolished in strains from which both the zzso and the zzso zzso systems were zzso Similarly, deletion of the sensor zzso genes zzso and zzso or the genes zzso both of the response regulators zzso and zzso also eliminated zzso zzso at the zzso zzso We also show that the regulators zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso repression of the promoter upstream of zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso Evidence for cross talk between the zzso and zzso systems is zzso In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the zzso and zzso regulatory systems are critical for full zzso zzso at the zzso promoter and also suggest that these zzso systems are involved in the complex mechanism of the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
