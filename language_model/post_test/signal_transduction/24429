The zzso type of zzso zzso play an important role in development and behave as potent zzso in cultured zzso However, little is known about the molecular nature of the components that act in the zzso zzso in an zzso We characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso and found that animals defective in zzso are zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso results in a zzso growth arrest caused by a feeding behavior zzso that is due to a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso To zzso the molecular nature of the signaling pathways in which zzso zzso we screened for zzso of the zzso zzso We isolated 50 zzso that contain zzso in zzso which encodes two protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso most similar to zzso zzso mediates the action of the tumor promoter zzso zzso of zzso and treatment of zzso animals with zzso induce an identical growth arrest caused by zzso of zzso zzso which is dependent on zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a downstream target of both zzso signaling and zzso in modulating feeding and growth in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for the transforming capability of zzso zzso
