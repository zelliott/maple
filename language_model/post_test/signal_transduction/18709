In developing zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso cell types resulting in control of zzso zzso Previous studies using zzso zzso and zzso as well as transgenic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have suggested that this zzso zzso combination might regulate the zzso to zzso transition of the hair zzso To further understand the precise role of zzso and the zzso in the hair cycle, we have evaluated hair growth in the traditional zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso expression limited to the adult hair cycle resulted in the production of shorter hair zzso zzso analysis indicated that reduced proliferation in the zzso preceded the appearance of thinner hair zzso and shafts during late zzso zzso zzso revealed that the late zzso hair zzso of the zzso mice were surrounded by reduced numbers of smaller diameter zzso as compared to zzso Moreover, the fetal skins of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso had zzso increases in the zzso diameter, and density of zzso Finally, crossing the zzso zzso onto a zzso zzso background reversed the vascular changes as well as the delayed zzso exhibited by these zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso influence on the hair cycle is zzso in part by its effects on zzso
