zzso has potential zzso activity and has been shown to be involved in several signaling pathways including differentiation and zzso Our previous study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso cell death through regulation of the function of zzso and the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso human oral cancer zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso effects of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso showed zzso shape by zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso in zzso prepared by single emulsion was zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso fragments on the mass spectrum of zzso and the zzso of zzso standard could be found on the zzso spectrum by zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso effects and zzso in zzso zzso Compared to the zzso zzso cells, more zzso amount of zzso was found inside the treated zzso zzso zzso induced DNA fragmentation and zzso bodies in zzso zzso Both the activity and the expression levels of zzso and zzso were elevated in the treated zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bad and zzso the protein expression level of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest zzso are effective in enhancing zzso in human zzso cells and thus could provide potential for cancer zzso
