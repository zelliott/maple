Several models have been suggested above, describing possible modes of zzso checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso (by zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso turnover (in budding zzso zzso zzso modification (by zzso zzso zzso Aurora B or zzso zzso Several of these mechanisms could affect zzso activity by zzso competing for, and/or blocking the binding zzso for its zzso zzso they could reduce the zzso of zzso of zzso or prevent the release of zzso and thereby reduce zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso of zzso can determine the order of destruction of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Most zzso require multiple zzso binding events in order to build zzso zzso and only zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso for zzso Thus, if the zzso of zzso or the turnover of zzso zzso were impaired in zzso the degradation of zzso and zzso would no longer take place, which would result in zzso zzso Our results have highlighted the importance of zzso as an zzso zzso and suggest that it usually acts in concert with zzso to efficiently inhibit zzso Further experiments are necessary to fully understand their mechanism of action, and this will require a wide range of approaches including dynamic studies of the zzso of zzso and zzso through zzso zzso further structural zzso the identification of important zzso sites on both the checkpoint proteins and zzso and an in zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso We look forward to seeing the complex regulation of zzso progression being described over the coming zzso
