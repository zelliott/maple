zzso zzso zzso zzso is a widely expressed zzso zzso that functions in multiple signaling zzso The actions of zzso can be regulated by its zzso on zzso and zzso zzso although little is known about the conditions that promote zzso zzso In this study, we tested the ability of several zzso factors to stimulate zzso zzso zzso The growth factors zzso and zzso zzso induced the highest increase in zzso zzso at zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso acid, while zzso had little zzso Further investigation of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this occurs through a novel zzso family zzso mechanism that does not require focal zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso We also show that zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso this association does not require zzso The interaction of zzso and the zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso activity, and expression of zzso zzso does not promote zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso does not act as an zzso zzso zzso However, zzso mediates zzso zzso because zzso zzso migration was reduced by approximately 50% in cells lacking zzso or in cells with zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso can occur in response to diverse stimuli and can be zzso by various zzso zzso In the case of zzso we propose that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso possibly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for efficient cell migration in response to this growth zzso
