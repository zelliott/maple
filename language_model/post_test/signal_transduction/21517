Over the past few years, the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso and the proteins that regulate it have emerged as a signaling system of pre-eminent importance in human physiology and in an increasing number of zzso While zzso is present in all differentiated cell types, its discovery and early characterization were rooted in understanding zzso zzso zzso research efforts over two decades have yielded a large body of literature devoted to understanding zzso functioning in the immune zzso zzso has been found to play roles in many different compartments of the immune system during differentiation of immune cells and development of zzso zzso and during immune zzso zzso is the nuclear zzso of signaling pathways emanating from many zzso including those of the inflammatory tumor necrosis factor and zzso zzso zzso With this review, we hope to provide historical context and zzso the diverse zzso functions of zzso in the immune system before focusing on recent advances in zzso the molecular mechanisms that mediate cell zzso and zzso functions of this zzso signaling zzso zzso the genetic regulatory zzso of zzso zzso involves zzso zzso zzso studies, and zzso zzso
