It has been supposed that green tea zzso zzso have zzso effects on brain damage after brain zzso in animal zzso Little is known regarding zzso protective effects against the zzso barrier zzso disruption after zzso zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and the corresponding cellular mechanisms involved in the early stage of cerebral zzso 

Male zzso rats were subjected to a middle cerebral artery zzso zzso for 0, 30, 60, and 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso or vehicle was administered by zzso zzso twice a day for 30 days prior to zzso At different time points, the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso in zzso fragments of cerebral zzso tissue were zzso 

zzso reduced zzso zzso at 60 zzso and 120 zzso after zzso as compared with the vehicle zzso zzso electron zzso also revealed that zzso could reverse the opening of tight junction zzso barrier at 60 zzso and 120 zzso after zzso The decreased zzso and protein expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso fragments of cerebral zzso tissue were significantly prevented by treatment with zzso at the same time points after zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso could zzso the increase in the expression levels of zzso zzso and protein caused by cerebral zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso may act as a potential zzso agent against zzso damage at the early stage of focal cerebral zzso through the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
