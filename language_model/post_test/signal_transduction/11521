Cell responses to soluble regulatory factors may be strongly influenced by the mode of presentation of the factor, as in zzso versus zzso zzso The possibly diverse effect of presenting a growth factor in zzso as opposed to zzso (or zzso mode is an especially important issue in cell zzso We demonstrate here that migration behavior of human zzso zzso cells in response to stimulation by zzso growth factor zzso is zzso different for zzso presented in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso is added as an zzso factor to the medium of cells that express zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cell migration speed increases while directional persistence zzso When these zzso cells are made to also express via zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso form on the plasma zzso migration speed similarly increases, but directional persistence increases as zzso zzso of zzso zzso to these cells abrogates their enhanced directional zzso reducing their zzso to a level similar to zzso zzso If the zzso cells are instead zzso with a gene zzso zzso in a soluble form, migration speed and directional persistence were zzso Thus, zzso presentation of zzso at the plasma membrane in a zzso form provides these cells with an enhanced ability to migrate persistently in a given direction, consistent with their increased capability for organizing into zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso mode of zzso presentation generates a zzso response by the zzso These findings emphasize the functional importance of spatial restriction of zzso zzso and suggest critical implications for growth zzso therapeutic zzso
