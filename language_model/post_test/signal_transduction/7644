zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso family protein that mediates zzso outgrowth and the function as zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso domain of zzso is essential for regulating several key cell cycle signal zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein is reported to cause zzso and affects normal brain zzso zzso zzso in zzso domain of zzso protein has been involved to induce breast cancer and zzso zzso We performed molecular zzso studies to examine the effect of this zzso on its zzso zzso Further, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structural consequences of zzso zzso over the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso results indicated the loss of zzso affinity of zzso structure, which were further rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations, where a notable loss in 3-D zzso of zzso zzso domain was observed in zzso as compared to zzso Our results explained the underlying molecular mechanism behind the observed cancer associated zzso caused by zzso zzso in zzso zzso
