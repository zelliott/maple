zzso zzso of gene networks by using zzso zzso gene expression profiles is an essential step towards understanding the zzso structure of gene regulatory zzso Unfortunately, most of the current studies have been limited to zzso a small number of genes because the length of zzso gene expression profiles is fairly zzso One promising approach to overcome such a limitation is to zzso gene networks by exploring the potential zzso zzso which are sets of genes sharing a common function or involved in the same zzso 

In this article, we present a novel approach based on the state space model to identify the zzso zzso and zzso gene networks zzso The state space model has the potential to zzso large-scale gene networks, zzso of order zzso from zzso gene expression zzso zzso we succeeded in the identification of a cell cycle system by using the gene expression profiles of zzso zzso in which the length of the zzso and number of genes were 24 and zzso zzso However, when zzso shorter zzso data, zzso of length 10 or less, the zzso zzso of the state space model often fail due to zzso To extend the zzso of the state space model, we provide an approach to use the technical replicates of gene expression profiles, which are often measured in duplicate or zzso The use of technical replicates is important for achieving zzso zzso of gene networks with short zzso zzso The potential of the proposed method has been demonstrated through the zzso analysis of the gene expression profiles of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso undergoing growth factor zzso zzso
