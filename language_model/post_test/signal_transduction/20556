Our laboratory has previously reported that zzso zzso cells zzso express a regulatory cascade of classic zzso and receptors that communicate in an almost zzso manner to achieve zzso zzso In this paper we show that the similarity between neurotransmitter signaling in zzso and zzso extends to the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso many of which zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso specifically has been shown to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function in zzso by altering zzso sensitivity and zzso We now report that zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso in zzso and serves to zzso regulate zzso downstream signaling zzso Treatment of primary cultures of zzso with nicotine increased levels of zzso zzso and that increase was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso increase in zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that effect was blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In parallel with the increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso also increased levels of zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso signaling blocked the ability of the zzso zzso to increase zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso appears to act as a negative zzso of zzso zzso events by zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso or zzso are a potentially important therapeutic target to develop new therapies for zzso diseases characterized by increased zzso zzso
