The injured growth plate cartilage is often repaired by a bone bridge which causes bone growth zzso zzso previous studies have identified sequential zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso responses involved in the repair process, the molecular pathways which regulated these cellular events remain zzso In a rat growth plate injury model, tissue from the injury site was collected across the zzso of bone bridge formation using laser capture zzso and was subjected to zzso zzso gene expression zzso Real Time zzso and zzso analyses were used to confirm changes in levels of expression of some genes identified in zzso Four major functional groupings of zzso expressed genes with known roles in skeletal development were identified across the zzso of bone bridge formation, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and skeletal development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These studies provide insight into the molecular pathways which act zzso to regulate bone formation following growth plate cartilage injury and highlight potential therapeutic targets to limit bone bridge zzso
