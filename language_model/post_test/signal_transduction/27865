zzso muscle cells are exposed to growth factors and zzso that contribute to pathological states including airway zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso and zzso A common feature of several of these conditions is migration of smooth muscle beyond the initial boundary of the zzso Signal zzso pathways activated by zzso signals that zzso migration are mostly undefined in smooth zzso We measured migration of cultured zzso zzso in response to zzso growth factor, zzso and transforming growth zzso Cellular migration was blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso Time course experiments demonstrated increased zzso of zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso shock protein zzso which may zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity inhibited zzso of zzso zzso expression of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso an upstream zzso for zzso increased cell migration, whereas zzso of zzso zzso dominant negative zzso and an zzso zzso zzso blocked cell migration zzso The results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso by growth factors and zzso zzso regulates smooth muscle cell migration and may contribute to pathological states involving smooth muscle zzso
