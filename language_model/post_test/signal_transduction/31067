zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso I of zzso proteins that is zzso regulated by water availability and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants zzso this zzso factor zzso exhibit a characteristic zzso that includes a strong tolerance to water zzso Here we show that this zzso is a new component of zzso zzso zzso and that it zzso a marked delay in zzso Plants zzso zzso are less sensitive to external zzso enter the zzso zzso later and do not show the typical triple zzso Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own zzso promoter showed an inverse correlation between zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso Potential targets of zzso were identified by comparing the zzso of zzso and zzso plants using zzso and quantitative zzso zzso of this zzso has a major repressive effect on genes related to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and on genes related to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso studies in sunflower indicate that zzso transcript levels are elevated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso zzso with several genes zzso to the targets identified in the zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso We propose that zzso is involved in a novel zzso mechanism related to zzso zzso that functions to improve zzso zzso
