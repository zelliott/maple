Plants respond to changes in the environment by altering their growth zzso Light is one of the most important environmental cues and affects plants throughout the life zzso It is perceived by zzso such as zzso that absorb light of red and zzso zzso and control, for example, zzso zzso zzso zzso and shade avoidance zzso We report that the terminal zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in negative regulation of zzso dependent light zzso zzso shows defects in both zzso zzso and shade avoidance zzso Double zzso analysis indicates that zzso of the zzso light absorbing zzso family of plant zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to zzso in zzso and red light, zzso An overlap between genes regulated by light and by zzso has earlier been reported and, in zzso plants zzso zzso genes are zzso Further, we show that zzso binds to zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso might be involved in regulation of zzso light responses through zzso zzso
