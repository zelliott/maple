We zzso report recent advances in our understanding of transport protein zzso Numerous families of complex zzso transport proteins are believed to have arisen from short zzso zzso or zzso peptides by various types of zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways distinguish families, demonstrating independent origins for some, and allowing assignment of others to zzso Some families have diversified in zzso whereas others have remained zzso An example of zzso was discovered where a more complex carrier gave rise to a structurally and functionally simpler zzso The results described in this review article expand our understanding of protein zzso
