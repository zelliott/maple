Many zzso factors sensitize zzso Often they act simultaneously and/or zzso on zzso zzso We investigated if stimulation of the protein zzso C zzso zzso signaling zzso influences the signaling of a subsequent zzso zzso Central in zzso of zzso is their transient zzso to cellular zzso We found in cultured zzso zzso that only a first stimulation of the zzso signaling zzso resulted in zzso zzso We identified a novel zzso cascade to branch off upstream of zzso but downstream of zzso via zzso calcium zzso This signaling branch actively inhibited subsequent zzso and even attenuated ongoing zzso A second zzso stimulus was zzso from the zzso to the zzso branch of the signaling zzso Central for the zzso was zzso calcium increase and zzso zzso zzso in behavioral experiments, zzso of calcium stores switched zzso substances into desensitizing substances in a zzso zzso This mechanism was also observed by in zzso zzso zzso corroborating the peripheral location of the zzso Thus, we conclude that the net effect of signaling in zzso is defined by the context of the individual cell's signaling zzso
