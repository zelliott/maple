In response to liver injury or loss of liver mass, proliferation of mature liver cells is the zzso defense to restore liver zzso In the setting of chronic liver disease, however, the ability of zzso and zzso to zzso is blocked and small zzso zzso cells are zzso Recent studies have established the role of these zzso zzso cells in injury repair and zzso in patients with chronic liver disease and in experimental zzso Several signaling pathways linking zzso cell zzso and zzso have been identified, and there is increasing evidence that zzso (both physical and via soluble zzso between zzso cells and zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso zzso Even more exciting are new data examining the cellular components of the zzso cell zzso demonstrating that both resident liver cells and circulating cells from the bone zzso can function as stem cells, suggesting that there is a surprising degree of zzso plasticity such that zzso cells can contribute to the zzso population and vice zzso We highlight here recent findings from the literature demonstrating the cellular and functional complexity of the zzso cell zzso and emphasize some of the important questions that remain to drive future zzso
