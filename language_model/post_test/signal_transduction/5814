Based on zzso acid zzso zzso of seed zzso and zzso growth zzso we isolated an zzso overly sensitive zzso zzso caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso The dominant, zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppressed the zzso hypersensitivity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the expression of the silenced zzso zzso zzso silent information zzso and the silenced zzso in the zzso zzso and increased the frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and increased zzso in both the wild type and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are required for zzso and zzso DNA break repair, are expressed at higher levels in zzso and are enhanced by zzso while zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso plants are sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso and show zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso plants were early flowering with lower expression of zzso zzso C and higher expression of zzso zzso T and changed zzso modifications in the two zzso Our results suggest that zzso is involved in maintaining zzso states, HR, and zzso signaling in zzso
