Human zzso zzso and zzso express zzso zzso and all of the zzso for zzso processing, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso including the regulatory protein zzso In zzso zzso processing also occurs in the zzso a zzso zzso that specializes in the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso synthesis and release of the key hormones zzso alpha and zzso and zzso takes also place in zzso All four hormones have been reported to promote the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso bind to the zzso zzso zzso on the plasma membrane and activate the zzso zzso predominantly coupled to production of zzso and in some cell lines raising zzso calcium zzso In the zzso this zzso is redundant due to the high expression of zzso and zzso zzso events increase zzso this zzso is redundant due to the high expression of a zzso expression zzso activity to stimulate zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso cells showed that both zzso and zzso bind to the zzso with similar or different affinity depending on the species zzso vs zzso We have zzso the zzso based on the X-ray crystal structure of a zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso revealed that all 3 zzso peptides yield zzso stable zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is predicted to only have a kinetic effect on the zzso and zzso has even a weaker affinity for the zzso than zzso Based on these results the relative importance of zzso versus zzso in the human zzso has been zzso
