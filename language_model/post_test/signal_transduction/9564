zzso of the pulmonary arteries is a common feature among the zzso disorders that cause pulmonary zzso In these disorders, the remodeled pulmonary arteries often demonstrate inflammation and an zzso of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso within the zzso zzso tissue zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso that can influence both inflammation and zzso suggesting that zzso may contribute to the development of pulmonary zzso We recently reported on a model of pulmonary hypertension induced by vascular zzso in which a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was associated with the extensive proliferation of zzso and increased pulmonary artery zzso Based on these data, we zzso that zzso can suppress pulmonary hypertension by directly zzso the proliferation of zzso Here, we tested the effects of zzso zzso on pulmonary zzso zzso by using zzso mice in a model of pulmonary hypertension induced by zzso zzso with our hypothesis, mice that zzso zzso zzso reduced pulmonary hypertension and zzso compared with zzso mice, despite developing similar levels of pulmonary vascular inflammation in the zzso The zzso of zzso was also protective in a hypoxic model of pulmonary zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso and reduced the activity of the serum response zzso response element pathway, which is a critical signaling zzso for smooth muscle cell zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso can regulate pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary zzso zzso through its direct effects on zzso zzso the zzso of zzso activity in the pulmonary zzso may be beneficial in pulmonary zzso
