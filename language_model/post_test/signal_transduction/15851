Among zzso zzso root zzso zzso is one of the most important beneficial interactions providing zzso plants with zzso zzso Over the past years a number of genes required for root zzso zzso has been identified but most recently great advances have been made to dissect zzso pathways and molecular interactions triggered by a set of zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches have not only provided evidence for the cross talk between bacterial infection of the host plant and zzso of a root zzso but also gained insights into dynamic regulation processes underlying successful infection zzso Here, we zzso recent progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate and trigger cellular zzso zzso during this zzso zzso
