A zzso heart can fully zzso after zzso of up to zzso of its zzso During this process, newly formed coronary blood vessels zzso the zzso zzso The formation of coronary blood vessels during zzso heart zzso likely zzso embryonic coronary vessel development, which involves the zzso and proliferation of the zzso followed by an zzso zzso The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes are not well zzso We examined the role of zzso signaling in zzso primary cultured zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso hearts in zzso We observed that mural and zzso cell zzso including zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso Using a primary culture of zzso cells derived from heart zzso we found that zzso signaling is essential for zzso cell zzso zzso also zzso stress fibers and loss of zzso contacts of zzso cells in zzso zzso This effect is zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso expression of zzso and mural cell zzso and coronary blood vessel zzso Our data suggest that zzso signaling plays important roles in zzso function and coronary vessel formation during heart zzso in zzso
