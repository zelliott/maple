To review papers on myostatin published in 2003 and early zzso zzso is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass produced in this zzso zzso zzso of the myostatin gene or interaction of myostatin protein with zzso and other zzso proteins induce a zzso zzso in cattle and zzso this is assumed to result from zzso of muscle cell proliferation and DNA and protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso also controls muscle mass in other animals, and appears to affect zzso tissue zzso 

New protein interactions zzso myostatin that lead to double zzso as well as the induction of zzso with myostatin zzso or the generation of a myostatin conditional knockout zzso have been zzso zzso a transgenic mouse zzso myostatin and exhibiting reduced muscle mass in a zzso process has been zzso In addition, novel zzso zzso in the myostatin gene and genetic zzso regulating myostatin effects, and the characterization of the myostatin gene and its effects on metabolism in fish and chicken have been zzso Finally, the regulation of myostatin levels by growth hormone, zzso anabolic agents, nutritional status and exercise, the characterization of myostatin signaling zzso and the clarification of myostatin effects on cell replication and zzso are other important recent zzso 

These studies suggest that proteins and drugs that zzso myostatin, or interfere with its binding to its zzso may be useful for the therapy of wasting and degenerative muscle diseases and for the food zzso Other promising approaches may derive from new insights into the zzso cascade that mediates myostatin effects, and into the role of myostatin in the regulation of fat metabolism and of heart and muscle zzso after zzso
