zzso of peripheral nerve stimulates events in multiple cell types that initiate a limited inflammatory response to zzso zzso and simultaneous outgrowth of zzso into the zzso segments after zzso We found that pharmacological blockade of zzso impaired peripheral nerve zzso in mice subjected to zzso blockade and acute crush of the zzso zzso As our studies revealed that zzso was expressed in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso upon injury, we tested the role of zzso in these distinct cell types on nerve zzso zzso mice expressing signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso or peripheral zzso were generated and subjected to unilateral crush injury to the zzso zzso zzso mice displayed decreased functional and zzso recovery compared with zzso controls, as assessed by motor and sensory zzso zzso and zzso fiber zzso In double transgenic mice expressing signal zzso deficient zzso in both zzso zzso and peripheral zzso zzso was even further impaired, suggesting the critical interplay between zzso inflammation and zzso outgrowth in nerve zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling in inflammatory cells and peripheral zzso plays an important role in plasticity of the peripheral nervous zzso
