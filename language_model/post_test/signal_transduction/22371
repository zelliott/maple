The zzso zzso zzso is central for many essential cellular activities, such as zzso assembly and quality control of zzso and membrane zzso zzso bond formation, zzso zzso zzso zzso storage and zzso In addition, this zzso zzso zzso many zzso and/or zzso signaling cues reporting on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We are beginning to understand how these functions and pathways are integrated with one another to regulate zzso at cell, tissue and zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying the introduction of the proper set of zzso bonds into zzso proteins zzso zzso are strictly related to zzso zzso zzso stress sensing and signaling and provide a good example of the integration systems operative in the early zzso zzso
