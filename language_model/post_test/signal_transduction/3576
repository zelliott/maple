Global gene expression profiling was performed using zzso from human embryonic neural stem cells zzso and adult human zzso zzso neural stem cells zzso to define a gene expression pattern and signaling pathways that are specific for each cell zzso We have demonstrated large differences in the gene expression profile of human embryonic zzso and adult human zzso but less zzso between parallel zzso zzso of genes involved in neural tube development and patterning zzso zzso zzso marker genes zzso zzso zzso proliferation of neural zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in both cell zzso By Gene zzso 325 out of zzso investigated gene sets were zzso zzso 41 out of the 307 investigated Cellular zzso zzso categories, 45 out of the zzso investigated zzso zzso zzso categories, and 239 out of the zzso investigated Biological zzso zzso categories were zzso zzso zzso Class zzso had revealed that 75 out of zzso investigated gene sets passed the zzso significance zzso zzso of gene expression were explored in three signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are known to be involved in zzso cell fates zzso The zzso signature also zzso the role of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso complex family, including zzso and zzso were found specifically zzso in our zzso but not in zzso zzso in gene expression profile of transcripts controlling zzso zzso and signaling pathways might indicate differences in the therapeutic potential of our examined two cell populations in relation to in cell survival, zzso migration, and differentiation following zzso in different zzso zzso
