As indicated by various and some overlapped zzso of the dominant zzso the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a functional similarity and zzso To evaluate the contributions of their expression patterns determined by promoter activity and molecular properties of their gene products to zzso function, we examined zzso of transgenic plants expressing the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso by the zzso or zzso zzso When driven by the zzso promoter zzso each zzso zzso caused the zzso zzso that is, the zzso stature in the zzso stage, long and straight zzso in the dark, reduced lateral root formation, relatively mild zzso traits in zzso and a normal zzso response in zzso However, development of one or two zzso zzso was often arrested in zzso of the zzso and zzso plants, resulting in zzso or no zzso zzso Such defects in zzso were never seen in zzso or the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed that expression of zzso started specifically in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When driven by the zzso promoter zzso each zzso zzso zzso caused, in principle, zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding dominant zzso However, either the zzso or zzso zzso brought about zzso zzso stems almost identical to those of zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited complete loss of zzso as did zzso These results showed functional differences among the zzso zzso and zzso zzso though some zzso were determined by the promoter zzso
