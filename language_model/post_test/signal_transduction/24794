The list of zzso is growing at a steady zzso zzso it is over 8 years since the initial description of zzso gamma inducing factor zzso now called zzso this novel zzso is still not well zzso However, the data were sufficient to support the testing of zzso in experimental zzso zzso zzso is produced mainly by zzso zzso to zzso zzso does not possess a signal sequence allowing direct zzso through the plasma zzso zzso the exact mechanism of zzso zzso is not confirmed, it seems that, like zzso zzso is processed by the zzso zzso belonging to zzso family, especially by ICE zzso zzso converting zzso Among the target cells responding to zzso are T zzso and zzso cells, which, under the influence of zzso produce substantial amounts of zzso In this respect zzso seems to be even stronger than zzso zzso to zzso zzso stimulates zzso of T and zzso zzso Moreover, it enhances zzso zzso of zzso T and zzso zzso A potential role of zzso in zzso zzso is discussed in this article with special emphasis on the similarities with zzso and the potential mechanisms of its zzso activity in zzso models in zzso
