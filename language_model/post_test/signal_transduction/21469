zzso zzso is a critical zzso of the respiratory tract in zzso zzso The chronic infections with this zzso contribute to excessive inflammation and progressive lung damage in zzso zzso zzso The full repertoire of zzso products that promote inflammation in the zzso zzso lung is not zzso Here we show that zzso zzso DNA released from the zzso but not human DNA from zzso cells or zzso coli DNA, displays zzso properties and zzso human respiratory zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso a key zzso causing excessive zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not due to an increase in zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoter transcription, but instead depended on zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso No zzso of zzso was observed using conventional zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso although it could be demonstrated that parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were functional, since class B and C zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso zzso The zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso DNA was decreased by treatments that inhibit zzso of zzso zzso using zzso a zzso compound, or zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso These data indicate that DNA released from zzso zzso during chronic infections may significantly contribute to the zzso processes in zzso zzso Our findings also show that treatments with drugs diminishing zzso zzso may reduce the inflammatory response in zzso zzso
