zzso is considered to play a critical role in the zzso of diabetic zzso and high mobility group box protein 1 zzso could promote inflammation as an zzso We investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso components in type 2 diabetic rat zzso and in high zzso cultured zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso and its receptors in type 2 diabetic rats were detected by western zzso and zzso zzso cells were cultured with low zzso high zzso (with or without zzso zzso or zzso zzso for different lengths of time zzso 24, 48, 72 zzso Then expression of zzso and its receptors was measured by zzso zzso or western zzso Nuclear factor zzso of activated B cells zzso activity and zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso production in zzso as well as in zzso cells were detected by zzso Furthermore, zzso barrier zzso and zzso cell viability were measured by zzso and Cell Counting zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso components including receptors for zzso as well as zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in type 2 diabetic zzso and in high zzso treated zzso cells, compared to their respective zzso zzso zzso significantly alleviated zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso cells cultured with high zzso In addition, zzso barrier zzso of the diabetic zzso increased, while cell viability of high zzso treated zzso cells zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso components were increased in diabetic rat zzso and in zzso cells exposed to high zzso
