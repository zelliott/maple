The zzso pathways by which insulin triggers protein synthesis were studied using an zzso strategy to zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso principally regulated the amount of the protein synthesis machinery available in the cell while the zzso zzso contributed to modulating its zzso in response to zzso zzso also zzso in a small proportion of zzso protein synthesis which included the induction of zzso zzso When zzso induction was blocked the majority of zzso protein synthesis still occurred and thus did not require zzso regulation of zzso or its zzso
