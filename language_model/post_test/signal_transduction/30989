We recently separated a zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of two zzso and one zzso groups at the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso a zzso bacteria, and found that zzso exhibited zzso biological activities through zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso 12 different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using four combinations of zzso (R and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and three different zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All the zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso tested showed zzso cell zzso The zzso capacities of the zzso compounds were more potent than those of the zzso compounds, whereas there were no differences between the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the production of zzso zzso following stimulation with the zzso zzso and zzso compounds was impaired in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso but not those from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso host cells in a zzso and zzso manner, and the fatty acid zzso at the zzso position in the zzso zzso plays an important role in recognition by zzso
