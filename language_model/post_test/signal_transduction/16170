zzso immunity at the zzso zzso tissue is induced primarily by zzso zzso zzso to the need for targeting zzso to the zzso zzso cells zzso In this study we show that an zzso type 5 zzso human zzso virus type 1 vaccine can prime a durable zzso zzso zzso response in the gut following intramuscular zzso zzso in zzso The ability of zzso to prime zzso zzso T cells in zzso was associated with zzso expression of retinal zzso zzso zzso in conventional zzso The zzso induction of zzso did not require signaling through zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulatory factors and several zzso protein zzso or replication capacity of the virus, but was dependent on nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results provide an innate mechanism through which zzso zzso prime zzso zzso T cells and have implications for the development of novel zzso zzso for zzso vaccines administered via the IM zzso
