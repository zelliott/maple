Experimental and clinical evidence points to a critical role of zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso in controlling zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso action in breast cancer still remain zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso are short zzso acids which have also been found to play a pivotal role in cancer zzso The role of zzso in zzso breast cancer is poorly zzso In this study we explored zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso study to explore zzso regulation of zzso expression in breast zzso zzso expression was studied by zzso in cancer cell lines with silenced zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso or zzso treated or not with zzso Breast cancer cells were zzso with the precursor of zzso and proliferation zzso Western blots or in zzso experiments were zzso Target genes of zzso were searched through a zzso approach, and the study was focused on zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were performed to confirm that zzso E zzso is a direct target of zzso 

We found that nine zzso were zzso and seven were zzso by zzso in zzso tumor zzso zzso whose function as a tumor zzso in leukemia has already been zzso was identified as one of the zzso zzso in zzso and human breast cancer zzso zzso induced a decrease in zzso levels via the classical zzso and through a zzso interplay between zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso A search for zzso targets showed that the zzso zzso zzso the cell cycle regulator zzso zzso contains zzso putative zzso target sites in its zzso 3' zzso zzso We found that, similar to the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso participated in the induction of zzso E expression by zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso the ability of zzso to induce zzso E zzso revealing that zzso E is a novel target of zzso in breast zzso zzso of zzso also inhibited zzso breast tumor growth in zzso and in zzso demonstrating for the first time, a role for zzso as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso We also found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso which then zzso in the zzso activity of zzso in breast tumor zzso 

In this study, we reveal the first zzso zzso expression profile and identify a novel role for zzso as a tumor zzso in zzso and growth zzso growth in breast zzso
