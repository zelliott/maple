zzso insulin signaling and zzso metabolism in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients may arise from genetic defects and an altered zzso zzso We determined insulin action on signal zzso and zzso transport in isolated zzso zzso skeletal muscle from normal zzso first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients zzso zzso 8, 41 zzso 3 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso zzso 9, 40 zzso 2 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with no family history of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport was comparable between groups, whereas the zzso response zzso zzso was 38% lower zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of 160 zzso zzso in a zzso manner, with comparable responses between zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport were positively correlated in control subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not relatives zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of key zzso factors and zzso of zzso zzso were also zzso zzso muscle zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear respiratory zzso and zzso zzso was comparable between first-degree relatives and control zzso In conclusion, the zzso of insulin action on zzso signaling and zzso transport implicates defective zzso trafficking as an early event in the zzso of type 2 zzso
