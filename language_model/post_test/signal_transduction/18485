zzso zzso zzso treatment is well known for its ability to increase insulin resistance in liver and zzso zzso leading to zzso On the other hand, exercise enhances peripheral insulin zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso and/or exercise affect zzso mass and function in diabetic rats, and whether their effects can be associated with the zzso of the zzso signaling cascade in pancreatic zzso After an zzso study, whole body zzso disposal rates in zzso zzso zzso and zzso male rats decreased with a high dose treatment of zzso zzso zzso body zzso treatment, while disposal rates increased with zzso zzso insulin zzso was decreased and delayed by zzso via the impairment of the zzso mechanism in zzso while exercise reversed the impairment of zzso insulin zzso caused by zzso suggesting ameliorated zzso zzso However, exercise and zzso did not alter zzso insulin zzso except for the fact that zzso decreased insulin zzso at 120 zzso during zzso clamp in zzso zzso Unlike zzso functions, zzso and exercise exhibited increased pancreatic zzso mass in two different zzso Only exercise, through increased proliferation and decreased zzso increased zzso mass via zzso which resulted from an enhanced zzso signaling cascade by insulin zzso zzso 2 zzso By contrast, zzso expanded zzso mass via zzso and zzso from precursor cells, rather than increasing proliferation and decreasing zzso In conclusion, the improvement of zzso function and survival via the zzso of an zzso signaling cascade due to exercise has a crucial role in preventing the development and progression of type 2 zzso
