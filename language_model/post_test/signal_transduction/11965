zzso attack leads to resource conflicts between plant defensive zzso zzso are required for defensive compounds and carbon storage below ground and may therefore be depleted or enriched in the roots of zzso zzso The potential role of zzso zzso as zzso of induced zzso zzso is zzso We evaluated signaling and zzso dynamics in the roots of zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso Experimental and natural genetic zzso was exploited to link the observed zzso patterns to plant tolerance and zzso zzso attack decreased sugar and starch zzso in the roots and reduced regrowth from the rootstock and flower production in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were identified as major regulators of this zzso zzso zzso lower zzso levels were associated with decreased defense, increased zzso levels and improved regrowth from the zzso Application and transport zzso experiments, in combination with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso may act as additional signals that regulate regrowth zzso In conclusion, our study shows that the ability to mobilize defenses has a hidden zzso cost below ground that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms may lead to divergent defensive plant strategies against zzso in zzso
