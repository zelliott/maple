zzso is a member of the Six family zzso zzso which function as components of the zzso gene network to control organ zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a limited set of zzso In this study, we established zzso mice and found that development of the inner ear, nose, zzso kidney and skeletal muscle was severely zzso zzso zzso were devoid of inner ear structures, including zzso and zzso while their zzso zzso was zzso The inner ear anomaly began at around zzso and zzso was expressed in the zzso region of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at this zzso In the zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were expressed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were zzso while the expression zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were expressed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expanded zzso Our results indicate that zzso functions as a key regulator of zzso zzso patterning at early zzso and controls the expression zzso of downstream zzso genes responsible for respective inner ear zzso In addition, cell proliferation was reduced and zzso cell death was enhanced in the zzso region of the zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in cell proliferation and zzso In spite of the similarity of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice, expressions of zzso and zzso were mutually zzso
