zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly lethal disease characterized by late diagnosis and treatment zzso zzso genetic zzso in defined genes in association with zzso of zzso cell signaling pathways have been associated with zzso development and zzso Here, we show that zzso contributes to pancreatic zzso during the zzso progression of pancreatic zzso zzso by virtue of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso amplified by both zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso copy number is significantly correlated with overall patient zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cell lines enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft zzso in zzso and growth in zzso as well as increased zzso zzso By contrast zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to corresponding decreases in these same zzso The effects of zzso were found to be due to its ability to bind DNA, as forced zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso had no effects on cell growth in zzso or in zzso nor did they affect zzso signaling levels in these same zzso A zzso analysis revealed the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso gene in association with zzso zzso and direct binding of zzso to the zzso promoter was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso into cancer cell lines led to decreased zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso protein into culture zzso zzso zzso of zzso antagonized the effects of zzso on zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso These findings illustrate that one mechanism by which zzso promotes pancreatic zzso is by virtue of its zzso of zzso zzso signaling via regulation of zzso
