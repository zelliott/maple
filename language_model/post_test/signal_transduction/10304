zzso dysfunction results in the zzso via the retrograde response pathway, of a concise set of genes zzso target zzso that zzso zzso involved in the zzso production of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso important regulators of cell growth, similarly results in zzso target gene expression under rich zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso target genes requires a number of shared zzso including the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso as well as their upstream regulator zzso Two unresolved discrepancies exist with regard to the mechanism of zzso target gene zzso zzso deletion of zzso results in zzso expression of zzso target genes in most but not all strain zzso and zzso zzso target gene expression has been correlated with both decreased as well as increased zzso zzso Here we have addressed both of these zzso First, we demonstrate that the zzso deletion strain used in a previous study by zzso and zzso contains a nonsense zzso within zzso zzso 231 in zzso that likely accounts for the zzso of the zzso system in this zzso Second, we confirm results by zzso and zzso that zzso is zzso as a primary response to induction of the zzso zzso of this protein appears to be a secondary consequence of zzso treatment and is influenced both by strain background as well as by specific supplied zzso That zzso of zzso is also caused by heat shock suggests that it may reflect a more generalized response to cell zzso Together these results contribute toward a uniform view of zzso target gene zzso
