zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso cell zzso These pathways are implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso proteins during progression of zzso to heart zzso however, the role of zzso in cardiac zzso has never been zzso This study was undertaken to 1) analyze zzso expression in primary cultures of cardiac zzso and cardiac zzso and in the heart following different types of zzso zzso and 2) examine its role in growth zzso zzso zzso and collagen zzso zzso overload and volume overload were induced for 10 zzso in zzso rats by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso was infused for 2 zzso zzso showed that, compared with zzso zzso was found abundantly expressed in cardiac zzso Treatment of cardiac zzso with zzso II and zzso resulted in increased expression of zzso zzso of zzso in cardiac zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and collagen zzso An inverse correlation between collagen and zzso was observed in in zzso models of cardiac zzso in pressure overload and after zzso II infusion, increased collagen zzso correlated with reduced zzso levels, whereas in volume overload increased zzso levels were accompanied by unchanged collagen zzso These data for the first time describe expression of zzso in the heart and demonstrate its zzso by zzso agents in cultured cardiac zzso and in in zzso models of heart zzso zzso suggest a role of zzso in cardiac zzso involving collagen expression during chronic zzso zzso
