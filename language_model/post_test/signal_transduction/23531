zzso zzso is a zzso zzso compound that has yielded mixed results in clinical trials of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, with a dramatically positive outcome in a Russian clinical trial that was zzso in a replication trial in the United zzso We sought to determine whether zzso zzso zzso precursor protein zzso zzso is at least partially attributable to regulation of zzso a highly zzso protein zzso zzso that is known to be impaired in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso We zzso several zzso cellular models to determine whether zzso regulates zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Male zzso mice were chronically administered zzso prior to behavior analysis in the cued and contextual fear conditioning zzso as well as zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso Treatment of cultured zzso cells with zzso led to enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso transgenic mice was associated with improved learning behavior and with a reduction in zzso of zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso possesses zzso properties in addition to the previously reported zzso properties, both of which are potentially relevant to the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative zzso We suggest that zzso of the molecular zzso underlying zzso effects on zzso zzso and behavior might warranty the further study of zzso as a potentially viable lead compound that might yield more consistent clinical benefit following the zzso of its zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso
