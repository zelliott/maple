A role of membrane zzso zzso released by vascular cells in zzso cell zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis of blood samples from normal volunteers revealed the presence of an zzso zzso population, which increased by approximately zzso after inflammatory stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 360 versus zzso zzso 640, p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 68 zzso and zzso zzso 282 zzso zzso and zzso de zzso expression of tissue factor on the zzso zzso This was associated with generation of a factor zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in a reaction inhibited by a zzso zzso to tissue zzso Fluorescent labeling with zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso demonstrated that circulating zzso originated from both zzso and zzso However, depletion of zzso zzso with an zzso to zzso did not reduce zzso zzso release, and, similarly, zzso from zzso zzso did not induce zzso release from zzso zzso stimulation with zzso zzso did not result in zzso of the zzso factor zzso and was not associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso These findings demonstrate that circulating zzso zzso are zzso by inflammatory stimulation in zzso and activate a stress signaling zzso in zzso leading to increased zzso and zzso zzso This may provide an alternative mechanism of zzso zzso potentially contributing to zzso of zzso functions during vascular zzso
