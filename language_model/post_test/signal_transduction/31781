zzso disease zzso is a zzso disorder of the enteric nervous system, which occurs due to the failure of neural crest cells to fully colonize the gut during embryonic zzso It is characterized by the absence of the enteric zzso in a variable length of the zzso zzso progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of zzso with the help of advanced genetic analysis techniques and animal zzso More than 11 genes have been found to be involved in the zzso of zzso The zzso gene is the most important zzso gene involved in zzso with both coding and zzso coding sequence zzso Due to zzso diversity and genetic complexity observed in zzso zzso analysis has limited practical value in genetic counseling and clinical zzso In this review, we discuss the progress that has been made in understanding the molecular zzso of zzso and zzso the currently identified genes as well as interactions between pathways and zzso zzso in zzso
