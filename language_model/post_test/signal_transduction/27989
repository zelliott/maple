The effect of blockade of zzso activity on human pancreatic cancer zzso was determined in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human pancreatic cancer cells, which expressed an elevated level of zzso zzso activity, were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso After zzso in the zzso of nude mice, parental zzso and control zzso zzso cells produced rapidly growing tumors and liver zzso whereas zzso zzso cells had decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling blockade significantly inhibited the in zzso and in zzso expression of the major zzso molecules vascular zzso growth factor and zzso and decreased tumor vascular zzso These events were correlated with retarded tumor growth and suppression of zzso zzso these data suggest that suppression of zzso and zzso by zzso blockade is due to impaired zzso potential of tumor zzso
