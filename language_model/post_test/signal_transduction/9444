While zzso is recognized to play a key role in regulating growth, particularly in relation to zzso fusion, the mechanisms that mediate its effects are still zzso We zzso an in zzso model of zzso the zzso cell line, to explore the effect of zzso on this zzso We demonstrated the presence of zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso in these cells, with increased abundance of both zzso zzso evident as the cells zzso zzso localized to the nucleus, suggesting it was zzso by zzso zzso while zzso was seen predominantly in the zzso suggesting it may be utilizing zzso zzso While zzso zzso had no effect on proliferation or zzso we found some evidence for the zzso production of zzso zzso as suggested by the expression of zzso in these zzso Selective zzso blockade with zzso zzso zzso led to a significant reduction in both proliferation and zzso while zzso blockade with zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in these zzso This is in keeping with results from mouse knockout models suggesting that zzso zzso zzso leads to an zzso of skeletal zzso Our results are further evidence for the importance of differential zzso zzso in regulating zzso Future studies examining in zzso effects of these agents are required to extrapolate these findings to a zzso zzso
