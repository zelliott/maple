We have tested whether different zzso of zzso zzso receptors could induce zzso of selective protein zzso C zzso in nerve zzso In rat cortical zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 100 zzso induced an increase in zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso conditions of the zzso protein zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso receptors group I and II, did not antagonize the effect of zzso and per zzso induced a zzso of protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso induction of protein zzso zzso zzso was not antagonized by zzso zzso acid, it is suggested that zzso and zzso activate this signal zzso zzso through distinct membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new compound known to antagonize zzso zzso receptors coupled to zzso D, was able to antagonize protein zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso directly induced zzso D activity, measured as zzso production in cortical zzso These data suggest that in cortical nerve terminals zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso coupled to different signal zzso zzso are present, zzso zzso is able to induce protein zzso zzso zzso and that zzso a zzso zzso zzso associated to zzso D might influence zzso of protein zzso C in a zzso zzso
