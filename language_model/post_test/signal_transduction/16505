Ever increasing use of engineered carbon zzso in zzso for selective imaging, sensor or drug delivery systems has increased the potential for blood zzso zzso We studied the effects of engineered and zzso carbon zzso on human zzso zzso in zzso and rat vascular zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mixed carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso were compared with standard urban particulate matter zzso average size zzso zzso zzso function was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso flow zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso and the rate of zzso was measured, in the presence of carbon zzso with an zzso flow zzso zzso zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and accelerated the rate of vascular zzso in rat carotid arteries with a similar rank order of zzso All particles resulted in zzso of zzso in zzso In contrast, particles zzso affected the release of zzso zzso as well as the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso pathways of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by zzso Thus, some carbon zzso and zzso have the ability to activate zzso and enhance vascular zzso These observations are of importance for the pharmacological use of carbon zzso and pathology of urban particulate zzso
