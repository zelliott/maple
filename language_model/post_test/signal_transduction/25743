zzso zzso is required not only for maintenance of gestation in pigs but also for zzso zzso development and subsequent zzso The actions of zzso are modulated by both long and short zzso of the zzso zzso zzso where short zzso can interfere with the essential signaling function of the long zzso Using 3' zzso we have isolated a unique zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that contains a short zzso domain of 38 zzso that is zzso by zzso from zzso 9 to a novel zzso 11 located zzso zzso downstream of zzso 10 on zzso zzso The short zzso was detected as a 42 zzso protein in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the short zzso functions as a dominant negative against the zzso function of the long zzso and does not zzso a signal to the rat zzso zzso zzso abundance of long zzso and short zzso zzso was established in a range of zzso zzso The binding affinity of the short zzso for zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso than the affinity of the long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso despite a fourfold higher level of binding sites for the short zzso Our data raise the possibility that the short zzso in pigs may function independently from the long zzso where the zzso strategy used to generate the short zzso likely evolved under different selection pressures to those acting on the long zzso
