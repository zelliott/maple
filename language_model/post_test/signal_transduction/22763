zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein and the zzso zzso of zzso Although Alzheimer's zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene elevate zzso zzso zzso production like zzso zzso here we demonstrate that a gene zzso of zzso (unlike that of zzso in mice does not result in a severe zzso resembling that of zzso zzso To investigate the zzso function of zzso more directly, we zzso a zzso zzso at position zzso to zzso because the corresponding zzso of zzso is known to be required for its zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso exhibit significant deficits in zzso processing of zzso precursor protein indicating a zzso in zzso zzso The reduced zzso activity results in the almost complete zzso of zzso and zzso production in cells zzso expressing zzso zzso whereas cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso produce robust levels of zzso and zzso Using highly sensitive in zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso not only blocks zzso activity but also zzso zzso activity in zzso signaling by zzso the zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is functionally involved in zzso production and zzso signaling by zzso similar zzso zzso
