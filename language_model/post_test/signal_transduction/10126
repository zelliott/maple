We have developed an in zzso mouse model, the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso model, and have previously reported that transplanted zzso bone zzso cells zzso differentiate into zzso via zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the growth factors that are closely related to the differentiation of transplanted zzso into zzso and the way that a specific growth factor affects the differentiation process in the zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis to identify an important growth factor in our model, zzso zzso growth factor zzso In liver samples, the expression of zzso and zzso and of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso was significantly elevated with time after bone zzso transplantation zzso compared with other factors, and zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso could be zzso We then analyzed the effect and molecular mechanism of zzso signaling on the enhancement of zzso differentiation into zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso especially zzso elevated the zzso rate of zzso cells in the liver and significantly increased the expression of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso at zzso also raised serum zzso levels and improved the survival zzso zzso of zzso with zzso specifically activated tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso the differentiation of transplanted zzso into zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso Administration of zzso in combination with zzso improves the liver function and prognosis of mice with zzso liver zzso
