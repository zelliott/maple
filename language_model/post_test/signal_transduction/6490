We report zzso the zzso properties of an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso formation with a zzso for zzso of approximately zzso zzso at pH zzso Although cellular zzso activity is increased by blue light zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 52 zzso zzso zzso zzso did not contain any zzso and the activity was zzso This suggests that an unknown blue zzso factor interacts with the zzso regulatory domain of zzso to control its zzso zzso zzso Finally, our results show that the sensor of blue light using zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso signal zzso in this zzso
