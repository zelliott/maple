zzso is a crucial zzso of zzso inflammatory responses, but its role in the context of zzso zzso immune responses has yet to be zzso Here, we demonstrate that classical zzso zzso delays zzso cell death zzso in Raw zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso upon zzso of bacteria from the zzso coli laboratory strain zzso By expression of a zzso form of zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment, prolonged zzso of zzso upon bacterial zzso is zzso whereas initial induction is only partially zzso This zzso pattern results in partial zzso of cellular zzso and reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso suppression of classical zzso zzso does not influence bacterial zzso rates but is followed by increased production of oxygen zzso and enhanced zzso killing in Raw zzso This is associated with reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso and a loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Raw cells and zzso causes increased zzso rates within 12 h of bacterial zzso Interestingly, accelerated zzso of zzso coli in zzso zzso is associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso via classical, zzso zzso zzso and thus zzso signaling to T zzso zzso a proper zzso immune response is likely to be zzso zzso therapeutic zzso of classical zzso zzso in zzso may hamper the initiation of zzso zzso
