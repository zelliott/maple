zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso which is implicated in zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso to alternative zzso and multiple translation initiation zzso several zzso zzso can be expressed from a single zzso All zzso zzso share the central zzso repeat domain but have divergent zzso and zzso Little is known about the biological functions of the different zzso In this study, we examined the distribution of various zzso zzso and the consequences of their expression in cultured cells of zzso zzso zzso analysis and western zzso revealed that zzso and melanoma cells primarily express the long zzso zzso whereas zzso express shorter zzso especially zzso which zzso to zzso zzso junctions in a zzso zzso The shortest zzso zzso which was detected in normal zzso and zzso was generally lost from cells derived from zzso cell zzso or zzso The zzso alternatively spliced zzso B was present in the zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso and zzso but was lost in several tumor zzso derived from these zzso To test whether zzso zzso serve in distinct biological functions, we zzso zzso the expression zzso into melanoma cells zzso and immortalized zzso zzso Indeed, distinct zzso of zzso are responsible for its different biological zzso The prominent branching zzso was induced equally by zzso zzso 2A and zzso whereas the shortest zzso zzso which was devoid of the zzso domain, completely lacked this zzso Also, the zzso zzso as in the zzso zzso were sufficient to abolish the branching zzso as induced by the zzso zzso The induction of the branching zzso zzso with the nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2A and zzso whereas the zzso 4A and zzso which were excluded from the nucleus, did not induce the branching zzso The zzso sequences that contain seven out of eight zzso zzso recently characterized as potential candidates for zzso by zzso zzso are required for the nuclear zzso and for the formation of the branching zzso Finally, expression of the zzso zzso which caused the branching zzso was associated with cellular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso we have identified sequences within the zzso zzso that are zzso for both nuclear zzso and the zzso branching zzso Loss of the zzso pool of zzso from tumor cells suggests an important function for such zzso in normal cells and zzso
