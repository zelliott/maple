Plant zzso development takes place in the zzso where stem cells zzso and produce daughter cells that differentiate and give rise to different organ zzso For the maintenance of zzso the rate of differentiation of daughter cells must equal the generation of new zzso How this is achieved is a central question in plant zzso In the zzso root zzso stem cells surround a small group of organizing cells, the zzso zzso Together they form a stem cell niche zzso zzso whose position and activity depends on the zzso action of two sets of genes - zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso - as well as on polar zzso zzso In contrast, the mechanisms controlling zzso cell differentiation remain zzso Here, we report that zzso control the rate of zzso cell differentiation and thus determine zzso size via a zzso zzso zzso zzso factor signaling zzso Analysis of the root zzso of zzso zzso spatial zzso zzso and zzso zzso application indicates that zzso act in a restricted region of the root zzso where they antagonize a zzso zzso zzso and we provide evidence that this signal is zzso
