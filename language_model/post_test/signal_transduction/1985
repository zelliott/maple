To investigate whether signaling pathways that incorporate protein zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso currents zzso in cultured rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in response to zzso stimulation was recorded with zzso zzso techniques in the presence of zzso agents that activate or block zzso and zzso 

zzso in rabbit zzso zzso zzso cells was identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso because current was zzso during cell swelling by zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso after zzso zzso whereas the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso but not its inactive analogue zzso inhibited the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso did not further inhibit zzso in cells zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso but blocked enhancement of zzso by zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, blocked zzso of zzso whereas insulin, which activates zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso The zzso current was also blocked by zzso zzso zzso was not activated under zzso conditions by the simultaneous zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso 

These data show that zzso zzso currents activated in response to cell swelling in zzso zzso zzso cells are modulated by protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may involve the upstream intermediaries zzso zzso zzso and zzso
