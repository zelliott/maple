Little is known about the zzso of the zzso switched B cell zzso zzso in multiple zzso and the way it might affect zzso zzso In this work zzso zzso isolated from the individual zzso of peripheral blood zzso zzso of 32 patients with zzso multiple myeloma and healthy controls were investigated for the expression of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso known to specify the zzso of human serum zzso The degree of zzso and signaling status of all 32 isolated myeloma zzso zzso were correlated and compared with the zzso of the zzso zzso isolated from zzso of the same zzso It was shown that zzso zzso in myeloma is more heavily zzso when compared with normal controls, that the increased zzso of zzso zzso is associated with higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex and that zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso from the same patient differed in all cases in the levels of terminal sugar zzso The results suggest that the development of the zzso clone in zzso from zzso B cells expressing zzso zzso at their surfaces to plasma cells zzso zzso zzso may be followed by permanent zzso changes in the zzso zzso
