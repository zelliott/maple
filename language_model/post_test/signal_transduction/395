During human zzso neural crest cells migrate to the anterior chamber of the eye and then differentiate into the inner layers of the zzso the zzso angle, and the anterior portion of the zzso When proper development does not occur, this causes zzso angle zzso and zzso pressure zzso zzso which ultimately results in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse neural crest cells causes anterior chamber zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso angle zzso These zzso are zzso of the human zzso glaucoma, zzso zzso In the neural crest cells of mice zzso disruption of the gene zzso zzso 1 zzso which is an indispensable zzso for HS zzso resulted in disturbed zzso zzso This led to reduced zzso of zzso and zzso expression of zzso box C1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso factors that have been identified as the zzso genes for zzso zzso Furthermore, impaired interactions between HS and zzso induced zzso glaucoma, which was zzso as an zzso zzso caused by zzso angle zzso These findings suggest that HS is necessary for neural crest cells to form the anterior chamber via zzso zzso zzso of HS synthesis might therefore contribute to the pathology of zzso zzso
