The zzso protein zzso is a potent zzso of zzso cell shape change and is required for lens and neural plate zzso Analysis of gut zzso in zzso deficient mouse zzso revealed that the direction of gut rotation is also zzso It was recently established that zzso zzso cellular behaviors in the zzso zzso zzso of the early zzso a structure connecting the zzso to the rest of the zzso contribute to the direction of gut rotation in chicken zzso by influencing the direction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell shapes in the zzso zzso are hypothesized to contribute to the zzso however, it is unclear what lies downstream of zzso to alter zzso cell zzso The cells of the left zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso deficient zzso are shorter and wider than those in control zzso and resemble the shape of those on the right, demonstrating that like zzso zzso is required for cell shape asymmetry and the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso expression is specific to the left side and is zzso dependent, we determined whether zzso and zzso function together to regulate cell shape in the left zzso zzso Analysis of mouse zzso lacking one zzso of both zzso and zzso revealed that they possess shorter and wider left zzso zzso cells when compared with zzso or zzso zzso zzso This indicates a genetic zzso Together these data provide evidence that zzso and zzso function zzso downstream of zzso to directly regulate cell shape changes necessary for early gut tube zzso
