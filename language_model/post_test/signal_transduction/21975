zzso is an important mechanism to regulate tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso the relevance of zzso zzso for signaling as well as the fate and route of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso is poorly zzso To analyze the dynamics of zzso signaling and turnover at the plasma membrane we established a human zzso expressing mouse embryonic zzso cell line in a zzso zzso zzso stimulation resulted in a decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that reduced zzso release is a result of zzso complex zzso Indeed, we could demonstrate that zzso was zzso together with its zzso and zzso binding zzso Upon zzso the zzso signaling complex zzso with late zzso marker zzso and entered the zzso degradation zzso Furthermore, we identified a zzso motif in the zzso part of zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso zzso defective zzso zzso are capable to zzso zzso activate zzso demonstrating that the zzso motif dependent zzso is zzso for this zzso We therefore propose that zzso zzso primarily serves as a negative zzso to limit zzso responses via zzso
