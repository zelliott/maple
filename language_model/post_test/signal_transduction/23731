zzso comprises a group of zzso produced zzso hormones that belong to the zzso factor zzso family with promising future as potential drugs for the treatment of heart zzso Members of the zzso family are known to act as potent regulators of cardiac and vascular functions, through the zzso of the zzso receptors that are highly expressed in heart and peripheral zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso effects in arteries from different zzso These effects have been related to its capability to regulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso by different molecular zzso zzso zzso increases heart zzso and evokes positive zzso and zzso effects by mechanisms involving different zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides have also the ability to protect the heart from zzso and zzso injuries by their improvement of zzso cardiac performances, which include the recovery of heart contraction, the prevention from zzso zzso overload and the reduction of cardiac cell zzso Furthermore, heart protection by zzso involves the regulation of the zzso of specific genes acting to minimize zzso damage, cell death, and zzso zzso This review summarizes some of the recent findings related to the molecular mechanism underlying the role of zzso in both vascular and cardiac zzso
