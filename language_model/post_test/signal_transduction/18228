Biological signals for transforming growth factor beta zzso are zzso through zzso zzso zzso receptors that signal to a family of zzso zzso known as zzso zzso and zzso are important for zzso and zzso responses to zzso and their zzso in human zzso indicates that they are tumor zzso A zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of both zzso and zzso has been identified in tumors from patients with zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso However, the mechanism zzso this zzso interferes with zzso activity is zzso Here we show that these zzso do not disrupt zzso of zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex formation, and zzso nuclear zzso In contrast, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso are zzso rapidly in comparison with their zzso zzso We show that this decrease in zzso protein stability occurs through induction of zzso zzso by pathways involving the zzso family of zzso zzso These studies thus reveal a mechanism for zzso zzso genetic defects in zzso induce their degradation through the zzso zzso
