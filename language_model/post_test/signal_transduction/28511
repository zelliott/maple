The tomato gene zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso potato zzso and zzso Using genetic screens, we have isolated a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso compromised in resistance to zzso zzso and potato zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso is also compromised in resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, using an zzso transient zzso in leaves to express zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso is not compromised in zzso hypersensitive zzso Moreover, the zzso in zzso does not result in increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso cell death zzso and zzso zzso root zzso we showed that the zzso cell death zzso is intact in this zzso Our results indicate that zzso is required for zzso resistance and acts either at the same step in the signal zzso zzso as zzso or upstream of zzso
