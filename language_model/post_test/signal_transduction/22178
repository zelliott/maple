In plants, zzso often appear at specific zzso zzso but are also induced by a number of environmental zzso The coordinated expression of genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is controlled at the zzso level usually by an zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the effects of zzso on plant resistance to environmental zzso In this study, we introduced an zzso zzso factor gene zzso a regulatory gene of zzso zzso in apple fruit, into zzso and analyzed its function to zzso stress in transgenic zzso Under high zzso stress, the zzso zzso plants exhibited growth better than zzso zzso The elevated tolerance of the transgenic plants to zzso stress was confirmed by the changes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results preliminarily showed that the zzso can possibly be used to enhance the high zzso ability of zzso
