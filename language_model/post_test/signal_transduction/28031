zzso acutely stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid zzso metabolism in lean zzso and zzso This zzso effect is eliminated following the feeding of high-fat diets in zzso as well as in obese zzso The zzso responsible for the development of skeletal muscle zzso resistance is zzso however, a role for increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been demonstrated in other zzso zzso Furthermore, whether exercise intervention is an effective strategy to prevent or zzso the development of skeletal muscle zzso resistance has not been zzso Toward this end, 48 zzso rats zzso zzso approximately 2-3 zzso of zzso were fed control or high-fat zzso zzso diets for 4 zzso and either remained sedentary or were treadmill zzso In control zzso animals that remained sedentary zzso or were endurance trained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and reduced the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso feeding induced zzso resistance in the zzso of sedentary rats zzso whereas endurance exercise training zzso restored the ability of zzso to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Training did not completely restore the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso diets zzso zzso zzso expression irrespective of training status zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thus the development of skeletal muscle zzso resistance appears to involve an increase in zzso zzso zzso Endurance training was generally effective in preventing the development of zzso resistance, although this did not appear to require a decrease in zzso zzso Future studies should examine changes in the actual protein content of zzso in muscle and establish whether zzso exercise is also effective in treating zzso resistance in zzso
