zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso is expressed almost exclusively in cells of zzso zzso zzso is known to associate with the T zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso and plays a critical role in both T zzso development and zzso zzso also associates with the zzso of the zzso and is activated when zzso binds to its zzso Using primary cultures of Con zzso normal zzso mouse T zzso we observed an zzso sequence of events involving zzso We saw a rapid zzso 1 to 2 zzso and transient increase in zzso zzso activity, which preceded the zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of which was observed after 10 zzso We also observed an zzso shift in the zzso mobility of zzso from an apparent molecular mass of 56 zzso zzso to 60 zzso zzso which reached a maximum at 15 zzso the level of zzso remaining constant for up to 4 h zzso This zzso shift correlated with the zzso of zzso of zzso a site that zzso protein zzso are capable of zzso in zzso The implications of these results for the understanding of both zzso function and zzso cell zzso signaling pathways are zzso
