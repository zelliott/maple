zzso zzso are skeletal muscle zzso found in humans and domestic zzso The zzso zzso strain developed a high frequency (between zzso of adult zzso type zzso zzso at zzso months of age while zzso also develop zzso but less zzso These zzso invaded skeletal muscle surrounding either the zzso or zzso zzso skeleton and were characterized by zzso cells with abundant zzso zzso multiple zzso and cross zzso The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cells using zzso The zzso strain, but not the related zzso zzso is also zzso by a progressive muscular zzso zzso to zzso muscular zzso type zzso The association between the development of zzso in similar muscle groups to those most severely affected by the progressive muscular zzso suggested that these zzso developed from abnormal zzso of the skeletal muscle exacerbated by the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed marked zzso of genes in muscular development and function signaling zzso zzso coding zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting these may be important in the zzso of zzso These studies suggest that A strains of mice can be useful models for zzso the molecular genetic basis for development, zzso and ultimately for testing novel zzso therapeutic agents dealing with zzso
