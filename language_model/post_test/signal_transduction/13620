zzso zzso zzso is a primary zzso zzso that zzso inflammatory responses in asthma and chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate lung zzso activity remain to be zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activates zzso by zzso the zzso zzso of the protein at zzso zzso This study aimed to identify how the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affected lung zzso activity and airway zzso zzso using gene zzso techniques in mouse lung or human small airway zzso cells determined that knocking down zzso expression blocked zzso zzso of zzso and negated the zzso effects of zzso protein in the zzso Similarly, the expression of human zzso in transgenic mice significantly increased zzso and zzso activities and prevented chronic cigarette zzso airway inflammation and zzso zzso zzso knockout mice, however, exhibited an exaggerated zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling becomes zzso in advanced lung zzso Indeed, zzso protein was oxidized in the lungs of subjects with advanced zzso and cigarette smoke did not increase zzso or zzso activity within zzso cells isolated from subjects with zzso unlike samples of healthy lung zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings establish that the zzso axis plays a critical role in countering the inflammatory and zzso responses that result in zzso destruction in response to cigarette smoke zzso
