zzso zzso are zzso approximately zzso zzso which suppress gene expression by selectively binding to the zzso region of specific zzso zzso through zzso Given the diversity and abundance of zzso targets, zzso appear to functionally interact with various components of many cellular zzso By analyzing the interactions between zzso and a human cellular signaling network, we found that zzso predominantly target positive regulatory zzso highly connected scaffolds and most downstream network components such as signaling zzso factors, but less frequently target negative regulatory zzso common components of basic cellular machines and most upstream network components such as zzso In addition, when an zzso has potential to recruit more downstream zzso these components are more frequently targeted by zzso This work zzso the principles of zzso regulation of signal zzso networks and implies a potential function of zzso for zzso robust transitions of cellular response to zzso signals and maintaining cellular zzso
