The zzso nucleus zzso is engaged in zzso of memory retention after zzso zzso but it is unknown which pathways and neurotransmitter zzso play a role in this zzso Here we examine zzso whether zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in the zzso are zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso zzso was studied in the zzso after various stages of passive shock avoidance zzso and active shock avoidance zzso training and, for zzso at various zzso time zzso zzso was significantly enhanced in zzso zzso as a result of the training zzso and the number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso increased zzso The increase in zzso as a result of zzso and zzso training was not due to fear conditioning or the number of correct zzso (in case of zzso zzso but rather to behavioral zzso as a consequence of zzso exposure to a novel environment (the test zzso This finding was confirmed by a zzso experiment in which the rats were allowed to stay in a novel cage for 15 zzso or 24 zzso Only the brief exposure to the fresh cage triggered zzso for zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso These results shed new light on a possible function of the zzso system in the zzso zzso by zzso in relation to zzso of memory processes and demonstrate that behavioral zzso during (the zzso stage zzso a learning task is sufficient to alter the zzso system in the zzso
