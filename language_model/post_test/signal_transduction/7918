zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso chains of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of HS zzso zzso is required for its interaction with various zzso growth factors to promote their biological activities to activate their high affinity zzso zzso zzso We have identified HS zzso zzso as a zzso gene in zzso breast, and several other cancer cell zzso Here we have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by serum withdrawal in zzso breast cancer zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso lines of zzso led to a significant increase in zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso only zzso The zzso signaling was also inhibited with zzso zzso against zzso and zzso the zzso growth factor family of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso signaling was associated with reduced zzso D1 levels, leading to decreased S phase fraction and increased zzso zzso as well as increased cell zzso Finally, evaluation of zzso expression levels in primary invasive breast tumors by zzso in zzso zzso indicated that zzso is zzso in the majority zzso of tumors, with a zzso association with zzso zzso These data suggest a potential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
