Central nervous system dissemination is a relatively uncommon but almost always fatal complication in diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy for central nervous involvement in this zzso has not been zzso In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of zzso a zzso zzso that zzso focal zzso zzso in a novel zzso model of diffuse large zzso zzso with central nervous system zzso zzso obtained after zzso of zzso subcutaneous tumors zzso zzso were zzso injected in zzso zzso These mice received oral vehicle or 75 zzso of zzso daily until they were zzso for weight loss or signs of zzso The zzso effect of zzso was validated in an independent experiment using a zzso mouse zzso zzso injected zzso cells showed higher take rate and higher central nervous system zzso zzso with increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso The oral administration of zzso significantly increased survival time in 2 independent experiments using mice injected with unmodified or zzso zzso zzso We have developed a new zzso model of diffuse large zzso zzso with central nervous system involvement that can be used in the zzso evaluation of new drugs for this zzso zzso is a new, zzso and orally available therapeutic agent that merits further investigation since it may improve current management of diffuse large zzso zzso patients with central nervous system zzso
