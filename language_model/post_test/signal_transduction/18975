zzso zzso species share a type III zzso system that zzso zzso zzso proteins into host cells to counteract zzso responses during zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by different zzso Here, we investigate whether zzso and zzso are functionally redundant by zzso the contribution of these two zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso in a mouse infection and tissue culture zzso Four days after oral infection, a zzso T zzso strain and a zzso T zzso strain zzso zzso of mice at similar levels, suggesting that zzso is not required for zzso In contrast, zzso colonization by a zzso strain was significantly zzso A zzso T zzso strain zzso zzso at levels comparable to those of the zzso T zzso strain, arguing that zzso can promote zzso in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso zzso strain expressing either zzso or zzso showed that zzso had a stronger zzso activity than zzso zzso of zzso strongly inhibited zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and prevented production of zzso whereas zzso moderately inhibited these zzso On the other hand, pore formation was inhibited equally by zzso or zzso In conclusion, zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso can only partially compensate for the loss of zzso
