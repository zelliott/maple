Multiple myeloma zzso is a zzso of plasma cell origin that is largely confined to the bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and other genetic events are known to contribute to deregulation of signaling pathways that lead to transformation of plasma cells and progression to zzso However, the tumor zzso may also provide zzso support and enhance resistance to zzso zzso of proteins on zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in cell growth and zzso zzso knowing the status of zzso signaling pathways in cells may provide key insights into how cell growth and survival is promoted in tumor zzso To provide a more comprehensive molecular analysis of signaling disruptions in zzso we conducted a zzso profile comparison of normal plasma cells and zzso plasma cells as well as their surrounding cells from normal zzso and diseased zzso Integrated zzso analysis of the profiles obtained reveals deregulation of multiple signaling pathways in zzso cells but also in surrounding bone zzso blood cells compared to their normal zzso The zzso zzso activities identified zzso which include the zzso zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2) zzso are potential novel molecular targets in this lethal zzso
