zzso pain is accompanied by zzso zzso in zzso horn of spinal zzso We have observed that in animal models this zzso is characterized by an increased expression of zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso without the release of soluble tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso we report that the zzso neurotransmitter zzso substance P zzso increases the expression of zzso without the release of zzso from primary zzso zzso We modeled this interaction using an immortalized zzso cell line; exposure of these cells to SP also resulted in the increased expression of zzso but without any increase in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and no release of zzso In order to evaluate the biological function of zzso zzso we zzso zzso cells with a zzso full-length zzso construct resistant to zzso by zzso zzso of zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso with zzso cells led to zzso cell zzso indicated by increased zzso zzso and release of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso by direct zzso zzso These results suggest a novel zzso through which the release of SP by primary zzso activates zzso expression of zzso establishing a zzso loop that may contribute to the establishment of chronic zzso
