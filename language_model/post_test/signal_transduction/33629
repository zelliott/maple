Three main events characterize the development of the zzso axis of the zzso wing zzso first, generation of zzso circular zzso defined by different combinations of gene zzso second, zzso of wingless zzso gene expression in a ring of zzso and third, an increase of cell number in each domain in response to zzso The mechanisms by which these zzso of gene expression are established and maintained are zzso We have analyzed the role of the gene zinc finger zzso 2 zzso We report that in discs lacking zzso the limits of the expression zzso of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and nab zzso and expression of zzso in the wing zzso is zzso We show that zzso expression is zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso repression of zzso permits zzso of nab in the wing blade and zzso in the wing zzso We suggest that the zzso wing fate, the zzso is specified first and that later repression of zzso permits zzso of the zzso fate, the wing zzso We propose that zzso axis development is achieved by a combination of two zzso on one hand a process involving zzso to zzso zzso with the wing hinge specified first followed later by the zzso wing zzso on the other hand, early zzso of the zzso zzso by different combinations of gene zzso The results we present here indicate that zzso plays a critical role in both zzso
