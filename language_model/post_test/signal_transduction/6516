zzso and zzso protein expression systems are used for the production of many industrially relevant zzso and are widely used by the research community to produce proteins that cannot be actively expressed in zzso coli or require zzso for proper folding and biological zzso However, for the production of therapeutic zzso intended for use in humans, zzso have been less useful because of their inability to modify proteins with human zzso zzso zzso zzso is of the zzso type, which zzso a short in zzso zzso to the protein and may render it less zzso or even zzso Several ways of zzso zzso zzso have been tried, including zzso zzso proteins in zzso and modulating host zzso pathways in zzso Recent advances in the zzso of zzso and the expression of therapeutic zzso in humanized zzso have shown significant promise, and are challenging the current dominance of therapeutic protein production based on zzso cell zzso
