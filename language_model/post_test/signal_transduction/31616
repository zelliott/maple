zzso affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component but unknown zzso We used zzso technology to determine the expression of approximately 22,000 zzso transcripts in zzso tissue from two brain regions in patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy zzso zzso prefrontal zzso tissue from a cohort of 70 subjects and zzso zzso tissue from a separate cohort of 30 subjects was zzso The final analysis included 30 bipolar and 31 control subjects for the zzso prefrontal zzso and 10 bipolar and 11 control subjects for the zzso zzso zzso between disease and control groups were identified using a rigorous statistical analysis with correction for zzso variables and multiple zzso In the zzso cortex, zzso zzso expressed transcripts were identified by zzso analysis and a representative subset was validated by quantitative real-time zzso zzso analysis revealed significant zzso of genes involved in zzso coupled zzso zzso and response to stimulus (in particular the immune zzso while genes relating to the zzso cycle and zzso transport showed coordinated zzso in bipolar zzso Additionally, several genes involved in synaptic function were significantly zzso in bipolar zzso No significant changes in gene expression were observed in the zzso prefrontal zzso using zzso analysis or quantitative real-time zzso Our findings zzso the zzso zzso as a region prominently involved in bipolar disorder and indicate that diverse processes are zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso and synaptic function may be central to the disease zzso
