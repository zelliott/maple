There is currently no treatment for the inherited motor zzso disease, spinal muscular zzso zzso Severe zzso causes lower motor zzso loss, impaired zzso development, profound muscle weakness and early zzso zzso is a transforming growth zzso family member that zzso muscle zzso Loss or blockade of myostatin signaling increases muscle mass and improves muscle strength in mouse models of primary muscle disease and in the motor zzso disease, zzso lateral zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of blocking myostatin signaling in severe zzso mice zzso by two independent zzso zzso transgenic zzso of the myostatin inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso administration of a soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso showed little increase in muscle mass and no improvement in motor function or zzso zzso mice treated with zzso showed minimal improvement in motor function, and no extension of survival compared with zzso zzso Together these results suggest that zzso of myostatin may not be a promising therapeutic strategy in severe forms of zzso
