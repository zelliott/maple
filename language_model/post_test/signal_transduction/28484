zzso also known as zzso is required to establish the zzso cell population necessary for zzso in zzso Additional roles during development, including zzso formation, have been zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows neural plate patterning defects and reduced zzso at the zzso zzso To investigate the function of maternal and early zzso zzso zzso we rescued zzso zzso zzso by injecting zzso zzso at the zzso stage and raised them into fertile zzso zzso adults that mate to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and germ cells develop in zzso zzso zzso is delayed and proceeds zzso Further, zzso zzso do not maintain expression of zzso express little or no zzso and fail to develop zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso ubiquitous zzso expression in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso fusion protein can rescue zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose that zzso plays an zzso role in zzso zzso development, where it maintains zzso expression during zzso and acts with zzso to induce zzso expression in zzso precursor zzso
