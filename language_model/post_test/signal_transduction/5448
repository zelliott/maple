zzso infection activates zzso factors zzso and zzso which collaborate to induce type I zzso zzso and elicit innate zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso has recently been identified as an zzso that links zzso receptors to zzso zzso Here, we showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso response, whereas zzso of zzso had opposite zzso zzso targeted zzso at zzso for zzso and degradation after viral zzso Both zzso and zzso were located at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and viral infection caused their zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso We further found that zzso zzso and degradation of zzso by zzso occurred at the zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso signaling by targeting zzso for zzso and degradation at the zzso
