zzso zzso factors control zzso along the zzso axis of zzso Because their direct functional targets are still poorly understood in zzso it remains unclear how the zzso information zzso by zzso genes is translated into zzso zzso Here, we zzso demonstrate that zzso is a direct downstream target of zzso in zzso and show that the zzso expression of zzso observed in the absence of zzso contributes to the zzso mouse zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts to mediate zzso control over the zzso growth factor zzso during zzso arch zzso
