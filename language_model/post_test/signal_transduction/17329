The gene zzso and its human zzso zzso zzso huge molecules with several zzso and zinc finger zzso It has been reported that they play important roles in neural differentiation and promotion of zzso in several zzso of both humans and zzso In the zzso wing zzso disc, zzso is expressed in a dynamic pattern and previous results suggest that it is involved is zzso zzso In this report we go further in the analysis of the function of this gene in wing development, performing zzso expression experiments and studying its effects in genes involved in wing zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays an important role controlling the expression of several wing genes and in the zzso of those cellular properties that define the differences in cell proliferation between zzso and zzso zzso of the wing zzso
