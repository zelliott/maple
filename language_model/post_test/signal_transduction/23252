Lupus is a complex zzso rheumatic disease of unknown zzso The disease is associated with diverse features of zzso zzso in which zzso play a central zzso However, the cause of zzso zzso responses remains zzso In this article, we provide a synopsis of current knowledge on zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso in lupus and their potential effects on the response of these cells in mouse models and in zzso There are numerous reported defects in the regulation of zzso zzso proteins and pathways in zzso in lupus that, zzso affect critical biological zzso Most of the evidence for these defects comes from studies of disease models and genetically engineered zzso However, there is also increasing evidence from studying zzso from patients and from zzso linkage analyses for parallel defects to those observed in zzso These studies provide molecular and genetic explanations for the key zzso abnormalities associated with zzso Most of the new information appears to relate to defects in zzso zzso that impact zzso zzso zzso production and responses to zzso Some of these abnormalities will be discussed within the context of disease zzso
