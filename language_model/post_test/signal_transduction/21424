Information contained in the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso proteins zzso that mediate diverse functions including zzso zzso cell trafficking and zzso zzso Although information on the biological roles of zzso is rapidly zzso challenges remain in identifying the zzso zzso and their impact on zzso zzso zzso interactions are typically low zzso requiring zzso interactions to achieve a biological zzso Though many zzso can carry the zzso structure recognized by the zzso other factors, such as recognition of protein zzso and zzso zzso may restrict which zzso are functional zzso in zzso Recent advances in development of zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso databases are providing new tools to identify the zzso of zzso and to zzso the mechanisms by which they participate in zzso zzso
