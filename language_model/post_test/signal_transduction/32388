zzso The zzso currents evoked in isolated and identified zzso of zzso pedal zzso by either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso were investigated using zzso and patch clamp zzso zzso zzso currents induced by either zzso or zzso could be blocked by zzso zzso as well as by a prolonged zzso injection of the G protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso with the G protein zzso zzso on the other hand, induced a zzso zzso This current was not additive to the currents evoked by zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of the calcium buffer zzso failed to affect any of the zzso zzso although it effectively blocked the zzso following directly evoked action zzso zzso The activity of the zzso channels seen in zzso patches was greatly enhanced by application to the bath of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The only effect of an addition of zzso to the bath was to increase the open probability zzso of the zzso channel already active in the control zzso The identity of the spontaneously active and zzso channels was concluded from the identity of their channel zzso zzso properties and current zzso zzso zzso when applied to the bath, induced an increase in open time and caused an increase in zzso as did the zzso zzso completely prevented changes of zzso induced by the zzso zzso but not those induced by the zzso zzso The same inwardly zzso zzso channel may be opened by both the zzso G protein (with zzso zzso zzso and by protein zzso C (with zzso zzso zzso zzso Strong evidence was obtained against the involvement of any known secondary zzso systems zzso of zzso zzso turnover and subsequent zzso of protein zzso C, formation of zzso oxide, metabolism of zzso zzso in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since none of the known secondary zzso systems seems to affect the zzso by zzso applied to receptors outside the patch of channels located under the patch zzso it appears that some as yet zzso linking system must exist that could connect the zzso separated zzso protein complex and the zzso zzso
