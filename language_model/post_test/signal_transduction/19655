This review summarizes the past year's literature regarding the regulation of gastric zzso and zzso zzso at the central, zzso and cellular zzso 

zzso acid zzso is an intricate and dynamic process that is regulated by neural zzso and zzso hormonal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways as well as mechanical zzso zzso and chemical zzso zzso zzso coffee, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid by the zzso cell involves recruitment and fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso membrane with subsequent zzso transport of zzso zzso in exchange for zzso the source of the latter is the zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso exits via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso pump zzso leads to a zzso zzso which, if zzso results in zzso and zzso cell zzso The clinical consequence is rebound acid zzso which may induce dyspeptic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate zzso symptoms in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

We continue to make progress in our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid zzso in health and zzso A better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms regulating acid zzso should lead to improved management of patients with zzso disorders as well as those who zzso too little zzso
