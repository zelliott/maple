The general properties of ABC zzso from bacteria to humans, including a brief history of their initial discovery, are zzso ABC zzso one of the largest protein super families and vital for human health, are in zzso responsible for the transport of an enormous range of molecules from zzso zzso or zzso drugs zzso to large zzso Nevertheless, all ABC zzso are powered by a zzso zzso the ABC or zzso domain, using in all probability the same basic mechanism of action for the zzso of zzso and its zzso to the transport zzso Based on recent high resolution structures of several zzso and an intact zzso a model of how zzso of these important proteins function will be discussed, with particular attention to zzso the ABC zzso from zzso zzso
