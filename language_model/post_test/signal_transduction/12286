The zzso zzso complex has many roles in response to DNA zzso breaks, but its functions in repair by zzso end joining zzso pathways are poorly zzso We have investigated requirements for zzso in class switch zzso zzso a programmed DNA zzso in B zzso that requires zzso To this end, we have engineered mice that lack the entire zzso complex in B zzso or that possess an intact complex that harbors zzso zzso lacking DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a strong zzso in zzso affecting both the classic and the alternative zzso zzso In contrast, absence of zzso zzso activities causes a milder zzso revealing a separation of function within the zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso distant breaks and processes DNA zzso to facilitate repair by both the classical and alternative zzso zzso
