zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics zzso zzso binding zzso play roles in determining cellular zzso The roles that these characteristics play are zzso by models of signal zzso We examined signal zzso through zzso zzso using a model based on the collision zzso model but including zzso zzso states and the zzso of receptors with zzso prior to the addition of zzso zzso and diffusion of molecules within the plasma membrane were simulated using zzso Carlo zzso The zzso zzso produced by our model was compared with that produced by the collision zzso zzso We zzso examined how the parameters characteristic of the tissue and zzso determine the zzso and zzso response of the zzso zzso zzso through zzso binding to zzso receptors can produce significantly higher zzso rates than does collision zzso zzso and zzso characteristics have zzso similar effects but zzso distinct effects on zzso for the two zzso Using standard experimental techniques, it may be possible to exploit these differences to determine the mechanism of zzso zzso in a specific cell zzso A quantitative comparison of model predictions with published data on the zzso zzso system zzso D and Barber zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also is zzso
