Our previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso kills zzso zzso by involving zzso zzso from the zzso pool in the cells but not by influx from zzso zzso More recently, we found that zzso induced zzso zzso of several cellular zzso followed by zzso cell death of zzso zzso The present study was aimed to zzso the molecular zzso of these zzso zzso induced by zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso C zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso caused the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso A, a specific inhibitor of protein zzso zzso inhibited a zzso increase in zzso level in the cells as well as zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso of the cells with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso prevented zzso cell zzso Thus, these results strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso plays, at least in part, an important role for the development of zzso cell zzso
