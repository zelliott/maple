Advanced zzso end products zzso have been shown to play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso in diabetic zzso but the zzso signaling zzso remains zzso We report here that zzso signal through the zzso for zzso zzso to induce zzso as determined by de zzso expression of a zzso marker zzso muscle zzso zzso and loss of zzso marker zzso directly through the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is zzso zzso This is supported by the following findings: zzso induced de zzso zzso zzso expression as early as 2 hours followed by a loss of zzso before zzso zzso expression at 24 hours and occurred in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at 15 minutes and zzso at 24 hours were completely blocked by a zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso to mediate the early zzso zzso The findings from this study suggest that targeting the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide new therapeutic strategies for diabetic zzso and shed new light on the zzso of diabetic zzso
