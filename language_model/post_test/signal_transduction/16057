zzso is strongly linked to aging but the mechanisms for this link are incompletely zzso The recent literature was reviewed to find studies providing new insights into the connection between aging and zzso 

Basic aging studies in zzso cells suggest that a cell stress or cell damage response contributes to chronic inflammation that promotes age-related zzso This cellular response results in the zzso zzso zzso which has many of the characteristics of an zzso zzso in terms of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress can promote cell zzso and studies have shown a role for zzso stress in altering cell signaling pathways in zzso that can disrupt the response to growth zzso zzso are an important source of zzso oxygen species and studies continue to support a role for the zzso in zzso including work suggesting changes in energy zzso Cell death occurs in zzso cartilage and recent studies suggest zzso may play a role in determining if a cell lives or dies when zzso 

zzso progress is being made on characterizing zzso changes in zzso Additional studies are needed that focus on the zzso outside of the zzso cartilage that play a role in zzso Because zzso occurs in older adults who also have age-related changes in muscle, bone, fat, and the nervous system, it is likely that a more general and systemic approach will be needed to better understand the link between aging and zzso
