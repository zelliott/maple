The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of obesity alone and obesity associated with Type 2 diabetes on the structure, vascular zzso and response to insulin of isolated human subcutaneous fat zzso these effects were correlated with the expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso tissue was zzso during surgery, small zzso zzso diameter 220 zzso 40 zzso were dissected out and investigated by electron zzso zzso and zzso Compared with the subcutaneous zzso of lean subjects, obesity activated the zzso enhanced the zzso of collagen within vascular wall and increased the sensitivity of zzso zzso obesity also diminished zzso zzso NO zzso protein zzso NO production, and zzso and zzso zzso as well as the protein expression of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of the downstream molecules in the insulin zzso pathway, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When obesity was associated with Type 2 diabetes, these changes were significantly zzso In conclusion, obesity alone or obesity associated with Type 2 diabetes alters human zzso zzso tissue zzso in terms of structure, function and zzso including diminished zzso expression and reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the insulin zzso zzso
