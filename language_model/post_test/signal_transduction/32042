Stem cell maintenance is essential for growth and development of plants and zzso Similar to animal studies, zzso factors play a critical role in plant stem cell zzso however the regulatory logic is not well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harbor a pool of zzso stem cells and they provide cells for the development of all zzso zzso zzso genetic studies spanning more than a decade have revealed zzso communication logic underlying stem cell zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor expressed in cells of the organizing center specifies stem cells in zzso cells of the central zone zzso and also activates a negative zzso zzso zzso a small zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and also possibly to zzso receptors to activate signaling which restricts zzso zzso Though the zzso feedback network explains the zzso communication logic of stem cell zzso how zzso communicates with adjacent cells had remained zzso In October 15 2011 issue of Genes and Development, we report that zzso protein zzso in cells of organizing center zzso into adjacent cells via zzso movement and activates zzso zzso by directly binding to promoter zzso
