zzso zzso zzso isolated from the roots of zzso zzso is a novel potential zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso various defense responses in zzso However, little is known about the mechanism of zzso induced plant zzso The zzso profiles in tobacco leaves after treatment with zzso or distilled water were analyzed using zzso zzso The profiling analysis revealed numerous changes in gene expression after zzso treatment, which resulted in the zzso of 169 genes and the zzso of 243 zzso The data were confirmed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and real-time quantitative zzso Gene zzso analysis revealed that the zzso expressed genes were mainly involved in stress responses, defense responses, zzso zzso hormone responses, zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways and other zzso The results of this study suggested two important zzso First, the differential expression of genes involved in plant hormone signaling pathways are related to defense, especially salicylic zzso zzso such as the genes zzso pathogen related zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso factor, zzso genes zzso flowering promoting zzso 1 and zzso dwarf 2, and zzso acid related gene zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that plant hormones and their zzso might play a critical role in the defense response to zzso treatment in zzso Second, the genes involved in the zzso of secondary zzso were increased after zzso treatment including zzso zzso and zzso zzso which serve as zzso in defense against pathogens and zzso
