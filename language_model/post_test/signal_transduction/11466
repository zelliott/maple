Recent experiments have provided new quantitative zzso of the zzso phenomenon in fields of developing zzso zzso These zzso have enabled us to develop a mathematical model for the ripple phenomenon on the basis of the zzso of the zzso system, zzso individuals signal by direct cell zzso The model zzso reproduces all of the experimental observations and illustrates how zzso zzso zzso zzso communication, and cell zzso can coordinate to produce collective zzso This pattern of waves is zzso different from that observed in other social organisms, especially zzso zzso which depend on zzso zzso
