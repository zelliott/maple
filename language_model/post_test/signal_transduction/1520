zzso promoters are able to respond to a wide spectrum of light through multiple zzso zzso Several zzso elements have been identified as components of zzso promoter zzso however, none of these regulatory elements by itself appears to be sufficient to zzso light zzso rather, the combination of at least two elements seems to be zzso Using zzso structural analysis, we have identified zzso DNA modular zzso zzso associated with zzso promoter regions that have been zzso throughout the evolutionary radiation of zzso Here, we report the functional characterization of zzso a native zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, which contains an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso behaves as a zzso minimal unit capable of zzso a zzso minimal promoter in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show that zzso light induction requires zzso and that downstream negative regulators zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate its zzso Our results show that the simplest zzso promoter element from zzso genes described to date is the common target for different signals involved in light zzso The possible mechanism involved in zzso regulation and tissue specificity of zzso elements units is zzso
