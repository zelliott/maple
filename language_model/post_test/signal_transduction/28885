Present treatment of zzso the most common zzso brain tumor in children, includes surgery, zzso and zzso In spite of radical treatment, only about zzso of patients zzso Also side effects of the treatment are zzso mostly due to applied zzso 

The following review highlights potential molecular targets for zzso of zzso as well as the directions in which, in the zzso opinion, the field will evolve in near zzso 

Present literature on pathways engaged in formation of zzso is summarized in the context of their available pharmacological zzso 

The quest for a better treatment zzso includes better risk zzso methods, including molecular profiling of individual tumors and a search for new small molecules capable of zzso zzso signaling zzso Several candidates for such agents are being tested zzso
