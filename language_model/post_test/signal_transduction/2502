We have studied zzso zzso of proteins in human zzso loaded with zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso A major zzso of 20 zzso in resting zzso was markedly zzso upon zzso of cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso this zzso could be shown to be identical with zzso a protein implicated in zzso filament zzso Signaling pathways leading to this zzso were further zzso To define the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso we used different zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso which zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso did not prevent zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso which act also on zzso zzso zzso almost completely suppressed this zzso The lack of effect of zzso zzso was not due to insufficient entry into the cells, as this drug suppressed zzso increases in protein zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso alpha or zzso may thus be involved in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting here a zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso attenuated zzso of zzso in resting zzso This reduced level was not further attenuated by zzso zzso 1 and/or 2A may thus control zzso zzso in resting cells and contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid was always accompanied by a shift of zzso to the cell periphery into zzso zzso These findings suggest a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
