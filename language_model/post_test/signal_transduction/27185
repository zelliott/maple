A series of investigations were performed to zzso the mechanisms of action of lithium, zzso and zzso We have found that zzso exerts major effects on G zzso most likely via a zzso process stabilizing the inactive zzso zzso beta zzso form of the zzso We also find that chronic zzso and zzso exert major, very similar effects on the zzso signaling pathway, with both drugs decreasing the levels of zzso zzso alpha and zzso and have similar effects on the DNA binding activity of the zzso factor, zzso By contrast, we find that zzso exerts major, direct zzso effect at the level of zzso zzso Overall, the results suggest that signal zzso pathways are targets for the actions of zzso zzso given their key roles in the amplification and integration of signals in the central nervous system, these findings have clear implications not only for research into the zzso of zzso illness, but also for the development of innovative treatment zzso
