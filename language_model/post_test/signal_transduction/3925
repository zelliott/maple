Many cells coordinate their activities by zzso rises in zzso calcium from cell to zzso In zzso cells, there are currently two models for zzso calcium wave zzso both of which involve release of zzso zzso zzso sensitive zzso calcium zzso In one model, zzso zzso gap junctions and zzso the release of zzso calcium stores in neighboring zzso zzso calcium waves may be zzso not by gap zzso communication, but rather by zzso activity of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso We studied mechanically induced calcium waves in two rat zzso cell lines that differ in the gap junction proteins they zzso in their ability to pass zzso dye from cell to cell, and in their expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which express the gap junction protein zzso zzso are well dye zzso and lack zzso zzso transmitted slow gap zzso calcium waves that did not require release of zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso cells predominantly express the gap junction protein zzso 45 zzso are poorly dye zzso and express zzso zzso they zzso fast calcium waves that required release of zzso calcium stores and zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not gap zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed both types of calcium zzso Gap zzso zzso zzso calcium waves were also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso receptors can zzso zzso zzso and describe a novel zzso mechanism for calcium wave propagation that does not require release of zzso calcium stores by zzso These studies suggest that gap junction communication zzso by either zzso or zzso does not allow passage of zzso well enough to elicit release of zzso calcium stores in neighboring zzso
