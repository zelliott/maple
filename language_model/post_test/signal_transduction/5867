Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso is the zzso agent for adult zzso leukemia zzso Aurora A, a zzso checkpoint zzso is zzso in human cancer zzso The cell zzso turnover of Aurora A is regulated by zzso zzso zzso such as checkpoint with fork zzso and ring finger zzso Here, we found zzso of Aurora A protein in zzso zzso lines and primary ATL zzso The expression of zzso zzso was reduced in these cells by abnormal zzso of zzso promoter zzso zzso of Aurora A using small interfering zzso suppressed the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso of Aurora A expression zzso enhanced zzso nuclear zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso into an zzso zzso line reduced cell growth, Aurora A protein level and zzso zzso reporter zzso Aurora zzso inhibitor suppressed the growth and survival of zzso zzso lines and primary ATL zzso It also reduced zzso zzso activity in an zzso zzso line by reducing zzso zzso beta zzso and the expression of zzso protein zzso Our results suggested that loss of zzso expression resulted to zzso of Aurora A, which increased zzso zzso These findings highlight the critical role of Aurora A in zzso T cells, making this zzso a potentially suitable target for future therapies for zzso
