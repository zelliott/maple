zzso in plants is almost entirely a zzso zzso This unique feature implies a strict zzso of cell proliferation and zzso including cell division, arrest, cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso The plant zzso zzso protein zzso the activity of zzso zzso factors to restrict cell zzso zzso contains a single zzso zzso and its loss of function zzso zzso formation and early zzso To determine the relevance of the zzso zzso during zzso outside its involvement in cell division, we have used an zzso system to zzso zzso function and release zzso zzso Here, we have focused on leaves where cell proliferation and differentiation are temporally and zzso zzso Our results reveal that zzso restricts cell division early during leaf development when cell proliferation zzso while it regulates zzso occurrence at later zzso Moreover, shortly after leaving the cell cycle, most of leaf zzso pavement cells retain the ability to zzso the cell cycle and zzso but maintain zzso cell zzso On the contrary, zzso cells in the inner layers do not respond in this way to zzso loss of zzso We conclude that there exists a distinct response of different cells to zzso zzso in terms of maintaining the balance between cell division and zzso during zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso
