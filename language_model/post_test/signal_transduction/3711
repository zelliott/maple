In zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the establishment of zzso cell zzso This signaling activity is thought to depend on the binding of zzso to members of the zzso family of zzso factors and the regulation of gene expression by this zzso To test whether zzso must accumulate in zzso to establish zzso cell fate, we constructed various zzso zzso that restrict zzso to either the plasma zzso the zzso or the zzso When zzso in zzso zzso the proteins zzso as predicted, but surprisingly all forms induce an zzso zzso indicative of inducing zzso cell zzso Given this unexpected result, we focused on the zzso form of zzso to resolve the apparent zzso between its membrane zzso and the hypothesized role of nuclear zzso in establishing zzso cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso the level of free zzso zzso which subsequently accumulates in zzso zzso with the hypothesis that it is this pool of zzso zzso that signals in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso which binds free zzso blocks the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso increases the level of zzso zzso likely involves competition for the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso which in other systems has been shown to play a role in degradation of zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso to the membrane in zzso Similar results are observed with zzso zzso casting doubt on a normal role for zzso in axis zzso and indicating that zzso proteins that interact with zzso can zzso elevate the level of zzso zzso likely by interfering with its zzso These results highlight the difficulty in interpreting the activity of an zzso protein when it is zzso in a background containing the zzso zzso We next investigated whether the ability of zzso to interact with potential protein partners in the cell may normally be regulated by zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso expressing the zzso region of zzso These results suggest that zzso interactions of zzso can be influenced by its state of zzso in addition to prior evidence that this zzso zzso the stability of zzso
