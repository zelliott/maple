zzso zzso requires zzso domain targeting signals that specify incorporation of cargo into zzso zzso zzso proteins play a central role in cargo collection by linking targeting signals to the zzso zzso We have characterized zzso zzso targeting signals and identified the zzso protein zzso as the zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso 11 zzso acids encompassing an zzso sequence were sufficient to direct zzso of a truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso In this context, zzso targeting activity was not sustained by conservative zzso of the zzso or zzso An zzso sequence was identified in native zzso that functions zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso interaction screen for zzso proteins yielded zzso but no genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso known to recognize zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did not recognize an zzso signal when directly tested by zzso zzso zzso disruption severely inhibited zzso zzso but only marginally affected zzso zzso zzso zzso required a zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso domain, which selectively bound an zzso fusion protein in zzso Thus, through a novel zzso domain, zzso serves as an zzso targeting signal zzso providing a means to couple cargo with zzso and zzso zzso zzso
