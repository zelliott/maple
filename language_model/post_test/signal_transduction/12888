zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both essential to cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso involves its zzso by zzso zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso heavy and zzso light alpha zzso Our report presents evidence of an alternative zzso of zzso processing involving zzso In breast zzso zzso cells deficient in zzso zzso is processed by a conventional zzso PC, and the mature zzso zzso zzso is represented by the zzso heavy chain and the zzso light chain zzso from the zzso zzso In contrast, in cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso generating a zzso heavy chain with the truncated C zzso and a zzso light chain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso are also susceptible to zzso zzso These novel mechanisms involved in the processing of zzso alpha zzso underscore the significance and complexity of interactions between zzso and zzso receptors and suggest that regulation of zzso functionality may be an important role of zzso in zzso tumor zzso
