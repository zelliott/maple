After zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in cerebral arteries contribute to delayed cerebral zzso and poor zzso We zzso such changes are triggered by early zzso signals, targeting of which may prevent zzso zzso We performed an unbiased quantitative analysis of early zzso zzso in cerebral arteries and evaluated identified signaling components as targets for prevention of delayed zzso and zzso zzso zzso from rat cerebral arteries were zzso by high-resolution tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso were validated by zzso and monitored over a 24-hour time course post zzso Moreover, zzso of key zzso was zzso Major zzso zzso were observed on focal zzso complexes, zzso regulated zzso 1/2 zzso calcium zzso zzso II, signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the latter two downstream of zzso zzso of zzso zzso post zzso prevented increases in cerebrovascular zzso zzso zzso zzso wall zzso and improved zzso zzso zzso zzso partially zzso these zzso The study shows that quantitative mass zzso is a strong approach to study in zzso vascular zzso Moreover, it shows that targeting of zzso prevents delayed zzso changes in cerebral arteries and improves outcome, and identifies zzso signaling components downstream and upstream of zzso
