The zzso system zzso is critical for the control of blood pressure by the zzso Recently, direct zzso zzso were approved as zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanism of zzso which regulates blood pressure in the nucleus zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Here we have investigated the zzso pathways involved in zzso blood pressure regulation, at the zzso 

zzso responses to zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso rats were zzso in the absence and presence of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor IV and zzso a zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the involvement of zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso into the zzso produced a prominent zzso effect and increased NO zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso response evoked by zzso zzso and zzso studies further showed that zzso of zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects evoked by zzso zzso of zzso also increased Ras zzso in the zzso 

Taken together, these results suggest zzso modulated blood pressure at the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and Ras to evoke zzso zzso
