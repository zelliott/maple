This study examined the effects of a dual treatment combining insulin treatment and exercise training on zzso cardiac function and signaling pathways involving zzso zzso and zzso in type 1 diabetic zzso Male zzso rats were assigned into a diabetic group receiving no treatment zzso an zzso diabetic zzso a trained diabetic zzso and a trained zzso diabetic zzso zzso Control group zzso was included in order to confirm the deleterious effects of zzso zzso treatment and/or treadmill exercise training were conducted for 8 zzso zzso cardiac function was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso was assessed using Western zzso Diabetes induced a decrease of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cardiac function zzso zzso zzso Moreover, diabetes was associated with an increase of zzso and zzso and a decrease of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Although combined treatment was not able to zzso zzso it succeeded to zzso zzso of diabetic zzso Combined treatment led to an zzso of zzso zzso of this combined treatment on zzso and zzso were greater than the effects of insulin and exercise training, applied zzso zzso applied solely or in zzso resulted in a complete zzso of zzso and in a zzso of zzso because this protein expression in all treated diabetic rats became lower than control values zzso zzso zzso Our study shows that unlike single treatments, dual treatment combining insulin treatment and exercise training was able to zzso zzso zzso function of diabetic rats by a specific regulation of zzso signaling zzso
