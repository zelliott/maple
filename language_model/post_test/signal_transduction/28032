zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso is not only limited to cells directly involved in zzso but has also been demonstrated in zzso cells like zzso zzso zzso Because zzso cells are subjected to regulation by zzso hormones and produce steroid hormones, we have investigated here the effects of human zzso zzso zzso or steroid hormones on zzso expression in cultured mouse tumor zzso cells zzso zzso and have then analyzed the underlying molecular zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso revealed increases in zzso zzso and protein levels, respectively, over zzso hours in zzso cells after stimulation with zzso or zzso Although zzso cells lack the classical zzso zzso zzso was able to stimulate zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso experiments suggested that the zzso region is able to zzso bind the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of 2 potential zzso binding sites in the zzso region showed the requirement of these motifs for stimulation of zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence interacts with so zzso faster zzso zzso Following stimulation with zzso or zzso the binding of these proteins was increased in the complexes formed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells is regulated by zzso via a zzso zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso appear to be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso also appears to play a role in the regulation of zzso acting presumably via a zzso zzso that remains to be characterized zzso
