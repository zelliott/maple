The proliferation of most cells is strictly dependent on zzso zzso a phenomenon called zzso zzso Because tumor cells often are independent of this regulation, it is important to characterize the molecular pathways that control cellular proliferation after detachment of cells from their zzso In this report, we investigated a possible role of zzso and one of its target zzso zzso as components of zzso cell growth zzso We found that zzso protein is rapidly activated upon the disruption of cellular zzso This led to zzso zzso zzso via two zzso sites in its zzso zzso zzso protein levels blocked zzso and activity of the cell zzso zzso A, and cells became arrested in zzso of the cell zzso Under the same conditions, zzso from zzso zzso mice did not activate zzso and did not zzso zzso A expression but rather induced another cell cycle zzso zzso Thus, our results characterize a chain of events, starting from the zzso of zzso and proceeding via zzso to zzso A, that is activated in response to the loss of cellular zzso This zzso zzso may constitute one of a few redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in zzso zzso
