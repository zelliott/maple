Several zzso proteins have two zzso targeting zzso These signals have been termed zzso because targeting can still occur with only one zzso We now report that separate targeting motifs within both zzso and zzso provide complementary zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that contains six zzso zzso zzso We had previously shown that the zzso region zzso zzso consisting of zzso and a short adjacent segment of zzso zzso was required for targeting to proliferated zzso in zzso zzso We now report that the analogous zzso which cannot target to proliferated zzso targets at least as well, or much better zzso on strain and growth zzso in cells containing only zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest differences in the targeting zzso among zzso zzso zzso a peripheral protein facing the zzso contains a typical zzso terminal targeting sequence zzso that has been shown to be zzso for zzso indicating the existence of a second targeting domain (not yet defined in zzso zzso thus, its function was zzso We show that targeting to zzso zzso but not to proliferated zzso is more efficient with the zzso than without zzso Our results indicate that multiple targeting signals within zzso proteins extend coverage among zzso populations of zzso and increase efficiency of targeting in some zzso zzso
