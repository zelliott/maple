zzso zzso is an important mechanism underlying the removal of redundant zzso from an inflammatory zzso The ability of many zzso agents to impede this event suggests that such agents act not only in a zzso or zzso capacity but also increase zzso longevity by delaying zzso We have examined whether this hypothesis holds true for all zzso zzso agents, in particular tumor necrosis zzso zzso which has been zzso reported to either zzso zzso or have no effect on zzso zzso After 20 hours zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso however, more detailed analysis demonstrated its ability to promote zzso in a zzso of cells at earlier (2 to 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor all inhibited zzso at 6 and 20 zzso The early zzso effect of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished by zzso zzso zzso and was not associated with any change in cell viability or zzso Of relevance to the inflamed site, the ability of zzso to accelerate zzso was lost if zzso were primed with 1 zzso zzso or aged for 6 hours before zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso but with a potency zzso lower than zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso blocking zzso to both zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso has the unique ability to induce zzso in human zzso via a mechanism where zzso zzso the dominant zzso death zzso This may be an important mechanism controlling zzso longevity and clearance in zzso
