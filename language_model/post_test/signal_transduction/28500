zzso zzso is a childhood cancer that arises in the adrenal zzso and often shows differentiated zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal zzso is functional in most zzso while loss of nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso with an aggressive zzso Thus, we hypothesized that the zzso and zzso signal pathways collaborate to instruct zzso zzso reminiscent of normal zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso increases expression of the zzso zzso complex in a panel of zzso human zzso cell lines, indicative of a positive feedback zzso zzso also zzso growth zzso zzso with an arrest of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso factor zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso thereby strengthening the zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expression of the amplified zzso zzso concurrent with the arrest of cell zzso while expressing zzso markers zzso zzso Interestingly, maintenance of differentiated zzso cells in culture is independent of the zzso activity of zzso but depends on zzso zzso thereby re-enacting the differentiation of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso
