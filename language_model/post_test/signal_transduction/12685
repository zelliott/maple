The zzso nerve can limit inflammation via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Selective pharmacological stimulation of the zzso may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory zzso We determined the zzso potential of zzso an zzso partial zzso on primary human zzso and compared it with zzso the zzso zzso widely used for research into the zzso effects of zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated whether the effects of both zzso zzso were restricted to specific zzso receptors zzso zzso and explored the mechanism behind the zzso effect of zzso zzso and nicotine inhibited the release of zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso and whole blood independent of the zzso zzso with higher zzso for zzso compared to zzso The zzso zzso zzso was relatively unaffected by both zzso zzso The effects of zzso and nicotine could not be reversed by zzso antagonists, while the zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso effect of zzso is zzso at the zzso level and involves zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso has a profound zzso effect in human zzso and that zzso is more zzso than zzso The absence of a blocking effect of zzso zzso in human zzso might indicate different pharmacological properties of the zzso in human zzso compared to other cell zzso zzso may be promising from a therapeutic perspective because of its suitability for human zzso
