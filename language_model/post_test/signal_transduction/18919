During aging, zzso become unresponsive to zzso growth zzso zzso This study examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso signaling during zzso zzso were performed using cartilage and zzso isolated from horses ages 1 zzso zzso Northern analysis was used to examine expression of the small zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western analysis was zzso to assess total zzso zzso + zzso active, zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso with Western zzso zzso was also measured following zzso zzso Gene expression for zzso and zzso were decreased in mature samples, but there was no difference in total zzso zzso + zzso protein expression due to zzso zzso was significantly greater in prepubescent samples compared to other age zzso zzso diminished the zzso state of zzso in prepubescent zzso however, this effect was lost during zzso No differences in results were observed due to sample type; that is, cartilage zzso versus isolated zzso These studies suggest that loss of zzso regulation of zzso zzso may be a mechanism for the zzso unresponsive state during zzso Further, the zzso state of zzso measured in native and zzso cartilage tissue for the first time, is similar to that of isolated zzso indicating that the zzso state of small zzso is not affected by isolation of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso studies will identify the upstream regulators of zzso which will further zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso resistance during aging thereby providing insight into targeted strategies for age-related zzso
