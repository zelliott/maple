zzso disorder zzso is associated with elevated cardiovascular mortality zzso We investigated the zzso of zzso oxide zzso signaling in zzso from patients with BD at different zzso 

zzso obtained from 28 patients with BD and 10 healthy volunteers were analyzed for zzso zzso NO zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso content, and zzso of zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso and zzso were also measured in zzso zzso acid and zzso protein levels in plasma were zzso 

Plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso standard error of the mean zzso zzso 97 zzso 10 versus 121 zzso 10 zzso and its transport into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso cells per zzso did not differ between patients with BD and controls zzso zzso zzso Patients with BD showed reduced zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, p zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content was reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, p zzso zzso despite the absence of changes in soluble zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso arbitrary units, p zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso activity, but not zzso activity, was increased in patients with BD in the manic phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 335 versus zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso protein was elevated only in manic episodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso NO generation from zzso zzso and zzso stress may play pivotal roles in the multifaceted process of cardiovascular events in zzso
