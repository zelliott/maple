The role of zzso factors in B cell survival and differentiation has been delineated during the last zzso However, little is known about the intermediate signals and the zzso pathways that control these zzso In this study, we provide evidence both in zzso and in zzso showing that zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a critical zzso of B cell differentiation and zzso Although zzso is not expressed in resting B cells from normal mice, its expression is markedly induced after zzso with stimuli such as zzso and zzso zzso These signals promote survival and block the final differentiation of these cells, thus allowing the rising of a memory B cell zzso In addition, zzso is expressed in B cells from zzso zzso mice, which received signals for zzso and differentiation in zzso By using an zzso strategy, we determined that zzso is a critical signal zzso the effects of zzso on B cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso survival of activated B cells, favoring the differentiation toward a plasma cell zzso Moreover, B cells with restrained zzso zzso expression failed to zzso the zzso zzso factor after zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in zzso skewed the balance toward plasma cell zzso which resulted in increased zzso production and zzso clearance during zzso zzso zzso Thus, the present study provides evidence of a novel role for zzso as an zzso zzso of B cell survival and a checkpoint in zzso B cell commitment toward a memory zzso
