zzso zzso not only participate in important signaling pathways but have also been implicated in a number of disease states including acute zzso To investigate the underlying mechanisms in an experimental model mimicking human zzso zzso we zzso the pancreatic duct of zzso rats and zzso mice for up to 6 h and studied zzso changes including the dynamics of zzso in isolated zzso In contrast to zzso duct zzso pancreatic duct obstruction induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso and increased lung zzso zzso Although resting zzso in isolated zzso rose by zzso to 205 zzso 7 zzso the zzso and zzso zzso calcium zzso as well as the zzso zzso declined, but neither the zzso pattern nor the zzso output in response to the zzso inhibitor zzso nor the zzso zzso release were impaired by pancreatic duct zzso On the single cell level pancreatic duct zzso reduced the percentage of cells in which zzso zzso stimulation was followed by a zzso response zzso zzso zzso and increased the percentage of cells with a pathological response zzso peak plateau or absent zzso zzso Moreover, it reduced the frequency and zzso of zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso influx in response to zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso of animals with the calcium zzso zzso These experiments suggest that pancreatic duct obstruction rapidly changes the zzso response of the zzso zzso to a zzso pattern that has been associated with premature zzso zzso zzso and the onset of zzso both of which can be prevented by administration of an zzso calcium zzso
