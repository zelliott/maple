zzso zzso are zzso a family of structurally zzso zzso proteins that regulate the survival, differentiation and maintenance of function of different populations of peripheral and central zzso Among these, zzso zzso zzso zzso has drawn considerable interest because both its synthesis and zzso are increased by zzso levels of activity, indicating a unique role of this zzso in zzso zzso activity to structural and functional properties of zzso zzso In addition to its classical zzso effects, which are evident within hours or days and which usually result from changes in cellular gene zzso zzso exerts acute effects on synaptic transmission and is involved in the induction of long-term zzso Many of these rapid effects of zzso are zzso by its zzso of zzso channel properties following zzso zzso of zzso second zzso zzso and protein zzso However, recent reports have shown that zzso not only acts as a zzso of zzso channels, but can also directly and rapidly gate a zzso channel, thereby assigning zzso the properties of a classical zzso zzso Thus, zzso in addition its role as a potent zzso emerges as an zzso zzso substance which acutely controls resting membrane potential, zzso zzso synaptic transmission and zzso in the induction of synaptic zzso
