zzso B zzso radiation has strong biological effects and zzso the expression of many zzso The major biological pathways affected by zzso radiation remain zzso In this work, we used a zzso zzso approach and applied rigorous statistical analyses to identify zzso regulated genes at 4, 8, 16 or 24 h after zzso zzso The most prominent biological categories in lists of zzso regulated gene sets were extracted by functional enrichment zzso With this approach, we determined that genes participating in two prime cellular zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso pathway, were persistently activated after zzso zzso zzso activity zzso confirmed increased activity for up to 24 h after zzso zzso These results suggest that the persistent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways may have a key role in zzso cellular zzso For the first time, the specific cellular pathways that respond to zzso radiation consistently and persistently can be delineated with confidence using a zzso zzso approach and functional zzso zzso The results of this study offer further insight into zzso stress zzso
