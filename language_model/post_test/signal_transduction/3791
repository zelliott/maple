Members of the heat shock protein 70 zzso family mediate import, zzso assembly and degradation of proteins in zzso The function of zzso proteins is dependent on their interaction with zzso including members of the zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to cooperate with the major zzso zzso zzso We describe the identification of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The protein possesses an zzso zzso domain that anchors it in the zzso inner zzso The zzso zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso of zzso coli zzso and is exposed to the zzso zzso zzso carries a putative internal zzso targeting signal and is imported into zzso in a membrane zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene did not result in a zzso growth zzso Double zzso of zzso and zzso showed severe growth defects at elevated temperature, indicating a distinct overlap of the functions of zzso and zzso
