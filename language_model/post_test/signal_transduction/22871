Signal zzso leading to calcium release in zzso eggs at zzso requires zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso indicating that a zzso zzso is a likely upstream zzso Because previous work has shown a zzso association between the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso family zzso we examined whether a zzso family zzso was required for zzso release at zzso To inhibit the function of zzso in this family, we injected zzso eggs with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This inhibited zzso release in response to zzso but not in response to injection of zzso We further established the specificity of the zzso by showing that the zzso zzso of several other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso domain of zzso were not zzso Also, a zzso zzso zzso domain, which has reduced affinity for zzso was a zzso less effective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that a zzso family zzso by way of its zzso domain, links zzso interaction to zzso zzso release at zzso in zzso zzso
