The mechanisms underlying the zzso C virus zzso resistance to zzso alpha zzso are not fully zzso We used zzso resistant zzso zzso cell lines and an infectious zzso cell culture system to zzso the mechanisms of zzso resistance in cell zzso The zzso resistance mechanism of the zzso cells were addressed by a zzso study that zzso the full-length zzso clones of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso reporter zzso We demonstrated that the expression of the full-length zzso clone alone restored the defective zzso signaling as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso response against zzso in all zzso resistant cell lines zzso zzso and zzso used in this zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequence analysis revealed that the cells from both zzso and zzso series of zzso resistant cells have 58 zzso acid deletions in the zzso zzso domain 1 zzso of zzso In addition, cells from the zzso series have 50 zzso acids deletion in the zzso domain 4 zzso of zzso protein leading to impaired zzso of zzso zzso Using an infectious zzso cell culture model we show here that viral replication in the infected zzso cells is relatively resistant to zzso zzso zzso infection itself zzso defective zzso signaling and zzso zzso and zzso zzso by down regulation of the cell surface expression of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso stress zzso The results of this study suggest that expression of cell surface zzso is critical for the response of zzso to zzso zzso
