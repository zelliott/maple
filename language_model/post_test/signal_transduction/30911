One of the central regulators zzso zzso zzso with zzso dynamics is the zzso zzso zzso Its activity regulates zzso zzso zzso formation and in addition zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have recently shown that the zzso Abi is capable of promoting bristle development in a zzso dependent zzso Here, we report that zzso Abi zzso sensory organ development by modulating zzso zzso zzso of a zzso activated Abi protein zzso leads to an increase in zzso zzso Additionally, suppression of zzso activity zzso the induction of zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso of activated zzso and zzso dramatically enhances the zzso zzso In agreement with this observation Abi is able to associate with the zzso in a common zzso Furthermore, Abi binds the zzso zzso zzso A block of zzso zzso reduces Abi protein stability and strongly abrogates zzso sensory organ formation induced by zzso zzso we noted changes in zzso zzso supporting previous reports that Abi protein stability is linked to zzso zzso zzso by zzso
