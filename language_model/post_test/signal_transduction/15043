To understand the role of human zzso 1 zzso in vascular wall zzso we have studied the effect of the major zzso zzso of zzso acid, zzso acid zzso on vascular smooth muscle cell zzso migration both in zzso and in zzso Among zzso zzso and zzso zzso potentially zzso more vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso migration was dependent on zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso completely negated zzso zzso zzso Cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso promoter revealed the presence of four putative zzso sites, and the site that is zzso to the zzso start site was found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carotid arteries that were subjected to balloon injury and zzso with zzso upon exposure to zzso acid ex zzso produced zzso as a major zzso and enhanced balloon zzso expression of zzso in smooth muscle cells in zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso delivery of zzso into rat carotid artery also led to recruitment and zzso of zzso to zzso region in response to zzso In addition, zzso of zzso into arteries enhanced balloon zzso smooth muscle cell migration from media to zzso and zzso zzso These results show for the first time that zzso axis plays a major role in vascular wall zzso after balloon zzso
