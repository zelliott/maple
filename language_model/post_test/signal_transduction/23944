zzso transient zzso zzso increased zzso resistance to subsequent induction of severe zzso Published data and results obtained by the authors on the zzso mechanisms of hypoxic zzso are zzso The roles of zzso signal zzso zzso function, stress zzso and zzso peptides in this process are zzso The roles of zzso as well as calcium and zzso regulatory systems and zzso factors as components of zzso signal transmission are analyzed in hypoxic zzso induction of functional tolerance mechanisms against the acute harmful effects of zzso on zzso in zzso zzso
