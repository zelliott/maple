In the present study we investigated long-term interactions between zzso and zzso drugs at several steps along their cellular signal zzso zzso For this purpose we zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and examined the effect of prolonged exposure to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso density and on the ability of subsequent application of the zzso to activate zzso (as measured by zzso zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso while zzso induced only zzso zzso This zzso zzso coincided with zzso cross zzso zzso zzso the binding of the zzso zzso zzso while zzso failed to reduce the binding of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso cells presented a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso the binding of zzso in these zzso Thus, a complete correlation was found between zzso and reduction in cell responsiveness zzso Moreover, when zzso zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by either zzso zzso solution or protein zzso zzso zzso was suppressed to the same zzso These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, the reduction in cell responsiveness resulted primarily from zzso of the zzso
