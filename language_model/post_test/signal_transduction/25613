To identify the role of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso wound healing, rat zzso receiving either zzso or zzso wounds were placed in organ culture for up to 3 and 14 days, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso were treated with a zzso inhibitor to suppress zzso signaling or zzso zzso to enhance zzso signaling and zzso changes in the zzso and zzso were zzso The expressions of markers of cell proliferation zzso and zzso differentiation zzso 3) were assessed by zzso zzso and zzso were localized to zzso zzso cells in normal zzso During zzso wound healing, both zzso receptors were detected in zzso and superficial zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed throughout all zzso zzso cell layers and occasional zzso of the zzso in normal and wounded zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso leading to a reduction in zzso cell layers during zzso wound zzso zzso the zzso of zzso resulted in a decreased zzso 3 expression in the zzso zzso with no effect on cellular expression of zzso zzso signaling zzso suppressed zzso zzso differentiation during zzso wound healing, but had no effect on zzso cell zzso
