zzso signals are crucial for the survival of zzso and memory T cells, and the zzso is expressed on the surface of these zzso Following viral infection, the zzso is expressed on only a subset of zzso zzso T cells, and has been demonstrated to be important for the survival of these memory zzso zzso message levels remain relatively constant during the T cell response to zzso zzso virus, but a short-lived burst of zzso is observed soon after zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso in which binding of zzso by T cells leads to zzso zzso allows for the delivery of an zzso signal in all zzso T cells expressing the zzso In mice infected with zzso zzso virus, zzso and zzso T cells zzso with this zzso zzso underwent an enhanced zzso response compared with zzso populations in the same zzso Similarly, zzso transgenic zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso produced higher zzso numbers during the peak of the T cell response to zzso Surprisingly, the enhanced proliferation did not lead to higher memory numbers, as the subsequent contraction phase was more pronounced in the zzso cell zzso These findings demonstrate that artificial zzso signaling during an infection leads to significantly increased zzso zzso T cell numbers, but does not result in increased numbers of memory zzso The extent of contraction may be dictated by intrinsic factors related to the number of prior cell zzso
