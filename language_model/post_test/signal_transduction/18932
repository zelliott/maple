The zzso locus encodes two members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a completely unrelated zzso known as zzso All three products participate in major zzso zzso networks that are disabled in human cancer and influence key zzso processes such as zzso zzso zzso and stem-cell zzso zzso from the locus is therefore kept under strict zzso zzso evidence suggests that although the individual genes can respond independently to positive and negative signals in different zzso the entire locus might be zzso suppressed by a zzso regulatory domain or by the action of zzso group zzso zzso
