zzso a zzso zzso zzso of human zzso was shown to suppress tumor zzso in zzso zzso and melanoma zzso However, the effect of zzso on human cancer cells is still not zzso Here we evaluated the efficiency of zzso delivered by zzso zzso virus zzso zzso for breast cancer zzso zzso of the two human breast cancer cell line zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of soluble zzso In zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso to zzso zzso and zzso migration and invasion of breast cancer cells induced by zzso In both breast cancer cells, zzso targeted zzso zzso namely inhibited the expression of zzso the zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso and the production and zzso of zzso by zzso molecules zzso zzso tail vein zzso and stable expression of zzso in the liver resulted in the long-term presence of zzso in zzso of nude zzso zzso zzso expression zzso by zzso zzso suppressed the growth and spontaneous zzso of zzso breast cancer zzso experimental zzso of circulating breast cancer cells, and improved the long-term survival of breast zzso zzso These findings suggest for the first time that zzso gene therapy may present a novel and promising strategy for treatment against zzso breast zzso
