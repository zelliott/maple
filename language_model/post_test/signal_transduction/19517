zzso signals, both positive and negative, regulate the positioning and zzso of embryonic blood zzso In the zzso of zzso and birds, the first major zzso event is the fusion of bilateral zzso zzso at the zzso to form the zzso zzso Although the original zzso of the zzso zzso occurs as the result of zzso factors zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso by the zzso it is unknown how fusion is later zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso fusion is tightly regulated by a change in signaling by the zzso along the zzso zzso During zzso fusion, the zzso zzso to exert its negative influence on vessel zzso This is achieved by a zzso zzso of negative regulators while positive regulators are maintained at zzso zzso In particular, zzso the most abundant zzso zzso expressed in the zzso prior to fusion, zzso a dramatic zzso in an anterior to zzso zzso With zzso signals diminished and sustained expression of the positive factors zzso and zzso at the zzso fusion of the zzso zzso is zzso These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which major modifications of the vascular pattern can occur through zzso of vascular zzso without changes in the levels of positive vascular zzso
