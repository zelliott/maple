zzso zzso cultures of rat zzso cells have been shown to zzso zzso and zzso when zzso with zzso agents, zzso agents and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso response are zzso In this study zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in zzso zzso at rest and upon stimulation with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso hormone and zzso zzso zzso at zzso that stimulate zzso zzso caused a rise in zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso by adrenaline was blocked by zzso but not by zzso Studies of the zzso relationships showed that for adrenaline and zzso the zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso was higher than that for stimulation of zzso zzso None of these zzso affects zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso contents in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B (with zzso with white zzso at zzso that stimulate zzso zzso also zzso a rise in zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso It is not known whether the zzso response to zzso zzso was zzso by an increase in cell zzso per se, or zzso zzso However, it can be concluded that zzso zzso is the second zzso which mediates the zzso responses to zzso zzso
