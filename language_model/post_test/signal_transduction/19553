zzso zzso beta zzso is the most highly expressed protein in patients with colon zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso is consistently expressed throughout cancer zzso We have previously shown that zzso therapy can inhibit zzso expression in colon cancer zzso In this study, we aim to identify the zzso effects and correlation of zzso and zzso in the context of colon zzso zzso and zzso levels were assessed by zzso in normal zzso and zzso zzso from 423 patients with stage zzso colon zzso The Cox zzso hazards zzso model was applied to analyze the lifetime data, including overall survival zzso and zzso survival zzso The zzso survival rate was significantly higher in patients with high expression of nuclear zzso than in patients with low expression zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso High expression of zzso was related to decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso and zzso survival zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso compared to patients with low expression of zzso In the subset of patients with high expression levels of zzso nuclear zzso high expression of zzso was related to zzso and zzso among colon cancer patients with high expression of zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that low expression of zzso was a risk factor in colon cancer, and high expression of zzso was an independent zzso factor of zzso patients with colon zzso
