While transport of zzso protein zzso from nucleus to zzso is emerging as a key regulatory step for zzso function, the mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in responding to zzso zzso zzso regulates the levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso accomplished either through cell treatment or by zzso infection to express zzso zzso was found to increase the level of zzso in the zzso and to enhance the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso transcripts and elevate their expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved by means including infection to express zzso active zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso decreased levels and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso and diminished zzso association with the corresponding zzso We therefore propose a novel function for zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso levels, which in turn influences the zzso function of zzso and the expression of zzso target zzso
