zzso zzso zzso is often difficult to treat and results in morbidity associated with chronic airway zzso This study assessed the requirement for B cells and their products in the allergic pulmonary zzso in a zzso model of zzso allergic asthma that mimics allergic zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso to lack peripheral B zzso were zzso with zzso zzso extract and challenged with two inhalation zzso of live zzso to induce airway zzso zzso zzso after zzso challenge, zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso of the airways was similar between zzso mice and their zzso counterparts zzso Surprisingly, even in the absence of the zzso these zzso mice produced zzso and zzso zzso although the zzso induced did not have specificity for zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not detected in either the zzso fluid or serum of zzso mice that had been exposed to zzso zzso Our findings also reveal the existence of zzso zzso cells in the lungs of the zzso zzso These data show the zzso mice to have a zzso zzso independent of the zzso zzso route that allows for their survival upon zzso challenge with zzso zzso zzso although this zzso does not seem to allow for the normal development of zzso zzso Additionally, this study shows that zzso is not required for either clearance or zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as zzso outgrowth was not observed in the zzso animals after multiple inhalation zzso to live zzso
