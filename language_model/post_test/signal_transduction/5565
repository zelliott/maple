zzso components such as zzso zzso bind to zzso receptors zzso and activate innate and inflammatory zzso zzso to zzso and other microbial components are limited by the zzso of negative feedback mechanisms that reduce responsiveness to subsequent zzso exposure, often termed zzso zzso Our laboratory has previously shown that zzso a zzso known for its zzso of T cells via zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso in zzso consequently, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mimic zzso zzso in zzso the zzso pathway, zzso and associated innate and inflammatory zzso This study investigated the zzso consequences of zzso zzso for zzso inflammatory responses in zzso and in zzso using two models: zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and zzso with zzso in zzso was shown to induce a state of reduced responsiveness to zzso zzso a form of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso from zzso mice or from mice in which the zzso B1 zzso zzso was zzso knocked out in zzso cells were found to have diminished zzso inflammatory zzso In addition, mice with zzso zzso cells and mice undergoing zzso treatment showed improved survival and recovery when challenged with high doses of systemic zzso compared to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso in zzso and other zzso cells by zzso or deletion can induce a form of zzso tolerance and protect the host from zzso toxicity in zzso
