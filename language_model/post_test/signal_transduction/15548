Recent experiments in zzso zzso have demonstrated the existence of compartments with elevated levels of second zzso molecules such as zzso zzso This zzso is believed to be necessary to ensure downstream signaling zzso Here we use zzso and zzso techniques to investigate the diffusion of a second zzso in the zzso and in the zzso of a zzso We obtain zzso solutions for the diffusion field and examine the limit in which the zzso of the zzso is much smaller than the radius of the zzso We find that the concentration profile depends both on the degradation rate and the zzso of the zzso and that zzso can be indeed be achieved for small zzso to zzso radius zzso
