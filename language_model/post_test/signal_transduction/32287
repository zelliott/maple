Across zzso there is a major drive to develop stem cell zzso treatments for debilitating zzso Most effective treatments restore an embryonic zzso to adult zzso This has led to two emerging zzso in SC zzso the application of zzso biology studies and the manipulation of the SC zzso zzso studies can reveal how zzso are orchestrated to build zzso the understanding of which is important in order to zzso tissue repair in the zzso SC niche studies can reveal cues that maintain SC zzso and how zzso may be released from the constraints of the niche to differentiate and repopulate a zzso zzso The zzso system provides an zzso zzso zzso of the blood lineages during development and the bone zzso niche has resulted in zzso now routinely used in the zzso zzso heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and the question remains as to whether these principles can be applied to the heart, in order to exploit the potential of adult zzso for use in cardiovascular repair and zzso
