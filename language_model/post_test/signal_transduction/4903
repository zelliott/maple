Cell polarization via zzso distribution of structures or molecules is essential for diverse cellular functions and development of organisms, but how polarity is zzso controlled has been poorly zzso In plants, the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso proteins involved in the cellular zzso of the quintessential zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso zzso and differential zzso Recently we showed that zzso promotes cell zzso by zzso the zzso family zzso zzso in leaf zzso pavement zzso Here we found that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso regulates the zzso distribution of zzso by zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of cortical zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso protein zzso Our findings suggest a link between the zzso zzso signal and polar zzso distribution via zzso zzso reorganization and reveal the conservation of a design principle for cell polarization that is based on zzso zzso zzso of zzso
