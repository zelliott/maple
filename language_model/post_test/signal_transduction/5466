We have previously demonstrated a function for zzso and zzso in zzso giant fiber circuit zzso Both molecules are required for guiding the giant fibers out of the brain and have distinct functions during giant zzso zzso In this study we characterized the effects of various combinations of zzso and zzso gain and loss of function backgrounds on giant fiber zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso genetically interact with each other during zzso guidance as well as during zzso zzso Our experiments revealed that during zzso of the giant fibers out of the brain, zzso function seems to be dependent on zzso In contrast, during giant fiber zzso formation we observed that zzso signaling as a zzso can be altered by zzso in the same zzso In zzso our findings suggest that zzso and zzso can regulate each other's function in zzso and that the zzso signaling output is possibly different during guidance and zzso zzso
