In view of the prominent role of protein zzso C zzso in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso growth and zzso the present studies were conducted to assess the impact of zzso zzso on zzso growth zzso zzso activity was elevated in the zzso and particulate compartments of zzso zzso relative to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to a zzso element zzso was also enhanced in zzso zzso Fetal bovine serum zzso did not increase zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso but increased zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was dramatically decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso for 24 h to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a marked zzso advantage over controls under both restrictive and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso did not influence the zzso response to serum in zzso zzso but zzso zzso incorporation into DNA in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated increased expression of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a dramatic increase in the zzso form of zzso relative to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso a requirement for a zzso zzso zzso during zzso stimulation of zzso
