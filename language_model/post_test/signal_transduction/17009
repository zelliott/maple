The zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso is a crucial zzso of cardiac physiology and zzso Increased expression and zzso of zzso has been linked to elevated risk for zzso events and is a hallmark of human heart zzso A useful approach to determining zzso role zzso is large-scale analysis of zzso events by mass zzso However, current large-scale zzso approaches have proved inadequate for zzso identification of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso approach to specifically identify zzso downstream effects in cardiac zzso 

To identify putative downstream zzso targets in cardiac zzso animals with zzso expression of the specific zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso or an inactive control zzso were compared using quantitative zzso The hearts were isolated after zzso injection to induce zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso Enriched zzso from zzso and zzso mice were zzso zzso using stable isotope zzso zzso strong zzso exchange zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso levels of several hundred sites could be zzso including 39 zzso noticeably affected by zzso zzso zzso 

Our data set included known zzso zzso as well as several new candidate proteins involved in functions not previously implicated in zzso zzso
