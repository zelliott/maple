How and when the zzso zzso is first subdivided into discrete zzso cell populations that will give rise to the different major zzso including zzso and liver, are only poorly zzso We have used zzso zzso as a model system to characterize these events, since it is particularly suited to study the early embryonic patterning in zzso Our experimental results support the notion that zzso acid zzso functions as an essential zzso patterning signal in zzso and that it acts as early as during zzso As a result of zzso treatment, the expression of Sonic zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso development in other zzso systems, is zzso regulated in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is found to promote zzso at the expense of zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso of zzso signaling activities in this zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso marker gene expression in the zzso zzso
