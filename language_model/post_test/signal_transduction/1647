zzso zzso zzso are present in zzso and zzso zzso that are involved in the regulation of body temperature zzso The role of zzso acting on these zzso receptors in zzso was investigated by studying the effects of the stable zzso analogue zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso on zzso when injected zzso zzso via a zzso zzso in conscious rats at various ambient temperatures and during zzso zzso zzso zzso Depending on ambient temperature, zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a fall in zzso zzso degrees C, zzso no changes in zzso when compared to zzso levels, or an increase in zzso ( approximately zzso degrees C, zzso in rats maintained at 10 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C ambient temperature, zzso zzso zzso (7 zzso zzso induced a lasting (up to 6 zzso increase in zzso (on average zzso degrees C, zzso in rats kept at 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C, but failed to induce any rise in zzso in rats at 10 degrees C ambient zzso An increase in zzso was also observed in rats zzso degrees C ambient zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected zzso or directly into the anterior zzso caused a profound fall in zzso (by zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C, zzso zzso during zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso fever in rats at 25 degrees C ambient zzso zzso was initiated more rapidly in rats treated with zzso (7 zzso or zzso zzso zzso however its late phase was zzso zzso (7 zzso and zzso zzso zzso injected at the time when fever was already developed zzso h after zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso may play a significant role in central mechanisms of zzso regulation at various ambient temperatures and during zzso
