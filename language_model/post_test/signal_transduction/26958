It is generally believed that zzso bind to zzso proteins and activate zzso channels located in zzso zzso In the present paper, we discuss whether or not this mechanism holds for in zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso did not affect the responses to zzso changes in concentration of zzso or zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso system to various general zzso was essentially similar to that of the zzso system, although the zzso cells have no zzso zzso of zzso from the surface of the zzso organ, similar to the zzso system, did not affect responses to zzso zzso zzso having certain zzso compositions responded to zzso with a sensitivity comparable to that in the zzso zzso The zzso containing zzso zzso exhibited strong responses, especially to fatty zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso greatly enhanced the responses to fatty zzso The results suggest that the zzso channels located at zzso zzso may not contribute to in zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that lipids in zzso zzso zzso are important in odor zzso
