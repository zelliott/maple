Important biological mechanisms, such as signal zzso and gene zzso are zzso by numerous interacting zzso zzso whose expression and zzso are tightly regulated in space and time in response to zzso In order to describe the network of functional zzso that govern such mechanisms, we use simple zzso to interpret multiple variable zzso identify the prominent participants, evaluate their interactions and obtain a zzso zzso of cell zzso Dynamic zzso of responses yield zzso information about zzso relations in the underlying zzso As a proof of principles we apply this approach to zzso zzso in protein gels, probing hormone and insulin zzso
