zzso hypertension zzso increased zzso zzso zzso has been shown to cause zzso damage progressing to zzso in animal zzso Increased zzso zzso pressure results in an increase in wall tension that acts primarily as zzso zzso stress on the zzso zzso The elastic properties of the zzso basement membrane zzso and the elastic as well as zzso properties of the zzso of the zzso and of zzso foot processes resist zzso zzso zzso Whether the zzso forces generated by zzso are able to equal zzso zzso stress to effectively counteract wall tension is an open zzso Mechanical stress is transmitted from the zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso foot processes via zzso contacts that contain mainly zzso zzso and a variety of zzso zzso and signaling zzso which are not well characterized in zzso We know from in zzso studies that zzso are sensitive to stretch, however, the crucial zzso in zzso remains zzso On the other hand, in zzso studies have shown that in stretched zzso specific signaling zzso are zzso the synthesis and zzso of various hormones and their receptors are increased, zzso arrest is zzso cell zzso is altered through zzso of zzso proteins and changes in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is reorganized in a way that stress fibers are zzso In zzso current evidence suggests that in zzso hypertension zzso primarily aim to maintain the delicate architecture of zzso foot processes in the face of an expanding zzso zzso
