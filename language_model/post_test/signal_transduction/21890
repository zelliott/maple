zzso of zzso zzso is correlated with the zzso of zzso types of human zzso whereas the zzso of other zzso zzso families zzso zzso and zzso is correlated to the formation of zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon has been zzso Earlier, we demonstrated that zzso acid zzso an inhibitor of a zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth zzso zzso zzso in the wild type Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and the cells expressing zzso zzso but suppressed zzso zzso in zzso cells that express zzso zzso zzso had been understood as a negative regulator of the growth zzso signal zzso zzso however, this observation suggested that expression of zzso zzso reversed the regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso suppressed zzso of zzso at zzso therefore it zzso zzso zzso in the zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contributed to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso expressing zzso cells, nevertheless it had been reported that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso By testing zzso for human cancer cell lines that express different types of zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso expression was accompanied with positive regulation of zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines, but not in zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulates the zzso activity in a zzso manner, and it is speculated that distinct regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may cause a difference in progression of cancer zzso
