zzso also known as growth and differentiation zzso is a pivotal negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass and reduces muscle protein synthesis by zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism by which myostatin zzso the zzso zzso remains zzso In this study, we investigated the global zzso expression profile in myostatin knockout mice and identified zzso a positive regulator of the zzso pathway, as a novel target of myostatin zzso In myostatin knockout mice, the expression level of zzso in skeletal muscle was significantly zzso In addition, we observed increased expression of the primary transcript of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the host gene of zzso in myostatin knockout zzso In zzso cells, myostatin zzso regulated the expression of zzso Moreover, zzso myostatin signaling zzso the skeletal zzso promoter activity of zzso This repression was partially zzso by the zzso elements in the zzso region of the zzso We also show that zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso was essential to maintain skeletal muscle size both in zzso and in zzso In addition, zzso of zzso led to a decrease in zzso activity in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is one of the zzso molecules connecting myostatin signaling and the zzso zzso in the regulation of skeletal muscle zzso
