zzso zzso is one of the most abundant zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Despite the zzso significance of zzso expression in long-term memory and psychiatric disorders, little is known about the factors that regulate the expression of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso and zzso zzso increase zzso gene zzso via protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso associated with the zzso zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was essential for zzso zzso the synergistic stimulation was not correlated to the level of zzso zzso indicating that recruitment and/or zzso of additional downstream factors were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso binding of zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso which mediates the zzso binding of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso was zzso activated by zzso and zzso Taken together the results imply that zzso zzso gene zzso is regulated by the cumulative action of calcium and zzso via stimulation of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways and that zzso is accomplished by the coordinate zzso of zzso and zzso
