zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the zzso and the zzso of this highly lethal disease has not been well zzso To identify genetic zzso factors for pancreatic cancer, we conducted zzso analysis of zzso association study zzso data in zzso pancreatic cancer patients and zzso controls with European zzso 

Using the gene set zzso zzso in association studies zzso method, we analyzed 197 pathways identified from the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso We used the zzso kernel machine zzso test to identify major contributing genes to each zzso We conducted functional enrichment analysis of the most significant genes zzso using the Database for zzso zzso and Integrated Discovery zzso 

Two pathways were significantly associated with risk of pancreatic cancer after adjusting for multiple comparisons zzso and in replication zzso zzso zzso interaction, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test identified four genes that were significantly associated with risk of pancreatic cancer after zzso correction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enrichment analysis using DAVID consistently found the G zzso zzso signaling zzso (including both zzso zzso interaction and zzso zzso zzso to be the most significant zzso for pancreatic cancer risk in this study zzso 

These novel findings provide new perspectives on genetic zzso to and molecular mechanisms of pancreatic zzso
