zzso patterning of the zzso zzso is essential for accurate zzso mapping of retinal zzso cell zzso zzso to visual processing zzso Bone zzso protein zzso growth factors regulate zzso retinal identity in zzso models, but the zzso timing of this signaling and the relative roles of individual zzso remain zzso In this study, we investigate the functions of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso during initiation of zzso retinal identity, and subsequently during lens zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocks initiation of retinal zzso zzso and zzso marker zzso while zzso of zzso produces no zzso retinal zzso These data, combined with analyses of zzso zzso expressing zzso demonstrate that zzso is necessary and sufficient for initiation of zzso retinal zzso We note a profound expansion of zzso retinal identity in zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso marker zzso Finally, we demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to defects in zzso gene zzso and when combined with zzso signaling zzso zzso lens fiber cell zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso zzso zzso retinal patterning independent of zzso and regulates lens zzso
