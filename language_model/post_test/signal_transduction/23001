zzso has multiple effects on B zzso many of which are concentration zzso This is particularly so for zzso zzso zzso where different thresholds of zzso stimulation are needed to induce switching from zzso to either zzso or zzso In this report we describe a critical role for the zzso zzso Lyn in setting zzso signaling thresholds in mouse B zzso Upon zzso zzso stimulation of zzso B cells, zzso less zzso was required to induce switching from zzso to zzso and zzso and an increased proportion of B cells zzso switched at each zzso zzso These in zzso results correlate with the in zzso findings that in zzso mice, zzso zzso cells develop prematurely in zzso and that adult zzso mice have an zzso high proportion of zzso B cells in their zzso Adult zzso mice also have significantly higher levels of zzso in their zzso These results identify Lyn as a zzso involved in modulating the zzso signal in B cells and provide insights into its regulation and how a B cell signaling imbalance may contribute to zzso
