zzso deposition is integral to the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso an experimental model of zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso a novel zzso zzso generates zzso by an alternate zzso and has been reported to be involved in the zzso of a number of zzso zzso We hypothesized that expression of zzso in inflamed zzso contributes to the zzso deposition and subsequent inflammation in zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with 100 zzso bovine collagen type II zzso zzso in complete zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in association with zzso deposition was examined in mice with zzso and zzso mice following induction of zzso To directly assess the contribution of zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso transcripts and zzso protein were markedly zzso in zzso of mice that developed zzso zzso deposition was prominent within the zzso lining and zzso joint space associated with expression of zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso was associated with decreased expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein and absence of zzso zzso Following injection of zzso all zzso mice developed severe arthritis with clinical and zzso manifestations characteristic of zzso whereas zzso mice failed to develop any clinical manifestation or zzso evidence of zzso 

This study demonstrates that the zzso activity of zzso contributes to the zzso of experimental zzso These studies may have therapeutic implications for patients with zzso
