zzso receptors act as zzso zzso zzso factors with a prominent role in zzso cell fate decisions during development, which is zzso across zzso In addition there is increasing evidence for other functions of zzso particularly in connection with zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso the activity of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in a manner that is independent of its zzso zzso Here we explore the mechanism of this interaction in the zzso of the zzso zzso discs and find that it is zzso by the zzso zzso and traffic of the zzso zzso Our results show that zzso associates with zzso near the zzso junctions and that it is rapidly zzso promoting the traffic of an activated form of zzso into zzso zzso where it may be zzso As zzso has the ability to interact with and zzso activated forms of zzso it is possible that in zzso zzso regulates the zzso competent pool of zzso These interactions reveal a previously unknown activity of zzso which serves to buffer the function of activated zzso and might zzso some of its zzso zzso
