The zzso zzso are a family of related zzso surface molecules that zzso a diverse array of cell processes via their paired triggering and zzso zzso zzso All family members have a single zzso like domain and they share a common evolutionary zzso At least one member of the family has undergone significant positive selection zzso second in the top 50) indicating a need to maintain some crucial zzso Here we have reviewed the zzso family members, and their expression on cells of the zzso and zzso cell zzso The consequences of zzso zzso expression by these zzso lineages are only now beginning to be zzso The ability to fine tune zzso and zzso cell function and immune responses highlights several potential options to exploit these molecules as therapeutic targets in chronic inflammatory diseases, zzso and other disease zzso
