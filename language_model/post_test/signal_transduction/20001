We investigated the mechanisms involved in the zzso zzso action on the zzso responses zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Diabetes was induced in rats by zzso zzso Eight weeks later, the animals were zzso and zzso The action and mechanisms of zzso were zzso based on the zzso responses induced by zzso In zzso animals, zzso (20 zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso which is reproduced by two selective zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso (5 zzso A zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso an inhibitor of NO production, prior to the infusion of zzso (5 zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso The zzso effect of infusion of zzso zzso (5 zzso was abolished in the presence of zzso (2 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso two selective zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso responses induced by electrical stimulation is zzso both by the NO and zzso pathways in zzso zzso
