zzso cancer is the eighth most common zzso and one of the leading causes of zzso deaths zzso The overall zzso survival rate of patients with zzso cancer remains low at zzso to zzso due to late diagnosis, zzso and resistance of the tumor to zzso and zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival, and zzso but little is known about the role of this signaling zzso in the zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the most common form of zzso zzso This study aims to explore the functions of zzso in human zzso progression and to determine whether targeting the zzso signaling zzso might be of therapeutic value against zzso Our results from human zzso cell lines and zzso tissue indicated that zzso is zzso active in zzso Exposure of zzso cells to two zzso zzso zzso and zzso not only reduced cancer cell zzso but also induced zzso and enhanced sensitivity to zzso drugs, zzso and zzso In addition, zzso and zzso suppressed the migration and invasive potential of zzso zzso More importantly, the results from tumor zzso and experimental zzso models showed that zzso had significant zzso effects on zzso zzso in nude mice by promoting zzso and zzso proliferation and zzso as well as reduced the zzso of zzso cells to the lungs without significant toxic zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso may be potentially useful as therapeutic agents for patients with zzso zzso
