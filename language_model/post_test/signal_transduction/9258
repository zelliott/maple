A number of zzso proteins possess zzso activity and catalyze important reactions involving zzso lipids or other zzso located within or near zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins that zzso the zzso bond in zzso to form zzso Recently, a group of putative zzso receptors called zzso and zzso receptors zzso were found to be zzso related to alkaline zzso raising the possibility that they may also function as membrane zzso 

Using sensitive similarity search methods, we identified statistically significant sequence similarities among several zzso protein families including alkaline zzso and zzso They were unified into a large and diverse zzso of putative zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso embraces a plethora of cellular functions and zzso activities, including putative zzso zzso such as zzso and the zzso family of putative zzso involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso putative hormone zzso bacterial zzso the zzso family of putative tumor zzso and the zzso family of putative zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso similarity searches and zzso analysis also revealed several groups of proteins with unknown function in the zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso share seven predicted core zzso segments with several zzso sequence zzso 

Universal conservation of a set of zzso and zzso zzso across all groups in the zzso zzso coupled with independent discoveries of zzso activities in alkaline zzso and the zzso family as well as results from previous zzso studies of zzso suggests that the majority of zzso members are zzso zzso
