A zzso zzso zzso is reported to zzso beneficial zzso including zzso cell derived zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso delivery of zzso would enhance zzso expression in the acute zzso zzso zzso heart and induce bone zzso cells zzso to home to the zzso leading to improved cardiac function in zzso 

zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso migration was greater to zzso than zzso zzso zzso This increase was diminished by treating the zzso with a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso sheets containing a zzso form of zzso zzso or zzso vehicle zzso were implanted on the left zzso zzso anterior wall immediately after permanent zzso descending artery zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso The zzso expression in the zzso border zone was significantly elevated for 1 month in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso hearts, detected by in zzso imaging after intravenous injection of labeled zzso was enhanced in the zzso zzso This increase was inhibited by zzso The accumulated zzso differentiated into zzso zzso The survival rates and cardiac function were significantly improved in the zzso group zzso area change zzso zzso compared to the vehicle group zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior wall zzso expansion of zzso and zzso were lower in the zzso zzso 

zzso delivery of zzso promoted zzso recruitment to the acute zzso heart via zzso signaling and restored cardiac performance, suggesting a novel mechanism for zzso zzso heart zzso
