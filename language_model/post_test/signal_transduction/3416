zzso zzso cells zzso may be the initiating cells in zzso zzso and contribute to the resistance of these tumors to conventional zzso Development of novel zzso agents and treatment approaches against zzso especially those specifically targeting zzso are thus zzso In the present study, we found that a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased the proliferation of established zzso cell lines in zzso and inhibit the growth of zzso in zzso To test the efficacy of zzso against zzso we then zzso zzso to zzso isolated and expanded from multiple human zzso zzso We revealed that zzso suppressed zzso of zzso and zzso with high potency and demonstrated a zzso zzso of proliferation and zzso formation of zzso These effects were at least due in part to zzso arrest associated with zzso of zzso D1 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exposure decreased expression of stem cell markers including zzso and zzso and induced cell death in zzso through zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso is a potent small zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso that shows promise as a therapeutic agent against zzso by targeting zzso
