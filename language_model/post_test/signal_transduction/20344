The aim of this work was to study the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and whether insulin or zzso growth factor zzso might zzso the effects of zzso zzso produced a zzso decrease in zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso However, insulin induced an increase in the levels of zzso that was zzso decreased by the addition of zzso By contrast, zzso induced a decrease in zzso production, which was further reduced by the addition of zzso To assess whether variations in zzso production might be related with changes in some component of soluble zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso At 1 zzso zzso produced a decrease in the expression of both zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso but at 24 h only zzso zzso As expected, insulin induced an increase in the expression of both zzso after 1 h of zzso this was decreased by the addition of zzso Likewise, incubation with zzso for 24 h produced a decrease in the expression of both zzso that was zzso when zzso was zzso In addition, incubation with insulin for 1 h produced an increase in the expression of the zzso zzso which was reduced by the addition of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso production by decreasing the cellular content of at least one zzso of the zzso active form of the zzso independently of the presence of insulin or zzso This may open new insights into the actions of this zzso
