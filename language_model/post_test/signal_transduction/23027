Cell zzso and impulse propagation were investigated in the zzso of zzso zzso at an advanced stage of heart zzso An appreciable decline in zzso zzso was found, a phenomenon in part related to zzso of the plasma and cardiac zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso or an zzso of zzso proteins also might be implicated in the decreased cell zzso zzso abnormalities such as fibrosis, zzso and zzso of cell contacts contribute to the decline of zzso zzso or to the blockade of impulse propagation in some areas of the zzso creating the conditions for zzso zzso and cardiac zzso The decrease in membrane potential found in zzso cells is related in part to depression of zzso activity, and the lack of action of zzso zzso on zzso zzso is explained by zzso of beta receptors and an zzso of zzso zzso
