zzso is a zzso protein of the transforming growth factor beta zzso family that activates zzso and zzso zzso factors through complexes of type I and type II zzso receptors and zzso zzso of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso During early zzso it stimulates the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and zzso in a zzso manner, their subsequent allocation to distinct germ zzso Available evidence indicates that the signaling strength of zzso is controlled at the level of zzso zzso and turnover of activated zzso complexes in early zzso but insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms are still zzso In this review, I briefly survey literature on the trafficking of the related zzso zzso and I discuss recent findings indicating that zzso of zzso is coupled to zzso processing of its precursor at the cell surface and that the maturation and zzso of zzso need to be guided by zzso to stabilize zzso signaling zzso
