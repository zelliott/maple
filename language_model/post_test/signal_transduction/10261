A key zzso zzso factor, nuclear factor zzso zzso is known to be critically important for tumor cell growth, zzso and development of zzso zzso We and others showed previously that zzso zzso factor was zzso activated in zzso prostate zzso zzso cell lines due to the zzso activity of inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso In this work, using zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and Northern zzso analysis of expression of zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that a novel highly specific zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited both zzso and induced zzso activity in PC zzso We found that zzso induced zzso zzso zzso in PC cells and significantly zzso PC cells to zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso We also showed that zzso inhibited PC cell zzso zzso of zzso on proliferation and zzso correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression and decreased zzso protein zzso In addition, we found that incubation with zzso inhibited the invasion activity of highly invasive zzso cells in invasion chamber zzso in a zzso zzso Overall, this study provides the framework for development of a novel therapeutic approach targeting zzso zzso factor to treat advanced zzso
