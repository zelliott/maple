zzso of zzso D3 is believed to be essential for its biological zzso In this study, we evaluated the biological activity of zzso itself comparing with the effect of zzso zzso D3 zzso First, we measured the zzso zzso level in immortalized human prostate cell zzso using zzso The effects of the zzso zzso on vitamin D3 zzso zzso zzso level and the cell growth zzso were significantly lower than the effects of zzso itself added to cell zzso zzso D3 zzso zzso gene zzso had no significant effects on the zzso effects, whereas vitamin D zzso zzso gene zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso can directly bind to zzso and exerts its biological zzso DNA zzso and real-time zzso analyses suggest that zzso 3B, zzso zzso and zzso D may be involved in the zzso effect of zzso
