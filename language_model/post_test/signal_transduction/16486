From its original description as solely an zzso molecular zzso heat shock proteins have now been shown to function as initiators of the zzso immune zzso Although the exact mechanism by which zzso heat shock proteins leave cells is still incompletely zzso recent work from several labs suggest that heat shock proteins are released by both passive zzso and active zzso zzso zzso to specific surface receptors is a prerequisite for the initiation of an immune zzso To date, several cell surface proteins have been described as the zzso for zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso including zzso receptors 2 and 4 with their zzso zzso the scavenger zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and another member of the scavenger zzso zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to these surface receptors specifically activates zzso signaling zzso which in turn exert zzso zzso zzso a process known as the zzso activity of zzso This review will highlight recent advances in understanding the mechanism by which zzso zzso the zzso immune zzso
