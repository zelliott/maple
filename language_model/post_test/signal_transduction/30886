zzso zzso are common in a variety of zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso bacteria are believed to contribute substantially to the zzso portion of the global sulfur zzso In order to better understand the ecology and roles of zzso zzso in particular those of the widespread zzso zzso in zzso cycles, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso has many features, including a larger size zzso zzso that suggest a greater degree of zzso versatility or responsiveness to the environment than seen for most of the other zzso zzso A zzso electron transport chain is apparent, with genes zzso complexes for the zzso of hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds, and zzso and the reduction of nitrate and zzso Genes are present for a complete, zzso reductive zzso acid zzso Many genes are present that could facilitate growth in the zzso and temporally zzso zzso habitat from where zzso zzso was originally zzso Many zzso family zzso genes (10 total) are zzso of these, several are predicted to zzso heavy metal zzso zzso An elaborate arsenal of sensory and regulatory zzso genes is in place, as are genes necessary to prevent and respond to zzso zzso
