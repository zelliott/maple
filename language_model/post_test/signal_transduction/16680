The zzso factor, zzso is a key regulator of growth and differentiation in the zzso zzso There are three different protein zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and differ by only 23 zzso zzso acids present in zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression causes zzso normal human zzso zzso cells to become transformed, undergo an zzso to zzso transition zzso and acquire an invasive zzso zzso is a downstream zzso target of Ras signaling pathways and is required for Ras transformation of some cell zzso Ras signaling pathways are activated in zzso zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we considered whether elevated zzso expression would resemble zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We show that elevated zzso expression zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso cells expressing zzso are not zzso and high zzso or zzso expression is incompatible with zzso zzso zzso zzso the normal zzso architecture of zzso cells in basement membrane cultures and zzso complex zzso structures with filled zzso similar to the consequences of zzso zzso zzso 

Given the ability of zzso to zzso zzso growth to zzso zzso cells as well as its capability for zzso normal zzso architecture and causing zzso it is worth considering whether zzso which target zzso family signaling pathways could be less effective in zzso zzso cells with elevated nuclear zzso zzso
