The present study investigated the relationship between the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and nucleus of zzso zzso cells and the zzso of zzso zzso was performed to detect the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and the level of these proteins in the nucleus and zzso was zzso There was zzso expression of zzso in zzso 27 AB patients were positive for zzso expression in the nucleus and 47 for zzso expression in the zzso The zzso expression of zzso was also zzso 23 patients zzso were positive for zzso expression in the nucleus and 55 zzso for zzso expression in the zzso The zzso expression of zzso was also zzso Of these patients, 33 were positive for zzso expression in the nucleus zzso and 45 for zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the expression of three proteins in the nucleus of patients with zzso cancer was markedly higher than that in those with primary zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the nucleus was related to the zzso of zzso zzso analysis with Cox zzso hazards model showed the zzso expression had influence on AB recurrence zzso zzso zzso zzso The possibility of AB recurrence in patients with nuclear zzso expression was zzso folds higher than that in those with zzso zzso zzso The nuclear expression of zzso zzso and zzso was associated with biological behaviors zzso of zzso and zzso was an independent predictor of zzso
