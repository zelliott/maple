The respiratory zzso lining the airway relies on zzso clearance and a complex network of inflammatory zzso to protect the zzso zzso in the composition and volume of the zzso liquid layer, as occur in zzso zzso zzso lead to impaired zzso clearance and persistent airway zzso Moreover, the respiratory zzso releases zzso after infection, inciting airway zzso However, characterizing the inflammatory response of primary human airway zzso cells to infection can be challenging because of genetic zzso Using zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cells grown at an zzso zzso which provides an in zzso polarized zzso model, we compared inflammatory gene expression and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso airway cells after infection with zzso zzso The expression of several zzso including zzso inflammatory zzso small zzso zzso zzso member 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was markedly increased after infection, and these zzso zzso were zzso released from the airway zzso predominantly from the zzso zzso Equal amounts of zzso were released from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were concentrated in the thin, zzso fluid layer, and the dehydrated zzso zzso of zzso airway zzso cells amplified the inflammatory zzso potentially resulting in high zzso concentration zzso across the zzso zzso with this zzso the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso was detected in zzso airway zzso cultures, compared with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso infection of the airway zzso zzso the expression and polarized zzso of zzso and the increased concentration zzso across the zzso airway leads to an exaggerated inflammatory zzso
