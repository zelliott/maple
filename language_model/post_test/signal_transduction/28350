The zzso system, zzso and liver all develop from the nearby zzso at almost the same time in zzso The molecular mechanisms that determine the identity of each organ in this complex area are zzso zzso encodes the basic zzso protein zzso zzso 1), which zzso positive basic zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso operates as a general negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso and defects in zzso signaling lead to accelerated pancreatic zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso cause the zzso syndrome in humans, characterized by poor development of the zzso system, suggesting that the zzso zzso is also involved in normal zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso throughout development and that zzso mice have gallbladder zzso and severe zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso expresses the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cells and forms zzso and zzso structures in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso has the potential for pancreatic differentiation and zzso determines zzso zzso by preventing the pancreatic differentiation program, probably by directly zzso zzso of zzso
