zzso zzso adapt to zzso or pathological stimuli by undergoing molecular changes which differentiate according to the specificity of the stimulus and eventually generate a zzso with peculiar molecular zzso Here, we review the literature on the molecular mechanisms activated in the zzso during zzso adaptation to stress, as opposed to zzso The critical role of the IGF-1 zzso signaling zzso during this process is zzso including zzso targets regulating zzso and cell zzso
