Aging is associated with increased free radical generation in the skeletal muscle that can cause zzso modification of zzso zzso and zzso Physical activity has many well-established health benefits, but zzso exercise increases muscle oxygen flux and elicits zzso events that can lead to increased zzso zzso The paradox arises as to whether exercise would be zzso to aged zzso Research evidence indicates that zzso organisms are more susceptible to zzso stress during exercise because of the age-related zzso and zzso changes that facilitate formation of zzso oxygen species zzso Aging also increases the zzso of muscle injury, and the inflammatory response can subject zzso muscle to further zzso zzso Furthermore, muscle repair and zzso capacity is reduced at old age that could potentially enhance the zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso of certain age-related zzso conditions may exacerbate the zzso In spite of these risks, the elderly who are physically active benefit from zzso adaptation in cellular zzso defense zzso zzso muscle mechanics, strength, and endurance make them less vulnerable to acute injury and chronic zzso Many critical questions remain regarding the relationship of aging and exercise as we enter a new zzso For example, how does aging alter zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms that generate zzso Can acute and chronic exercise zzso the declined gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso seen at old age? Does exercise prevent zzso muscle loss zzso What kinds of zzso zzso if any, do aged people who are physically active need? Answers to these questions require highly specific research in both animals and zzso
