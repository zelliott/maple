Both zzso zzso and Sonic zzso zzso contribute to zzso and nerve zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso improves the recovery of injured nerves by zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso protein zzso and increasing zzso zzso Mice were treated with local injections of zzso or zzso one week before zzso zzso 28 days after injury, nerve zzso zzso exercise zzso and zzso were significantly greater in zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso treatment was also associated with higher zzso levels of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso target zzso but with lower levels of zzso The zzso enhancement of nerve zzso was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the effect of zzso treatment on zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso activity in human zzso zzso cells zzso increased more after treatment with zzso and zzso than after treatment with zzso alone, and zzso treatment reduced zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells without altering zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso improves nerve recovery, at least in part, by reducing zzso zzso which subsequently leads to an increase in zzso signaling and zzso zzso
