To study the expression and function of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso in human zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and surrounding normal skin were collected from 12 patients with zzso during zzso zzso zzso were isolated, zzso and randomly divided into 3 groups: normal skin group, zzso group, and zzso with transforming growth factor zzso group cultured with zzso for 48 zzso zzso technique was used to detect the location of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to measure the zzso and protein expression levels of zzso and zzso 

zzso protein was localized primarily in the zzso of the zzso and zzso protein was detected both in the zzso and zzso in the 3 zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso in the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly higher than those of the normal skin group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso but significantly lower than those of the zzso zzso with zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant differences in the zzso zzso and protein levels among these 3 groups (all P zzso zzso 

zzso plays a leading role in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein levels are increased by zzso stimulation in zzso zzso perhaps indicating that zzso is involved in zzso signal zzso zzso
