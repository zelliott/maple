Plant cells use zzso zzso pathways to zzso zzso and/or zzso stimuli into zzso zzso However, little is known about the zzso between calcium zzso zzso regulation and the downstream zzso zzso To understand these relationships better, we challenged tobacco zzso cells with zzso and evaluated how calcium zzso zzso through the calcium sensor zzso impact zzso transcript levels of zzso genes zzso by zzso and zzso zzso compounds zzso by mass zzso Most genes of the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and cell zzso zzso compounds accumulated zzso zzso zzso The zzso of both transcripts and zzso was zzso The zzso regulation of zzso genes was correlated in a zzso manner with stimulus intensity and with components of the zzso calcium zzso In addition, zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of cells to low zzso of zzso These results led us to propose a model of zzso between the zzso zzso calcium zzso and the zzso response, exerting control of zzso through the coordinated action of two decoding zzso exerting opposite zzso
