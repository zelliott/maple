zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso family with a role in vascular zzso In developing zzso leaves it is expressed first in ground cells and then becomes restricted to zzso and zzso cells as zzso zzso We isolated proteins interacting with the activated zzso zzso domain of zzso and found that most belong to three zzso zzso activity, zzso traffic and zzso signal zzso Two zzso proteins are included that we named zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso in the same cells as zzso at two distinct time points in vein zzso zzso of either zzso or of zzso results in vein pattern defects and in zzso in response to zzso and zzso We propose that these two zzso facilitate the diversification and amplification of a zzso signal perceived by zzso in multiple downstream pathways affecting zzso
