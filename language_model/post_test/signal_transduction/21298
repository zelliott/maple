zzso analyses indicate that zzso and pharmacological zzso suppress zzso of the zzso terminal repeat zzso long zzso nuclear element 1 zzso zzso after zzso in the rat zzso We tested whether zzso zzso is mechanistically involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat hearts were treated with zzso or scrambled zzso zzso against zzso for 60 zzso and exposed to 40 zzso of zzso followed by 60 zzso of zzso zzso recovery and zzso size were zzso zzso nuclear zzso was determined by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis was used to assess changes in expression levels of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso was performed to zzso zzso proteins in cardiac zzso zzso of zzso on zzso protein zzso B zzso expression and activity were also zzso zzso zzso against zzso prevented zzso burst after zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso enhanced zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and markedly improved zzso functional recovery and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso protection was abolished by zzso confirming the involvement of the zzso survival zzso zzso and zzso were found to be expressed in rat zzso zzso showed a predominantly nuclear zzso in zzso whereas zzso was exclusively present in zzso zzso zzso levels increased in response to zzso which was reversed by zzso zzso zzso No significant changes in zzso were zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso suppression favorably affects zzso outcome in the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso may represent a novel zzso therapeutic zzso
