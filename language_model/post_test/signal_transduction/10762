How cells integrate the input of multiple polarizing signals during division is poorly zzso We demonstrate that two distinct zzso zzso zzso pathways contribute to the polarization of the zzso zzso by zzso regulating its duplicated zzso zzso with the C zzso zzso the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso alignment pathway, while a zzso zzso controls the timing of zzso zzso zzso The three zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute to these processes in different ways, suggesting that functional distinctions may exist among zzso We also find that zzso zzso plays a role not only in the zzso pathway, but also in the zzso zzso orientation zzso as zzso Based on these findings, we establish a model for the coordination of zzso interactions and distinct zzso signaling pathways that ensures the robust timing and orientation of zzso rotation during a zzso regulated cell division zzso
