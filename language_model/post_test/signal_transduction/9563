zzso zzso is a potent environmental zzso zzso studies have associated zzso exposure with the development of chronic zzso pulmonary disease, which is zzso by zzso cell zzso The purpose of this research was to zzso the zzso that lead to zzso gene expression in both primary normal human zzso zzso cells and an immortalized cell line, zzso under zzso interface zzso zzso exposure induced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in these zzso Treatment with an zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso but significantly suppressed zzso zzso However, treatments with zzso of signaling pathways and the expression of dominant negative zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso of zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso but not that of zzso These effects also occurred at the zzso zzso level using the zzso construct for a transient zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed the zzso of activated zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso in cells after zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso also occurred in cells after zzso zzso Both zzso expression and the promoter activity were inhibited by zzso A, an inhibitor specific to zzso zzso These results lead to the conclusion that zzso induced zzso expression through a zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso
