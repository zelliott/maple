The elevated insulin zzso that occur in many women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso can contribute significantly to zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to compare the content of zzso insulin zzso molecules in zzso and zzso cells between zzso zzso and regular cycling zzso Individual zzso zzso zzso were obtained from 11 women with zzso and 10 regularly cycling control zzso The zzso and zzso cells were zzso from each zzso Total protein was extracted and zzso proteins were measured by western zzso zzso There was no difference in insulin zzso content between zzso and controls in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased zzso but zzso was decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso There were no changes in zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in all zzso There were no changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso These data demonstrate zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso in zzso cells from zzso zzso that are consistent with an exaggerated amplification of the insulin signal and which may play an important role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
