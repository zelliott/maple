The zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso program of many cells and zzso in a variety of zzso In addition, many zzso and components of their downstream signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso have been implicated in zzso Over the past years, several genes have been identified as zzso responsive, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In order to identify additional genes responsive to zzso signaling that contribute to the transformed zzso we performed a zzso zzso zzso screen between a mouse zzso zzso cell line that zzso zzso zzso and the parental cell line zzso The screen identified a total of 67 genes to be zzso in response to zzso zzso Of these 67 zzso the zzso of 62 was subsequently confirmed by Northern and dot zzso analyses (and, for a zzso zzso zzso of zzso isolated from zzso cells subjected to zzso an independent zzso zzso infection, and zzso zzso with zzso expressing zzso Among the confirmed zzso responsive zzso we further characterized a mouse zzso of the human zzso factor Basic zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Several novel genes were identified in this screen, as well as others that have been shown previously to be regulated by zzso zzso such as zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is a useful method for identifying genes involved in the process of zzso zzso
