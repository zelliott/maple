zzso acid zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso One problem in understanding these mechanisms is to distinguish molecular events leading to differentiation from those leading to zzso We have identified a zzso cell line, zzso where zzso directly zzso zzso with no zzso zzso or zzso marker evidence of zzso These cells differentiate following zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso flow zzso showed no zzso of the cell cycle after zzso treatment, and zzso marker analysis of zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso genes regulated by zzso differentiation in zzso cells, was unchanged by zzso zzso Instead, zzso induced zzso as shown by typical zzso zzso features, zzso DNA zzso and positive labeling in the zzso zzso We found that induction of zzso in this model requires a different pattern of zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso than is seen in zzso zzso As previously zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso showed that stimulation of zzso alone is sufficient to induce differentiation and zzso in zzso cells, and that stimulation of zzso has no effect on the parameters zzso In zzso cells, on the other hand, zzso was induced only upon zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso of either zzso alone had no effect on the zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso and protein levels were zzso after stimulation of both zzso and zzso but not with an zzso zzso alone, as in zzso zzso The expression of several other zzso family members zzso zzso zzso bag, and zzso ) and zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso was not affected by treatment with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso before and after zzso zzso Thus, our cell model provides a useful tool in determining the genetic events zzso zzso as a response to zzso zzso by events implicated in zzso
