zzso zzso zzso zzso the central element in the zzso zzso of zzso is frequently absent or poorly expressed in zzso zzso a tumor type showing a low degree of spontaneous zzso and a poor response to conventional zzso In the present study, we used the zzso zzso melanoma cell line to investigate the fate of zzso during zzso zzso As novel findings described for the first time in melanoma cells, we observed that zzso was markedly decreased during zzso already at early stages of cell zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso with 26 zzso was zzso In spite of the remarkable decrease of zzso in zzso cells, zzso was found to be processed and zzso zzso Both zzso depletion and its zzso zzso were markedly prevented in presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso In presence of zzso zzso activity was also zzso along with a partially different pattern of zzso processing zzso zzso the zzso afforded by zzso on several zzso that is, zzso and zzso activities, and zzso zzso degradation, did not abrogate the zzso zzso and cell zzso nor the zzso degradation of crucial targets, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso and zzso proved to be zzso for the above zzso events, play a role on zzso handling and possibly on zzso zzso
