zzso zzso and zzso zzso are universal zzso zzso adapter proteins that zzso regulate cardiac zzso zzso zzso function via zzso zzso and zzso In addition, they mediate zzso zzso zzso which might be zzso for example, zzso for the zzso However, the specific zzso of each zzso zzso in cardiac zzso dysfunction, the molecular hallmark of chronic heart failure zzso remains zzso Furthermore, adrenal zzso zzso zzso by chronically enhancing adrenal production and hence circulating levels of zzso and zzso zzso we sought to delineate specific roles of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso by testing the effects of zzso genetic deletion on normal and zzso cardiac function and zzso We studied zzso knockout zzso mice alongside zzso controls under normal conditions and after surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso mice display enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice enhanced overall cardiac function (and zzso zzso compared with wild zzso zzso zzso mice also show increased survival and decreased cardiac zzso size, zzso and adverse zzso as well as circulating catecholamines and zzso compared with zzso wild zzso The underlying mechanisms, on one hand, improved cardiac zzso signaling and function, as evidenced by increased zzso density and zzso zzso via reduced cardiac zzso zzso because of cardiac zzso absence, and, on the other hand, decreased production leading to lower circulating levels of catecholamines and zzso because of adrenal zzso zzso Thus, zzso via both cardiac and adrenal effects, is zzso for cardiac structure and function and significantly zzso zzso zzso
