The possible formation of a stable complex between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso was investigated in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism by which zzso protein zzso were zzso regulated in response to the various zzso leading to the zzso of zzso in rat zzso zzso was found to zzso with zzso but not zzso after zzso of rat zzso zzso by zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso was released into soluble zzso fraction from the zzso but not zzso zzso after incubation with zzso These results, taken together, suggest the specific association of zzso with zzso in rat zzso
