Signal zzso in the nervous system depends on zzso and zzso whose zzso is regulated by a large group of scaffolding zzso In particular, protein zzso mediates zzso actions on a variety of zzso including zzso zzso and this, in turn, depends on the binding of protein zzso to its binding protein zzso To better understand zzso role in targeting protein zzso within zzso we used a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso labeling and electron zzso to determine the zzso of this scaffolding protein in zzso prefrontal zzso zzso with previous reports, zzso was found predominantly in zzso zzso but a significant number of labeled zzso shafts and, less zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso By using the zzso zzso method, we further examined the distribution of zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso was present throughout the spine, but the density of label was zzso and defined two zzso The highest density of label was associated with the zzso density and the 100 zzso immediately zzso to zzso The deeper region of the spine, further than 100 zzso from the zzso density, had a lower density of zzso zzso The distribution of zzso reported in this study supports its role in modulating zzso zzso but also suggests the possibility that zzso may target protein zzso to other sites within the spine or to other zzso or zzso zzso
