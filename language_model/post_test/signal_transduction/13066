zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso is one of the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling to various functional targets, including zzso of zzso B, zzso and zzso We investigated how zzso mediates zzso the distinct downstream zzso We now report a novel mechanism of zzso signal zzso revealed by an association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is responsible for the production of zzso zzso We identified a zzso motif of zzso that zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso which in turn is required for zzso zzso of zzso B but not zzso In addition, by using a zzso inactive zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that lacks zzso motif we show that the interaction of zzso with zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso are critical for prevention of zzso during zzso zzso These findings show a role for zzso in the signal zzso by zzso specifically leading to zzso of zzso B and zzso
