G zzso receptors zzso are regulated by multiple families of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso active towards zzso and zzso of zzso are linked to zzso We zzso through zzso the interactions between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso G zzso Because zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso zzso signaling and lacks a zzso domain, we hypothesized that zzso would interact with active zzso but not zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso interacts with inactive zzso and zzso to a greater extent than active zzso zzso also interacts with inactive zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production indicating that the zzso domain is responsible for zzso zzso This evidence suggests that binding to inactive zzso and zzso may explain the zzso activity of zzso towards zzso zzso
