zzso stem cells zzso are thought to contribute to the diffuse zzso of zzso zzso Emerging evidence supports a role for a zzso and zzso 17 zzso in zzso zzso shedding of several zzso zzso which subsequently activate zzso and zzso pathways through zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso However, it is not clear if zzso also plays important roles in promoting zzso zzso In this study, we isolated zzso zzso from the human zzso cell line zzso using zzso cell sorting and demonstrated their increased invasive potential compared with matched zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso zzso expressed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso revealed that high expression levels of zzso at the invasive front were correlated with the presence of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased migration and invasion of zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso In addition, zzso also induced zzso zzso invasion via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso These findings suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso invasive process and may provide a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
