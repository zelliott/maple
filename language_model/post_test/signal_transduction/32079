Although human zzso has been associated frequently with zzso zzso of the tumor zzso gene zzso the underlying mechanisms have not been zzso Here we report that zzso zzso is associated with high levels of zzso and zzso in contrast to normal vessels or benign zzso Studies of zzso deficient mice not only zzso genetic traits observed in human zzso but also unveil a possible therapeutic link comprised of the zzso signaling zzso In zzso cells, zzso controlled zzso signaling by zzso controlling the expression of zzso zzso and zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso of zzso solely in zzso cells was insufficient to block zzso zzso in contrast, systemic zzso of zzso zzso or zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso Our findings offer clinical implications for targeting the zzso zzso as a rational strategy to treat zzso
