zzso is an opportunistic zzso pathogen that causes pneumonia in a variety of clinical zzso An early step in zzso infection involves the attachment of organisms to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso produce zzso in response to zzso zzso but the upstream zzso interactions that activate zzso signaling zzso are not zzso zzso is an zzso zzso required for zzso of zzso signaling zzso following zzso zzso zzso recognition of zzso molecular patterns on zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were incubated with zzso As expected, zzso zzso produced zzso and zzso following zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were severely impaired in their ability to respond to zzso zzso zzso did not display zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and produced much less zzso than zzso zzso zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso primary zzso zzso were found to respond vigorously to zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso response to zzso did not require zzso or zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso was required for an zzso zzso response to zzso The role of zzso in early responses during zzso infection was supported by in zzso studies demonstrating that zzso mice showed impaired zzso zzso production and impaired inflammatory cell zzso These data indicate an important role for zzso in the zzso inflammatory response to zzso
