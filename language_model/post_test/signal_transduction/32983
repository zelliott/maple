Following zzso zzso there are well-documented events that affect the zzso zzso zzso These zzso effects are zzso similar to those occurring at the zzso side, but are usually smaller in magnitude and have a zzso time zzso It is unclear whether the findings are an zzso or serve a biological purpose, but in either case the existence of these effects implies the presence of zzso zzso mechanisms that link the two sides of the zzso Strong circumstantial evidence argues against a peripheral mechanism (for example, via circulating zzso and in zzso of a central zzso in particular zzso via the system of zzso zzso that is present in spinal zzso and zzso While an altered pattern of activity in this system might zzso the phenomenon, there are several reasons for proposing that the changes depend upon chemical signals, possibly growth zzso Because of its relative easy access for experimental zzso the spinal zzso could serve as a model system to study these zzso zzso zzso
