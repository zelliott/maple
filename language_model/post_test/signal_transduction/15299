zzso are large, zzso repulsive zzso guidance zzso Recent genetic studies revealed that the zzso is zzso for neural development but required for zzso zzso zzso such as the genesis of the zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso zzso promotes zzso a process essential for proper zzso during embryonic zzso We observed that zzso is expressed and zzso by both zzso cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in zzso and that the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso are universally expressed by zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may act in zzso and zzso manners to regulate zzso zzso Cellular function studies revealed that zzso stimulates zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso via interaction with zzso and zzso zzso vascular network formation in zzso with a specific activity comparable with vascular zzso growth zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulates zzso zzso ex zzso and new blood vessel growth in zzso zzso with these zzso the zzso knockout mice display disrupted zzso during zzso Taken together, our studies reveal that the repulsive zzso guidance zzso zzso is a novel and potent zzso factor and functions to promote zzso in zzso zzso during embryonic zzso
