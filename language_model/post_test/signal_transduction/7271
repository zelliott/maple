zzso diets zzso promote the development of both obesity and fatty liver disease through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso resistance, a hallmark of both conditions, causes dysfunctional fuel zzso and increases in zzso Recent work has demonstrated that systemic insulin resistance occurs in as little as the first 72 hours of an zzso suggesting the potential for zzso disruption with zzso at this time zzso The current study sought to determine differences in expression of zzso genes between sexes in zzso male and female zzso rats after 72 hours of a zzso zzso or a zzso fat zzso zzso zzso to the response of zzso on zzso zzso we hypothesized that a sexual zzso response would occur in the expression of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and cell repair and zzso zzso Both sexes consumed more energy when fed an zzso compared with their low zzso zzso However, only the males fed the zzso had a significant increase in body zzso Regardless of sex, zzso caused zzso of zzso and inflammatory zzso Interestingly, females fed an zzso had zzso expression of zzso and cell zzso genes compared with the zzso This may suggest that females are more responsive to the acute zzso injury effects caused by zzso In zzso neither male nor female rats displayed disrupted zzso zzso pathways after 72 hours of the zzso zzso In addition, female rats appear to have protection from increases in fat deposition, possibly due to increased caloric zzso male rats fed an zzso were less active, as demonstrated by distance traveled in their home zzso
