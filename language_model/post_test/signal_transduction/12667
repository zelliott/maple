The ubiquitous zzso of zzso zzso a product of the zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the control of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso gene expression is increased in zzso diabetic mouse zzso The zzso promoter construct linked to the zzso reporter gene was delivered to the liver via zzso gene zzso This promoter was zzso in zzso diabetic mouse liver compared with zzso healthy zzso In addition, increases were observed in zzso zzso and zzso protein levels, and zzso zzso zzso During zzso diabetes, zzso of both zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso was zzso together with the zzso of the zzso markers zzso D and zzso These findings indicate that zzso induction is coupled to enhanced zzso proliferation in zzso diabetic mouse zzso zzso decreased when zzso were treated with either zzso or zzso zzso This shows that zzso regulation is zzso zzso target of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is essential to the maintenance of the zzso flux necessary for providing energy and zzso precursors to dividing zzso
