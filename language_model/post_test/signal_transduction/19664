zzso zzso are a family of zzso that act downstream of cell surface receptors leading to zzso of multiple signaling pathways regulating cellular growth, zzso zzso and zzso To date, most research efforts have focused on a group of zzso zzso termed class I, of which the most studied member is zzso zzso is an zzso frequently zzso in human cancer, as is the chief negative regulator of the pathway, the tumor zzso zzso Recently, it has been suggested that tumors deficient for zzso might depend on the function of another class I member, zzso to sustain their transformed zzso Taken together, these findings provide a significant medical rationale to study the signaling zzso regulated by zzso and zzso particularly in the context of their role in the development and maintenance of human zzso Here, we zzso the current understanding of the upstream zzso regulation of the two zzso zzso and their roles in cancer as well as their functional requirements in downstream signaling zzso
