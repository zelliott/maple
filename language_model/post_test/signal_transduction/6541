zzso zzso signaling plays a crucial role in controlling cell expansion in many types of stem zzso Recent studies, however, demonstrated that zzso is not only a general stem cell growth factor but can also influence cell lineage decisions in certain stem cell types by promoting specific fates at the expense of zzso Thus, zzso signaling elicits multiple functions in stem zzso zzso activity appears to depend on zzso properties that might change with time during development, thereby altering the cellular response to zzso Moreover, the spatial context of a stem cell also determines how the cell zzso zzso signal activity, in that synergistic or zzso signaling pathways can zzso zzso zzso How a stem cell zzso zzso and other signals and how such signaling networks regulate stem cell function on the molecular level remains to be zzso
