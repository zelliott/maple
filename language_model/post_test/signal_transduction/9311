zzso zzso are highly vascular zzso characterized by a potent zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are implicated as major regulators of zzso cell growth and zzso zzso a downstream zzso of zzso signaling is positively associated with tumor zzso The present study aimed to investigate the expression of zzso and zzso in 97 zzso zzso zzso of various grades, in relation to zzso zzso zzso features, zzso characteristics and patients' zzso zzso expression was localized in zzso cells, being associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso around areas of necrosis as well as in zzso inflammatory and zzso zzso All the molecules under study correlated with tumor grade and degree of necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was positively associated with zzso density zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso and zzso adversely affected survival in the entire cohort whereas increased zzso expression was zzso of improved survival in high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis only zzso expression zzso zzso zzso retained its zzso The zzso significance of zzso expression and its correlation with zzso and zzso implicates this novel signaling zzso in zzso tumors progression providing new targets for effective zzso
