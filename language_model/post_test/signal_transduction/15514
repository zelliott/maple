This study investigates the mechanism by which zzso exerts its protective effect in zzso zzso injury in zzso Following induction of zzso zzso expression and activity levels increased and remained high for over 24 zzso zzso silenced for zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso to zzso zzso cell death and a lower capacity to generate zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and real time zzso analysis of gene expression from zzso cells revealed a number of zzso protective zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso a master regulator of cellular adaptation to zzso zzso zzso protein expression and nuclear zzso were also confirmed in zzso zzso zzso cells showed low zzso zzso content with no zzso to zzso lower zzso zzso levels than their controls and lower zzso membrane potential, which all were even more salient after zzso zzso zzso appears to act as a zzso zzso for the zzso of survival genes following zzso injury in zzso
