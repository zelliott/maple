zzso zzso is the principal zzso regulating zzso through its zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso are also found on immune cells with incompletely understood zzso Here, we show that EPO zzso the induction of zzso genes including tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in activated zzso which is mechanistically attributable to zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in systemic zzso infection, treatment of mice with EPO results in reduced survival and impaired pathogen clearance because of diminished formation of zzso zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso EPO or genetic zzso of zzso promotes zzso zzso In contrast, in chemically induced zzso zzso interaction decreases the production of zzso immune zzso thus limiting tissue damage and zzso disease zzso These zzso effects of EPO may be of therapeutic relevance in infectious and inflammatory zzso
