zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso G zzso zzso that has been studied primarily for its zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso results in zzso of the zzso zzso via a zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso N zzso resulting in a dramatic enhancement in zzso zzso This zzso activity of the truncated zzso zzso also resulted in enhanced downstream zzso of zzso as well as increased zzso association with zzso and increased zzso of the zzso To gain insights into the regulation of zzso zzso we screened the C zzso of zzso against a zzso array of zzso zzso to identify novel interacting zzso These screens revealed that the zzso C zzso interacts with a variety of zzso zzso from synaptic zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif resulted in zzso of zzso signaling to zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was found to zzso signaling to zzso by zzso active zzso in a manner that was dependent on the zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is highly enriched in zzso density zzso a finding consistent with our observations that zzso can interact with zzso proteins known to be concentrated in the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is a synaptic zzso that can activate both the zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso playing key roles in the regulation of zzso signaling zzso
