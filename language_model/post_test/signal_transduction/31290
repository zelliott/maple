Signal zzso networks of different cell types show a large variety in their structural zzso In this paper, basic structural properties of signal zzso networks are zzso For this, such networks with the recently developed method of network expansion are zzso This method allows for a structural analysis of networks by calculating signal expansion profiles when provided with certain compounds, for example growth factors, inactive zzso and so on zzso zzso to initiate such an zzso The presented results may put forth valuable hints on the evolution of zzso zzso
