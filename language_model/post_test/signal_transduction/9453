zzso pain represents an important zzso clinical need with important socioeconomic zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso has been shown to elicit mechanical zzso but the mechanisms remain largely zzso We now demonstrate that, in addition to mechanical zzso zzso injection of zzso (10 zzso led to the development of zzso zzso that was dependent on induction of the zzso zzso zzso and subsequent increase of zzso zzso zzso The development of mechanical and zzso zzso and increased production of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso The importance of the zzso to zzso zzso in zzso signaling was underscored by the findings that zzso injection of a zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso blocked the development of zzso Our results further revealed that zzso induction is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso since zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, blocked zzso induction and increased formation of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso was dependent on upstream zzso of zzso zzso since zzso zzso (10 zzso blocked zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso by zzso (1 zzso Our findings not only provide zzso insight into the signaling pathways engaged by zzso in the development of zzso but also provide a potential pharmacological basis for developing zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso as novel zzso
