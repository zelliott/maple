zzso zzso is an zzso killer protein that zzso in target cells to create small zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif is a zzso attack element of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Following the recognition that zzso cells can survive membrane zzso a profile of abundant transcripts was obtained in zzso zzso zzso Several immediate early genes were found to be zzso reminiscent of the cellular response to growth zzso Cell cycle analyses revealed doubling of S + zzso phase cells 26 h post toxin zzso zzso of cell counts uncovered that after an initial drop, numbers increased to exceed the controls after 2 zzso A zzso zzso zzso remained without zzso The zzso pore is too small to allow zzso of zzso growth factors, and evidence was instead obtained for growth zzso via the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or of zzso blocked the zzso effect of zzso Western blots with zzso zzso revealed zzso of the zzso and of the adapter protein zzso Immediate early response and proliferation upon transient plasma membrane pore formation by bacterial toxins may represent a novel facet of the complex interaction between pathogen and zzso
