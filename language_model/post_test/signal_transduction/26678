zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the control of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso expression levels and its zzso activity in the mouse zzso are significantly higher in the dark phase than those in the light zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso expression of zzso have not been zzso In this study, expression of zzso zzso in the mouse zzso showed a significant zzso rhythm and was higher in the dark zzso Although such an zzso was eliminated by a Clock gene zzso zzso and zzso did not activate zzso zzso in the zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso response element zzso protein family, is a component responsible for sustaining zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso significantly activated zzso zzso in zzso and time zzso bound to the zzso site in the zzso promoter in the mouse zzso In addition, zzso of the Clock gene disrupted zzso binding of zzso to the zzso site in the zzso zzso These results indicated that the circuit of zzso molecular regulation between the clockwork system and mouse zzso gene was connected by the zzso signaling zzso
