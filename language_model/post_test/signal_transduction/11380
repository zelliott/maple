To observe the time course and tissue distribution of zzso zzso and basic zzso growth zzso genes and their proteins in burned skin, and explore the possible network regulation mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso in wound healing and the role of the protein zzso C zzso involved in signal zzso among these zzso zzso 

The study was carried out on 188 zzso zzso Animal model with zzso partial thickness zzso injury was made and all rats were randomly divided into several groups: normal control zzso zzso zzso injured control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were used to detect the gene and protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the wounded zzso 

zzso The first appeared induction of zzso gene was zzso the second zzso and the last zzso They were peaked at 3 zzso 1 d and 3 d zzso with values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso decreased the expression of these three zzso factors when compared with that in the zzso There were a zzso decrease in zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso inhibited the gene and protein expression of zzso and zzso The peak times of zzso gene and protein were delayed to 6 hours post zzso Treatment with zzso induced an earlier expression of zzso zzso at 6 hours, and increased the gene and protein expressions of zzso and zzso The total amount of their values was increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injury can induce a series of zzso gene expression showing a zzso control and regional zzso zzso plays an important role in wound healing zzso zzso zzso C zzso may repair zzso
