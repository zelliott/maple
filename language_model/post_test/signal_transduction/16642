The natural zzso hormone zzso functions as an effective zzso zzso However, in its native state it is not an efficient therapeutic compound because of its poor zzso Thus, for practical therapeutic usage it became necessary to develop orally active zzso for use in hormone zzso We have shown that not all zzso are equal in their ability to zzso zzso survival and markers of zzso zzso Thus, one cannot assume that all hormone therapies will perform the same, and it is crucial to determine the neural effects and interactions with zzso of synthetic zzso used in place of natural zzso We have analyzed a number of clinically relevant zzso for zzso zzso These in zzso analyses of zzso efficacy could serve as a zzso index of clinical efficacy for zzso to protect against degenerative insults that lead to Alzheimer's zzso To aid in such therapeutic development, we determined the chemical structural features that predict zzso efficacy in the brain and showed that binding affinity does not predict zzso efficacy or the direction of effect and thus cannot be used as an indicator of neurological zzso In contrast, there was a set of common features of zzso interactions that are zzso and hopefully zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the sites and targets of zzso action should have a clear impact on both the use of hormone therapy for the prevention of neurodegenerative disease and the future design of zzso hormone therapy zzso
