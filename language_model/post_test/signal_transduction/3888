We have previously reported the isolation of two distinct populations of zzso resistant membrane complexes zzso from zzso chick brain zzso et zzso J zzso Res zzso zzso We now show that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso are associated in a zzso complex with zzso the zzso G alpha i zzso members G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso alpha and beta zzso and a number of other zzso in zzso isolated from both populations of zzso zzso of this zzso complex via zzso zzso zzso incubation with chick zzso cells, zzso a decrease in total zzso profile and zzso zzso activity present in zzso zzso isolated from these cells, while zzso and control zzso had no zzso zzso of the zzso zzso profile was accompanied by an increase in the zzso zzso complex, suggesting that zzso of this complex zzso the decreases seen in overall zzso zzso zzso This zzso complex provides the basis for zzso zzso signal zzso within the unique plasma membrane zzso represented by zzso
