The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the inflammation of rat dental pulp zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced with bacterial zzso in rat zzso dental zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso competitive binding with different zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso activity were zzso A drastic change in expression and response to zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso pulp expressed high number of zzso zzso of high zzso whereas the zzso zzso is the main zzso displayed in normal zzso zzso with the identification of the affinity constant zzso of zzso and Ki of zzso in both zzso and in normal zzso are the differences in the zzso functionality of these zzso In zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso zzso exerted an zzso action on zzso activity that was blocked by J zzso zzso zzso selective affinity to zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso zzso has no zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso times as high in zzso as in the normal pulp as a result of the zzso of zzso zzso The irreversible zzso could induce a zzso zzso increasing the zzso zzso density and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso activity, leading to a spontaneously active zzso of the zzso zzso acting as an inverse zzso might be useful zzso to prevent necrosis and subsequent loss of dental zzso
