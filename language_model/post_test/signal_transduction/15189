Our laboratory has reported that mice that express a dominant negative form of transforming growth factor beta zzso restricted to T cells zzso develop an inflammatory zzso zzso disease with elevated serum levels of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso closely resembling human primary zzso zzso zzso We have used this mouse model to address the potential mechanisms of zzso of liver disease by creating two unique genetic zzso zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso The two colonies of genetically modified zzso for purposes of controls, the zzso zzso monitored for liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Disease expression in the zzso zzso mice, including liver zzso were similar to those of zzso mice, whereas the zzso zzso mice had a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso zzso and significant decreases in levels of zzso zzso zzso but similar levels of zzso compared with zzso zzso 

These data indicate that in this mouse model of zzso signaling by way of zzso is an essential requirement for the development of zzso zzso The results of these studies will play an important role in identifying pathways and zzso that will selectively inhibit zzso signaling for the outlining of future therapeutic strategies for human zzso
