zzso and pharmacological experiments have recently implicated several protein zzso zzso in zzso and memory zzso The small zzso of the Ras zzso are activated by multiple zzso stimuli and, via a complex array of downstream zzso they control a variety of cellular events that culminate in gene zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cascade is essential for the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso In addition, in the zzso zzso specific zzso of the zzso zzso significantly zzso the induction of zzso which implicates this zzso cascade in zzso zzso Mice that lack the zzso Ras regulator, zzso zzso zzso have severely impaired zzso in the zzso and a corresponding deficit in long-term memory for aversive zzso The results obtained from these different systems demonstrate the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso plasticity and zzso and raise a number of intriguing zzso
