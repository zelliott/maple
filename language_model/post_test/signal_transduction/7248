This study provides original data regarding the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso rhythm of the zzso zzso zzso The results reveal that the zzso rhythms of the central zzso zzso genes reached their zzso from 1 to zzso after the light was switched on, and the zzso rhythms of zzso related genes were highly synchronized with the central zzso zzso zzso These zzso rhythms were consistent with cell growth at the zzso zzso The zzso rhythms of the central zzso zzso genes were altered, and their zzso disappeared or were delayed by the zzso zzso zzso the rhythms of the zzso related genes in this study also changed to zzso the new zzso zzso And the zzso parameters were tightly correlated with the gene zzso rhythm in the zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso affects zzso zzso growth by possibly altering the zzso expression patterns of the zzso Furthermore, this influence is related to the exposure time point of zzso Thus, chemicals treated in the suitable exposure time point can exert their fullest effects against cell zzso
