zzso zzso is released from various types of zzso cells despite no typical zzso signal zzso We show here that a zzso site in zzso is essential for its release from T zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso regulates its own zzso zzso Human T cell leukemia virus type zzso T zzso zzso release a large amount of zzso The level of zzso release is zzso upon the addition of zzso but suppressed upon the addition of zzso In the culture zzso of a zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso type zzso the zzso zzso protein is rapidly released at 1 h and kept at a constant level until 6 h after the addition of zzso In contrast, another type of zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to release the zzso zzso release of zzso from the zzso is inhibited by the presence of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso for 1 h at 37 degrees C, but not 0 degrees C, results in a significant suppression of the zzso release, zzso oxygen species, and zzso activity induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis show that zzso zzso added to the culture does not obviously enter T zzso until 24 zzso These results collectively suggest that the zzso zzso zzso release from T zzso depends on a zzso event and may be regulated by negative feedback zzso using zzso oxygen zzso signal zzso
