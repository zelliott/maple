Plasma zzso is thought to contribute to the local regulation of skeletal muscle blood zzso zzso zzso infusion can induce profound limb muscle zzso but the zzso receptors and downstream signals involved in this response remain zzso This study zzso 1) the role of zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso limb zzso and 2) the expression and distribution of zzso zzso receptors in human skeletal zzso zzso and leg zzso were measured before and during zzso zzso of zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso in 19 healthy male subjects with and without zzso of zzso zzso NO formation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso 26 zzso During control conditions, zzso infusion increased leg blood flow zzso from baseline conditions by zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso was zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso + zzso combined, the increase in zzso was reduced by 14 zzso 6, 15 zzso 9, and 39 zzso zzso respectively (all P zzso zzso and was associated with a parallel lowering in leg vascular zzso and cardiac output and a zzso increase in leg zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter the zzso leg zzso or systemic zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso content from the zzso zzso muscle of eight subjects showed the highest expression of zzso receptors of the 10 investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso receptors were located in the zzso of zzso and smooth muscle cells, whereas zzso receptors were located in the zzso and the zzso zzso these results indicate that NO and zzso but not zzso play a role in zzso zzso in human skeletal zzso The expression and zzso of the zzso selective zzso and zzso receptors suggest that these receptors may mediate zzso zzso in skeletal zzso
