zzso of mouse zzso by collagen is associated with zzso zzso of multiple proteins including the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that collagen signals in a manner similar to that of immune zzso This hypothesis has been tested using zzso from mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by collagen stimulation is absent in mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by collagen stimulation is also absent in mice zzso which lack zzso although zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso proteins by the G zzso zzso zzso zzso is maintained in mouse zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso or zzso The absence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso is accompanied by a loss of zzso and zzso responses in zzso but not zzso zzso These observations provide the first direct evidence of an essential role for the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
