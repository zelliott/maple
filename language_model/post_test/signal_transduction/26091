The zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso network that is the major site for the synthesis and folding of integral membrane and zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso protein folding is facilitated by molecular zzso and a variety of zzso that ensure that zzso obtain their appropriate, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso zzso and Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso development and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions that increase protein synthesis or stimuli that disturb the processes by which proteins obtain their native zzso create an imbalance between the zzso demand and capacity of the zzso This results in the zzso of unfolded or improperly folded proteins in the zzso zzso and a state of zzso zzso The cellular response, referred to as the unfolded protein response zzso results in zzso of three linked signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requiring 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and Walter, zzso zzso Signal integration in the zzso zzso unfolded protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and the unfolded protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the combined actions of these signaling zzso serve to reduce zzso stress through zzso of translation to reduce protein synthesis and through zzso of zzso programs that ultimately serve to increase zzso zzso zzso Recently, we and Park et zzso have characterized a novel function for the zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of the zzso by virtue of their ability to facilitate the nuclear entry of zzso following induction of zzso stress zzso zzso zzso Zhou, zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso Sun, zzso Chung, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Regulatory zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso interact with zzso and increase its nuclear zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso zzso zzso Boucher, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kahn, zzso zzso zzso A regulatory zzso of zzso zzso increases the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso to zzso the unfolded protein zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso This chapter describes the recently zzso role for the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso as zzso of the zzso and provides methods to measure zzso zzso zzso
