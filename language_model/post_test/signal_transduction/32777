Human zzso cells zzso respond to zzso II zzso which zzso their zzso activities, zzso contraction and zzso It has been revealed that focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in the zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso at focal zzso We investigated the influences of cell zzso upon zzso II effects in zzso In adherent cells, both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso by zzso II, while the cell detachment completely inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso II was zzso in suspended zzso Moreover, zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso in adherent cells and zzso II stimulation reduced the formation of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the formation of focal zzso complexes accelerated by zzso of zzso zzso may inhibit the proliferation of zzso by modulating zzso zzso activity and be related to zzso cell zzso
