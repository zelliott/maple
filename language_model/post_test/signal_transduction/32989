zzso zzso adjusts to increases in external zzso via a specific zzso protein zzso signal pathway, the zzso zzso response zzso zzso Studies with a functional zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion reveal that even under zzso conditions the zzso protein zzso zzso cycles between zzso and nuclear zzso The zzso distribution of the protein seems independent of its zzso zzso and independent of its zzso zzso Upon zzso challenge, the zzso fusion becomes rapidly concentrated in the nucleus from which it is zzso after return to an zzso environment or after adaptation to high zzso The zzso and zzso of increased nuclear zzso correlate with those found for the dual zzso of zzso The duration of zzso nuclear residence is modulated by the presence of the general stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso does not require de zzso protein synthesis but depends on zzso zzso zzso Thus, at least three different mechanisms contribute to the zzso distribution pattern of zzso zzso nuclear zzso retention by nuclear targets, and a zzso zzso
