zzso are a zzso integral membrane protein complex that is part of the zzso zzso zzso Previous findings suggest that the zzso zzso complex plays roles not only in maintaining the mechanical structure of the cell membrane but also in signal zzso To evaluate the functions of zzso we here took advantage of zzso which is useful for screening genetic zzso zzso zzso was observed in the adult compound eyes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also detected genetic interactions between zzso and zzso related zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso two extra cell types with strong expression of zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These cells exhibited zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is activated via zzso Through these in zzso zzso we conclude that zzso zzso regulates the zzso signaling zzso
