zzso P zzso acting on the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso involved in the inflammatory zzso It promotes zzso and increases zzso thus ensuing zzso and zzso of zzso at sites of zzso The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SP zzso on the responses during zzso infection and the accompanying zzso Three experiments were performed where zzso mice and controls were zzso infected with different doses of zzso zzso Clinical assessment of arthritis was performed as well as zzso analysis of bone and cartilage destruction in the zzso In addition, the impact of zzso zzso on bacterial load in the zzso as well as the zzso capacity of blood zzso were zzso Mice lacking the zzso displayed significantly higher bacterial load in the zzso and significantly more severe zzso and zzso destruction than the controls when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso Thus, 11 days after bacterial zzso 15 of 19 mice in the zzso group had died versus 8 of 15 in the control zzso zzso test revealed that significantly fewer zzso from zzso mice were able to zzso zzso zzso when compared with zzso from zzso control zzso zzso the biological responses to substance P via its zzso zzso results in a less efficient clearance of bacteria leading to more severe zzso zzso in zzso
