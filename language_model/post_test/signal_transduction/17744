zzso zzso a disease of unknown zzso and zzso is associated with heart failure and zzso zzso Although cell and animal models suggest a role for altered gene expression in the transition to heart failure, there is a paucity of data derived from the study of human heart zzso In this study, we used DNA zzso profiling to investigate changes in the expression of genes involved in zzso that occur in human idiopathic zzso zzso hearts that had progressed to heart zzso We observed altered gene expression consistent with a zzso shift in the zzso signaling zzso Specifically, we found decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes such as growth arrest and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein 3 zzso zzso with a role for zzso in heart failure, we also observed a significant decrease in zzso of BAD at zzso This study identifies several pathways that are altered in human heart failure and provides new targets for zzso
