The zzso zzso signaling zzso is vital to animal development as it mediates the differentiation of multiple cell types during zzso In adults, zzso signaling can be activated to facilitate tissue maintenance and zzso Moreover, stimulation of the zzso zzso has shown therapeutic efficacy in models of zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso signal zzso remain obscure, zzso little is known about the communication between the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that directly binds zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein that is related to zzso receptors and is capable of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso 

We have identified and characterized a synthetic zzso small zzso zzso that acts as an zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso promotes zzso proliferation and zzso differentiation in zzso while in zzso it zzso aspects of the zzso zzso in Sonic zzso but not zzso mouse zzso zzso studies with zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso inhibitor zzso reveal that the action of all these compounds is independent of zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso as each binds directly to zzso 

zzso can have its activity modulated directly by synthetic small zzso These studies raise the possibility that zzso signaling may be regulated by zzso small molecules in zzso and provide potent compounds with which to test the therapeutic value of zzso the zzso zzso in the treatment of traumatic and chronic degenerative zzso
