The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso effect of zzso isolated from zzso zzso Bureau zzso zzso on allergic zzso We evaluated the activities of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso factor, and production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso inhibited the production of zzso and zzso in serum from zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was effectively blocked by treatment with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The results from these experiments indicate that the zzso zzso zzso release of zzso and production of zzso and zzso via down regulation of zzso zzso on the stage of mast cell zzso In conclusion, we suggest that the zzso zzso might be a potent preventive agent in allergic zzso
