Long chain bases zzso are zzso zzso acting as second zzso in programmed cell death zzso in zzso Most of the molecular and cellular features of this signaling function remain zzso We induced zzso conditions in zzso zzso zzso and analyzed zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was unable to mount an effective zzso in response to zzso B1 zzso revealing that the zzso gene is essential for the induction of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso plants and zzso experiments with zzso indicated that this zzso was primarily responsible for zzso zzso The resistance of the zzso zzso zzso to manifest zzso on zzso and zzso addition and the failure to show resistance on pathogen infection and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso indicated that zzso mediates zzso downstream of zzso This work describes zzso as a novel zzso in the zzso leading to zzso zzso in zzso and reveals that zzso and the zzso gene are required in a zzso process that operates as one of the more effective strategies used as defense against pathogens in zzso
