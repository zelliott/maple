The zzso system has long been known for its role in acquisition and retention of new zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple memory systems, and this has promoted the notion that drug-induced side effects are responsible for diminished task execution rather than selective zzso on learning and memory per zzso Here, we revisit this issue with the aim to zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso on spatial learning in the water zzso zzso 1 and 2 showed that acquisition of a reference memory paradigm with constant platform location is compromised by zzso independent of whether the animals are zzso or zzso zzso were paralleled by drug induced zzso on zzso zzso zzso 3 explored the role of zzso receptors in acquisition of an zzso spatial delayed matching to position zzso zzso and zzso still caused a learning deficit and zzso on zzso zzso zzso extensively zzso in the zzso protocol with 30 s and 1 h delays over several months in experiment 4 and tested in a zzso design under saline and zzso had no zzso deficits, but spatial working memory remained zzso zzso 5 used the rising Atlantis platform in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the amount of dwelling and its location revealed a clear deficit in spatial working memory induced by zzso but there was no effect on zzso or procedural task zzso Apart from the well-known contribution to zzso and procedural learning, our findings provide compelling evidence for an important role of zzso zzso zzso signaling in spatial zzso zzso
