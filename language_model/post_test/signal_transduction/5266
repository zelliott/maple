zzso in the zzso zzso cause zzso type II zzso a syndrome featuring hypertension and high serum zzso levels zzso zzso has distinct functional states that regulate the balance between zzso salt zzso and zzso zzso by modulating the activities of zzso zzso and channels, including the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso channel zzso zzso functions could enable differential responses to zzso volume depletion zzso and zzso Because zzso is uniquely associated with high zzso II zzso levels, zzso signaling might zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso signaling in zzso zzso increases zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso of zzso but does not alter zzso zzso of zzso This effect requires zzso its zzso zzso and zzso and is prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso activity is also increased by zzso harboring zzso found in zzso and this activity cannot be further zzso by zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso providing zzso zzso of the signaling zzso between zzso and zzso zzso effect on zzso is also dependent on the zzso zzso because zzso zzso or elimination of the zzso binding motif in zzso prevent zzso of zzso by zzso zzso These effects extend to zzso zzso zzso increases zzso of specific sites on zzso and zzso that are necessary for zzso of each in zzso zzso These findings place zzso in the signaling zzso between zzso and zzso and provide a mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso salt zzso without zzso increasing zzso zzso
