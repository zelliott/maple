Signaling in development is not always on or zzso often, distinct intensity and duration of signaling leads to distinct zzso This is true for zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in many zzso where negative feedback often plays a zzso Although such negative feedback might reduce or even turn off signaling output over time, continued signaling is often maintained for proper cell fate zzso In this issue, zzso et zzso identify a positive regulator of zzso zzso signaling that they name zzso zzso is necessary to achieve specific signaling intensity for the differentiation of zzso and of zzso that wrap zzso in the developing zzso eye zzso Both the negative regulator zzso and zzso influence signaling through the zzso zzso zzso specifically, zzso forms a positive feedback loop important for zzso the zzso negative feedback zzso
