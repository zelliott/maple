Several studies have revealed a role for zzso in zzso zzso in the developing zzso In this study we monitored the spatial and zzso expression of zzso signaling molecules in the brain of zzso zzso zzso rats after the application of a single zzso dose zzso zzso zzso The structures of interest were the zzso and zzso as the primary areas of zzso zzso Changes of the protein levels of the zzso zzso factor zzso and nerve growth factor zzso their activated receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso and downstream zzso zzso and the zzso signal regulated zzso zzso were assessed by Western zzso analysis at different time points during the first 24 h after the treatment, as well as the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso was used to follow the appearance of zzso zzso The obtained results show that the treatment caused marked zzso in levels of the examined zzso their receptors and downstream zzso zzso However, these changes were not associated with increased zzso in either the zzso or the zzso These results indicate that in the brain of zzso rats, the interaction between zzso signaling might be one of important part of zzso defense mechanisms, which the developing brain zzso to protect itself from potential zzso zzso zzso of the underlying molecular mechanisms will improve our understanding of the zzso component of zzso zzso
