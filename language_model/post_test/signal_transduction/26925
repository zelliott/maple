zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which stimulates vessel contraction through vascular smooth muscle zzso receptors differing from those in zzso We studied zzso events in cultured adult rat zzso smooth muscle zzso The stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso for zzso zzso binding to vascular smooth muscle cells with an zzso of 10 zzso 1 zzso In zzso cells, zzso increased free zzso zzso concentration with an zzso of 49 zzso 14 zzso The increase in free zzso zzso was zzso transient and independent of zzso zzso or zzso zzso and thus was due to release from zzso zzso zzso zzso release was temporally associated with zzso of zzso light zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso from pH zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release was zzso attenuated by the zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso In rat zzso rings zzso caused zzso zzso zzso zzso of 28 zzso 2 zzso which were not attenuated by removal of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso occupation of zzso receptors produces vascular smooth muscle contraction through initial zzso of zzso C with production of zzso zzso release of zzso calcium stores and zzso of zzso light chains associated with cellular zzso presumably via zzso of zzso zzso
