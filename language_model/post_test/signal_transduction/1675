zzso and zzso regulate the expression of several important genes at the level of zzso and of zzso zzso Two zzso of a zzso zzso zzso previously identified as zzso zzso bind to a zzso zzso site in the zzso region of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and regulate zzso zzso To determine if zzso proteins show changes in expression -- which might regulate zzso stability -- in hypoxic or zzso zzso cells, we examined zzso protein 1 and zzso protein 2 expression in hypoxic cortical zzso cultures and in rat cerebral zzso after focal zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso showed hypoxic zzso of zzso protein 1, and zzso of zzso protein 2, zzso and protein zzso zzso expression of zzso protein 1 was zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso while zzso expression of zzso protein 2 was zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso protein 1, but not zzso protein 2, expression was increased in the zzso boundary zone zzso of the frontal zzso after 90 zzso of zzso and persisted for at least 72 h after zzso These results demonstrate that zzso protein 1 and zzso protein 2 in cortical zzso are zzso affected by zzso zzso suggesting that there are functional differences between zzso protein zzso Since we observed no zzso protein expression in zzso alternative zzso stability mechanisms may exist in these zzso
