zzso is an zzso zzso protein complex composed of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins that selects and packages cargo proteins into transport carriers that export cargo from the zzso The mechanisms by which zzso is recruited to the zzso and captures cargo are zzso We show that membrane recruitment of zzso is zzso by zzso recognition of an zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso These zzso interactions prime zzso to capture integral membrane zzso which enhances membrane association of zzso and zzso cargo zzso The role of zzso is severely impaired by a zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso zzso The results zzso minimal requirements for zzso assembly on the zzso membrane and reveal how zzso and zzso signaling are coupled to initiate zzso cargo zzso
