The zzso zzso the least zzso member of the zzso zzso factor zzso family, associates with the plasma membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso defective in zzso binding and zzso have a marked effect on zzso trafficking and the gross zzso of the peripheral membrane zzso Here we report that expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso by inducing zzso zzso at the cell zzso This zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso with deletion zzso of zzso a zzso protein involved in membrane zzso but not with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A synergistic effect between zzso and zzso for the induction of zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso interacts directly with zzso and that this interaction was zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso function on distinct signaling pathways to mediate zzso zzso and suggest a role for zzso as an important regulatory element in orchestrating zzso zzso at the cell periphery induced by zzso and zzso
