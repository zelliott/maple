Juvenile hormone zzso regulates insect development by a poorly understood zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso during the zzso onset of metamorphosis results in zzso and specific zzso zzso some of which resemble those in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene mediates zzso action, and Met zzso protect against the zzso and zzso To explore relationships among these two genes and zzso double zzso were constructed between Met zzso and zzso of each of the zzso zzso groups: broad zzso reduced zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in viability and zzso were consistently more severe in zzso Met or br Met double zzso than would be expected if these genes act zzso Additionally, zzso between zzso zzso zzso often failed when zzso was zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso during metamorphosis revealed essentially no difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not block zzso of zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso interact to control zzso of one or more downstream zzso zzso which can be disrupted either by zzso in Met or zzso or by application of zzso zzso which alters zzso interaction with zzso
