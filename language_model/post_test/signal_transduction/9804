The zzso zzso zzso member zzso is a well known zzso promoting zzso However, the mechanisms upstream of zzso membrane zzso by which zzso is involved in zzso have been poorly investigated, particularly in response to agents capable of interfering with the zzso architecture and arresting cells in zzso Based on the observation that zzso is zzso on the zzso by interaction with the light chain of zzso we have investigated upon zzso whether zzso could be involved in the commitment of zzso With this purpose zzso zzso Small Lung Cancer zzso zzso were treated with the zzso damaging agent zzso zzso zzso zzso and various parameters were zzso Upon treatment, cells arrested in zzso and died through a zzso zzso zzso zzso knock down of zzso drastically reduced zzso indicating that this protein was involved in cell death as induced by zzso zzso In response to increasing conditions of zzso zzso we found that the protein level of zzso was strongly zzso in a zzso manner at zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was released from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso even in a condition of protein synthesis zzso where it showed a markedly increased interaction with zzso In turn, the fraction of zzso bound to zzso decreases in response to treatment, thereby indicating that zzso possibly promotes zzso release from the zzso protein zzso Overall, we demonstrated that zzso is required for the zzso cell death in the zzso lung cancer cell line via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Defining the contribution of zzso to the mechanism of zzso may offer some different clues in view of developing new strategies for chemotherapy with zzso underlining the relevance of the zzso integrity in the zzso zzso
