zzso stresses caused by zzso oxygen species zzso can induce rapid zzso of inner zzso membrane potential and subsequent impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso produce more zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso so-called zzso zzso release zzso via zzso of an zzso signaling zzso zzso loss of function in only a fraction of zzso might eventually affect cell viability through this positive feedback zzso Since zzso are very short-lived molecules in the biological zzso zzso network zzso such as density, number, and spatial distribution, can affect zzso zzso zzso To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model using an zzso modeling approach, and tested the effect of zzso network dynamics on zzso for zzso under various zzso zzso results show that the zzso zzso signaling pattern, such as zzso propagation speed and zzso stress vulnerability, are critically affected by zzso network zzso zzso network dynamics of zzso distribution, density, activity, and size can mediate zzso signaling under certain conditions and determine the identity of the zzso signaling zzso We further zzso the potential mechanism of these actions, zzso conversion of major zzso molecules involved in zzso zzso If the average distance between neighboring zzso is large or zzso distribution becomes randomized, zzso zzso of the zzso signaling network can be switched from zzso to zzso In this case, zzso zzso propagation is efficiently blocked by introduction of excess zzso zzso zzso 1, while introduction of zzso zzso zzso has no zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso network dynamics is a major zzso for cellular responses to zzso through changing the key zzso zzso
