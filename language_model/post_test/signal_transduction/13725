The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactive domain zzso zzso has been recently zzso as a novel tumor zzso of zzso cancer and one of the driver genes in zzso zzso However, specific relationships with established molecular zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso are currently zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso in 146 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso in relation to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status zzso zzso and zzso zzso To discriminate between zzso instability due to zzso zzso promoter zzso or zzso zzso in one of the mismatch repair genes zzso zzso we included a zzso syndrome zzso This set included 21 cases with confirmed zzso zzso and 15 cases that were suspected to have a zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression was exclusively found in zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso No loss of expression of the other zzso of the zzso complex, zzso and zzso was zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were more frequent when zzso expression was zzso Loss of zzso and zzso zzso expression was nearly mutually exclusive zzso In contrast to zzso tumors, a strong association between zzso loss and sporadic zzso instability was zzso Only five cases zzso of the zzso syndrome zzso as compared with 24 cases zzso zzso of the sporadic zzso tumors showed loss of zzso These observations suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso instead of a target zzso of zzso instability by having a role in zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
