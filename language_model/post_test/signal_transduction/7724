zzso injury zzso contributes to early and late dysfunction of liver zzso We have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso of T cell immune responses during zzso zzso We have also documented that zzso of zzso zzso zzso exerts potent zzso zzso This study analyzes how zzso zzso viral zzso zzso gene transfer affects zzso and zzso signaling in host innate and zzso immunity during liver zzso Using a partial zzso warm zzso model, groups of zzso and zzso knockout zzso mice were assessed for severity of zzso damage after 90 zzso of warm zzso followed by 6 zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso have shown improved zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso ameliorated zzso signs of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and depressed tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso zzso These effects were zzso dependent as treatment with zzso zzso zzso liver zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso showed severe zzso damage due to zzso Unlike in controls, zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso revealed markedly depressed zzso and zzso zzso along with increased zzso and zzso zzso as compared with respective zzso Thus, zzso gene transfer prevents zzso zzso in association with depressed expression of innate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso exerts synergistic zzso function against zzso zzso inflammatory response triggered by zzso
