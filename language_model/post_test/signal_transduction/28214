The purpose of the present study was to examine the roles of signaling pathways potentially activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in regulation of cell migration and proliferation of healing mouse zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso or zzso was evaluated by zzso in healing mouse zzso zzso after zzso The role of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso healing was determined in zzso mouse zzso with an zzso zzso in the presence or absence of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by incorporation of zzso 

zzso mouse zzso zzso had minimal cell zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso of normal zzso zzso whereas they were absent in zzso of zzso cells in association with zzso zzso on zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso reduced the protein expression of zzso in zzso after a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso were markedly evident in zzso zzso during healing, but not in zzso zzso In organ culture, addition of zzso zzso blocked cell migration more markedly than zzso zzso and enhanced cell proliferation in the injured zzso zzso in association with zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso enhances migration of zzso zzso during wound healing in zzso The zzso but not the zzso cascade plays a major role in promoting cell migration and in suppressing cell proliferation in zzso zzso
