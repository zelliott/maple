zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disorder characterized by the presence of a fusion zzso zzso which encodes a protein with zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso marked a major advance in zzso zzso however, there are problems with current zzso For example, zzso occurs when these drugs are discontinued in the majority of patients who have achieved a complete molecular response on zzso and these agents are less effective in patients with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can effectively target zzso mature cells, but do not eradicate zzso zzso stem cells zzso therefore allowing disease persistence despite zzso It is essential that alternative strategies are used to target the zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of different zzso zzso which allows the zzso fraction to evade cell zzso Several pathways have been shown to be modulated by zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso components of these survival zzso alone or in combination with zzso therefore represents an attractive potential therapeutic approach for targeting the zzso However, many pathways are also active in normal stem zzso zzso potential targets must be validated to effectively eradicate zzso stem cells while sparing normal zzso This review summarizes the main pathways modulated in zzso stem cells, the recent developments and the use of novel drugs to target components in these pathways which may be used to target the zzso zzso
