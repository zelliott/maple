zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and protein zzso which associates with the activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso and other zzso zzso We studied the effects of zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso regulated zzso zzso by zzso in cultured zzso zzso cells, zzso cells responsible for zzso zzso synthesis within the zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso a dose which almost completely blocks zzso zzso resulted in 50% reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso could not be considered responsible for this effect, since zzso did not inhibit zzso activity in zzso Rather, zzso of zzso zzso acts on the zzso cascade that leads to zzso zzso since zzso zzso of zzso was found to be reduced after incubation with zzso zzso also inhibited the increase in zzso zzso induced by zzso which is dependent on zzso zzso The results of this study show that in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso although it is not zzso These data indicate zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
