zzso zzso zzso is an ancient and zzso zzso of energy zzso Despite its importance, the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso control of body fat remain poorly zzso Here, we decipher the zzso neural circuit for body fat loss in zzso zzso and show that the effects of zzso require signaling from zzso the zzso analog of zzso to sustain body fat zzso Our results provide a potential molecular explanation for the zzso potent effects of combined zzso and zzso weight loss zzso In zzso zzso we find that the zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso drives zzso fat zzso We show that the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso a long-range zzso signal from zzso zzso body cavity zzso to control zzso zzso function, via the nuclear zzso zzso Our findings establish a zzso neuroendocrine axis operated by neural zzso and zzso signaling to regulate body zzso
