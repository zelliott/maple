Muscle zzso relies on adult muscle stem zzso zzso zzso cues released within the zzso zzso such as zzso instruct different components of the satellite cell niche toward specialized tasks by regulating specific zzso of genes in each individual cell zzso However, how zzso cues are zzso and interpreted by the multitude of cell types within the zzso environment is zzso We have recently identified an zzso zzso consisting of zzso recruitment of zzso repressive complex 2 zzso to the zzso promoter, in satellite zzso Here we show that zzso regulation of zzso expression is restricted to a discrete stage of satellite zzso zzso In activated satellite cells, zzso locus shows a zzso zzso signature, with zzso of zzso and zzso that appears to zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso zzso resolves zzso to zzso which results in zzso repression, while zzso blockade promotes zzso expression by preventing zzso zzso and leading to relative increase in zzso Interestingly, in satellite zzso zzso zzso expression cannot be zzso by zzso zzso revealing a zzso resistance of zzso gene to inflammatory zzso Likewise, in other cell types, such as zzso zzso zzso locus is zzso zzso by zzso and is unresponsive to zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso repression in embryonic stem cells is not directed by zzso zzso although it is zzso by zzso This evidence indicates a cell zzso and zzso specific control of zzso zzso by the zzso
