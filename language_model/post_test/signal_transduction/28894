zzso coli and other zzso zzso can adapt their metabolism according to oxygen availability by means of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso signal zzso system that controls, at the zzso level, the choice of energy generation zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso High zzso studies on different zzso regulator zzso involving zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso enabled the zzso of a repertoire of zzso coordinated by zzso which extended beyond zzso control including, among others, those which code for survival, zzso replication and degradation of fatty zzso zzso analysis by zzso labeling provided new clues to the understanding of the distribution of zzso zzso by zzso The genetic manipulation of this regulator proved to be useful for the generation of reduced products of commercial zzso
