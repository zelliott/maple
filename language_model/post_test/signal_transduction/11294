Growth factor receptors of the zzso zzso family regulate proliferation of a variety of cell zzso In some human zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its zzso often are zzso leading to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling via this zzso takes place through several mechanisms of action, including zzso of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that human zzso cell zzso zzso lines zzso zzso and do not increase proliferation in response to zzso zzso growth factor zzso The vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso has been used as a zzso drug in the treatment of zzso zzso decreases proliferation of SCC lines, in part zzso to zzso of zzso zzso However, we previously found that treatment of SCC lines with zzso doses of zzso zzso cells to the zzso effects of zzso We now present a mechanism of action for this zzso zzso inhibited expression of zzso and proteins in the zzso signaling zzso zzso of these molecules returned to zzso levels within 24 h after zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso which returned to zzso levels with slower zzso During this time, addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso in SCC zzso These data suggested that signaling proteins downstream of zzso zzso may have limited the zzso response in SCC zzso In support of this hypothesis, zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso increased cell proliferation and restored zzso zzso
