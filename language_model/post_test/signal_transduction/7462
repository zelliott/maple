It has been reported that the zzso signaling zzso is activated in diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso However, the copy number variations zzso of zzso zzso on gene level remain unknown in zzso zzso the aim of the study is to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso and their relationship with zzso features exploring the possible mechanism underlying of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso of 12 genes in the zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso in 60 de zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso specimens as zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso was performed to examine the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso tissue zzso 

All zzso and zzso zzso except for zzso had various zzso in the form of copy number zzso and copy number zzso Their rates were in the range of zzso Of them zzso and zzso gene zzso were significantly associated with decreased overall survival zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the frequency of strong positive expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and they were found to be associated with decreased survival zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not only significantly associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but also positively correlated with strong positive expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso is highly associated with zzso zzso protein expression and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso protein expression of zzso zzso are of great important value for predicting inferior prognosis in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
