Communication from zzso to zzso has recently been reported by two laboratories, but different mechanisms were though to zzso zzso calcium wave zzso of associated zzso zzso calcium zzso by zzso observed in the present report is similar to that reported zzso where an increase in zzso calcium was demonstrated in response to zzso zzso In the present study zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso displayed a transient increase in zzso calcium following a short delay after the passage of a wave of increased calcium in underlying zzso zzso cells displayed action zzso in response to zzso waves and showed zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the responsiveness of zzso to zzso calcium zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso growing on zzso or cortical zzso respond to zzso calcium waves with zzso in calcium and increased electrical zzso Furthermore, we show that in most cases this communication appears to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso
