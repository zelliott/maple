zzso zzso 6 zzso is a zzso family zzso zzso factor that is critically involved in tooth zzso and dental cell zzso However, its mechanism of action is still not fully zzso We have employed both zzso and zzso approaches to address the role of zzso in the formation of cell junctions in dental cells and in the regulation of zzso signal zzso zzso We have evaluated the expression of junction proteins in zzso zzso and zzso tooth sections from zzso mice and in dental pulp zzso cells zzso zzso In zzso mice, a dramatic reduction occurs in the expression of tight junction and zzso junction proteins and of the zzso zzso zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso Loss of cell junctions and zzso in zzso mice is correlated with a clear decrease in bone zzso protein 4 zzso zzso a decrease in zzso in the tooth zzso altered cell zzso and failure of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells results in an increased cellular zzso of zzso zzso indicative of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso enhances zzso zzso signaling in the developing dental pulp zzso a condition that promotes the activity of other downstream signaling zzso such as zzso which are fundamental for cellular induction and zzso zzso These altered signaling events might zzso some of the most prominent dental defects observed in zzso mice, such as the absence of zzso and zzso and might throw light on zzso zzso of the zzso including zzso
