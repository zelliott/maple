In 2005, the first robust zzso C virus zzso infectious cell culture system was developed based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular clone and the zzso zzso cell line zzso Although much effort has been made to dissect and expand the repertoire of zzso zzso less attention has been given to the host cell despite the intriguing facts that thus far only zzso cells have been found to be highly zzso for zzso infection and zzso only a limited number of zzso cell zzso appear to be fully zzso As such, we compiled a panel of zzso lines from disparate sources and evaluated their zzso for zzso zzso We found that although zzso lines from different laboratories do vary in zzso and cell growth, the majority (8 out of 9) were highly zzso for infection, as demonstrated by robust zzso zzso and de zzso infectious zzso production following zzso While zzso zzso levels achieved in the 8 zzso cell lines were relatively zzso three zzso lines demonstrated higher infectious zzso production suggesting these cell lines more efficiently support zzso zzso in the viral life zzso zzso with previous studies, the single zzso line found to be relatively resistant to infection demonstrated a block in zzso zzso These studies not only suggest that the majority of zzso cell lines in different laboratories are in fact highly zzso for zzso infection, but also identify zzso distinct zzso lines, which may facilitate studies investigating the cellular zzso of zzso zzso
