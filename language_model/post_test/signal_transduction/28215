zzso is a known inhibitor of zzso bone zzso but it remains uncertain whether zzso also regulates human zzso activity, particularly during the zzso process of root zzso In this study, we examined the expression of zzso receptors in human zzso and the effect of zzso on root zzso using zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso formation was used to assess zzso changes during zzso zzso Our results show that zzso receptors are expressed in human zzso freshly isolated from zzso teeth of the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation and zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are protein zzso A zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso root zzso via zzso a signaling zzso different from that in human zzso
