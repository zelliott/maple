zzso are important regulators of both zzso zzso cell zzso proliferation and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Here, we compared the biological effects of the zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso with those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso products zzso zzso In particular, studies on zzso zzso of LP zzso cell attachment to zzso plastic surfaces, proliferation of these cells in zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso were zzso zzso but not zzso was found to increase the zzso of LP zzso cells to zzso in a zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso effects on LP zzso cells in zzso zzso While zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso colonies to the same extent, zzso showed a significantly greater zzso effect on zzso than zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso but not zzso triggers increases in zzso calcium in LP zzso zzso The zzso calcium response was rapid and zzso with a zzso stimulation observed at zzso or zzso 15 zzso In conclusion, our data suggest distinct biological properties of zzso and zzso in terms of zzso of LP zzso cell zzso to zzso and zzso calcium zzso However, comparable zzso effects on zzso proliferation were observed, indicating that this feature may be independent of zzso calcium zzso
