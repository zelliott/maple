The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor that is expressed in B cells and a subset of zzso T cells within zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso can act as a zzso zzso of transcription, but the target genes for this activity have not yet been zzso The binding site for zzso shares striking zzso to the sites that are the target sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that zzso can zzso with different zzso to several DNA elements recognized by zzso zzso of zzso can repress the zzso induction of zzso zzso germ line zzso zzso but does not repress the zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso with the role of zzso in modulating zzso from the germ line zzso promoter, zzso mice display an increased ability to class switch to zzso in response to zzso in zzso These animals also exhibit a zzso inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of a large number of zzso B zzso The apparent zzso of zzso production is abolished in zzso zzso mice, indicating that zzso regulation of zzso class switching is dependent upon zzso zzso Thus, zzso can zzso the zzso of selective zzso zzso responses, including zzso class switching in B zzso
