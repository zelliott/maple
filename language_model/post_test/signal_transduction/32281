Ion channels regulate the membrane potential and zzso zzso concentration and thus serve a central role in various cellular zzso Several zzso channels have been identified in the germ cells, including zzso emphasizing their importance in male fertility and zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso transport and the nature of the zzso channels involved have begun to emerge only recently despite the fact that several zzso and zzso channels have been identified and localized on zzso The presence of the zzso zzso channel zzso gene family, zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso sodium zzso channel zzso and the members of the transient zzso potential zzso channel family suggest an indispensable role for zzso channels in zzso physiology and fertility zzso Ion channels are the key players in very important processes such as zzso and the zzso reaction, which are critical steps in zzso physiology preparing for zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel family members have been proposed to participate in the zzso reaction, thereby making them most important for zzso zzso Similarly, zzso channels could play a crucial role in zzso zzso and in the initial zzso zzso The role of zzso channels seems indispensable for zzso fertility as evidenced by studies on animal zzso however, the functional defects in zzso human males await further zzso This article represents an update on the role of zzso channels in zzso zzso male zzso and zzso
