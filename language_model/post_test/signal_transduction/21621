We used zzso zzso at single cell resolution to zzso the in zzso spatial scale of zzso zzso zzso zzso communication of zzso zzso zzso on tomato and wheat root zzso The results of this in zzso zzso study on zzso surfaces challenge the conventional view of a zzso group requirement of high cell zzso for this type of bacterial zzso In zzso image analysis indicated that the effective zzso zzso on root surfaces was most frequent at 4-5 zzso extended to 37 zzso in the root zzso zone and further out to 78 zzso in the root hair zzso The spatial scale of these calling distances is very long-range in proportion to the size of individual zzso zzso modeling analysis implicated the importance of zzso zzso effective communication between remote zzso We conclude that zzso zzso communication occurs not only within dense zzso but also in very small groups and over long ranges between individual bacteria, and therefore this cellular activity is more commonplace and effective than zzso zzso We propose that this zzso communication is governed more by the in zzso spatial proximity of cells within zzso than the requirement for a zzso group of high population zzso
