The basic zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso We show that zzso is expressed by activated T helper zzso 1 zzso memory zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells depended on zzso nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso and zzso zzso signaling via signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was transient after T cell zzso engagement, and increased upon repeated stimulation of zzso zzso Imprinting for enhanced zzso expression was characteristic of repeatedly zzso zzso zzso cells, and thus of the zzso memory zzso cells characteristic of chronic zzso zzso zzso from the inflamed joint or gut tissue of patients with rheumatic diseases, Crohn's disease or zzso colitis expressed high levels of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso limited the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso and ameliorated zzso zzso in zzso hypersensitivity and zzso zzso
