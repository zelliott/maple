We had previously selected five zzso zzso zzso upon their specific binding to human zzso zzso These zzso which are specific for two distinct zzso of the zzso zzso also inhibit the zzso binding to human zzso membrane zzso We then zzso zzso mice with the various zzso in attempt to generate zzso zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso were selected from one mouse zzso with the mixture of the five zzso These zzso zzso to the zzso were selected upon their ability to specifically bind to the zzso Moreover, we showed that binding of zzso to the individual zzso used for zzso was specifically inhibited by zzso and not by insulin or by human zzso zzso a highly related zzso zzso The five zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso to its zzso by 8 to zzso moreover, two of them zzso the zzso system of the zzso zzso With respect to their properties, zzso were classified as zzso
