Here, we have created a series of zzso zzso deletion zzso to examine whether the membrane spanning segment is required for membrane attachment of zzso in zzso One zzso zzso contains only the zzso zzso domain and lacks the membrane spanning domain and the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso still behaves as an integral membrane protein but lacks any known signals for zzso zzso In striking contrast, another deletion zzso zzso behaved as a soluble zzso These results zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as the zzso scaffolding zzso in membrane zzso In accordance with the zzso role of the zzso scaffolding domain as an inhibitor of signal zzso zzso retained the ability to functionally inhibit signaling along the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso whereas zzso was completely zzso To rule out the possibility that membrane attachment zzso by the zzso scaffolding domain was zzso we zzso the membrane binding of zzso in zzso By using zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins and zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso scaffolding domain and the zzso domain zzso zzso are both sufficient for membrane attachment in zzso However, the putative membrane spanning domain zzso zzso did not show any physical association with zzso in this in zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the zzso scaffolding domain contributes to the membrane attachment of zzso
