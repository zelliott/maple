Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso could improve the zzso function in rats and mice with diabetic zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in rat zzso cells zzso cultured under high zzso However, the molecular mechanisms have not been fully zzso 

To explore the potential mechanisms of zzso in the treatment of zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso nuclear zzso B zzso zzso and its downstream inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression in rat zzso 

Cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was detected by Western zzso and zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in rat zzso were detected by Western zzso 

Our results revealed that zzso significantly suppressed zzso cell proliferation and inhibited zzso zzso nuclear zzso in zzso as well as protein expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso significantly zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso expression in rat zzso through zzso the zzso of zzso signaling zzso and protein expression of its downstream inflammatory zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso might be associated with this zzso effect on zzso signaling zzso which was independent of its zzso zzso
