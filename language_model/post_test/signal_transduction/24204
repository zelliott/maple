In the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso metamorphosis of zzso or zzso buds to zzso is triggered by specific external cues which are transmitted inside the zzso or bud where internal signals finally coordinate the initiation of zzso This study deals with an zzso metamorphosis zzso present in zzso and buds of zzso The zzso cue is localized in the zzso part of the buds and can be characterized as a zzso with an apparent molecular weight of about 7,000 zzso Further zzso was performed via reversed phase zzso on a zzso zzso Additional inhibitor zzso revealed that protein zzso C and zzso zzso two known elements of the zzso signal zzso cascade in zzso may act downstream of the zzso inducing zzso
