When asthma is zzso zzso inflammation and airway zzso are established in the zzso airways and can no longer be separated as cause and effect because both processes contribute to persistence and progression of disease, despite zzso zzso zzso cells are continually active in the zzso even when disease is zzso zzso is the key zzso zzso in asthma and stimulates airway zzso through the action of zzso zzso on zzso and promotes zzso damage, zzso production, and zzso The production of zzso and other zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso the inflammatory zzso zzso is amplified by local responses of the zzso smooth muscle, and zzso through the production of zzso zzso and zzso Injured cells produce zzso that enhances zzso zzso We review human and animal data detailing the cellular and molecular interactions in established allergic asthma that promote persistent disease, amplify zzso and, in turn, cause disease zzso
