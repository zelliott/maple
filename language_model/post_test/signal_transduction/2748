Studies of the mechanisms by which signals are transmitted from zzso zzso zzso would be facilitated by a way of monitoring events at the zzso zzso We have explored how zzso imaging can be used to examine the role of specific zzso pathways in zzso gene zzso The analysis of zzso expression in single cells has previously been hampered by the zzso of existing zzso and the lack of a way of monitoring zzso and zzso more than one promoter within the same zzso We have developed a technique for examining the dynamics of zzso zzso zzso in single living cells, and have explored the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso gene expression were examined in single living cells with a zzso zzso zzso The technique involved the zzso of zzso and zzso reporter plasmids directly into the cell nucleus, and the subsequent analysis of zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The method is quantitative and allows zzso gene expression to be monitored in real zzso We found that insulin promoted a substantial increase in the expression of a zzso gene under the control of the zzso site from the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso under the control of a zzso promoter, was unaffected by zzso The effect of insulin on zzso expression was specifically blocked by zzso of either the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso coupled with zzso imaging allows zzso gene expression from relatively weak promoters to be monitored in single living zzso We have used this method to demonstrate that zzso zzso plays a central role in the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso gene zzso
