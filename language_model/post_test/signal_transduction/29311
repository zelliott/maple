zzso zzso tissue zzso development requires interaction with the zzso zzso Because zzso secondary zzso tissue development is driven by positive feedback interactions between B cells and zzso cells, we used in zzso zzso to determine whether zzso zzso influence such interactions during rabbit appendix zzso The features of positive feedback interactions we examined zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso and zzso zzso increased during early zzso development, but stalled in the absence of zzso zzso These features were zzso by zzso that zzso zzso development and zzso B cell zzso Our results suggest that rabbit appendix zzso develop in two zzso an initial phase of B cell recruitment to nascent zzso possibly through positive feedback zzso and a subsequent phase of zzso B cell proliferation zzso by zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso stimulate appendix zzso zzso expression and T cell area zzso
