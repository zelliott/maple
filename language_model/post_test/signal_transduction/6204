zzso agents can act as both zzso and zzso for cell zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and use it as a zzso and zzso regulator of cell zzso To gain a zzso insight into zzso control of zzso zzso we determined types of zzso zzso receptors and signaling pathways regulating zzso zzso and zzso using respective modifications of the zzso gel zzso outgrowth zzso Random migration of zzso was significantly zzso inhibited by zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso as well as by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and knockout mice demonstrated pivotal role for the zzso channel in zzso zzso zzso Signaling pathways downstream of zzso included zzso of the zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was most pronounced towards the concentration zzso of zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso diminished zzso zzso further suggesting a central role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was confirmed in experiments with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso II, conventional zzso of zzso C, zzso and engagement of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the leading edge of zzso upon exposure to a zzso preceded zzso shape formation and directional zzso Application of high-resolution zzso zzso demonstrated that, on the cell membrane of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The obtained results demonstrate for the first time that zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors regulate zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and identify signaling pathways zzso these functions, which has clinical implications for wound healing and control of cancer zzso
