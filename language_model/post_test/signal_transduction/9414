To investigate whether zzso zzso abnormalities occur in vessels from rats with zzso arthritis zzso and to determine whether the zzso of zzso which zzso regulates zzso oxide zzso zzso by competing for the same zzso zzso contributes to zzso dysfunction in zzso 

We performed vascular zzso experiments on zzso zzso rings from zzso rats and control rats, and we investigated the response of rings to zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso relaxation was evaluated in the presence (or not in the zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using a zzso method, and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by Western zzso 

zzso zzso was significantly impaired in zzso rats, while the responses to zzso and to zzso did not differ from those in control zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso to a lesser extent in zzso rats than in control zzso zzso of zzso rings with zzso enhanced the vascular response to zzso in zzso rats and reversed the effects of zzso Compared with control rats, zzso rats exhibited increased vascular expression of zzso II (by zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as increased zzso activity (by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was zzso Finally, zzso activity and expression correlated positively with arthritis zzso 

Our results are consistent with the notion that zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso They suggest that zzso might be an attractive new target for treating zzso dysfunction in zzso
