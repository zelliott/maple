zzso electrical stimulation of zzso evokes a zzso zzso fast calcium zzso during the zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso slow calcium signal few seconds after stimulus zzso zzso calcium channels zzso zzso zzso zzso acting as zzso sensors activate an unknown signaling zzso involved in zzso C zzso We demonstrated that both G protein and zzso zzso were activated by electrical zzso and both the zzso zzso rise and slow calcium signal induced by electrical stimulation were blocked by zzso zzso by a zzso scavenger zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso gamma zzso showed a clear location in zzso within the zzso consistent with a position near the I band region of the zzso The time course of zzso zzso zzso monitored in single living cells using a zzso zzso domain fused to green fluorescent zzso was compatible with sequential zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of a dominant negative form of zzso zzso gamma inhibited the zzso zzso activity as well as the slow calcium zzso We conclude that zzso zzso gamma signaling zzso is involved in zzso C zzso and the generation of the slow calcium signal induced by zzso zzso We zzso that membrane potential fluctuations in skeletal muscle cells can activate a zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso toward zzso of long term, zzso plastic zzso
