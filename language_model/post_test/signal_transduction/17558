zzso free calcium zzso was measured in single cells of a zzso zzso zzso subjected to defined zzso zzso medium containing zzso zzso zzso was used to study the influence of flow forces upon zzso zzso as zzso via the zzso zzso responses were highly sensitive to the fluid motion at the cell surface; consecutive small increases of flow zzso large zzso zzso with the levels returning to baseline at the new flow rate within 250 zzso The characteristics of zzso zzso were also influenced by decreasing zzso Since potent zzso at the zzso cell surface rapidly degrade zzso we zzso that a combination of flow and zzso zzso regulates the mass transport of zzso in the boundary zzso The hypothesis predicts that step increases of flow exceed the capacity of the zzso and allow zzso to reach the zzso zzso were conducted to compare zzso and zzso beta zzso a zzso zzso analog that resists degradation by surface zzso and calculations of zzso mass transport to the cell surface were compared to estimates of surface clearance zzso zzso of mass transport zzso for zzso in the boundary layer demonstrated that changes of flow which zzso a prominent zzso response represented zzso changes in the mass transport of zzso from the bulk zzso When zzso mass transport zzso for zzso under various flow conditions were compared with the estimated rate constant for surface degradation of zzso ratios close to unity were zzso These results suggest that both boundary layer mass transport and zzso clearance rates can be zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso The experiments provide evidence for differential signal zzso responses in the zzso driven by diffusion zzso zzso from both the blood and the vessel zzso which are likely to vary widely in the complex flow fields encountered in zzso
