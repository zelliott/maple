The exchange of information between cells represents an important regulatory mechanism for cellular zzso Such regulation processes mainly occur by zzso compounds, unable to penetrate the cell zzso zzso such signals have to be transmitted into the cell that is performed by zzso zzso The widespread group of zzso coupled receptors plays a decisive role in zzso signal recognition and transition into cellular zzso The importance of this interaction is evidently shown by the severe diseases that correlate with dysfunction of the interaction between zzso and zzso coupled zzso The development of drugs against these diseases needs the comprehension of signal recognition and transition as well as the understanding of zzso signal zzso In this review, we describe concepts and methods to identify the zzso relationships of zzso coupled zzso receptors and their successful zzso zzso we provide an insight into zzso based drug zzso Examples are taken from the field of zzso zzso and growth hormone zzso zzso zzso
