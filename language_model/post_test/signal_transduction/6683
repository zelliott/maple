We have shown differences in regulation of zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso and peripheral zzso After zzso stimulation of peripheral blood, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed with similar zzso peak expression occurred after four hours and subsequently declined over 48 zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed later, with peak expression occurring after eight hours of stimulation and no zzso zzso after 40 zzso of zzso The intensity of the zzso zzso signal and the amount of zzso zzso was much greater in zzso from peripheral blood than in zzso and zzso and correlated with the percentage of zzso in zzso from each zzso zzso zzso expression differed in all three zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso with a major peak at eight hours and a minor peak at 24 zzso after zzso The zzso of zzso were not due to effects of mixed cell zzso The same zzso peak was observed in zzso zzso T zzso and the minor 24-hr peak was dependent on zzso zzso synthesis by cells expressing high amounts of zzso 1 zzso zzso on their surface and which lacked the zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not express zzso zzso when zzso with a number of zzso and only exhibited zzso zzso expression when zzso with the combination of zzso and zzso or zzso Thus, zzso zzso has markedly different zzso and intensity of expression in zzso peripheral blood, and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
