zzso zzso the zzso of zzso bacteria, is capable of zzso a wide variety of zzso effects, including zzso zzso tissue injury and zzso in both humans and zzso It is also a potent stimulant to initiate the zzso differentiation and zzso of B zzso and zzso resulting in changes of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and enhancement of immune zzso However, little is known about its effect on the induction of zzso in zzso In the present study, the zzso from zzso zzso were employed for this zzso The cells were exposed to zzso at various doses for different time zzso By careful zzso characteristic analysis, such as zzso of nuclear zzso fragmentation of zzso DNA and formation of zzso bodies, it provided the first evidence that zzso had zzso effect on fish zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure induced significant increase of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso loss of zzso zzso potential zzso depletion of zzso production, zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso of zzso rather than zzso Each of these observations suggests that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso occurs largely via the zzso zzso zzso This observation was different from the mechanism behind the zzso zzso in zzso zzso that occurs via the zzso zzso zzso Our study suggested the existence of a possible novel role in the zzso of zzso bacterial infection in fish and even in zzso which may contribute to the therapy of bacterial zzso Also, it will help to gain more insights into the mechanisms of septic shock and of zzso zzso and zzso
