We investigated the effects of zzso on zzso premature zzso in primary human zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso for 2 h resulted in premature zzso with characteristic increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 days later and no changes in zzso or zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was preceded by increases in both zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso (6 zzso and the abundance of the zzso inhibitor zzso (16 zzso zzso with zzso or zzso both of which activated zzso prevented the zzso increases in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso diminished the increase in zzso zzso The decreases in zzso expression induced by zzso and zzso were prevented by the pharmacological zzso inhibitor zzso C, expression of a zzso or zzso zzso with zzso Likewise, both zzso of zzso and expression of zzso were sufficient to induce zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso As reported by others, we found that zzso zzso by itself increased zzso zzso at zzso in embryonic zzso zzso whereas under the same conditions it decreased zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso cells, and human zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that zzso at low zzso causes premature zzso in human zzso by zzso zzso signaling and that these effects can be prevented by acute zzso zzso and enhanced by zzso zzso They also suggest that this action of zzso may be cell or zzso
