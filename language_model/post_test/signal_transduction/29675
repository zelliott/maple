zzso of survival, expansion, and differentiation of zzso zzso requires the zzso activity of signaling pathways induced by zzso zzso and stem cell factor zzso In addition to qualitative regulation of signaling zzso quantitative control may be essential to control appropriate cell numbers in peripheral zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to associate with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso results in reduced and delayed zzso of the zzso zzso and downstream signaling molecules such as zzso and zzso as well as in decreased responsiveness to zzso As a result, expansion of zzso zzso lacking zzso is impaired at limiting zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and that lack of zzso results in increased sensitivity to zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso is a novel, quantitative regulator of zzso expansion and survival in zzso
