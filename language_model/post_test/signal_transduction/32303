zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a virulent pathogen that zzso rapid host zzso Here we observed that host survival after infection with zzso zzso was enhanced in the absence of type I zzso zzso with improved survival of mice deficient in the zzso for type I zzso zzso zzso that was attributed to zzso Although there was no impairment in zzso expression or zzso zzso in zzso zzso they were highly resistant to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso prevented the death of zzso zzso which indicated that zzso was a mechanism of cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso which cannot undergo zzso had similarly less death and enhanced control of zzso zzso in zzso Thus, we propose that zzso zzso zzso the production of type I zzso which drives zzso of zzso and allows them to evade the immune zzso
