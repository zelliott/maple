The zzso zzso zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso regulated zzso pathways and are therefore potential targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases including diabetes and zzso In this study we describe the identification of three series of chemically distinct zzso zzso In addition, we report a novel zzso zzso protein with five zzso in or near its zzso site, which was used to determine the binding mode of two of the three inhibitor series, and provided a robust system to aid the zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We show that the resulting zzso zzso is a potent and zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso which blocks the zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso negative zzso human zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso activity and thus provides a useful tool compound to investigate the function of zzso zzso
