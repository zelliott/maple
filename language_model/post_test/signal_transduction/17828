In this study, we show that zzso required for zzso zzso responses is zzso different from that needed for systemic responses, including serum zzso Following oral zzso with zzso toxin zzso zzso we found that whereas zzso transgenic mice largely failed to respond, zzso mice developed near normal gut zzso zzso responses but poor serum zzso zzso The local zzso response was functional in that strong zzso protection developed in zzso zzso zzso This was in spite of the fact that no zzso centers zzso were observed in the zzso patches, zzso or other peripheral zzso zzso Moreover, significant zzso zzso was found in isolated zzso plasma cells from gut zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus, differentiation to functional gut zzso zzso responses against T zzso zzso does not require signaling through zzso and can be independent of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso By contrast, serum zzso responses, similar to zzso are dependent on zzso and zzso However, both local and systemic responses are impaired in zzso transgenic mice, indicating that zzso zzso responses are dependent on the zzso zzso but require signaling via zzso or more likely a third related zzso zzso zzso cell interactions leading to zzso as opposed to serum zzso responses are uniquely regulated and appear to represent separate zzso Although CT is known to strongly zzso zzso we have demonstrated that it acts as a potent zzso zzso in the absence of zzso suggesting that alternative zzso pathways are zzso
