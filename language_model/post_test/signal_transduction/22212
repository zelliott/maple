zzso zzso cells normally exist as individual zzso but will enter a period of zzso development upon zzso The initial stages of development involve the zzso of individual cells, using zzso as a zzso zzso is initiated when zzso binds to its zzso zzso and activates the associated G zzso zzso However, zzso will not occur unless there is a high density of starving cells present, as measured by high levels of the zzso zzso sensing zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that cells lacking zzso bypass the need for zzso and can zzso at low cell density, whereas cells zzso zzso do not zzso even at high cell zzso Here, we found that zzso controlled both zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso was also required by zzso to regulate G protein zzso Specifically, zzso used zzso to regulate the zzso of zzso from zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso we found that along with zzso zzso increased the zzso of the G zzso In fact, zzso zzso the zzso induced by zzso This zzso was lost in cells lacking zzso zzso appears to mediate the zzso signal through the production of zzso acid, as zzso added zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso D activity is required for zzso to alter the zzso of zzso G protein zzso
