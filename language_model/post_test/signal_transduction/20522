zzso is a member of the zzso family that is implicated as a promoter of the tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso form membrane complexes with zzso In the present study, we constructed a zzso zzso to assess the roles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the effects of zzso complexes on the zzso migration and invasion of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso plasmids were constructed and used to zzso zzso zzso cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso the expression of zzso was determined by western zzso A cell proliferation zzso was performed using the cell counting zzso zzso method, cell migration was assessed by a cell zzso zzso and cell invasion was evaluated in zzso chambers using zzso as the zzso zzso The potential involvement of various signaling pathways was explored using relevant zzso The association between zzso and zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso We found that zzso promoted cell zzso migration and zzso and increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso had reduced cellular zzso migration and invasion compared with the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso the association between zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso forms complexes by interacting with zzso particularly zzso and zzso and thereby affects the functioning of the zzso zzso The mechanism is possibly related to the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso
