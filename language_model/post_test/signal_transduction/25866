The infrequently feeding Burmese python zzso zzso experiences significant and rapid zzso cardiac zzso followed by zzso as zzso is zzso To begin to explore the molecular mechanisms of this response, we have zzso and assembled the zzso and zzso Burmese python heart zzso with zzso technology using the chicken zzso zzso zzso as a zzso In addition, we have used zzso analysis to identify differences in the expression of biological processes and signaling pathways between zzso 1 day zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso Out of a combined zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso Genes showing differential expression at 1 zzso compared with zzso were enriched for biological processes involved in metabolism and zzso while genes showing differential expression at 3 zzso compared with zzso were enriched for processes involved in zzso structural zzso and zzso Moreover, we present evidence for the zzso of zzso and not pathological signaling pathways in this zzso novel model of cardiac growth in zzso Together, our data provide the first comprehensive gene expression profile for a zzso zzso
