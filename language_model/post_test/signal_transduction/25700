We have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso signaling by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso is necessary for proliferation of smooth muscle cells zzso and contributes to zzso zzso following vascular zzso 

Studies were performed in zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso each caused zzso of both zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation of zzso zzso Whereas responses to zzso were preserved in zzso zzso the responses to zzso were markedly zzso These defects zzso following gene transfer of zzso zzso injury increased vascular zzso zzso and compared with zzso mice, zzso mice exhibited a reduction in zzso area of the carotid artery 28 days after zzso 

zzso is necessary for the zzso of zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso markedly reduces zzso zzso following vascular zzso In view of our previous findings, this observation is consistent with a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as a novel target for the prevention of inflammatory and zzso vascular zzso
