zzso approaches have promised to organize collections of functional zzso data into testable predictions of gene and protein involvement in biological processes and zzso However, few such predictions have been zzso validated on a large scale, leaving many zzso methods unproven and zzso in the biology zzso Further, it remains unclear what biological concerns should be taken into account when using zzso methods to drive real-world experimental zzso To investigate these concerns and to establish the utility of zzso predictions of gene function, we zzso tested hundreds of predictions generated from an ensemble of three complementary methods for the process of zzso organization and zzso in zzso zzso The biological data with respect to the zzso are presented in a companion manuscript published in PLoS zzso zzso Here we analyze and explore the results of this study that are broadly zzso for zzso applying gene function prediction techniques, including a new experimental comparison with 48 genes representing the zzso zzso Our study leads to several conclusions that are important to consider when driving laboratory investigations using zzso prediction zzso While most genes in zzso are already known to participate in at least one biological process, we confirm that genes with known functions can still be strong candidates for zzso of additional gene zzso We find that different analysis techniques and different underlying data can both greatly affect the types of functional predictions produced by zzso zzso This diversity allows an ensemble of techniques to substantially broaden the biological scope and breadth of zzso We also find that performing prediction and validation steps zzso allows us to more completely characterize a biological area of zzso While this study focused on a specific functional area in zzso many of these observations may be useful in the contexts of other processes and zzso
