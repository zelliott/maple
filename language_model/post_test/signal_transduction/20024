We engineered an zzso zzso zzso to regulate stem cell fate and applied it to maintain mouse embryonic stem zzso cell zzso In the zzso environment formed using zzso scaffolds in which specific zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso by zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso no longer acted as a limiting factor for stem cell zzso Instead, simultaneous stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso scaffold greatly increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso which resulted in prolonged zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso cells exposed to the combined stimulation of the zzso for 4 zzso in zzso zzso scaffolds maintained the zzso zzso of cell colonies without losing any activity of zzso In conclusion, cell zzso zzso signaling within the zzso environment supported mouse zzso cell zzso and the resulting zzso signaling replaced zzso with zzso and zzso zzso as critical signals for mouse zzso cell zzso
