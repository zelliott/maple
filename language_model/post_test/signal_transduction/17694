The lung contains two distinct forms of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is activated through fatty zzso zzso to the zzso zzso where it converts zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and neutral zzso zzso is zzso dependent and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral protein localized to the plasma zzso Because zzso degrades zzso zzso and zzso in addition to PA and zzso it has been renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso independent and zzso zzso zzso This review describes zzso zzso found in the lung and their location in signaling platforms zzso Pulmonary zzso likely function in the zzso D pathway, thereby controlling zzso zzso Through lowering the levels of zzso and zzso which serve as zzso for zzso differentiation gene zzso zzso regulate cell division, zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity could also influence zzso of zzso type II to type I zzso It is considered likely that these zzso zzso have critical roles in lung zzso and in acute lung injury and zzso
