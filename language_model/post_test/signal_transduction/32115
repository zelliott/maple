zzso of the nuclear zzso is a key step during open zzso in higher zzso The activity of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso 1) and protein zzso C zzso has been shown to trigger zzso zzso zzso yet their precise contributions are zzso In this study, we develop a quantitative imaging zzso to study zzso zzso B1 zzso in living zzso We find that zzso and zzso act in concert to mediate zzso zzso B1 zzso during zzso Using zzso acid interference zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso steps of zzso zzso zzso depletion or chemical zzso of zzso zzso that produce zzso delayed zzso zzso to a similar extent as does zzso zzso Furthermore, the delay of zzso B1 zzso after zzso depletion could be rescued by the addition of zzso These findings suggest that zzso activate a zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and provide evidence for a zzso zzso signaling zzso
