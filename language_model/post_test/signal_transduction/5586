The zzso of B cells zzso long-lasting protection from a plethora of infectious diseases through the generation of plasma cells that produce zzso zzso and memory zzso zzso of the B cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso are now considered the zzso forms that initiate B cell zzso in zzso We have shown that upon recognition of zzso on the surface of a presenting cell, the B cell zzso a dramatic change in zzso characterized by rapid spreading followed by more prolonged contraction along the presenting zzso This zzso response increases the amount of zzso that the B cell zzso zzso and subsequently presents to T zzso Thus, the spreading and contraction response shapes the outcome of B cell zzso We used a combination of zzso zzso zzso and total internal reflection zzso zzso to investigate the early events that occur after engagement of the zzso and before B cell zzso We observed the rapid formation of zzso zzso which we redefine as zzso because they mediate the coordinated recruitment of zzso zzso such as the zzso Lyn and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified an essential role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and thus B cell zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the cellular zzso changes described in zzso are likely to occur upon recognition of zzso presented on the surface of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso
