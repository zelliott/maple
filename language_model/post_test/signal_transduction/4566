The aim of this study is to determine zzso effect of zzso II zzso from the root of zzso zzso zzso on human acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso 

zzso II blocked the growth zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso In this zzso process, this herb compound rendered the cells susceptible to zzso zzso by enhanced zzso of zzso cell population and increased the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso II was able to activate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso cells, were zzso by zzso zzso In addition, zzso II could inhibit zzso zzso and function and subsequently suppress the zzso of zzso activated zzso 2 zzso the upstream zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso II also enhanced the expression of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the addition of sodium zzso (a zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso positive zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso using its specific zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso II in zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrated that via targeting zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso cells to zzso and perhaps serves as a potent zzso agent for zzso
