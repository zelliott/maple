There is increasing interest in the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso on cardiovascular zzso Their chemical structures are similar, although zzso aromatic zzso contain no chlorine as does zzso The zzso mechanism of their action is mainly zzso by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso In addition, zzso stress also plays a role in the biological and toxic effects of these zzso In this study, we used an zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate its effect on the proliferation and zzso of human zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso suppressed DNA synthesis of human zzso vascular zzso cells as determined by zzso incorporation in a zzso fashion and arrested cells at the zzso phase of the cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso of DNA synthesis by zzso was eliminated to a greater extent by zzso hydrocarbon zzso antagonists, zzso zzso and 1 zzso and zzso (5 and 10 zzso than by the zzso zzso (5 and 10 zzso Cell zzso zzso and tube formation in human zzso vascular zzso cells exposed to zzso decreased in zzso zzso We also demonstrated that cell zzso signaling zzso focal zzso zzso zzso decreased upon zzso treatment, suggesting that cell zzso inhibited by zzso might be due to zzso of cell zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso ameliorated the effects of zzso on cell zzso zzso and tube formation, indicating the involvement of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso in zzso The results suggest that the adverse effects of zzso are mainly zzso by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso and not via increased zzso zzso
