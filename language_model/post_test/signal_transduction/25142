The gene zzso zzso is originally expressed zzso in the wing zzso disc but, during development, its activity is restricted to the cells that form the zzso and the zzso where the wing blade zzso to the zzso and eliminated in the wing pouch, which forms the wing zzso We show that zzso repression in the wing zzso is a prerequisite for wing zzso forcing zzso expression prevents growth of the wing zzso Both the zzso and the zzso pathways are involved in zzso zzso zzso unable to process the zzso zzso thick veins or Mothers against zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso signal express zzso in the wing zzso We have identified vestigial zzso as a zzso and zzso response factor that is involved in zzso zzso In contrast to its zzso role in the wing pouch, zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso We have also identified the gene zzso zzso as a positive regulator of zzso in the zzso zzso plays a role specifying hinge structures, possibly in zzso with zzso
