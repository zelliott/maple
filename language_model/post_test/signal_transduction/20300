Recent studies have suggested zzso zzso as a new natural therapeutic agent to treat type 2 diabetes and zzso insulin zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso could reverse zzso insulin resistance in human primary muscle zzso 

zzso obtained from six healthy men (54 zzso 3 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated for 4 h with 100 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso with or without 100 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso activity were zzso 

zzso did not reverse zzso impairment of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in human skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso completely blocked the activity of zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso stress was increased in response to zzso as indicated by increased zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso binding protein zzso protein zzso 

Acute exposure to zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso metabolism in human zzso
