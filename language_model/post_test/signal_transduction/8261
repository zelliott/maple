Human red cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) is an zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso spans zzso Previous work using zzso zzso has shown that two zzso fragments of zzso lacking zzso 6 and 7 are capable of forming a zzso zzso zzso pathway, reminiscent of intact zzso In the present study, we create a single zzso zzso zzso representing the intact protein lacking zzso 6 and zzso We expressed this construct in zzso zzso and evaluated it employing a combination of zzso zzso clamp and zzso zzso We found that, whereas zzso 7) has some zzso zzso exchange activity, the protein also forms a novel zzso zzso that is blocked by zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site of zzso reduced the zzso sensitivity, demonstrating that zzso the zzso zzso is intrinsic to zzso 7) and zzso the zzso zzso has some zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso has an zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso It may also have a limited zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso Although this zzso zzso is not a usual feature of intact zzso zzso it shares many properties with the zzso pathways intrinsic to two other zzso zzso trout zzso and zzso zzso
