We showed previously that activated zzso but not zzso causes transformation of zzso zzso cells, demonstrating the importance of zzso pathways in zzso Ras zzso To assess the mechanism by which zzso zzso signaling pathways contribute to zzso zzso we recently zzso zzso difference analysis to identify genes expressed in a zzso fashion by activated Ras but not zzso One gene identified in these analyses encodes for zzso zzso we evaluated the mechanism by which Ras causes the zzso of zzso zzso By using zzso cells that harbor zzso expression of activated zzso we determined that the zzso of zzso expression correlated with the onset of zzso zzso We found that the reversal of Ras transformation caused by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponded to a restoration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso cells caused both zzso transformation and loss of zzso zzso Thus, a reduction in zzso expression correlated strictly with zzso transformation of zzso zzso However, forced zzso of zzso in zzso cells did not reverse zzso or growth zzso a finding consistent with the possibility that multiple changes in gene expression contribute to Ras zzso We also determined that zzso expression was low in two human tumor cell lines, zzso and zzso that harbor zzso zzso zzso of zzso but high in zzso zzso cell lines in which the zzso zzso zzso has been genetically zzso Finally, treatment with zzso restored zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggesting a role for DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso
