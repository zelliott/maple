To search for zzso zzso that may have preferential binding affinity for human zzso zzso zzso alpha or beta zzso and also to gain insights into the structural zzso favoring differential zzso zzso we studied the binding affinities of 74 natural or synthetic zzso including more than 50 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for human zzso alpha and zzso zzso Many of the zzso zzso zzso retained varying degrees of similar binding affinity for zzso alpha and zzso zzso but some of them retained differential binding affinity for the two zzso For instance, several of the zzso zzso such as 16 zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso and zzso had distinct preferential binding affinity for human zzso beta over zzso alpha zzso up to zzso zzso although zzso has nearly the highest and equal binding affinity for zzso alpha and zzso zzso E1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso woman) have preferential binding affinity for zzso alpha over zzso zzso whereas 16 zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed during zzso have preferential binding affinity for zzso beta over zzso zzso zzso facile zzso conversion of parent hormone zzso to various zzso under different zzso conditions may serve unique functions by providing differential zzso of the zzso alpha or zzso beta signaling zzso Lastly, our zzso three-dimensional quantitative zzso zzso molecular field analysis of 47 zzso zzso zzso for human zzso alpha and zzso beta yielded useful information on the structural features that determine the preferential zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso which may aid in the rational design of selective zzso for each human zzso zzso
