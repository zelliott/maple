zzso are dynamic zzso that frequently change their number, size, shape, and distribution in response to zzso and zzso zzso After proliferated from pre-existing ones, fresh zzso enter constant cycles of zzso and fusion that organize them into two distinct states - zzso zzso and zzso zzso When compromised with various injuries, solitary zzso are subjected to zzso zzso This clearance zzso relies on zzso a zzso process that plays key roles in zzso cell zzso Recent studies reveal that defects in zzso degradation selective for zzso zzso are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the zzso relevance to cellular zzso 

Here we review recent progress regarding a link between zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In particular, fundamental principles underlying zzso and zzso quality control are zzso zzso evidence also implicates zzso zzso in the management of zzso zzso zzso zzso are suggested to serve as signaling platforms vital for regulating zzso These zzso relationships are likely to coordinate zzso plasticity in the zzso 

zzso and zzso are elaborately linked zzso elements that act in response to changes in cellular environment such as energy, zzso and zzso How cells integrate these double zzso systems still remains zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso seems to be zzso zzso zzso in one of these elements could simultaneously impair the other, resulting in risk increments for various human zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso of zzso
