A main shortcoming of using zzso cells as a model of zzso differentiation is that some cells in the zzso population undergo zzso To address this issue, we have identified which zzso proteins are involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were induced specifically to undergo zzso with 68 zzso zzso and to undergo zzso differentiation with 1 zzso zzso acid zzso The corresponding two-dimensional zzso maps of zzso proteins from treated cells were zzso In the 8 h zzso zzso cell population, zzso of the cells were zzso In the 120 h zzso cells, 50% of the cells were zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso proteins were found in both the 8 h zzso and the 120 h zzso cells, but not in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso analyses suggested that some of the proteins may be involved in signal zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso others in cell zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a third group in cell zzso organization and zzso cycling zzso zzso An understanding of signal zzso in zzso initiation by screening for zzso proteins associated with zzso may provide new targets for the treatment of zzso
