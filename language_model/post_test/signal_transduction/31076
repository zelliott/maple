zzso leads to zzso modification and damage of zzso in the respiratory tract with loss of biological zzso Given the lack of zzso gene induction with acute exposure to zzso zzso we hypothesized that clearance pathways for zzso modified proteins may be induced and serve in the immediate cellular response to preserve the zzso zzso To test this, airway zzso cells were obtained from individuals under ambient oxygen conditions and after breathing zzso oxygen for 12 zzso Gene expression profiling identified induction of genes in the zzso and zzso pathways that together comprise an integrated cellular response to manage and degrade damaged zzso zzso also revealed gene expression changes associated with zzso function, cell cycle regulation, and zzso zzso Increased zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso were validated in cells exposed to zzso in zzso zzso of zzso degradation revealed the importance of accelerated protein zzso for energy production of cells exposed to zzso Thus, the human airway early response to zzso relies predominantly upon induction of zzso zzso and the zzso protein degradation system to maintain airway zzso zzso
