The zzso zzso cells zzso derived from zzso bulb zzso may improve motor function after transplantation in injured spinal zzso However, the effects of zzso transplantation on sensory function have not been reported zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate whether zzso transplantation could affect the sensory function and to analyze the underlying zzso 

zzso transplantation into the zzso spinal cords can result in zzso indicated by radiant and mechanical stimuli towards the zzso surface in zzso This could be associated with zzso of Brain zzso zzso Factor zzso indicated by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was mainly located in the zzso of the zzso I and II of the zzso zzso Moreover, a notable zzso on the level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the downstream zzso of zzso was detected by using Western zzso These findings indicate that the increased zzso level associated with the zzso was possibly involved in zzso pain in zzso spinal zzso subjected to zzso zzso 

The transplantation of zzso may induce the noticeable pain hypersensitivity in rats after zzso spinal zzso injury, and the possible mechanism may be associated with the zzso of zzso and the activated zzso zzso
