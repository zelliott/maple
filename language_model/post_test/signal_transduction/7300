Vitamin zzso zzso generated in response to vascular injury and infection enable zzso zzso formation, but also trigger distinct zzso signaling pathways on zzso zzso Factor zzso a zzso crucial for blood zzso also zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Factor zzso can bind both zzso and zzso but whether factor zzso signaling stimulates or suppresses zzso cell zzso production in response to zzso zzso zzso is not zzso In this study, exposure to factor zzso significantly impaired zzso zzso production from zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Furthermore, factor zzso inhibited nuclear zzso B zzso in zzso reporter cells, requiring zzso zzso activity for its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid domain zzso and a zzso mimic of the factor zzso zzso growth zzso region prevented factor zzso zzso of zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso In addition, factor zzso zzso activity was markedly attenuated by the presence of an zzso of zzso zzso 2, but not zzso zzso zzso The key role of zzso zzso 2 in zzso factor zzso zzso signaling on zzso was further underscored by the inability of factor zzso to mediate zzso of tumor necrosis zzso and zzso release from zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show for the first time that, in addition to zzso zzso 2, factor zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso the findings of this study support a novel function for factor zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso
