zzso zzso zzso is a severe and frequent blinding disease in horses which presents with zzso invading zzso resulting in the destruction of the inner zzso zzso of inflammatory cells into the zzso and zzso is driven by currently unknown guidance cues, however surgical removal of the zzso zzso has proven zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso samples are likely to result in detection of proteins contributing to disease zzso zzso from healthy and zzso diseased horses were directly compared by quantitative mass zzso based on zzso zzso of peak zzso across zzso We found a significant zzso of complement and zzso zzso and zzso of negative zzso regulators of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso both proteins are expressed in zzso zzso and suggest zzso to retinal zzso zzso cells zzso which may be the source cells for these zzso Furthermore, retinal expression levels and patterns of zzso change in response to zzso Since many other regulated proteins identified here are associated with zzso cells, these cells qualify as the prime zzso to zzso zzso
