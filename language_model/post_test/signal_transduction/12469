One of the most striking aspects of plant diversity is variation in leaf zzso Much of this diversity is achieved by the zzso of leaf blade dissection to form zzso or zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso is a crucial signal regulating the zzso outgrowth necessary to develop a dissected zzso In developing leaves, the zzso distribution of zzso driven by active zzso zzso the initiation of zzso and leaflets and specifies differential zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso members of the zzso acid zzso gene family mediate the action of zzso in determining leaf shape by zzso outgrowth in areas of low zzso concentration during both simple and compound leaf zzso These results provide molecular evidence that leaflets initiate in a process reminiscent of zzso at the shoot zzso zzso but that compound and simple leaves regulate marginal growth through an zzso zzso zzso thus shedding light on the zzso of compound and simple zzso
