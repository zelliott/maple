The generation of cellular diversity in the nervous system involves the mechanism of zzso cell zzso Besides an array of zzso including the Par protein zzso a zzso G protein zzso complex, zzso plays a major role in controlling zzso cell division, which ultimately leads to differential zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and correct zzso of the two daughter zzso In this context, zzso is required to be active in one sibling and inactive in the zzso Here, we investigated the requirement of genes previously known to play key roles in sibling cell fate zzso such as members of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso Delta zzso and zzso zzso and a crucial regulator of zzso cell division, zzso zzso throughout lineage progression of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell fate zzso defects were zzso and were observed in all zzso lineages even in cells born from late zzso mother cells zzso within the zzso We also show that zzso functions zzso during zzso lineage progression and zzso cells do not require zzso from within the zzso This suggests that within a zzso lineage zzso is zzso for sibling cell fate zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that zzso is involved in sibling cell fate zzso in the central nervous zzso It is zzso required in the same zzso cells which also depend on zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is required to facilitate a functional zzso signal in the zzso cell for correct cell fate zzso Finally, we show that three zzso lineages zzso zzso and zzso require zzso function for sibling cell fate zzso in cells born from early zzso whereas zzso is not required in cells born from later zzso of the same zzso Thus, there is differential requirement for zzso for cell fate zzso depending on the stage of lineage progression of zzso
