The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and then zzso zzso activities were determined by zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso were determined by Western zzso The levels of zzso were determined with culture medium by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso which was induced by zzso zzso as well as its target zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in zzso 

zzso are primary sensors that detect a wide variety of microbial components and play an important role in the induction of innate zzso To evaluate the therapeutic potential of zzso we examined its effect on signal zzso via the zzso signaling zzso Our results suggest that beneficial effects of zzso on chronic inflammatory diseases are zzso through zzso of zzso signaling pathways by targeting zzso
