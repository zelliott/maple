The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso receptors are G zzso and have been divided into at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which act through zzso zzso to mobilize zzso zzso and V2 zzso zzso which is coupled to zzso zzso Recently zzso and V2 zzso zzso were zzso These zzso zzso proteins with seven putative zzso zzso and a similar structure to zzso and other G zzso zzso zzso of zzso coding for zzso and V2 receptors was carried out in the rat kidney using a reverse zzso and zzso chain zzso Large signals for zzso zzso zzso product were detected in zzso cortical collecting duct zzso outer zzso collecting duct zzso inner zzso collecting duct zzso and zzso zzso Large signals for V2 zzso zzso product were detected in zzso zzso and zzso 72-hour zzso caused decrease of V2 zzso zzso but no change in zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso These data show that zzso coding for the two zzso zzso zzso are distributed differently along the zzso and zzso vascular system, and that these zzso are regulated differently in response to the dehydrated zzso Recently, two reports of a zzso in the zzso V2 zzso gene in a zzso with zzso zzso diabetes zzso are zzso These studies demonstrated that point zzso of V2 zzso gene causes the zzso diabetes zzso zzso the nature of defective diabetes zzso may ultimately lead to improved zzso
