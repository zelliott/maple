The zzso zzso zzso zzso is prominently expressed during tissue zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth factors and activates zzso signals through its multiple zzso zzso converts zzso transforming growth zzso zzso complexes into their biologically active zzso zzso plays significant roles in zzso regulation, zzso of zzso and induction of zzso Although zzso is a major inhibitor of proliferation in cultured zzso the functional requirement of zzso during liver zzso remains to be defined in zzso We generated a zzso mouse model of a partial zzso zzso and explored zzso zzso progression of liver zzso and zzso signaling during the repair process after zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in suppressing zzso zzso zzso expression was induced in zzso cells zzso as an immediate early gene in response to zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso signaling and accelerated zzso proliferation through zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso induced in zzso by zzso oxygen species zzso modulated zzso signaling and proliferation in zzso in zzso suggesting that the immediately and zzso produced zzso in the zzso liver were the responsible factor for zzso zzso 

We have identified zzso as an zzso element in regulating liver zzso by zzso zzso Our work defines zzso as a novel immediate early gene that could be a potential therapeutic target to accelerate liver zzso
