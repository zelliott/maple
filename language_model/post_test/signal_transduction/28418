zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell function and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are seen in diabetic zzso zzso growth zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso production in the zzso Recent studies demonstrated that some of the effects of high zzso on cellular metabolism are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is converted to zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in zzso cells is zzso by the zzso and that zzso is more potent than zzso in inducing zzso promoter zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the effects of zzso on zzso zzso production occur via zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso rat kidney zzso cells in 25 zzso zzso zzso for 48 h increases cellular zzso and zzso levels about twofold on Western blots compared with low zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso h also increases zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso or zzso with zzso are not zzso The presence of zzso zzso (20 zzso blocks both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels via zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso led to zzso increases in zzso of the zzso responsive element binding zzso zzso These results suggest that the effects of excess zzso on zzso zzso synthesis occur via zzso regulation of zzso
