The zzso zzso zzso has important roles in normal cellular zzso development and zzso Many zzso zzso including sporadic zzso zzso are caused by zzso zzso of the zzso route due to zzso in the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso coli zzso or the zzso zzso ultimately resulting in reduced zzso degradation by the zzso zzso zzso system zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulates the UPS by controlling zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso and the zzso destruction complex cooperate in targeting zzso for degradation by the zzso Together with the zzso that zzso zzso they form a zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso induce the zzso of the zzso and the zzso of zzso Likewise, zzso of the zzso in zzso cells leads to retarded degradation of zzso Additionally, we found that the zzso of the zzso causes accelerated zzso of zzso an essential component of the zzso destruction complex, which is zzso by the UPS as zzso We show here that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso 15 zzso associated with the zzso This is demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso against zzso or by zzso of an zzso zzso which is unable to degrade zzso zzso Thus, the zzso controls the zzso zzso by assisting the assembly of zzso zzso by zzso and, zzso by zzso zzso via zzso zzso The zzso regulates the balance between zzso and zzso Disturbance of this balance can cause cancer by driving cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso A model is provided that proposes a role of zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso and the protection of zzso zzso via zzso zzso
