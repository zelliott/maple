In the last few years, great progress has been made in understanding how zzso interacting zzso 1 zzso a protein containing a calcium sensor that is located in the zzso zzso and zzso a protein that forms a calcium channel in the plasma zzso interact and give rise to zzso calcium zzso zzso depletion of calcium stores leads to the formation of clusters containing zzso and zzso that appear to be sites for calcium zzso Similar zzso are also produced in response to zzso stimuli in immune zzso In T cells engaged with zzso cells, clusters containing zzso and zzso accumulate at the zzso zzso We recently discovered that in activated T cells, zzso and zzso also accumulate in zzso structures opposite the immune zzso at the zzso pole of the zzso Both caps and zzso are zzso stable structures containing zzso and zzso in close zzso The function of zzso as sites of calcium influx is zzso We speculate that the caps may provide a secondary site of calcium zzso zzso they may serve as a source of zzso channel complexes that move to new immune zzso as T cells repeatedly engage zzso zzso
