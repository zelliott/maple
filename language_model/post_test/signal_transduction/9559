zzso zzso zzso characterized by normal zzso hormone levels maintained by elevated zzso zzso zzso patients to health problems as they zzso Some cases arise from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso This resistance might be zzso by zzso zzso with different modes of binding compared with zzso We hypothesized that the recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso with its unique mode of zzso zzso would activate zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso their zzso 

zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso analyzed for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling to establish C2 as a zzso zzso zzso These cells were also zzso with zzso or C2 to characterize each zzso zzso ability to maintain and zzso zzso zzso 

We showed that C2 could activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso and C2 could acutely activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso with C2 caused persistent zzso signaling and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso signal persistence with no zzso zzso in the cases of zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso C2 is a useful pharmacological tool for the study of zzso zzso It revealed that some naturally occurring zzso zzso can mediate induction of zzso zzso upon stimulation with C2 and that this signal is zzso maintained within zzso
