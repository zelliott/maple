zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso from the rat adrenal zzso through zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso mechanisms associated with zzso of zzso receptors in rat zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso formation was significantly reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso markedly attenuated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso type 2 and 4 zzso zzso zzso the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Administration of zzso in the vicinity of cultured zzso cells induced a slowly developing and robust increase in zzso calcium concentration zzso The effect of zzso on zzso was suppressed by zzso a zzso calcium channel zzso zzso studies confirmed that zzso activated a zzso calcium zzso zzso also induced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The sequence of events associated with zzso of zzso receptors was zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso markedly attenuated both the zzso response and the zzso of zzso calcium current induced by zzso In contrast, reduction of the calcium concentration in the incubation medium did not affect zzso induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso toxin abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso but zzso toxin had no zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in rat zzso cells, zzso of native zzso receptors stimulates zzso formation through a zzso zzso which in turn provokes calcium influx through zzso calcium zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and the calcium influx are involved in zzso zzso zzso
