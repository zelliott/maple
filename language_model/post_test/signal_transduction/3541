zzso zzso zzso zzso which is silent in most normal adult zzso and expressed in various zzso tumors, has been identified for zzso zzso of zzso in tumors has been associated with advanced stages and worse patient zzso However, little is known about its role in breast zzso The zzso expression zzso constructed was zzso zzso into the breast cancer cell line zzso The influence of zzso on zzso cells was assessed using zzso zzso flow zzso zzso invasion zzso and in zzso zzso zzso A comparative zzso approach was performed to identify and clarify the underlying molecular zzso zzso expression was more pronounced in zzso breast cancer cells compared with the positive zzso zzso of zzso induced cell growth and prompted cell zzso Both zzso and zzso expression were suppressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven known proteins were identified with significant differential zzso Among these, five were zzso while other six were increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggested zzso may enhance zzso in zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso The regulation of zzso signaling by target proteins of zzso may explain the zzso potential of breast cancer zzso
