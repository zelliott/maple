In this paper, we continue our studies of the previously discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso accumulating in the roots of winter wheat during adaptation to low temperature, Russian Journal of Plant zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso which stimulates the acquisition of freezing tolerance in winter varieties of zzso zzso zzso The transient zzso of zzso in the zzso of winter wheat zzso with the zzso zzso of cell wall zzso during the first hours of cold zzso (2 degrees zzso This finding suggests that the zzso is liberated as a result of the zzso of zzso zzso At low zzso zzso zzso the acquisition of freezing tolerance in winter plants, in a manner similar to zzso even at room zzso The zzso effect of zzso and zzso on the freezing tolerance of winter wheat depends on the sequence of zzso with these two zzso When zzso are zzso with zzso a few hours before treatment with zzso the effect is zzso and its impact depends on the duration of zzso with zzso When zzso is applied first, the zzso effect on freezing tolerance is zzso The results obtained here lead to the conclusion that zzso accumulating during the first hours of cold zzso functions as a partner of zzso during the initiation of freezing tolerance acquisition in winter zzso We zzso that zzso increases cell zzso to zzso zzso
