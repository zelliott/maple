zzso modification of zzso connections is essential for the development of the nervous system and may also zzso learning and memory functions of mature zzso Previous studies have shown an increase in zzso spine density and/or enlargement of spines after the induction of long-term zzso zzso Using zzso zzso imaging of zzso spines in acute zzso slices from zzso rats, we found that the induction of long-term depression zzso by zzso stimulation is accompanied by a marked shrinkage of zzso which can be reversed by subsequent zzso stimulation that zzso zzso The spine shrinkage requires zzso of zzso receptors and zzso similar to that for zzso However, spine shrinkage is zzso by zzso but not by protein zzso 1 zzso which is essential for zzso suggesting that different downstream pathways are involved in spine shrinkage and zzso This zzso spine shrinkage may contribute to zzso elimination of synaptic zzso
