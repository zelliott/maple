zzso acids are important nutrients during fetal development, and the activity of zzso zzso acid zzso is crucial in the regulation of fetal zzso zzso an zzso and zzso hormone, has been proposed to act as a peripheral signal in reproduction in zzso zzso is elevated during pregnancy and elevated further in zzso zzso such as zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso function has not been fully zzso We zzso that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso acid transport by zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso acid zzso specifically system A transport was studied in zzso zzso fragments using the zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso were used to further zzso their role in zzso effects on zzso acid transport zzso Western zzso was performed to identify zzso zzso as a measure of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly increased system A zzso acid zzso activity by zzso after zzso of zzso zzso activated zzso signaling zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso reduction in system A zzso acid zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking zzso produced zzso also decreased system A transport by zzso comparable to zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso stimulates system A by zzso dependent zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our findings support the zzso role of zzso in regulating zzso acid transport in the human zzso
