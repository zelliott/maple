zzso in zzso attachment trigger zzso zzso and delay zzso zzso How zzso attachment is sensed and integrated into the steps of zzso amplification is poorly zzso In a functional zzso screen targeting human zzso and zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso as an important regulator of zzso zzso required for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the checkpoint zzso zzso and promotes enrichment of the checkpoint protein zzso at sites of defective attachment, providing evidence for a regulatory step that precedes the proposed zzso dependent zzso amplification zzso We propose that the dual functions of zzso in regulating zzso dynamics and checkpoint zzso may help to coordinate the establishment and monitoring of correct zzso of zzso thereby protecting zzso stability in human zzso
