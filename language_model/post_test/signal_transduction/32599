zzso zzso are critical regulators of zzso development and zzso zzso and zzso of the mature hormones are regulated by zzso hormone zzso which is itself zzso from the zzso zzso stimulation of zzso expression and zzso occurs through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, which ultimately leads to protein zzso C zzso zzso and increased zzso calcium zzso zzso factors zzso the effects of zzso signals on zzso of zzso genes have not yet been zzso Recent studies have identified key factors involved in zzso hormone beta zzso zzso gene zzso the nuclear zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is specifically enhanced by zzso in agreement with a role for zzso in zzso a zzso effect on zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso and with zzso leading to an enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a likely zzso zzso of zzso signals for zzso of the zzso zzso
