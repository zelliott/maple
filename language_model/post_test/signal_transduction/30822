The availability of the carbon backbone zzso zzso is critical to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso derives from zzso and is formed by zzso zzso zzso To clarify the function of zzso in cellular zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was expressed in potato plants targeting the zzso protein to zzso and to the zzso Both approaches resulted in up to 11 times increased total zzso zzso zzso zzso plants exhibited reduced zzso levels while met and zzso did not accumulate zzso However, the precursor zzso and upstream zzso of met such as zzso and homocysteine did indicating an accelerated carbon flow towards the end zzso zzso plants with elevated zzso levels of zzso exhibited a reduction in transcript levels of the zzso zzso as well as of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and met zzso zzso In all plants, zzso zzso zzso expression remained relatively unchanged from wild type levels, while zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Feeding studies with zzso supplied zzso fostered the synthesis of met and zzso but the regulation of synthesis of both zzso acids retained the wild type regulation zzso The results indicate that excess of zzso zzso zzso activity does not influence the de zzso synthesis of met and zzso However, expression of zzso in the zzso resulted in the zzso of gene expression of zzso genes probably zzso via zzso We integrated these data in a novel working model describing the regulatory mechanism of met and zzso zzso
