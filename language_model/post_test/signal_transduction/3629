zzso acid zzso regulates many aspects of plant development, including seed dormancy and zzso root growth and zzso zzso Plant zzso proteins are zzso of the zzso complex zzso zzso which regulate several zzso zzso pathways through protein zzso However, little is known about zzso proteins participating in zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in delayed seed zzso and hypersensitivity to zzso The opening of zzso guard cells and the zzso of several zzso genes were affected in transgenic zzso In contrast, zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso zzso compared with that in wild zzso zzso or zzso zzso could rescue or partially rescue the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our work demonstrates that zzso is involved in zzso zzso and that zzso genes may positively regulate zzso zzso by zzso protein zzso
