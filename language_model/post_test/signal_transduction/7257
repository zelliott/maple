zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso leads to its interaction with zzso a zzso adapter zzso both signaling through Ras and zzso zzso We used zzso three-dimensional imaging by spinning disk zzso zzso to analyze trafficking of zzso and zzso in living zzso cells zzso with low, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was replaced in these cells by zzso fused to yellow fluorescent protein zzso After transient residence in the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were rapidly zzso and accumulated in zzso zzso image analysis revealed that on average two zzso molecules were zzso with one zzso in cells zzso with 2 zzso zzso and the excess of zzso over zzso was even higher when a zzso concentration of zzso was zzso zzso we zzso that a single zzso zzso can be simultaneously associated with functionally distinct zzso interaction partners during and after zzso Continuous presence of zzso in zzso was also observed when zzso was activated by transforming growth zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso remain zzso occupied and signaling competent, despite the fact that these growth factors are thought to zzso from the zzso at zzso zzso The prolonged zzso and activity of zzso complexes in zzso correlated with the sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2, suggesting that zzso zzso contribute significantly to this signaling zzso We propose that zzso zzso function to extend signaling in time and space to compensate for rapid zzso of surface zzso in cells with low zzso expression zzso
