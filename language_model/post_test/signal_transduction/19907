zzso muscles are the organ of movement, and their growth, zzso and maintenance are dependent in large part on a population of zzso stem cells known as satellite zzso zzso muscles and these resident zzso stem cells zzso satellite zzso are commonly exposed to significant doses of radiation during diagnostic procedures and/or during the zzso management of zzso The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of clinically relevant doses of zzso radiation on satellite cell survival and zzso cell cycle regulation, zzso DNA zzso break repair, zzso stress and NO zzso Overall, our findings demonstrate that doses of zzso radiation zzso zzso reduced satellite cell numbers by at least zzso due in part to elevated zzso and the zzso of cell cycle zzso zzso was also found to cause a significant and persistent increase in the level of zzso oxygen and nitrogen zzso Interestingly, and within this backdrop of elevated zzso stress, similar doses were found to produce substantial reductions in the levels of zzso oxide zzso zzso of satellite cells has been shown to depend in part on the production of zzso and our findings give rise to the possibility that zzso reductions in NO levels may provide a mechanism for the zzso of satellite cell proliferation in zzso and possibly the regrowth of skeletal muscle exposed during clinical zzso zzso
