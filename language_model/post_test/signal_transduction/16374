The adult zzso is composed of several distinct cell types with well defined zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the generation of these cell types are only partially zzso zzso zzso has a wide variety of roles in generation of the central nervous system, though the specific activity of this zzso during zzso development is not well zzso Here, we present data that delineate the zzso specific pattern of zzso signaling during mouse zzso development between zzso and zzso Using the zzso zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso activity is present zzso at the embryonic zzso lip but not at later stages during the expansion of cell populations that arise from zzso At late embryonic and early zzso zzso zzso activity shifts to the zzso zzso zone and to cells arising from this zzso zzso zzso the expression pattern becomes progressively restricted to zzso zzso cells, which show expression of the reporter at zzso These results indicate a variety of potential functions for zzso activity during zzso zzso
