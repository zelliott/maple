zzso C virus zzso establishes chronic infection in a significant number of infected humans, although the mechanisms for zzso remain largely zzso We have previously shown that zzso infection in immortalized human zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Steele, zzso Ray, and zzso zzso Ray, zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the regulation of the downstream signaling zzso for zzso production by zzso is not clearly zzso In this study, the regulation of the zzso signaling zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso was zzso zzso infection zzso expression of total zzso but failed to induce zzso and efficient nuclear zzso zzso study revealed that zzso infection zzso zzso response element zzso as evidenced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, nuclear zzso of zzso was impaired following zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression initially increased (up to 24 zzso and then decreased at later time points, and zzso protein 27 was not zzso Interestingly, zzso infection blocked zzso nuclear zzso upon zzso or zzso treatment of zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso infection enhances zzso expression but zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso These zzso in the zzso signaling zzso may, in part, be responsible for establishment of chronic zzso zzso
