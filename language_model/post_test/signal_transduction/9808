zzso zzso zzso has been indicated to activate zzso zzso 4 zzso trafficking to the plasma membrane zzso to enhance zzso zzso in zzso zzso In skeletal and heart muscle cells, insulin directs the zzso trafficking of the fatty acid zzso to induce the zzso of cellular zzso fatty acid zzso The current study describes the effects of zzso and insulin on the zzso of zzso from zzso storage pools to the PM in zzso zzso in comparison with that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso were expressed and primarily located zzso in zzso zzso Upon insulin or zzso zzso PM expression of zzso increased in a similar manner as that for zzso the zzso PM expression was less strong than that of zzso The increase in PM zzso for these two proteins by insulin paralleled zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso The induction of the PM expression of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso by insulin and zzso appears to be additive in zzso Furthermore, zzso completely inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso and prevented the increased zzso of zzso or zzso in these zzso Taken together, for the first time, these findings suggest that both insulin and zzso induce zzso zzso to the PM in zzso zzso and that their zzso effects are not zzso The signaling zzso inducing the zzso is different, apparently resulting in a differential activity of zzso
