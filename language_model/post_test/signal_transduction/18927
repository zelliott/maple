This study tested the hypothesis that depletion of zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso via reducing zzso generation and zzso zzso signaling pathways after zzso 

zzso rats were randomly divided into one of four groups: 

30 zzso zzso and 3 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso serum was injected 6 h before zzso zzso zzso zzso was given twice before zzso and at zzso zzso the zzso was placed without coronary zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Elisa zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by Western zzso zzso 

Relative to zzso depletion of zzso or zzso treatment reduced levels of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and 231 zzso zzso versus 1994 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 666 zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanying a reduction in zzso zzso (12 zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso versus 20 zzso 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both groups showed a reduction in expression of nuclear zzso relative to zzso (62 zzso zzso and 67 zzso zzso versus 124 zzso 16 zzso consistent with reduced zzso binding zzso The number of zzso cells zzso in area at risk zzso was comparably reduced in zzso and zzso groups relative to zzso (12 zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso versus 20 zzso 1), consistent with reduced appearance of DNA zzso Furthermore, activated zzso was significantly reduced and zzso was increased relative to zzso No difference in all parameters measured was detected during the course of experiment in the zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso generated from activated zzso after zzso trigger zzso zzso which is further supported by an zzso therapy with zzso potentially zzso by enhanced zzso signaling pathway, activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso
