zzso zzso zzso triggers a complex series of zzso and molecular mechanisms that zzso the zzso functions through breakdown of cellular integrity zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These intricate processes lead to zzso of zzso mechanisms involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of these zzso bring them in contact with appropriate molecular targets leading to altered gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso early gene zzso responsible for zzso of cell zzso zzso Moreover, inflammatory reactions initiated at the zzso interface and zzso in the dynamic communication between the zzso cells, zzso and zzso are thought to substantially contribute to the zzso of the zzso The damaging mechanisms may proceed through rapid zzso cell zzso zzso or by active form of cell demise zzso or zzso depending upon the severity and duration of the zzso zzso A systematic understanding of these molecular mechanisms with prospect of modulating the chain of events leading to cellular zzso may help to generate the potential strategies for zzso This review briefly covers the current status on the molecular mechanisms of stroke zzso with an zzso to identify potential molecular targets such as targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction, certain key proteins involved in zzso stress, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell death pathways zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso besides targeting directly the genes zzso However, selecting promising targets from various zzso zzso for drug discovery and development is very challenging, nevertheless such novel approaches may lead to the emergence of new avenues for therapeutic intervention in cerebral zzso
