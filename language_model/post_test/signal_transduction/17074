The zzso of protein interactions is the prerequisite of forming various signaling networks, and the construction of signaling networks is a critical issue in the discovering the mechanism of the life zzso In this paper, we proposed a novel method to zzso the zzso in zzso interaction networks and zzso construct signaling zzso Based on the functional zzso of zzso we proposed a novel zzso zzso and established the prediction zzso This method shows high sensitivity and specificity to predict the zzso of protein zzso evaluated by fivefold cross zzso By taking the threshold value of zzso as 2, we achieved accuracy zzso percent and coverage zzso percent in the human test zzso Also, this method was successfully applied to reconstruct the classical signaling pathways in zzso This study not only provided an effective method to unravel the unknown signaling zzso but also the deeper understanding for the signaling networks, from the aspect of protein zzso
