zzso proteins allow specific protein complexes to be assembled in particular regions of the cell at which they organize zzso structures and signal zzso zzso This characteristic is especially important for zzso which are highly polarized zzso Among the zzso contained by scaffold zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are of particular relevance in signal zzso processes and maintenance of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are specialized in the binding of the zzso zzso of proteins allowing membrane proteins to be localized by the zzso to the zzso zzso by zzso scaffold zzso In zzso studies carried out in zzso have taught that the role of many scaffold proteins is not limited to a single process; thus, in many cases the same genes are expressed in different zzso and participate in apparently very diverse zzso In addition to the differential expression of zzso of scaffold zzso the expression of zzso of these molecular scaffolds as the result of the alternative processing of the genes that zzso them is proving to be a very important source of zzso and complexity on a main zzso Alternative zzso in the nervous system is well zzso where specific zzso play roles in zzso zzso channel function, zzso cell recognition, and are zzso regulated making it a major mechanism of functional zzso Here we review the current state of knowledge about the diversity and the known function of zzso proteins in zzso with emphasis in the role played by alternatively processed forms in the diversity of functions attributed to this family of zzso
