The effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by the zzso patch clamp technique using zzso zzso zzso had a dual effect on zzso zzso it zzso the currents induced by low zzso zzso zzso of zzso and suppressed those induced by high zzso zzso zzso of zzso These effects were zzso after washing with drug-free zzso The stimulating effect of zzso was clearly observed at a concentration of 10 zzso and slight increases in currents were detected even at zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso at 100 zzso suppressed the currents induced by a low concentration (10 zzso of zzso The rate of zzso of zzso current was greatly accelerated by zzso and this effect could not be reversed by washing with drug-free zzso When added to the internal zzso solution, the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso but not the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso C zzso zzso abolished the zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso of cells with 200 zzso zzso toxin for 24 h also abolished the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is exerted via G proteins and protein zzso zzso The stimulation of the zzso zzso may be directly related to the cognitive enhancing action of zzso
