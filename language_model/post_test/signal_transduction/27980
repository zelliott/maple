Although zzso zzso is a well-known zzso it has only recently been demonstrated that zzso is able to inhibit cell proliferation in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the possible zzso pathways involved in the growth zzso of human zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this leads to the zzso of DNA zzso Interestingly, the prolonged zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the transient zzso of zzso zzso B zzso were also observed in concert with the zzso of zzso proliferation by zzso To verify further the zzso action of zzso we examined changes in cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso synthesis but zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all are zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the growth zzso by zzso was in part abolished by zzso toxin zzso treatment, but that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso suggesting that zzso functions both zzso as a second messenger, and zzso as a zzso for cell surface zzso zzso growth factor I zzso is a well-established human zzso zzso and is known to stimulate zzso in various cell zzso In the present study, zzso was found to inhibit the zzso proliferation and zzso zzso induced by zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the negative regulation of zzso proliferation by zzso the zzso zzso
