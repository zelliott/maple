zzso zzso and growing zzso produce vascular zzso growth factors zzso leading to the zzso of the corresponding receptors in zzso zzso The zzso zzso expansion of the local zzso can promote zzso and pathological growth zzso Previous work has uncovered that the zzso and zzso pathways are tightly zzso zzso triggered by zzso (also known as zzso has been shown to induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso vessels and, most zzso in the tip of zzso zzso zzso activates zzso in adjacent cells, which suppresses the expression of zzso receptors and thereby zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show, by using zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso in zzso that zzso protein expression in retinal tip cells is only zzso modulated by zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso also had no significant impact on zzso expression and induced zzso zzso zzso and proliferation even in the absence of zzso which is the most important zzso zzso and is considered to be indispensable for these zzso By contrast, zzso the main zzso for zzso was strongly modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso cells that had low zzso zzso zzso Our results establish that zzso and zzso are regulated in a highly differential manner by zzso We propose that successful zzso targeting of these receptors and their zzso will strongly depend on the status of zzso zzso zzso
