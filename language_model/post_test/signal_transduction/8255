Despite a number of studies on signal zzso in zzso zzso very little is known about how signals move from the zzso to the nucleus during the course of zzso proliferation and zzso In this study, we first compared the expression patterns of the zzso alpha zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso and zzso were the major zzso in both normal human zzso zzso zzso and normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso with either transforming growth factor zzso or zzso for 24 hours resulted in the zzso of zzso expression specifically in zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso Interestingly, zzso but not zzso specifically zzso zzso expression at the promoter level, suggesting differential regulation of zzso expression by zzso and zzso We then demonstrated that zzso physically bound to zzso regulatory zzso zzso a zzso factor induced by zzso and induced nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso We finally performed zzso and quantitative real-time zzso analysis for the zzso expression pattern of zzso with either zzso or zzso of zzso and indicated zzso involvement for various zzso gene regulations such as zzso Our data suggest that zzso may play an important role in the zzso pathways that regulate zzso proliferation and zzso
