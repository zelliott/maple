We address the mechanisms underlying generation of skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and zzso from zzso zzso in the zzso zzso analysis shows that of all zzso zzso the lateral region is the most prolific producer of smooth muscle and zzso zzso individual labeled lateral zzso cells give rise to only zzso or mural cells (not zzso and zzso and mural cell differentiation is driven by distinct signaling zzso zzso activity is necessary for smooth muscle production while zzso zzso muscle zzso yet it does not affect initial development of zzso zzso On the other hand, bone zzso protein signaling is required for zzso cell differentiation and/or migration but zzso zzso muscle differentiation and fails to impact smooth muscle cell zzso zzso although different mechanisms are responsible for smooth muscle and zzso generation, the choice to become smooth versus zzso muscle depends on a single signaling zzso Altogether, these findings underscore the spatial and zzso complexity of lineage diversification in an apparently homogeneous zzso
