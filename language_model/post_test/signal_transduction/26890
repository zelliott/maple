zzso zzso in zzso coli are characterized by the remarkable zzso with which spatial patterns zzso adapt to variations of cell zzso Moreover, zzso and therefore proper cell division, is independent of zzso These observations raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms establishing robust zzso zzso and about the role of spatial cues, as they are at odds with present zzso Here, we introduce a robust model based on experimental data, consistently explaining the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and circular patterns, as well as the observed temperature dependence of the zzso zzso zzso to prior zzso the model predicts that zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso The transient zzso of zzso and highly zzso transfer of zzso between polar zones are the key mechanisms underlying zzso zzso channeling enhances zzso zzso and zzso stripe formation, revealing the potential zzso process from which robust zzso originally zzso
