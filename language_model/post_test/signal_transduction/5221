Mercury zzso is one of the universal environmental pollutants and is responsible for various organ zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed to explore the protective role of zzso in zzso zzso and cell death in zzso zzso Exposure of mercury (20 zzso in the form zzso for 1 zzso significantly enhanced the zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso oxygen species production, reduced cell viability and distorted the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso analyses shows that zzso zzso death in zzso zzso of this zzso involves reduced zzso membrane potential, variations in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso distinctly increased zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso however, reduced zzso zzso stress, attenuated the changes in zzso zzso and protects zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso also distinctly increased the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso treatment suppressed these zzso events, signifying its protective role in zzso zzso zzso as referred by reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso suggest that zzso can zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso in zzso probably because of its zzso activity and functioning via zzso pathways and could be a beneficial agent in zzso zzso liver zzso
