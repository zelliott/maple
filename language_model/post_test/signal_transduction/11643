zzso development is initiated by signals from the oral zzso which induce gene expression required for tooth development in the underlying zzso In this study, we have used zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to analyze the requirement of zzso signaling during early tooth zzso We show that zzso signaling is necessary for expression of zzso a zzso factor required for development of all teeth, in prospective zzso and zzso zzso until zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso also requires zzso signaling until zzso whereas expression of its zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso already becomes independent of zzso signaling at zzso In contrast, zzso expression of several genes thought to be important for tooth development was unaffected by the block of zzso zzso Finally, we show that expression of the zzso zzso Dan in prospective tooth zzso requires zzso signals and can be induced by zzso beads but is maintained in zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso signaling is required for development of both zzso and zzso teeth and suggest that zzso of tooth zzso involves at least two zzso zzso
