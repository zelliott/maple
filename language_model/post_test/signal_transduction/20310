The interaction of the immune system with zzso zzso remains poorly zzso We have previously shown that zzso on the zzso A portion of zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso is added to zzso A by the zzso zzso specific for zzso A, which is zzso by zzso Here, we report that Southern zzso and zzso analyses of zzso sequences from all eight zzso zzso species confirmed that zzso was absent in 15 of 17 strains examined but was present in zzso zzso Mass zzso of zzso A and intact LOS revealed the lack of both zzso and zzso in zzso A of zzso species lacking zzso zzso signaling in human zzso zzso cells was much greater with zzso than with zzso zzso strains that lacked zzso and greater sensitivity to zzso B was consistent with the absence of zzso Unlike the other zzso whole bacteria of two zzso zzso zzso strains had low inflammatory potential, whereas their zzso A had high-level zzso and zzso and induced high-level inflammatory zzso supporting previous studies indicating that this species uses mechanisms other than altering zzso A to support zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso had reduced inflammatory potential, further illustrating the importance of zzso A zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso Overall, our results indicate that lack of zzso and zzso of zzso A contributes to the immune privilege of most zzso zzso strains by reducing the inflammatory potential of zzso
