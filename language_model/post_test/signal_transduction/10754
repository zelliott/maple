Gap junction channels and zzso formed of zzso zzso are found in most cell types in zzso Gap junctions connect cells via channels not open to the zzso space and permit the passage of zzso and molecules of approximately 1 zzso Single zzso zzso which are zzso zzso are present in the surface membrane before zzso with a zzso in an zzso zzso Because of their high zzso and zzso in zzso channels, it had been thought that zzso zzso remained closed until zzso to form a zzso zzso Now it is clear that at least some zzso can open to allow passage of molecules between the zzso and zzso zzso Here we review evidence that gap junction channels may allow zzso diffusion of zzso or zzso signals, but may also allow diffusion of zzso and substances from healthy to injured cells, thereby contributing to cell zzso Moreover, opening of gap junction zzso may exacerbate cell injury or mediate zzso or zzso zzso In addition to the cell specific features of an zzso zzso propagation of cell damage and death within affected zzso may be affected by expression and regulation of gap junction channels and zzso formed by zzso
