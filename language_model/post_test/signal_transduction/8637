Bone zzso protein 2 is found in zzso areas of zzso zzso valves, and prolonged stimulation of zzso valve zzso cells with bone zzso protein 2 results in increased expression of alkaline zzso indicating a zzso role for bone zzso protein 2 in zzso valve zzso The purposes of this study were to assess the effect of bone zzso protein 2 on the expression of the zzso factors zzso and zzso in human zzso valve zzso cells and to determine the signaling mechanisms that mediate the expression of these early zzso zzso 

zzso cells were isolated from normal and zzso human zzso valve zzso and cellular bone zzso protein 2 levels were analyzed by means of zzso zzso zzso cells from normal zzso valves were zzso with bone zzso protein 2 to determine its effect on cellular zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso cells from zzso zzso valves express greater levels of bone zzso protein 2 than cells from normal zzso zzso of human zzso valve zzso cells with bone zzso protein 2 induced marked increases in zzso and zzso levels at 48 zzso The changes in zzso and zzso levels were preceded by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 but not zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso levels, whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 reduced zzso expression without an influence on zzso zzso 

zzso cells of zzso human zzso valves are characterized by increased bone zzso protein 2 zzso A short period of exposure of human zzso valve zzso cells to bone zzso protein 2 zzso the expression of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plays a role in regulating the expression of both zzso and zzso induced by bone zzso protein zzso
