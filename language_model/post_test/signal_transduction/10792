zzso zzso are essential regulators of zzso zzso but how they do so during zzso zzso in zzso is poorly zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso factor zzso is essential for zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso function in zzso growth is inhibited by zzso zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be the major function of zzso in regulating zzso growth in zzso zzso data provide evidence that zzso or zzso via zzso zzso zzso or zzso respectively, activate zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso also activates a zzso zzso that promotes zzso growth, and different zzso regulate these distinct zzso These genetic analyses reveal zzso and divergent pathways from zzso zzso to the zzso during zzso growth in zzso and suggest that different zzso outcomes could be achieved by biases in zzso zzso
