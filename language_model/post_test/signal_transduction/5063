zzso with zzso failure who are zzso nutrition zzso may develop zzso liver injury and zzso zzso liver zzso zzso The zzso of zzso remains incompletely zzso We hypothesized that zzso injury with increased zzso zzso combined with administration of zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso signaling dependent zzso cell zzso zzso as an early event in the zzso of zzso We developed a mouse model in which zzso injury and increased zzso were induced by oral treatment for 4 days with zzso zzso sodium zzso followed by continuous infusion of soy zzso zzso solution through a central zzso zzso for 7 zzso and 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice showed increased zzso zzso and elevated portal vein zzso levels, evidence of zzso injury and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso and increased zzso expression of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso of liver injury remained elevated in zzso mice associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso infusion without zzso zzso or zzso zzso alone did not result in liver injury or zzso zzso even though portal vein zzso levels were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with broad spectrum antibiotics or zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso mice resulted in significantly reduced zzso zzso and markedly attenuated liver injury in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso activates zzso through zzso signaling in early stages of zzso
