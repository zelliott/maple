zzso (3 to zzso zzso is essential in maintaining the plasticity of embryonic stem cells and permitting their transformation via zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso and zzso of the developing zzso Similarly, a relatively hypoxic zzso supports the development of tumor cells with zzso and zzso properties and zzso At the same time, such adaptation results in the tumor cells becoming relatively resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and promotes zzso into blood vessels with zzso In this context, current therapeutic strategies designed to target zzso zzso could promote zzso and zzso by rendering tumor cells more zzso leading to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The purpose of this report is to present a conceptual model that illustrates the impact of an hypoxic zzso on the signal zzso pathways involved in the zzso zzso We will show the molecular connectivity and zzso association of these pathways with protein zzso in both zzso and zzso in order to strengthen our hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso Finally, we propose to use the model as a basis for the construction of zzso therapeutic options from existing pharmaceutical and zzso agents that may zzso zzso adaptation to zzso 

zzso and biomedical zzso zzso AND zzso zzso data retrieved from zzso analysis of zzso zzso cases revealed zzso zzso of zzso necrosis and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Analysis zzso showed comparative validation of the zzso pathway, as demonstrated by zzso in zzso both with the zzso genes in zzso and with the networks associated with zzso Additionally, therapeutic agents known to have activity against various components of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis in zzso were validated using zzso identifiers entered into zzso and zzso zzso These therapies also connected with the zzso signature in zzso and zzso 

The application of zzso to define the presence of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with biomedical zzso in the demonstration of zzso interaction with the zzso signature in zzso and zzso providing proof of concept that zzso zzso zzso This approach also zzso a new zzso therapeutic strategy targeting the zzso zzso and designed to prevent zzso adaptation, zzso and zzso zzso
