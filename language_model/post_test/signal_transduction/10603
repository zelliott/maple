A dynamic mathematical model was developed to describe the zzso of various carbohydrates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso For validation a number of zzso strains with defined zzso were zzso By considering zzso reactions as well as signal zzso processes influencing the relevant zzso we were able to describe zzso the phenomenon of zzso repression in zzso zzso We verified model predictions by measuring time courses of several zzso and zzso components such as zzso zzso zzso zzso level, both zzso and zzso zzso and total zzso zzso under various growth zzso The entire data base consists of 18 experiments performed with nine different zzso The model describes the expression of 17 key zzso 38 zzso zzso and the dynamic behavior of more than 50 zzso The different phenomena affecting the zzso level of zzso the key regulation zzso for zzso exclusion and zzso repression in enteric bacteria, can now be explained zzso
