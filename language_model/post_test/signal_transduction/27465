We have isolated a zzso clone from zzso zzso named zzso coding for a G zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a molecular mass of 45 zzso and contains most of the zzso regions involved in zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso acid sequence levels with the other plant G zzso shows a high degree of conservation zzso zzso zzso analysis of these plant genes with the other G zzso from different species clearly indicate that those proteins represent a new member of the zzso zzso family, named zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso stem and leaf zzso shows that this gene is widely expressed throughout the plant although it is most abundant in the vascular zzso of all these zzso Furthermore, the transcript is more abundant in young zzso and organ zzso than mature zzso The high degree of sequence conservation among the plant G zzso and the differences to other species of other zzso suggest that plant G proteins may function in specialized zzso zzso
