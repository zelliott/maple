In order to attain competence to respond to hormone, certain steroid hormone receptors must be assembled into zzso zzso complexes, containing zzso and other zzso Members of the zzso gene family are highly zzso strongly zzso and required for viability in zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in the activity of steroid hormone receptors in zzso four zzso zzso which cause defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso but support the viability of zzso zzso were previously isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 90, zzso In this study, I characterize the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso response, zzso binding activity, and zzso complex zzso The zzso fall into two zzso Three of the zzso zzso cause defects in zzso zzso binding in zzso and form zzso complexes that are unstable in zzso relative to those containing zzso zzso The other zzso affects zzso zzso but zzso complexes with this zzso are not defective for zzso binding or zzso These findings indicate that the binding of zzso to zzso in the zzso complex is insufficient to induce a high zzso affinity zzso rather the high zzso affinity to zzso requires a specific interaction with zzso which is altered by certain zzso zzso
