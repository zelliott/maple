We evaluated the contribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling to zzso production in zzso thick ascending limb zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso but not the inactive zzso binding zzso abolished zzso increases in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was partially reversed by using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production also was partially reversed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso dependent and blocked by zzso partial zzso also was observed with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity by approximately zzso and zzso prevented zzso increases in zzso activity, an nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso reporter zzso and a zzso promoter zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was determined, as we previously showed that zzso zzso production was zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activity by zzso an effect abolished by transient zzso with a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso (20 zzso abolished zzso increases in activity of zzso an zzso reporter, and a zzso promoter zzso zzso the data suggest that zzso signaling contributes to zzso zzso production in a zzso and zzso manner and may be part of a zzso mechanism to regulate zzso zzso Moreover, concurrent zzso and zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso production in zzso cells via a zzso zzso that is zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways that regulate zzso production in the zzso is crucial to defining novel mechanisms that regulate zzso fluid volume and salt zzso
