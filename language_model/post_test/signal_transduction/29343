zzso has been widely used to treat head and neck zzso One of the clinical limitations with this treatment, however, is that tumors that are initially responsive to zzso later acquire zzso We have recently shown that a subset of head and neck cancer cell lines has a defective zzso anemia DNA damage response zzso and this zzso zzso to zzso zzso We have also shown that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso sensitize human cells to zzso In this study we explored whether zzso may sensitize head and neck cancer cells by interfering with the zzso anemia zzso 

We found that the zzso zzso head and neck cancer cell lines to zzso This zzso by zzso correlated to a significant decrease in the formation of zzso zzso nuclear zzso which is a functional read out of the zzso anemia and zzso zzso zzso This zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso was not due to loss of zzso zzso but rather correlated to a zzso reduction in the expression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that cancer cells defective in the zzso zzso were also zzso to zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso targets additional zzso 

The results from this study suggest that zzso may have therapeutic utility as a zzso zzso in head and neck cancer by zzso the zzso zzso through the down regulation of zzso as well as by an zzso zzso
