In zzso zzso the majority of zzso are lost before zzso by zzso This degenerative process is initiated or caused by zzso cell zzso To reveal the zzso mechanism of selective zzso zzso the culture model system for zzso and antagonism of the zzso zzso has been zzso We examined the influence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso They were incubated (6 and zzso in the presence of testosterone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or both T and zzso zzso and then analyzed by flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso To better imitate in zzso conditions, the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso have been incubated in an organ culture system with the addition of the same zzso Sections obtained from zzso fixed after culture were stained with zzso and zzso and the presence of zzso DNA strand breaks was evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the culture media were measured by zzso The addition of T or zzso to the culture media caused an increase in the number of zzso zzso cells, while treatment with zzso decreased it in both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cultured with the addition of T or zzso exhibited zzso changes indicating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was considerably zzso by zzso The highest increase in zzso zzso zzso was observed after the zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso cultures, the production of zzso declined in the presence of T or zzso but increased after their simultaneous zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso cell zzso in the presence of a high T zzso The nature of this protective mechanism as yet is unknown and requires further zzso
