zzso zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The induction of zzso gene expression in immortalized mouse liver cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested that they may be zzso zzso signal zzso zzso We report that incubation of zzso zzso cells with zzso resulted in the appearance of two zzso bands of approximately 44 and 42 zzso with zzso zzso at 20 zzso These two proteins were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (also known as zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also resulted in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso however, the steroid zzso zzso zzso which does not induce zzso gene zzso did not induce zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso was zzso by the zzso consistent with their zzso The zzso also induced zzso of the upstream regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso of zzso and zzso by the zzso implicating zzso zzso as a requirement for zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso with zzso greatly reduced the zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression by zzso was also seen in rat zzso These results attribute many of the effects of zzso on zzso gene expression to the zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso and add the zzso to the growing number of tumor promoters that zzso signaling zzso
