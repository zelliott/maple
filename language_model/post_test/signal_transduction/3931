Although zzso zzso channels mediate sensory zzso in zzso and vision, other forms of sensory zzso are independent of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso respond normally to some zzso stimuli and to zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso responses use an alternative sensory zzso zzso One gene that may act in this zzso is zzso which is required for each of these responses as well as a zzso response to nose zzso zzso encodes a protein with zzso repeats and multiple predicted zzso zzso that has limited similarity to the zzso zzso channels transient zzso potential zzso and zzso zzso The sequence of zzso and other zzso genes reveals a previously zzso diversity of zzso and zzso genes in this zzso zzso is required for the activity of the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso which acts in the zzso zzso zzso its similarity to other zzso zzso channels suggests that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion genes are expressed in a subset of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also affects zzso adaptation within zzso that require the zzso zzso channel for zzso in these zzso the gene has a regulatory function and not a primary role in sensory zzso
