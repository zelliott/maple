The zzso functions of zzso proteins have attracted more attention in recent zzso zzso proteins are a group of zzso proteins which exhibit zzso and zzso zzso and different expression levels of members from this family have been observed in various pathological zzso The reported zzso functions of zzso proteins include the ability to enhance zzso zzso involvement in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In our previous study, we reported zzso of zzso in response to the elevated zzso calcium levels induced by zzso zzso In order to investigate potential effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used here to stimulate human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the cells resulted in both zzso protein zzso and protein zzso from the zzso zzso To test specificity of this effect, addition of various other zzso proteins was also zzso Interestingly, zzso of specific zzso proteins was only observed when the cells were zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso is a putative cell surface zzso for zzso proteins and is involved in various signal zzso zzso we next investigated the interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso which is a downstream regulator in zzso zzso pathways can be activated by addition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins was inhibited by soluble zzso These experiments suggest a common cell surface zzso for zzso proteins on zzso cells even though zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso proteins is zzso
