Many zzso possess zzso hair zzso zzso zzso in zzso which are extremely sensitive detectors of medium particle zzso zzso evidence in some zzso suggests that these zzso can detect air particle zzso resulting from zzso communication zzso However, it has not yet been shown for any species that the air particle zzso detected by the zzso hairs are themselves perceived as a zzso zzso that individuals make zzso decisions based upon the responses of these zzso to the displays of zzso We investigate the zzso zzso of the whip zzso zzso zzso and the role of its zzso in receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso have extremely zzso zzso first legs, which they zzso close to their opponents during zzso zzso inducing air movements that zzso their opponents' zzso We find that zzso of the zzso causes significant increases in: zzso contest zzso and zzso the probability of contest escalation past aggressive displays to physical zzso zzso in the absence of air zzso zzso contest assessment is zzso This suggests that whip zzso exploit true air movement signals during zzso zzso and that these are received by the zzso Furthermore, these results indicate that, in whip zzso such signals help mitigate the cost of zzso zzso
