zzso cardiac zzso is an early zzso in both types 1 and 2 zzso The primary stimulus for zzso growth in diabetes is yet unknown and may involve zzso stimulation of zzso receptors as well as direct zzso zzso To discriminate between these zzso stimuli we analyzed zzso zzso pathways in zzso and zzso zzso 

Experimental diabetes was induced in zzso and knockout mice by zzso injection of zzso 8 weeks after induction of diabetes zzso function and structure was assessed by zzso before zzso To identify zzso zzso pathways expression and zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso analysis after tissue zzso Changes in zzso zzso were identified by zzso analysis and functional zzso zzso levels of zzso factors zzso and zzso were zzso by real-time zzso 

zzso zzso mice developed zzso zzso with preserved cardiac zzso zzso zzso was not different between the two zzso However, diabetic zzso mice showed increased protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to cellular zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso In contrast, diabetic zzso mice showed no altered zzso and no changes in zzso or zzso zzso although zzso of zzso occurred as in zzso 

zzso is essential for the development of cardiac zzso in type zzso zzso of zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso appears to be zzso whereas zzso is activated by zzso independent of zzso
