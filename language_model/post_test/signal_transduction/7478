At later stages of zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains layers of zzso zzso cells surrounding an zzso zzso During zzso development zzso cells zzso zzso hormones and support the growth of the zzso In zzso the zzso needs to grow zzso 10 zzso in diameter to allow an zzso to zzso following which the zzso cells cease dividing and differentiate into the zzso cells of the corpus zzso To better understand the molecular basis of zzso growth and zzso cell zzso we undertook zzso profiling of zzso cells from small zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 10) and large zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 4) healthy bovine zzso using zzso zzso zzso probe zzso 

Principal component analysis for the first two components and zzso zzso showed zzso into two groups, small and large, with the former being more zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of variation of the signal zzso of each probe set also revealed that small zzso were more zzso than the zzso zzso and GO enrichment analyses revealed that processes of zzso guidance, immune zzso and cell zzso were most affected in large zzso The most important networks were associated with: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through zzso signal related zzso zzso zzso regulator genes which were predicted to be active in large zzso included zzso and zzso By comparison, zzso processes such as those zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were most active in small zzso zzso was identified as an upstream regulator in small zzso It encodes an zzso that zzso the activity of many target zzso including those involved in energy zzso by removal of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that as zzso enlarge more genes and/or pathways are activated than are zzso and gene expression becomes more zzso These findings could be interpreted that either the cells in large zzso are more uniform in their gene zzso or that zzso are more uniform or a combination of both and that additional factors, such as zzso are additionally controlling the zzso zzso
