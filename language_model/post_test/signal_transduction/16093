Heart failure is associated with deficient zzso zzso oxide zzso production as well as increased zzso stress and accelerated NO zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso NO zzso and zzso zzso zzso production in patients with heart zzso 

In zzso from patients with heart failure due to idiopathic zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso 23), NO zzso zzso activity was evaluated by zzso to zzso conversion, zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso total and zzso was assessed by western zzso and zzso production and zzso scavenging capacity were measured by zzso zzso In zzso from patients with heart failure, zzso zzso activity was higher than in those from zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso activity increased as expected in response to zzso or collagen in controls, no increase occurred in zzso from heart failure zzso Despite this, zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower in heart failure than in control subjects, as was zzso zzso of zzso suggesting a decrease in zzso zzso zzso from heart failure subjects exhibited higher zzso and zzso zzso production and impaired zzso scavenging capacity, resulting in higher zzso stress, consistent with the observed decrease in zzso zzso 

In heart failure, despite zzso of zzso zzso produce less zzso zzso probably as a result of NO scavenging due to increased zzso zzso This functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso could contribute to the zzso zzso observed in heart zzso
