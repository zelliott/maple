Directed cell migration plays important roles in zzso processes such as host defense, wound healing, cancer zzso and zzso Many organisms are capable of directional migration, which can be guided by diverse cellular factors including chemical and electrical zzso Recently, zzso devices that consist of small channels with zzso dimensions are being developed for cell migration zzso These devices can precisely zzso and zzso manipulate chemical concentration zzso and electric fields, and thus can be used to study the complex guiding mechanisms for cell zzso In this paper we highlight recent applications of zzso devices for cell migration research, with a focus on electric zzso cell migration, to provide important and timely updates of this rapidly developing research zzso
