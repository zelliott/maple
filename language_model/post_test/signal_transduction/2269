zzso of the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the immune zzso family, results in the zzso of protein zzso zzso and downstream signaling zzso The two zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso or zzso and zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso or zzso are expressed in the zzso rat mast cell zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso This zzso was independent of the presence of the protein zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso Whereas zzso was zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso only after zzso zzso Fusion proteins containing either the full-length or the zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso directly bound to the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso experiments, synthetic zzso peptides based on the zzso zzso zzso motif of the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, neither fusion proteins nor synthetic peptides detected interaction between zzso and zzso zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta and gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associate with zzso zzso by different mechanisms and can regulate the extent of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, unlike other immune cells in which zzso molecules are recruited by accessory zzso zzso zzso bind molecules that both activate and inhibit signal zzso
