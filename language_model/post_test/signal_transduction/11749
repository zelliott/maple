In the present study we show that when certain major zzso zzso zzso T cell clones with natural zzso activity are zzso through their zzso zzso in the absence of significant zzso (as provided by zzso fragments of zzso zzso they lose their zzso 2 zzso This is attributable to an induction of a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of this process in some zzso cells leads to an overall decrease in zzso activity and constitutes a possible mechanism of suppression of the immune zzso
