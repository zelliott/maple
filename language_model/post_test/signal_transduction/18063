This study was designed to determine whether zzso would augment zzso zzso via a mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso exhibited the most efficient potency for decreasing zzso zzso for 16 h from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso it exerted poor and adverse effects on zzso zzso A selective protein zzso A inhibitor zzso (10 zzso reversed the capacity of zzso zzso but not zzso to induce an zzso effect on zzso zzso suggesting that occupancy of zzso zzso receptors inhibit zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso derivatives show the following pattern of potency for inducing zzso zzso competing with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This pattern is consistent with the affinity established for zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an additive effect to that of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in inducing zzso zzso but not to that of zzso zzso or zzso (a selective zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso suggesting conflicting effects on the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso has an zzso action on zzso zzso via a mechanism of zzso zzso
