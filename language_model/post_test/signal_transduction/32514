Although it is common knowledge that some dietary zzso can adversely affect the growth and health of young animals and that, therefore, zzso are implicated in nutritional disorders of the zzso system, it has not been rigorously established that findings with animals are also directly zzso to zzso However, because the zzso state of the human gut is basically similar to that of higher animals, it may be confidently predicted that the effects of dietary zzso will have similarities in both humans and zzso The more recent but not generally appreciated realization that zzso also have many beneficial effects on the gut and metabolism of animals makes the exploration of these for possible use in zzso practice even more zzso Most zzso in our diet are resistant to breakdown during gut passage and are bound and zzso by zzso zzso These zzso are powerful zzso growth factors for the small zzso can induce dramatic shifts in its bacterial zzso and interfere with its hormone zzso In addition, zzso which are transported across the gut wall into the systemic circulation can zzso the body's hormone balance, metabolism and zzso Although these zzso effects are zzso or reinforced by immune responses, they are primarily the result of the specific chemical zzso of zzso with cell surface receptors of the zzso Clearly, as the interactions between zzso and the gut are predictable and may be manipulated to our advantage, the exciting scientific challenge is now to explore the possible transfer of the existing knowledge gained from animal zzso to zzso zzso
