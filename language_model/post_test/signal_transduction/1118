The zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso export during zzso Using zzso of zzso zzso of assimilated zzso zzso gas exchange, and zzso fluorescence, we show that a zzso of zzso lacking the zzso increases synthesis of starch compared to the wild type, thereby zzso for a zzso in its ability to export zzso from the zzso However, during growth under high light, the capacity for starch synthesis becomes limiting so that the zzso zzso pool is zzso resulting in a restriction on electron zzso a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis, and slowed plant zzso Under the same conditions but not under low light, we observe release of zzso label from zzso indicating that its synthesis and degradation occur simultaneously in the zzso The induction of starch turnover in the zzso specifically under high light conditions leads us to conclude that it is regulated by one or more zzso signals, which arise as a result of zzso limitation of zzso
