The human zzso zzso zzso gene family includes 24 genes whose regulated zzso together with that of four tissue zzso of zzso zzso is essential in tissue zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to evaluate the shared and unique patterns of control of these two gene families in human zzso and zzso zzso in response to the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso The requirement for ongoing translation was zzso using three protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso and induction of all except zzso and zzso was blocked by all protein synthesis zzso However, even though all zzso effectively blocked translation, zzso of zzso and zzso was blocked by zzso but was insensitive to zzso and zzso zzso alone induced zzso and zzso along with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were strongly activated by zzso while zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso but zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The involvement of the zzso and zzso pathways in the selective effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression was supported by use of pharmacological zzso These data confirm that most zzso zzso and zzso behave as zzso zzso protein zzso genes in zzso However, the requirement of protein synthesis for zzso of zzso and zzso is not universal, since it is zzso for zzso and zzso by stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso The definition of clusters of zzso genes among the two gene families will aid in zzso dissection of control zzso
