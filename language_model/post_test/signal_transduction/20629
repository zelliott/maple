zzso networks established on zzso zzso provide useful models for synaptic zzso Whether or not this represents a facet of learning is debated since ex zzso networks are deprived of zzso interaction with the zzso We compared zzso signaling of such networks with and without stimulation with a prerecorded synaptic signal from another mature culture as a model of sensory zzso zzso networks displayed a zzso increase in individual signals that eventually declined, yielding a pattern containing organized bursts of zzso zzso zzso to model the onset of sensory input hastened the onset of zzso zzso However, the overall zzso pattern of zzso networks, including the total number and type of signals as well as the length of this zzso period, was identical to that of zzso zzso One interpretation of these findings is that ongoing plasticity may be essential to establish an appropriate platform for learning once sensory input zzso
