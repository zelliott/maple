Many patients with brain cancer experience zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly decreases their quality of zzso This study aimed to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms of zzso The zzso expressed genes zzso between zzso patients with or without brain tumor were zzso screened using the Linear Models for zzso Data package using zzso zzso from the USA National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene zzso zzso zzso Then the zzso interaction zzso network, using data from the Human zzso zzso Database and the Biological General zzso for zzso zzso was zzso For further analysis, the zzso network structure and clusters in this zzso network were identified by zzso Meanwhile, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to illuminate the biological pathways and processes which generally affect patients with zzso A total of zzso zzso were identified and a zzso network, which contained 114 zzso and 21 normal zzso was zzso zzso which mainly belonged to the mini zzso maintenance and collagen families, were discovered to be enriched in the three identified clusters in the zzso zzso Finally, several biological pathways (including cell cycle, DNA replication and transforming growth factor zzso signaling zzso and processes (such as zzso zzso nuclear transport and regulation of zzso were zzso zzso in these three clusters may become new targets for zzso zzso Our results provide some potential underlying zzso for understanding the zzso of zzso in patients with brain zzso
