A zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is essential for the differentiation of cultured skeletal zzso in response to growth factor zzso Previously, zzso D zzso has been found to play a role in cell growth regulation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, a role for zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso differentiation is not zzso Here we show that upon induction of differentiation in mouse zzso satellite cells, the expression of both zzso and zzso is zzso zzso differentiation is markedly inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso reaction, and also by the zzso of zzso but not zzso Further investigation has revealed that zzso is unlikely to regulate zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso as previously zzso Instead, zzso positively regulates zzso signaling leading to the production of zzso an zzso factor instrumental for the initiation of satellite cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso fully zzso the differentiation zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso is critically involved in skeletal zzso by regulating the zzso zzso
