zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso is expressed in the developing limb zzso and zzso mice present with severe limb zzso These zzso might be attributable to an zzso patterning zzso however, recent reports suggest that zzso is zzso for limb zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso mice and transgenic mice in which zzso is zzso deleted under control of the zzso promoter beginning at zzso zzso We found that the limb zzso in zzso mice was less severe than that observed in zzso animals and that a change in zzso zzso contributed to the difference in zzso We systematically examined the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and found that zzso cells and limb zzso cells treated with a zzso zzso are maintained in a zzso state, exhibit reduced zzso differentiation and have modestly accelerated zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibited an increase in expression of genes in a closely related zzso zzso indicating that zzso signals in the limb interfere with differentiation and maintain zzso zzso Together, these findings support an important function for zzso in regulating the zzso of zzso zzso and their subsequent differentiation and zzso
