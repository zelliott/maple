T cell zzso appears to be regulated by an interplay between protein zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been found to associate with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso has been shown to be able to regulate the activities of these zzso zzso in zzso In man, zzso contains five different zzso whose distribution defines zzso of T cells having distinct zzso requirements and in zzso zzso Several groups have reported a physical interaction between distinct zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Given the potential regulatory interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso expressing different zzso zzso we have examined zzso associated and zzso associated zzso activities, associated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso T cell lines derived from peripheral zzso Both zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which exhibit identical in zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso sites zzso Further, both zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity associated with zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of a similar spectrum of zzso zzso in these zzso and zzso zzso T cell zzso These observations indicate that despite the possible interaction between zzso zzso and zzso or zzso the mere expression of the zzso zzso does not in and of itself alter the presence of zzso zzso or their zzso zzso
