The kidney zzso zzso under conditions that paradoxically cause a loss of lean body mass, such as diabetes, zzso and chronic kidney zzso What unique mechanisms account for kidney growth during negative nitrogen zzso One adaptation is that zzso zzso cells substantially decrease protein breakdown during kidney cell zzso In this review, we discuss how zzso and diabetes reduce protein breakdown within the kidney and the zzso signaling pathways that may regulate protein zzso Our results suggest that in cell culture models and in acute diabetes, kidney cells specifically reduce protein breakdown by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This differs from the zzso of zzso by the zzso system in muscle in acute diabetes and zzso A shared signaling zzso regulates protein breakdown in both kidney and skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso Diabetes zzso activates signaling through this zzso in the kidney while zzso it in skeletal zzso We conclude that similar signaling pathways may regulate distinct zzso pathways in different zzso
