In honey bees zzso zzso the development of a zzso into either a queen or worker depends on differential feeding with royal jelly and involves zzso modifications by DNA zzso To understand the role of DNA zzso in this process we zzso the zzso zzso in both queens and zzso We show that the number of zzso zzso genes zzso in zzso head is significantly increased relative to adult brain zzso zzso zzso with more than zzso of zzso zzso in worker zzso Several highly zzso zzso and signaling pathways are enriched in zzso zzso zzso the connection between dietary intake and zzso zzso This includes genes related to juvenile hormone and insulin, two hormones shown previously to regulate zzso zzso We also tie zzso data to zzso profiling and describe a distinct role for one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an important regulator of zzso We show that zzso is not only zzso zzso and alternatively spliced in zzso but also seems to be regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The unusually complex regulation of zzso in zzso suggests that this protein could represent a previously unknown zzso in a process that activates downstream signaling according to a nutritional zzso The correlation between zzso and alternative zzso of zzso is consistent with the recently described mechanism involving zzso zzso II zzso Our study offers insights into zzso development in zzso
