zzso therapy represents a very promising approach in cancer treatment, as most tumors needs to be supplied by a functional vascular network in order to grow beyond the local boundaries and zzso The accessibility of vessels to drug delivery and the broad spectrum of zzso zzso with the same compound have arisen interest in research of suitable zzso with zzso especially targeting the zzso pathway, entered in clinical trials and approved by the Food and Drug zzso Despite good results, the major hurdle resides in the limited duration of an effective clinical response before tumors start to grow zzso Thus, researchers are looking for different alternative targets for a combined and parallel zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso type I zzso with high affinity for the zzso member of Bone zzso zzso zzso it is expressed zzso even if not exclusively, on zzso cells and seems to be involved in the regulatory phase of zzso Despite a zzso zzso zzso the targeting of this pathway, both by a soluble zzso zzso developed by zzso zzso and by a fully human zzso zzso developed by Pfizer, has achieved encouraging zzso After having briefly summarized the state of the art of zzso therapy, we will first review existing evidence about the molecular mechanisms of zzso signaling and we will then zzso in detail the zzso and clinical data available about these two zzso
