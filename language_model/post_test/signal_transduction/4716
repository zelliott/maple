A significant zzso zzso persists after zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the coronary zzso which has been linked to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells and subsequent generation of zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the contribution of zzso zzso zzso to regulation of zzso coronary zzso tone in zzso and in zzso Twenty-six zzso were chronically zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso (5 zzso zzso alone had no effect on zzso zzso coronary zzso in zzso but slightly attenuated zzso zzso in the presence of combined zzso blockade with zzso (20 zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso had minimal effects on coronary resistance vessel tone at rest or during zzso Surprisingly, in the presence of combined zzso zzso a significant coronary zzso response to zzso became apparent, both at rest and during zzso zzso we investigated in isolated zzso coronary small arteries zzso zzso the possible involvement of zzso oxygen species zzso in the paradoxical zzso influence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso by zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso blockade was markedly zzso by zzso under control conditions but not in the presence of the zzso scavenger zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso can produce both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is enhanced by combined zzso blockade and is critically dependent on the experimental zzso Thus production of zzso slightly zzso the production of zzso at rest and during zzso zzso stimulation with zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso production when administered in zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso most likely zzso were dominant when administered in zzso
