zzso zzso has shown zzso effects on zzso inflammation in zzso However, little is known about how zzso regulates zzso of chronic zzso with zzso zzso a major form of zzso inflammation in the upper zzso 

We sought to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso production by dispersed zzso zzso cells zzso 

Either zzso or zzso zzso were cultured with or without zzso zzso B zzso in the presence or absence of zzso after which the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso were zzso The effects of zzso on zzso responses by zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso production and zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso B induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso production by zzso zzso with zzso prior to zzso stimulation inhibited production of these zzso After stimulation with zzso zzso production and expression of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso increased zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso effects of zzso were zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso while addition of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso production by zzso zzso while the addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso itself, inhibited zzso and zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the regulatory effects of zzso on zzso airway inflammation are controlled via the zzso zzso For clinical zzso zzso use of zzso zzso drugs should be avoided in patients with chronic zzso with zzso zzso
