While the molecular locus of zzso and zzso drug action has not yet been established, it has become increasingly likely that the targets of such drugs lie zzso to neurotransmitter receptors along the signal zzso zzso These targets are likely to involve G zzso signal zzso systems such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso This article will demonstrate model systems that have been developed in an attempt to determine how and where these drugs zzso It appears that these model systems not only represent good experimental zzso for studying the mechanisms of zzso and zzso drugs, but are useful as zzso yet realistic venues in which to test the speed and efficacy of suspected therapeutic zzso
