We explored the relationships between resistance exercise zzso and muscle zzso protein synthetic zzso responses in young and older zzso In a crossover design, four groups of six young zzso zzso and older zzso zzso men performed two volumes of resistance zzso either zzso one repetition maximum zzso (3 zzso 14, then 6 zzso 14 zzso or zzso zzso (3 zzso 8, then 6 zzso 8 zzso such that at the same volume, work was identical between zzso Muscle zzso were taken 0, 1, 2, and zzso after exercise to measure zzso via zzso bound zzso and zzso of zzso target of zzso signaling by zzso In younger men, doubling exercise volume produced limited added effects, whereas in older men, it resulted in greater zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at both zzso that is, zzso area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exercise volume is a valid strategy to maximize zzso zzso in zzso
