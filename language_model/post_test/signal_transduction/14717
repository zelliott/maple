Unlike normal zzso cells, human embryonic stem cells zzso can zzso indefinitely in culture in an zzso state where they do not appear to undergo zzso and yet remain zzso zzso maintain their zzso both in zzso and in zzso exhibit high zzso activity, and maintain zzso length after prolonged in zzso zzso Thus, zzso may provide an unlimited cell source for replacement in a number of zzso neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease as well as other neurological disorders including spinal zzso zzso The ability of zzso to bypass zzso is lost as zzso differentiate into fully differentiated zzso zzso Evidence has been accumulated that differences in zzso zzso zzso activity, cell cycle zzso DNA repair ability, as well as the lack of zzso zzso and zzso changes, may contribute to the lack of zzso in zzso In this zzso we will review recent advances in characterizing zzso and monitoring changes in these aspects in prolonged zzso We will focus on the potential roles of several cellular pathways including the zzso zzso and the zzso pathways in escaping zzso in zzso We will also discuss the zzso and zzso changes in long-term zzso culture and their potential roles in bypassing zzso
