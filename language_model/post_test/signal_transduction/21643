zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signals play important roles in cell zzso zzso and zzso and they recently have been considered as therapeutic targets for suppressing zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso including zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso are well known as negative regulators of the zzso pathway, but their precise mechanisms are largely zzso Based on our previous finding that in cultured rat brain zzso zzso induce rapid and transient zzso of the zzso pathway, we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso is involved in transient zzso of zzso signaling by zzso We first used Western zzso analysis to confirm that zzso rapidly induce the zzso of zzso This was inhibited by zzso with the zzso raft zzso zzso and was restored following zzso zzso zzso using zzso directed against zzso and zzso revealed zzso zzso and polarization of zzso in membrane zzso zzso regulation of zzso was further demonstrated in zzso experiments using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Rapid zzso recruitment to zzso raft zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso further indicating the involvement of zzso We also confirmed by zzso that zzso rapidly binds in a zzso manner to zzso in response to zzso Our study therefore showed that transient zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso is accomplished by zzso in a zzso manner in brain zzso
