zzso play pivotal roles in supporting zzso and zzso cell zzso and zzso These functions require the integrity of the short beta zzso zzso zzso which contain zzso highly zzso zzso zzso signals, typically found in receptors undergoing zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that these sequences may control surface zzso dynamics in zzso adherent and/or zzso cells via regulated zzso and polarized recycling of the zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells, we found that zzso in the zzso zzso sequence is selectively required for recycling of spontaneously zzso receptors to the cell surface and to growth zzso membrane zzso zzso of this motif by zzso zzso has no effect on the zzso adhesive function, but zzso zzso zzso from a recycling compartment into a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso substitution in the zzso zzso sequence abrogates zzso zzso and spreading without affecting zzso zzso Both of these zzso display a severe impairment in zzso migration, suggesting the existence in zzso zzso zzso of independent signals regulating apparently unrelated functions that are required to sustain cell migration over specific zzso
