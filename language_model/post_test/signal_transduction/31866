zzso zzso zzso must be tightly controlled to zzso zzso responses that cause zzso zzso promote classical zzso zzso by blocking zzso signals and zzso factors but also can prevent excessive zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso profile associated with alternatively activated zzso and their role in regulating wound healing or zzso responses has not been zzso By using an in zzso model of alternative zzso in which adult zzso zzso zzso are implanted surgically in the zzso cavity of mice, we identified differential expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso was specifically induced by zzso and revealed the zzso zzso as a zzso Chemical zzso of this zzso showed that intact zzso signaling is an important enhancement factor for alternative zzso in zzso and in zzso and is essential for zzso zzso proliferation in zzso Thus, identification of zzso as an zzso zzso led to the discovery that zzso regulates the newly discovered mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Together, the data suggest that negative regulation of zzso signaling via zzso might play a central role in limiting zzso expansion and alternative zzso during type 2 inflammatory zzso
