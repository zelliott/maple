Treatment of cancer patients with zzso like zzso often causes zzso as a result of premature and zzso zzso Because the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signals zzso hair zzso to enter zzso we hypothesized that zzso signaling may be involved in zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso zzso mice were generated by crossing zzso zzso and zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of control mice resulted in zzso while zzso zzso skin was resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso skin entered zzso zzso as indicated by zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso but did not progress to zzso as did zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso responded with less zzso zzso and fewer zzso cells after zzso Treatment of control mice with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso similarly suppressed zzso and zzso progression by zzso Secondary analysis of clinical trials utilizing zzso therapies and zzso chemotherapy also revealed evidence for involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrated the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso zzso which will help in the design of novel therapeutic regimens to minimize zzso zzso
