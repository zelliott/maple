zzso signaling is required for appropriate cell migration and zzso patterning during zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein activated in response to zzso zzso is expressed in the developing zzso bud and in zzso zzso cells in the adult zzso zzso protein is expressed in a complementary pattern, first in the zzso zzso the zzso bud during zzso and then in the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in mouse of either zzso or zzso induced zzso in the development of the zzso network, including significant zzso in zzso zzso decreased terminal zzso and zzso and disorganization of the zzso zzso At later zzso some zzso zzso overcame these early delays, but went on to exhibit enlarged and chaotic zzso zzso and decreased terminal zzso these zzso are suggestive of a role for zzso in spatial patterning or structural organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited decreased migration in response to zzso zzso in zzso a response that required zzso These observations highlight a role for zzso signaling in the directed migration of zzso zzso cells driving zzso zzso into the zzso fat pad and provide the first evidence that zzso signaling may be crucial for regulating the migration and organization of zzso zzso
