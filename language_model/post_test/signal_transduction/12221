zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso exposed to ambient air particulate matter has been suggested to be a key factor in the zzso of inflammatory and allergic diseases in the zzso However, receptors and mechanisms underlying these responses have not been fully zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso zzso and the key zzso zzso zzso mediate the expression of zzso zzso and zzso by mouse zzso zzso exposed to fine and coarse zzso zzso zzso blunted zzso zzso and zzso expression in response to fine zzso while not affecting zzso ability of coarse zzso Standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso showed inhibited zzso expression upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso but exhibited normal responses to zzso zzso with zzso B markedly suppressed the capacity of zzso zzso zzso to elicit zzso and zzso indicating zzso as a principal zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells imparted zzso sensitivity, as judged by zzso gene zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression of the zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso this zzso zzso with the shared use of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso responses of zzso zzso to both types of air PM were significantly zzso These data indicate differential zzso of zzso and zzso but shared use of zzso by fine and coarse air pollution zzso
