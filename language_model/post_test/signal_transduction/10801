To investigate the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso tissue growth factor zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with transforming growth factor zzso 

zzso of rat were isolated by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso the activated zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso for 24, 48 and 72 zzso zzso was detected by flow zzso The expression of zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and then zzso was detected by zzso 

zzso zzso to zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso zzso expression decreased after the zzso being incubated with zzso zzso zzso for 48 h zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso in zzso but this effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso within 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso 

zzso may have an zzso effect on the signal pathways of zzso including the expression of zzso zzso and zzso
