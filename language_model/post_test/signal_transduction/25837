zzso genes zzso receptors for a signaling zzso that regulates cell growth and differentiation in various zzso but the role of zzso signaling in osteogenesis is not well zzso zzso controls zzso differentiation by affecting zzso but the question arises whether normal zzso differentiation can occur regardless of the presence of zzso In this study, we observed the zzso of zzso signaling during zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins reduced zzso activity to a marked zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity by zzso the zzso zzso Using deletion zzso we also determined that the zzso domain of zzso was crucial to the binding and zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein level paralleled reduced expression of zzso which is a downstream target of zzso during zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso is an inhibitor of the zzso signaling zzso during normal zzso zzso
