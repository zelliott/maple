zzso zzso factor zzso is implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity in the adult zzso but the cellular mechanisms are little zzso Here we used zzso zzso of zzso to trigger long-term zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso infusion led to rapid zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso protein zzso These effects were restricted to the infused zzso zzso no changes were observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Local infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso delivery abolished zzso and the associated zzso zzso Application of zzso inhibitor during established zzso had no zzso zzso of zzso is therefore required for the zzso but not the zzso of zzso zzso was further coupled to zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso response zzso zzso Finally, we investigated the expression of two immediate early zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso both of which are required for generation of late, zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion resulted in selective zzso of zzso and protein for zzso In zzso zzso showed that Arc transcripts are rapidly and extensively delivered to zzso cell zzso zzso blocked Arc zzso in parallel with zzso The results support a model in which zzso triggers long-lasting synaptic strengthening through zzso and selective induction of the zzso zzso species zzso
