The unique energy demands of zzso require zzso distribution and maintenance of zzso Thus, dynamic properties of zzso including zzso fusion, trafficking, zzso and degradation, are critical to all cells, but may be particularly important in zzso zzso in zzso dynamics has been linked to zzso and is increasingly being linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, but the evidence is particularly strong, and continuously zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso The unique characteristics of zzso that zzso in zzso may zzso those zzso populations to zzso to zzso in zzso zzso In addition, evidence from zzso toxins supports that zzso zzso fusion, and transport may be involved in zzso Furthermore, rapidly increasing evidence suggests that two proteins linked to familial forms of the disease, zzso and zzso interact in a common zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso may also play a role in maintaining zzso zzso through targeting damaged zzso for zzso Taken together, the current data suggests that zzso dynamics may play a role in zzso zzso and a better understanding of zzso dynamics within the zzso may lead to future therapeutic treatments for zzso potentially aimed at some of the earliest zzso zzso
