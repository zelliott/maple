We tested in zzso zzso the nature of the maternal signal that zzso zzso information to the developing zzso As previous investigations have identified maternal hormonal and zzso components in this process, the specific goal of this presentation is to determine quality of the signal that zzso zzso when it is imparted to the zzso Does the function of the signal received by the fetus best support the coincidence or duration hypotheses of zzso zzso zzso zzso received 1 or 8 zzso zzso or vehicle infusions zzso zzso of intact mothers zzso on 16 zzso of light per day zzso experienced zzso suppression of zzso development when reared on zzso However, when intact mothers zzso on zzso received a zzso zzso infusion daily at zzso zzso their young responded to zzso with greatly accelerated zzso zzso In the absence of the maternal zzso zzso (and, therefore, the maternal zzso zzso the effects of maternal zzso infusions were zzso Here, only the juveniles of zzso females infused at zzso zzso daily responded to zzso with enhanced zzso zzso All other groups showed the same extent of zzso development, independent of the time or type of infusion their mothers zzso zzso development on zzso of all juveniles from zzso mothers zzso on zzso was of the same zzso regardless of the type and time of infusion their mothers received during zzso The results suggest that the maternal signal transferred to the fetuses during gestation consists not only of the daily zzso zzso but also some zzso component that greatly affects the effect of the zzso The timing, and not the zzso of the maternal zzso signal with respect to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso day is of crucial importance in the transfer of zzso information from mother to zzso
