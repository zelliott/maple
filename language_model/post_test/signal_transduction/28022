Cell zzso spreading and migration require the dynamic formation and zzso of contacts with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the number, availability and distribution of zzso binding sites dictate the shape of a cell and determine its zzso To zzso the geometrical limits of zzso binding sites required for cell attachment and zzso we used zzso printing to produce regular patterns of zzso protein dots of defined size separated by zzso zzso zzso cultured on these zzso adhere to and spread on zzso regions as small as zzso zzso when spacing between dots is less than 5 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a cell to adapt its shape to the zzso zzso The ability to spread and migrate on dots zzso or zzso zzso zzso when the dot separation is zzso or zzso zzso The extent of cell spreading is directly correlated to the total zzso coverage with zzso but irrespective of the geometrical zzso An optimal spreading extent is reached at a surface coating above zzso zzso of these geometrical limits is essential for an understanding of cell zzso and migration, and for the design of artificial surfaces that zzso interact with cells in a living zzso
