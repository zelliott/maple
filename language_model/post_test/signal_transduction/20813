The zzso acid receptors zzso and zzso X zzso which are members of the nuclear zzso family, mediate the effects of vitamin A derivatives on cellular growth and zzso The protein zzso C zzso family also controls these processes in response to zzso zzso We have investigated the relationship between these two signal zzso pathways using gene transfer zzso We show that selective zzso of protein zzso C zzso and its depletion by prolonged treatment with zzso lead to the loss of zzso zzso of an zzso zzso The effect of the depletion in cellular zzso could be zzso by zzso of zzso alpha and is directly correlated to the loss of the zzso activity of complexes containing the human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated an altered zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, direct in zzso zzso of zzso alpha by zzso diminished its ability to form zzso or zzso complexes on a zzso acid response element, suggesting that the zzso capacity of zzso alpha in intact cells is indirectly controlled by a zzso zzso Thus our observations establish a functional link between the zzso and zzso zzso which are generally considered to have zzso activities on differentiation zzso
