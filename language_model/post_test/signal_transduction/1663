zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso zzso factor that regulates zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso are potent therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and zzso zzso zzso also prevent inflammation in animal models, suggesting their use for the treatment of human inflammatory zzso Experimental allergic zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inflammatory zzso disease model of multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso and zzso In this study we have examined the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso In zzso treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso decreased the duration and clinical severity of active zzso and adoptive transfer models of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso in association with a decrease in zzso production and differentiation of neural zzso zzso zzso In zzso treatment of activated T cells with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso These findings highlight the fact that zzso zzso regulate central nervous system inflammation and zzso by zzso zzso production, zzso signaling and zzso differentiation in zzso
