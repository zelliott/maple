zzso advances have been realized during the past five years in the understanding of the zzso by which zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso cells leads to characteristic cellular zzso There is now strong experimental evidence to support the concept that specific receptors for the zzso A component of zzso do, in fact, exist and are functional on these zzso While the available data do not rule out a potential contribution of zzso zzso interactions of zzso A with the membrane zzso in the cellular zzso process, it would appear that interaction with the zzso zzso alone is sufficient to initiate zzso Whether there exist more than one molecular entity which might function on zzso cell zzso as a specific zzso for zzso or whether different cell types may manifest different zzso receptors remains as an interesting area for future zzso Further, the concept that molecular complexes of zzso with zzso host zzso such as the acute phase zzso binding zzso might trigger additional novel pathways for cell zzso is both exciting and of potential zzso The precise mechanism or mechanisms by which zzso zzso interactions translate into appropriate zzso zzso events is currently zzso Clearly there exists evidence for contribution of many of the traditional second signals, although at present, the data are incomplete and not always consistent between zzso Of potential concern in this respect are the sometimes rather striking differences noted between zzso A and intact zzso containing zzso While such differences may be significant and important, it should be remembered that zzso itself is a potent stimulus for many zzso cell zzso and any zzso pathways must zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In any case, it is likely that the further zzso characterization of zzso receptors will yield crucial information for the eventual zzso of the precise pathways for zzso zzso zzso Such information will be invaluable in the future harnessing of the zzso potential of zzso as well as the zzso of its profound deleterious zzso effects in zzso zzso
