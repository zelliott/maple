Research into understanding bacterial zzso systems has become a paradigm for Systems zzso Experimental and theoretical researchers have worked hand-in-hand for over 40 years to understand the intricate behavior driving bacterial species, in particular how such small zzso usually not more than 5 zzso in zzso detect and respond to small changes in their zzso zzso In this review we highlight the importance that theoretical modeling has played in providing new insight and understanding into bacterial zzso We begin with an overview of the bacterial zzso sensory response, before reviewing the role of theoretical modeling in understanding elements of the system on the single cell scale and features underpinning zzso extensions to population zzso
