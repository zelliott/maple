zzso zzso membrane proteins zzso are zzso in the zzso and imported zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso binds and zzso newly zzso zzso in the zzso binds to multiple zzso targeting signals zzso interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso targeting signals, and is essential for zzso targeting and zzso These results show that zzso functions as both a zzso and an import zzso for newly zzso zzso We also demonstrate the existence of two zzso import mechanisms and two classes of zzso class 1 zzso which are bound by zzso and imported in a zzso manner, and class 2 zzso which are not bound by zzso and mediate protein import independently of zzso
