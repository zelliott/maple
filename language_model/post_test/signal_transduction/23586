The human gamma zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso are associated with multiple zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso and possibly other viruses can manipulate the tumor zzso through the zzso of specific viral and cellular components into zzso small zzso derived zzso that are released from zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso cells contain high levels of the viral zzso zzso membrane protein 1 and viral zzso that activate critical signaling pathways in recipient zzso In this study, to determine the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso content, quantitative zzso techniques were performed on zzso zzso from 11 zzso lines that are zzso infected with zzso or with zzso or infected with both zzso Using mass zzso zzso proteins were identified, of which zzso were unique to the viral zzso Analysis by zzso difference gel zzso and spectral counting identified multiple significant changes compared with the zzso control cells and between viral zzso These data predict that both zzso and zzso zzso likely zzso cell death and survival, zzso function, protein zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso suggest that zzso zzso would affect cellular zzso whereas zzso zzso would activate cellular signaling zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso The changes in zzso content identified in this study suggest ways that these zzso viruses zzso the tumor zzso and may provide diagnostic markers specific for zzso and zzso associated zzso
