zzso stress is a contributing factor in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso is one of the major cellular defense mechanisms against zzso zzso This study investigated the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso consisting of the zzso adjacent normal, and distant normal zzso from the zzso specimens of 83 zzso cancer patients were subjected to zzso zzso zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso Parkinson protein 7 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso density of each zzso zzso was digitally zzso The results showed that molecules of the zzso zzso were actively zzso with different expression profiles among the tumor and normal zzso The zzso stress, represented by the mean zzso zzso density of zzso did not differ but was correlated with the expressions of different zzso zzso molecules to a varied extent in tumor and normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significant zzso for the expression of zzso and had the closest proximity to zzso in the cluster zzso of the tumor and distant normal zzso zzso Advanced stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and current smoker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significant zzso with high estimates for zzso in the adjacent and distant normal zzso zzso In zzso cancer, the molecules of the zzso zzso have different expression profiles and a difference in their importance, especially zzso and zzso related to zzso and zzso stress among tumor and normal zzso
