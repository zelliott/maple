We have studied the role of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in DNA repair and zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by DNA damage and zzso zzso 63 and 73 in the zzso domain of zzso which is known to increase its zzso zzso We show that treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso but not the zzso zzso activates zzso about zzso zzso cells, which are highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso 13 zzso modified to express a zzso dominant negative zzso zzso zzso exhibit decreased viability following treatment with zzso but not zzso in proportion zzso zzso zzso to the level of zzso expressed leading to a zzso decreased zzso Similar effects are observed in zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso cells, as well as in zzso cells modified to express zzso a known inhibitor of zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso effect was observed in cells modified to express zzso zzso Furthermore, through quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso we show that zzso expressing cells were inhibited in repair of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas repair is readily zzso zzso zzso zzso in parental zzso These observations indicate that the zzso zzso is activated by zzso DNA damage and that this response is required for DNA repair and viability following zzso zzso zzso of DNA repair following zzso stress may be a normal zzso role of the zzso zzso
