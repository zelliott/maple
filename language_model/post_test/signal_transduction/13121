zzso growth factor zzso regulates cell zzso zzso and zzso transport by using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a downstream zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso is involved in signaling by G zzso zzso growth hormone, and zzso by means of zzso It has been suggested that steroids interact with zzso hormones, in part, by zzso potentially zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso exchange in zzso canine kidney zzso cells by means of zzso in a way similar to growth zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso uses the zzso as a zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induce a rapid increase in zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso exchange activity similar to increases induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso induced a rapid increase in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced the zzso response, whereas prevention of zzso influx did not abolish zzso zzso Our data show that zzso uses the zzso signaling cascade to elicit its rapid effects in zzso zzso
