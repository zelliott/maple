zzso growth zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in many biological zzso The class zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an important downstream zzso of the zzso signaling zzso The aim of this study is to examine the effect of persistent zzso of zzso on gene expression and markers of cellular zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso mice expressing a zzso active zzso in a zzso manner were analyzed at the ages of 3 and 20 zzso zzso of persistent zzso of zzso on gene expression were zzso analyzed using zzso 

Upon comprehensive gene expression zzso the genes whose expression was increased included those for several heat shock zzso The amount and nuclear zzso of a zzso box O zzso protein was zzso In addition, the gene expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso increased, suggesting that the persistent zzso of zzso modified the expression of molecules of zzso zzso The expression of markers of cellular zzso such as zzso zzso activity, cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between old zzso and zzso zzso 

The persistent zzso of zzso modified the expression of molecules of zzso signaling zzso in a transgenic mouse zzso zzso of cellular zzso were not changed in the aged zzso zzso
