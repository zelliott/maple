Fluorescence zzso is an imaging technique that provides insights into signal zzso pathways through the generation of quantitative data, such as the zzso distribution of zzso proteins in signaling zzso The data acquired are, however, usually a composition of both the zzso proteins of interest and of an zzso background, which both undergo zzso during zzso We here present a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations that successfully describes the shuttling of zzso zzso under changing environmental conditions regarding zzso zzso Our analysis separates the different zzso rates of zzso and background, and the zzso zzso By applying our model to experimental data, we can thus extract the zzso signal from the overall acquired signal and investigate the influence of zzso and zzso on zzso We found a stronger regulation of zzso through its zzso than through its zzso when controlled by the zzso zzso with a constant zzso rate independent of the zzso zzso By replacing the term for decreasing excited zzso concentration with a constant, we were able to reconstruct the dynamics of zzso as it would occur without zzso and background zzso Our model effectively demonstrates how data, acquired with an optical zzso can be processed and used for a systems biology analysis of signal zzso zzso
