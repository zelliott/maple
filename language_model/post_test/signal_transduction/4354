In zzso coli the zzso zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso the regulatory zzso zzso zzso of the levels of zzso controls the differential expression of zzso and zzso While the zzso reaction between zzso and zzso has been extensively zzso the zzso involved in the sensing function of zzso are not well zzso We have used a comparative approach to study the sensing function of zzso During our search of numerous bacteria we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso of zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso which is 108 zzso shorter than zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso acid sequence comparison showed that the zzso zzso of the zzso molecules shared 57% sequence zzso In contrast, the large zzso zzso domain of zzso was absent in zzso and was replaced by a shorter zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso was able to complement a delta zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso produced in response to changes in medium zzso in this zzso Further genetic analysis established that zzso zzso between zzso and zzso of zzso coli zzso accounted for the zzso of the delta zzso zzso In addition we show that the zzso molecules of zzso zzso and zzso coli share zzso zzso acid sequence zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein of zzso zzso was able to sense these changes in the zzso of the growth environment and properly regulate the levels of zzso in zzso zzso
