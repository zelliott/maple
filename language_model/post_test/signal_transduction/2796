zzso zzso signals between the zzso and zzso are critical to zzso gut zzso Sonic zzso encodes a zzso protein known to act as an zzso signal in several regions of the developing zzso In this report, we provide evidence to support the role of Sonic zzso and its target genes zzso and the zzso zzso genes in the induction and patterning the chick zzso Sonic is expressed in the definitive zzso at the earliest stage of chick gut zzso Immediately zzso to Sonic expression in the zzso zzso is zzso zzso later to become the visceral zzso of the zzso Genes expressed within this tissue include zzso (a zzso relative implicated in proper growth of visceral zzso and members of the zzso class of zzso genes zzso regulators of pattern in many aspects of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that Sonic zzso is sufficient to induce zzso expression of zzso and specific zzso genes within the zzso Sonic therefore appears to act as a signal in an zzso interaction in the earliest stages of chick zzso zzso zzso pattern is evidenced later in gut zzso with the presence of zzso boundaries reflecting zzso and zzso distinct zzso The expression pattern of the zzso zzso genes remains restricted in the zzso and these zzso expression zzso reflect gut zzso zzso This finding strongly supports a role for these genes in determining the adult gut zzso Our results provide the basis for a model to describe molecular controls of early zzso zzso development and zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso suggest that aspects of gut zzso may be regulated by similar zzso networks in the two zzso
