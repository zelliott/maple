Despite the lack of direct evidence, it is generally believed that zzso signals are zzso by the abundant feedback connections from zzso to zzso sensory zzso Here we provide direct evidence for a zzso zzso We stained the visual zzso of the ferret with a zzso dye and presented a zzso contrast zzso This zzso an initial zzso and lateral spreading zzso at the square representation in areas 17 and zzso After a zzso a broad feedback wave zzso of zzso peak zzso traveled from areas 21 and 19 toward areas 18 and zzso In areas 18 and 17, the zzso contributed the peak zzso of zzso of the zzso representing the square, after which the zzso decreased their zzso and zzso zzso the peak zzso surrounded the figure representation over most of areas 17 and 18 representing the zzso Thus, the zzso is an example of a well behaved long-range communication from zzso visual areas to areas 18 and 17, collectively addressing very large populations of zzso representing the visual zzso Through local interaction with zzso and lateral spreading zzso the zzso zzso activates zzso representing the object and zzso representing the zzso
