The zzso gene is a zzso regulator involved in the zzso syndrome, which affects normal facial and tooth zzso Several clinical reports point to a common zzso zzso in the teeth of patients with zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the zzso regulation, and function of zzso during mouse zzso zzso zzso expression is restricted to zzso cells that give rise to the zzso producing zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso requires zzso zzso dental zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso dental and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso molecules are able to maintain zzso zzso expression during zzso zzso of zzso in dental zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice is zzso showing a genetic link between zzso signaling and zzso in zzso zzso expression of zzso in dental zzso activates zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso expression in developing teeth is under control of zzso signaling and zzso with determination of the zzso zzso
