Human zzso and zzso are known to produce the zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso and obesity was found to be state of increased zzso production of these zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the regulation of zzso gene expression in human zzso Human zzso zzso in primary culture and the zzso cell line were used as cell zzso zzso were zzso using various zzso and promoter activity was measured as zzso zzso zzso expression was measured by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression and zzso of the protein in a zzso zzso This effect was reversed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also reduced zzso expression and zzso promoter zzso zzso Further experiments revealed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In conclusion our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression and release from human zzso via a zzso but not a zzso zzso
