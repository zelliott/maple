zzso gene zzso was first identified as a partner of zzso in generating the zzso zzso zzso and is also involved in zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso role is still unknown, but the presence of a number of motifs involved in protein interactions suggests that it may function by zzso with other zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso associates and regulates the activity of the zzso zzso zzso In this study by zzso zzso screening we identified zzso and zzso two proteins modulating the zzso pathway, as novel zzso zzso These interactions were further characterized in zzso and in zzso We provide evidence that zzso and zzso may be part of the same high molecular weight zzso zzso enhances the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso in inducing zzso zzso We suggest that zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso
