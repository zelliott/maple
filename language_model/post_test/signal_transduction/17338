The zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a pivotal role in organ size control by balancing cell proliferation and cell zzso Here, we reported the identification of zzso as a regulator of the zzso signaling zzso using a zzso zzso screen in zzso zzso zzso of zzso elevated zzso activity, resulting in increased zzso target gene expression and tissue zzso while loss of zzso diminished zzso target gene expression and reduced organ zzso We demonstrated that zzso functioned downstream of fat and expanded and upstream of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we also found that zzso physically zzso with zzso and zzso and regulated the zzso of zzso at zzso to restrict its zzso zzso also inhibited the association of zzso and zzso resulting in zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we provided evidence that zzso zzso regulation is zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings identified zzso as a novel component of the zzso signaling zzso
