We have recently shown that zzso zzso the formation of zzso and cell invasion by suppressing zzso zzso while enhanced zzso strongly zzso the zzso invasive zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso and zzso play zzso roles in cell invasion is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso is a required downstream zzso of zzso in inducing zzso structures and related invasive zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso through the suppression of zzso and the zzso protein zzso a known zzso zzso In contrast, enhanced zzso zzso zzso function and zzso zzso formation by zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso function, also zzso the zzso zzso zzso thereby further enhancing the zzso potential of the zzso Furthermore, the protein zzso activity of zzso plays a major role in the negative regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that cellular zzso is dependent on the balance between two opposing zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso tumor zzso zzso
