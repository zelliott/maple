Bone zzso proteins zzso are required for normal zzso bone formation and zzso zzso There is evidence from recent studies that zzso signaling in zzso is controlled by an zzso regulatory mechanism involving a cascade of zzso zzso The specificity of protein zzso is determined by zzso zzso zzso which play a crucial role in defining zzso specificity and subsequent protein degradation by zzso zzso We have examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso a member of the zzso domain family of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been found to interact with zzso zzso and -5 and to mediate degradation of these zzso zzso Recently we have found that zzso mediates the protein degradation of the zzso zzso factor zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso in the present studies we zzso a zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso precursor cells and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in bone formation in zzso we generated transgenic mice in which expression of the zzso zzso zzso was targeted to zzso using the zzso zzso zzso type I collagen zzso In these transgenic mice, bone formation was significantly reduced during zzso zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso plays a specific role in zzso differentiation and bone formation in zzso
