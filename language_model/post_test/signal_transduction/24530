zzso (also known as zzso is a novel zzso zzso adapter zzso that is expressed on the cell surface of natural killer cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso have been zzso The in zzso function of zzso and its zzso molecules in inflammation has remained primarily zzso To investigate zzso signaling during chronic zzso we constructed two zzso gene transfer zzso to express zzso zzso and the zzso domain of mouse zzso and the zzso portion of human zzso zzso zzso respectively, and observed their zzso activities in a mouse model of zzso zzso inflammation zzso by zzso zzso Mice were injected with zzso A zzso and 24 hours after zzso A, they were injected with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation peaked at day 7 and markedly declined by day zzso Although zzso zzso gene transfer did not enhance zzso formation by day 7, it sustained and enhanced zzso formation beyond day zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso used to zzso the signaling of zzso zzso enhanced zzso formation at day zzso In sharp contrast to the effect by zzso zzso expression in the liver of soluble form of zzso domain of zzso as an zzso of zzso zzso remarkably inhibited zzso zzso zzso formation at all time points zzso Our findings thus suggest that both zzso and zzso are involved in the development of zzso responses in the zzso
