To investigate the expression of zzso in zzso and development of colon zzso and to reveal their correlation with the zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso and western zzso in 32 specimens from patients with colon zzso 

The positive rate of zzso was significantly lower in colon zzso zzso than that in normal control zzso zzso zzso and the positive rate of zzso was significantly higher in colon zzso zzso than that in normal control zzso zzso zzso and expression level of zzso and zzso were related to zzso zzso distant invasion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso stage zzso A negative correlation was observed between the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso accompanied by the loss of zzso involves zzso and development of colon zzso
