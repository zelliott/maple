The zzso system is critically involved in synaptic models of learning and memory by enhancing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests zzso zzso of membrane currents and zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso to study spread of zzso zzso after focal application into brain slice and zzso zzso zzso of synaptic responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso rapidly blocked the zzso slow zzso zzso following repetitive zzso In contrast, the time course of zzso of the slow zzso zzso zzso during synaptic input was slower and followed the time course of spread of zzso to the zzso zzso With zzso application, zzso of the zzso zzso and of zzso zzso responses followed spread of zzso to the entire zzso zzso tree, whereas the zzso was blocked only after spread of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso recordings, zzso blocked a small zzso zzso the zzso and rather reduced zzso action zzso zzso of zzso zzso signals was highly correlated to zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso blocked approximately zzso of the zzso in control and during zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso suppression of the zzso zzso can augment firing and thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by blockade of the zzso and direct enhancement of zzso zzso zzso currents zzso zzso signals even when firing is not affected due to zzso zzso In this way, zzso zzso zzso may contribute to parallel information processing and storage by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
