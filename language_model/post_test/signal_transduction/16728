To investigate the influence of activated complement on the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso in the production of zzso oxide zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso especially in the role of different zzso zzso in this process after zzso 

The mice inflicted by zzso zzso zzso zzso was established and employed as the zzso And the mice were divided into A (the zzso were preserved and zzso and B (with zzso injection of zzso to zzso complement before zzso zzso The plasma of the mice in the two groups was collected at 6 zzso hour zzso and cultured with zzso from normal zzso The zzso were zzso with zzso toxin zzso and with zzso toxin zzso The NO and zzso levels in the zzso of normal zzso culture with different zzso were measured by zzso zzso 

The NO and zzso contents in group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obviously higher than those in group B zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The NO content produced by zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso in A group decreased zzso zzso zzso while the zzso activity zzso zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, the NO content produced by zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso in group A increased zzso zzso zzso while the zzso activity (27 zzso zzso decreased by CT zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicates that the zzso function of normal zzso can be enhanced by complement zzso after zzso injury, which might partly be due to the effect of activated complement components through complement zzso coupled zzso In the zzso function of complement zzso zzso zzso protein has a major role in the production of zzso zzso protein is mainly involved in the zzso of zzso
