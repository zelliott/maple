Overnight culture of Swiss zzso cells in zzso medium leads to loss of focal zzso and associated zzso stress zzso although the cells remain well zzso The small zzso protein zzso is required for the formation of stress zzso and focal zzso induced by growth factors such as zzso acid zzso in zzso Swiss zzso cells, and for the zzso zzso zzso of several focal zzso zzso zzso of cells on zzso zzso proteins also stimulates protein zzso zzso and the formation of stress zzso and focal zzso in the absence of added growth zzso These responses were inhibited in cells zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and stress zzso formation was also triggered by addition of a zzso zzso which is zzso by a number of zzso and is contained within the cell binding domain of a variety of zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was blocked by zzso cells with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso binding to zzso stimulates a zzso assembly of focal zzso These experiments indicate that zzso is involved in zzso downstream of zzso
