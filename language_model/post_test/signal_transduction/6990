How zzso and zzso develop and maintain their characteristic three-dimensional cellular architecture is often a poorly understood part of their zzso program; yet, as is clearly the case for the eye zzso precise regulation of these features can be critical for zzso During lens zzso cells become organized into a zzso zzso structure with a zzso of zzso cells zzso the zzso tips of zzso fiber zzso zzso cells zzso and progeny that shift below the lens zzso differentiate into new fibers that are progressively added to the fiber zzso It is now known that zzso zzso zzso to fiber zzso however, it is not fully understood how these two forms of cells assemble into their characteristic polarized zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso fibers become zzso towards islands of zzso cells and mimic their polarized arrangement in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the culture medium and we show that zzso can promote directed behavior of lens zzso We also show that these zzso replicate aspects of the zzso signaling activity that has been shown to regulate proliferation of zzso cells in zzso Thus, our in zzso study identifies a novel zzso intrinsic to the two forms of lens cells, that zzso zzso into the polarized arrangement characteristic of the lens in zzso In this way the zzso with its relatively simple cellular zzso serves as a useful model to highlight the importance of such intrinsic zzso mechanisms in tissue zzso and zzso zzso
