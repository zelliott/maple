The zzso barrier zzso is crucial to the health of the brain and is often compromised in neurological zzso Moreover, because of its barrier properties, this zzso interface restricts zzso of zzso Thus, a renewable source of human zzso zzso could spur brain research and pharmaceutical zzso Here we show that zzso cells derived from human zzso stem cells zzso acquire zzso properties when zzso with neural cells that provide relevant cues, including those involved in zzso zzso The resulting zzso cells have many zzso zzso including well-organized tight zzso appropriate expression of zzso zzso and polarized zzso zzso zzso zzso they respond to zzso acquiring substantial barrier properties as measured by zzso electrical resistance zzso zzso 140 zzso zzso and they possess molecular zzso that zzso well with in zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso
