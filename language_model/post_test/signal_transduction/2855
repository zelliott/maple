The recent identification of zzso as a zzso zzso in zzso patterning means that we now have a known signal for control of each of the three limb zzso zzso growth factors can allow zzso patterning and Sonic zzso gene expression signals zzso zzso Networks of these signals not only coordinate cell responses, but also mutually maintain each zzso A positive feedback loop is established which coordinates expression of Sonic zzso in zzso cells of the polarizing region and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso also influences Sonic zzso expression in the polarizing zzso zzso of development of a complete limb can be achieved with just one zzso a growth zzso
