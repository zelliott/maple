To identify the zzso of the third zzso loop of the zzso II zzso type zzso zzso zzso in G protein zzso specificity and zzso zzso several zzso were constructed and zzso The zzso sequence zzso the zzso segment of the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was replaced with the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso type 2 zzso zzso These zzso receptors were zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, and their pharmacological and functional properties were zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation into DNA, and zzso The affinities of these zzso receptors for zzso zzso and zzso were essentially zzso however, the affinity of these zzso was increased by a factor of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The functional properties of the zzso zzso were essentially identical to those of the wild type zzso zzso On the other hand, replacement with the zzso segment produced a partial reduction of the zzso zzso production, a measurable zzso zzso zzso a reduced zzso and a total impairment to zzso the zzso effect of zzso The zzso zzso presented a normal zzso but was inactive in all the other functional zzso In conclusion, the zzso segment of the third zzso loop of the rat zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso selectivity and zzso signaling via G zzso as well as in the zzso of the specific signaling pathways involved in the zzso actions of zzso
