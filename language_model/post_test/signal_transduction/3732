We wished to determine whether the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso is modulated by chronic zzso in zzso 

We investigated the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO production in cultured zzso rat zzso subjected to zzso zzso for 48 zzso Among several zzso tested, zzso was the most effective in stimulating NO production, which was maximum at 48 zzso In zzso zzso induced expression of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone had no effect on NO production, zzso gene zzso or protein zzso However, chronic zzso decreased zzso NO production, zzso zzso and protein level in cardiac zzso zzso binding and zzso mobility shift zzso showed that during chronic zzso zzso zzso density and activity of the zzso factor zzso induced by zzso were zzso which may account at least in part for the decrease in zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and NO generation in zzso rat zzso and that chronic zzso appears to be a potent negative regulator of zzso expression in these zzso
