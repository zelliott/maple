The beta 3 zzso alpha zzso beta 3 and alpha V beta 3, are prominently expressed on the surfaces of zzso and zzso cells, zzso This vascular zzso places them in a strategic position to perform adhesive functions necessary for zzso wound healing and zzso In addition, these zzso are now known to serve a signaling function, zzso environmental cues on either side of the plasma membrane can be transmitted across the membrane to the other zzso Indeed, preliminary studies indicate that these dual function receptors are wired to other signaling pathways within zzso and zzso cells, thus helping to explain how zzso cell zzso can affect zzso organization and cell zzso as well as zzso cell growth, differentiation and zzso
