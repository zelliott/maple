zzso of blood is required for zzso mosquitoes to initiate zzso cycles determining their role as zzso of devastating human zzso zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein precursor genes is zzso until mosquitoes take zzso Previously, we have shown that to signal the presence of blood in the gut, mosquitoes zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso acid signal zzso the major zzso protein precursor zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a zzso factor zzso that is zzso after a blood meal and acts as a zzso zzso of zzso We showed that zzso bound specifically to zzso sites present in the zzso promoter region of the zzso gene and positively regulated zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso knock down of zzso transcript resulted in a significant zzso of zzso expression in both zzso tissue culture and zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the fat body prior to blood zzso However, translation of zzso was activated by blood feeding because the zzso protein increased dramatically in the fat body of zzso zzso This increase was also reproduced in the zzso culture zzso with zzso zzso zzso translation was inhibited by zzso and zzso as well as by zzso zzso knock down of zzso zzso These experiments have revealed that the zzso signaling zzso induced by nutritional signaling regulates the translation of a zzso factor, which is the specific zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
