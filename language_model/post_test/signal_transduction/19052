Plant zzso zzso zzso play important roles in a variety of cellular zzso Previous evidence from this laboratory indicates that the expression of a class 1 zzso gene zzso from cotton is induced in cotton roots challenged with the zzso zzso zzso The present study examined further the expression patterns of the zzso gene in cotton plants and characterized its in zzso function through zzso zzso of the gene in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cotton plants was induced by zzso applied salicylic acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso overproduction of zzso in zzso led to zzso expression of the defense genes zzso and zzso and zzso enhanced disease resistance to zzso zzso and tolerance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more tolerant to zzso NO and contained lower levels of cellular NO than the zzso zzso Moreover, transgenic plants with relatively high levels of expression of the zzso gene developed spontaneous hypersensitive zzso on the leaves in the absence of pathogen zzso Our results indicate that zzso proteins play a role in the defense responses against pathogen zzso possibly by modulating the NO level and the ratio of zzso in the defense zzso
