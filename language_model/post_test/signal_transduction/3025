zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso expressed in human skin zzso In addition to its well-known role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso signaling that may promote cancer development and zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso activates these signaling pathways and the relative contribution of its signaling and zzso functions in tumor progression are poorly zzso In this study we show that zzso associates with zzso zzso the major protein of specialized membrane zzso called zzso which functions in both membrane protein turnover and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso contains a putative zzso zzso A permeable competing zzso resembling the zzso scaffolding domain bound to zzso disrupted normal zzso zzso and zzso with the integrity of zzso sheets in zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso is zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso shed product and a zzso zzso fragment, the latter of which zzso to zzso zzso along with full-length zzso zzso of zzso zzso shifted zzso to the zzso zzso leading to the zzso of these zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso products are elevated in zzso in skin tumors from transgenic mice zzso zzso zzso these data are consistent with the possibility that zzso of truncated zzso protein interferes with zzso assembly and/or maintenance to disrupt zzso zzso Furthermore, the association of zzso with zzso may provide a mechanism for regulating zzso signaling and modulating the zzso presentation of an important zzso zzso both of which could contribute to zzso transformation and tumor zzso
