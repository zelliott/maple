zzso zzso small zzso zzso molecules can function as zzso or tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the most prevalent zzso worldwide with a zzso survival rate of approximately zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and cell lines was investigated using quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The functions of zzso in zzso and lung colonization were determined by zzso and tail vein injection zzso zzso zzso targets of zzso were determined by software zzso correlation with target protein zzso and zzso reporter zzso The signaling pathways involved in regulation of zzso were investigated using the zzso zzso 

We observed reduced levels of zzso identified as one of the most zzso zzso in zzso and all tested zzso cell lines compared to normal oral zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells markedly reduced migration and invasion in zzso as well as lung colonization in zzso When evaluating the specific targets of zzso we found that zzso zzso expression zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso protein and that the expression of zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso of a reporter gene markedly reduced zzso activity in zzso cells expressing zzso suggesting that zzso reduces zzso activity by targeting the zzso of zzso zzso When evaluating the mechanisms of zzso zzso we observed the zzso of zzso expression in zzso conditions and its suppression in response to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso suppression of zzso suggesting the negative regulation of zzso expression by zzso zzso 

Overall, results indicate that zzso functions as a tumor zzso zzso in zzso cells and mutually regulates zzso expression in a zzso zzso
