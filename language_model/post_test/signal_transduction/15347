The combined activity of three zzso factors can zzso adult cells into induced zzso stem cells zzso However, the transgenic methods used for delivering zzso factors have raised concerns regarding the future utility of the resulting stem zzso These uncertainties could be overcome if each transgenic factor were replaced with a small zzso that either directly activated its expression from the zzso zzso or in some way compensated for its zzso To this end, we have used zzso chemical screening to identify small molecules that can replace zzso in zzso We show that one of these molecules functions in zzso by zzso zzso signaling in a stable and trapped intermediate cell type that forms during the zzso We find that this zzso promotes the completion of zzso through induction of the zzso factor zzso
