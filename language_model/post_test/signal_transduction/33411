zzso zzso C zzso is a primary group of zzso zzso signal zzso for a wide variety of functions in many different cell zzso Its zzso has been implicated in various inflammatory zzso In zzso inflammatory cells, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are primed and activated compared with those obtained from control zzso In particular, they release higher amounts of zzso oxygen zzso zzso has been known to play an important role in the respiratory burst of human zzso In this study, the zzso activity was measured in blood zzso and zzso zzso from control zzso zzso zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso In zzso the total zzso activity was significantly lower in zzso from stable zzso zzso zzso and unstable zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, compared with control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso for controls and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso the percentage of membrane zzso was significantly higher in stable zzso patients in both cell zzso After stimulation of zzso with zzso a significant decrease in total zzso activity was observed in both control and zzso zzso We have found an abnormal regulation of zzso activity in both blood zzso and AM in zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the functional zzso of inflammatory cells observed in zzso
