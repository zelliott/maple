zzso inhibitor of protein zzso zzso plays an important role in preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso It is an zzso zzso that targets the zzso translation initiation factor zzso initiation factor 2 zzso The aim of this study was to determine the roles of zzso in protecting against diabetic zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A rat diabetic model was established by zzso injection of zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso or zzso into rat retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso was determined by assessing the Evans Blue retinal zzso To zzso the zzso level in cultured rat retinal zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso interference zzso was introduced in these zzso Real time reverse zzso zzso and western zzso analyses were performed to evaluate the zzso and protein levels of zzso binding protein zzso zzso protein zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso 

zzso blood vessel leakage was significantly decreased in zzso diabetic rats compared with the control diabetic zzso Both zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of diabetic rats were remarkably reduced in zzso zzso In zzso study further demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso under high zzso conditions, whereas introduction of zzso enhanced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso 

These results revealed the protecting role of zzso against zzso zzso DR in diabetic rats, suggesting that zzso may act as a zzso gene during zzso
