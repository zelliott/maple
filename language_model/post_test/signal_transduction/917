T cell zzso to minor zzso zzso zzso is responsible for rejection of zzso zzso limiting the effectiveness of transplantation for the treatment of zzso organ zzso The zzso gene zzso is located on the Y zzso and encodes an zzso zzso that zzso rejection of male zzso by female zzso zzso a network of regulatory T zzso cells that is capable of zzso zzso cells to adopt a tolerant zzso offers an attractive strategy for immune intervention in such deleterious immune zzso While various approaches have successfully induced a dominant form of transplantation zzso they share the propensity to provoke zzso incomplete zzso of T zzso By identifying the T cell zzso zzso contact sites of the dominant zzso of the zzso gene product, we have designed an altered zzso zzso zzso that delivers incomplete signals to zzso T cells from A1 zzso zzso mice that are transgenic for a complementary zzso Administration of this zzso to female transgenic mice zzso T cells toward a regulatory zzso securing a form of dominant tolerance to male skin zzso that is capable of resisting rejection by zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that incomplete signaling through the zzso may establish a network of zzso cells that may be harnessed in the service of transplantation zzso
