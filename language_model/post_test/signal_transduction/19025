Despite adequately expressing functional receptors for tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso many cultured tumor cells are zzso to the zzso effect of this zzso zzso zzso drugs have been shown to zzso with zzso to mediate zzso in cancer zzso The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of either zzso or zzso two common used zzso agents for solid tumors, on enhancing zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cancer cells and to examine the role of the zzso zzso zzso cascade in zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso or zzso sequential combinations in zzso Cell viability and zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso were created by zzso gene zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso 3, 6, 8, and 9 were measured by commercially available kits using fluorescent zzso 

All cell lines zzso expressed high levels of zzso and/or zzso and low levels of zzso all of which were not altered by zzso drug zzso zzso of these cancer cells with zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso increased their zzso to zzso by twofold to zzso zzso synergistic induction of zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso of primary normal cells was affected by neither zzso nor the combinations of chemotherapy and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso 9 activity completely zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating the essential role of the zzso death signaling cascade in this zzso zzso zzso of zzso 8 in zzso cells was completely suppressed either by zzso zzso or by blocking of the activity of the zzso zzso 9, thus identifying the amplification feedback loop as the source of elevated zzso 8 zzso Finally, zzso amplification of zzso 8 activity was indispensable for complete zzso zzso and full execution of zzso because suppression of its activity using the selective zzso 6 inhibitor zzso downstream of the zzso 3 but upstream of the zzso 8 in the feedback zzso resulted in profound suppression of not only zzso 8 activity but also those of zzso 9 and 3, as well as complete protection of cancer cells from zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso interacts with zzso to mediate profound induction of zzso The zzso zzso zzso cascade and the amplification feedback loop are essential for the complete execution of the cell death zzso Furthermore, our data identify zzso as the direct target for the development of more refined strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect of zzso as an zzso zzso
