During zzso zzso cells are exposed to increasing amounts of alcohol, which is stressful and affects both growth and zzso On the molecular level, numerous aspects of alcohol stress signaling remain zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso finger protein that zzso zzso between nucleus and zzso but accumulates in the nucleus upon exposure to ethanol, zzso or zzso zzso zzso of this protein is not altered by zzso zzso or heat stress or during nitrogen or zzso zzso Because of its exclusive sensitivity to environmental alcohol, the protein was called zzso for Alcohol Sensitive zzso finger 1 zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso is zzso zzso and requires a functional zzso zzso zzso contains two N terminally located zzso nuclear export sequences zzso required for nuclear zzso zzso it accumulates in the nucleus of zzso cells at restrictive temperature and forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso leads to sensitivity in growth on medium containing alcohol or zzso consistent with a function of zzso in alcohol-related zzso zzso is the first reported protein that changes its zzso zzso specifically upon exposure to alcohol and therefore represents a key element in the analysis of zzso zzso
