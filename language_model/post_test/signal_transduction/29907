The zzso family consists of a large number of zzso zzso zzso factors, many of which have been implicated in tumor zzso zzso studies on this family of proteins have focused so far mainly on the zzso properties and cellular functions of individual zzso Since most of the zzso factors can bind to the core consensus DNA sequence zzso in zzso it has been a challenge to differentiate redundant from specific functions of various zzso proteins in zzso Recent findings, however, suggest that such apparent zzso may in fact be a central component of a network of zzso regulated specific zzso factors, resulting in distinct biological and pathological zzso The programmed zzso zzso appears to play a critical role during tumor zzso especially in control of cellular changes during zzso transition and zzso zzso of multiple zzso gene functions also mediates interactions between tumor and zzso zzso As such, these new insights may provide a novel view of the zzso gene family as well as a focal point for studying the complex biological control involved in tumor zzso
