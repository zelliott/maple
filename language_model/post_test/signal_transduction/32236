Combining synthetic biology and materials science will enable more advanced studies of cellular regulatory zzso in addition to zzso therapeutic applications of engineered gene zzso One approach is to couple genetic zzso into zzso thereby generating zzso zzso that are capable of controlling intrinsic and zzso cellular zzso Here, we have engineered zzso to present the genetic zzso zzso with different modes of zzso genetic circuits in zzso and in zzso Gene circuits were activated in materials with zzso embedded within the scaffold walls or chemically linked to the zzso In addition, systemic applications of zzso were used to induce genetic circuits in cells zzso into materials and implanted in zzso The flexibility of zzso zzso with genetic zzso allows for patterned placement of these zzso that can be used to generate distinct patterns of gene zzso Together, these genetically interactive materials can be used to characterize genetic circuits in environments that more closely mimic zzso natural zzso settings, to better explore complex zzso and zzso zzso and to facilitate therapeutic applications of synthetic zzso
