Physical properties of the zzso zzso zzso can control cellular zzso via zzso which is the process of translation of mechanical stresses into zzso zzso While current research is clarifying the relationship between zzso and zzso or zzso complexes, the contribution of zzso factors to zzso is not well zzso The results of this study revealed that the zzso factor zzso a major regulator for zzso and cancer zzso is responsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso was temporarily induced in zzso lung zzso cells grown on a stiff zzso but not in cells grown on a soft zzso Although the zzso of zzso was independent of the activity of zzso zzso an zzso zzso the zzso was dependent on zzso zzso induced by zzso of zzso regulatory light chain zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduced the activity of zzso We also observed zzso zzso of the cells, with cells grown on the soft zzso appearing more rounded and cells grown on the stiff zzso appearing more spread zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a reversal of these zzso on both zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso activity via zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso
