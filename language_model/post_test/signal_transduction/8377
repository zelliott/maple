The zzso is a prime example of inherently complex biological system with zzso and zzso feedback zzso in zzso forming the basic properties of zzso zzso zzso properties of cells and zzso have been studied zzso with powerful tools of genetic engineering, combined with extensive zzso While this approach provides accurate information about the physiology at the zzso complementary methods, such as mathematical zzso can provide more detailed information about the processes that have lead to the zzso zzso 

In order to gain novel zzso information of the zzso zzso in normal zzso and to analyze sophisticated genetically engineered heart models, we have built a mathematical model of a mouse zzso zzso In addition to the fundamental components of membrane zzso calcium zzso and contraction, our integrated model includes the zzso zzso cascade and the regulation it zzso on the proteins involved in zzso zzso With the model, we investigate the effects of three genetic modifications that interfere with calcium zzso 1) zzso of zzso 2) disruption of the regulation of zzso calcium channels by zzso zzso II zzso and 3) zzso of zzso We show that the key features of the experimental zzso involve zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms that bring the system to a state closer to the original zzso zzso in all transgenic zzso A drastic zzso was found when the genetic modification zzso the regulatory zzso system itself, zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

The novel features of the presented zzso model enable accurate description of zzso zzso The model is thus an zzso tool for further studies of both normal and defective cellular zzso We propose that zzso zzso as in the present work is a valuable complement to experiments in understanding the causality within complex biological systems such as cardiac zzso
