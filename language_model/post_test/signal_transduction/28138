The importance of zzso zzso acids as zzso regulators of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle was recognized more than 20 years zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular was shown to play a central role in promoting muscle protein zzso However, it was only recently that the zzso involved in the stimulation of protein synthesis by zzso has begun to be zzso Studies performed in our laboratory during the past few years have revealed that oral administration of zzso to zzso rats enhances protein synthesis in association with increased zzso of two proteins downstream of the protein zzso referred to as the zzso target of zzso zzso These zzso zzso initiation factor zzso binding protein zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso control in part the step in translation initiation involving the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In theory the translation of all zzso can be regulated through such mechanisms, however, some zzso are more sensitive to the changes than others, resulting in zzso of gene expression through altered patterns of translation of specific zzso Moreover, although a zzso amount of plasma insulin is required for zzso to enhance signaling downstream of zzso the concentration observed in plasma of zzso rats is sufficient to observe zzso changes in zzso of zzso and zzso
