Proper calcium channel and insulin signaling are essential for normal brain zzso zzso mice with a zzso in the zzso zzso calcium channel, zzso develop zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso human gene are associated with increased migraine and seizure zzso Similarly, abnormalities in insulin signaling are associated with abnormal brain growth and migraine zzso Previously, we have shown that in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso channel function affects zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso reporter construct is similarly decreased by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This decreased expression of zzso zzso observed in both the zzso and zzso zzso backgrounds is zzso either genetically by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso factor, an zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that both zzso and zzso function are required in the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
