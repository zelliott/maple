zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two well-known membrane bound zzso Diabetes is associated with impaired zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso cell model, this study investigated the role of zzso and zzso on insulin zzso zzso metabolism in high zzso zzso treated zzso zzso zzso supplementation zzso 5, or 10 zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso which in turn zzso zzso total protein expression as well as its surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso however, zzso had no zzso Comparative signal zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso is more effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso with zzso in combination with insulin enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso with insulin, or insulin alone, in zzso zzso This suggests that a decrease in cellular zzso levels may cause impaired insulin sensitivity in zzso zzso supplementation also prevented zzso zzso and zzso zzso and lowered zzso zzso This study for the first time demonstrates that zzso but not zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso and zzso metabolism zzso by zzso zzso Whether zzso levels in blood can be used as a zzso of insulin resistance in diabetes needs further zzso
