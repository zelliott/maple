zzso antibiotics are produced by a wide range of zzso Most of them target the cell zzso often by zzso cell wall zzso One of the resistance mechanisms against zzso peptides is a zzso module consisting of a zzso system and an ABC zzso Upon the detection of such a compound, the zzso system zzso the expression of the ABC zzso which in turn removes the zzso from its site of action, zzso the resistance of the zzso Three such zzso zzso and zzso zzso are present in zzso zzso Here we show that each of these zzso responds to a number of peptides and zzso resistance against zzso zzso zzso responds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is induced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso (formerly zzso system responds primarily to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso We characterized the zzso zzso and defined the regulatory sequences within the zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression is fully zzso zzso The features of both the zzso and zzso promoters make them promising candidates as novel zzso zzso that can easily be adjusted for zzso zzso
