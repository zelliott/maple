A zzso zzso prepared from the cell debris of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple responses by zzso zzso cells, including an increase in generation of zzso oxide zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of total zzso zzso compounds zzso but does not trigger production of zzso or zzso acid zzso The role of NO in zzso production was investigated via the effects of the zzso scavenger zzso zzso and the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso profiles were zzso using zzso zzso zzso combining zzso pattern recognition zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or AG suppressed not only zzso NO generation and PAL activity, but also the zzso increase in zzso zzso This zzso reduction by either a NO scavenger or a zzso inhibitor was reversed by zzso addition of either a NO zzso sodium zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso profiles showed that the induced zzso were zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso which possess high zzso zzso Thus, NO mediates an zzso increase in production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso via a zzso zzso independent of zzso or zzso a mechanism which differs from those in some higher zzso
