zzso II is zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso where it is also zzso thus increasing the local concentration of the zzso to levels of potential zzso zzso In the present work, we studied the effect of zzso II via the zzso zzso of zzso cells on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso II (at zzso found in the zzso zzso rapid (30 zzso and persistent (30 zzso zzso activity by more than zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso with zzso II for 30 zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso spark, demonstrating a positively zzso stimulus of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso II in the medium facing the zzso side of the cells decreased with time with no formation of zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso II increased zzso of zzso and zzso receptors by zzso and either zzso or zzso completely blocked the stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso Using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso C, it was possible to demonstrate the involvement of a zzso zzso in the stimulation of zzso by zzso II with no effect on zzso We conclude that zzso II triggers zzso zzso via the zzso zzso increasing the zzso stock in the zzso to ensure a more efficient subsequent zzso of zzso This first report on the regulation of zzso activity by zzso II shows a new mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso cells and also for regulation of zzso fluid zzso in zzso zzso
