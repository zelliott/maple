The present study investigates the differential effect of two vitamin D zzso zzso zzso and zzso on human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso in zzso Human vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated in a high zzso zzso medium alone or supplemented with either zzso zzso zzso + zzso or zzso zzso M zzso + zzso zzso medium induced zzso which was associated with the zzso of zzso expression of zzso factors such as bone zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso In these cells, zzso of zzso signaling was evidenced by the zzso of zzso into the nucleus and the increase in the expression of direct target genes as zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso of zzso to zzso medium zzso + zzso further increased zzso and also enhanced the expression of zzso factors together with a significant zzso of nuclear zzso levels and the expression of zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso By contrast, the addition of zzso zzso + zzso not only reduced zzso but also zzso the expression of zzso and other zzso zzso markers as well as the levels of nuclear zzso and the expression of its target zzso The role of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso was further demonstrated by the zzso of zzso after addition of zzso protein 1 zzso a specific natural zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In conclusion, the differential effect of zzso and zzso on vascular zzso appears to be zzso by a distinct regulation of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
