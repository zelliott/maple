Breaking zzso symmetry in zzso is a major event during zzso development that is required for zzso organ position, directional organ looping and zzso organ function in the zzso zzso expression of zzso genes is hypothesized to be the driving force behind regulation of organ zzso Here we identify a zzso mechanism that drives zzso heart looping in zzso zzso In a unique zzso defective for the zzso zzso zzso preferential zzso looping in the heart is zzso whereas gut and brain zzso are zzso As genetic and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso does not abolish heart zzso a yet undiscovered mechanism controls heart zzso This mechanism is tissue zzso as zzso hearts maintain ex zzso retain zzso looping zzso and require zzso zzso and zzso II zzso We find that zzso zzso regulates zzso gene zzso supporting a model in which zzso zzso zzso this zzso mechanism of heart zzso
