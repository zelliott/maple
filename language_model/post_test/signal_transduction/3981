Human zzso virus binds to zzso T zzso by the interaction, in part, between its zzso envelope zzso and the zzso zzso We and others have reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso complex and can be activated by various zzso zzso In a previous report we showed that the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso T cells and B zzso This zzso was shown to be zzso Here we investigate the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso induced by zzso binding to zzso We found that zzso activates the zzso of zzso zzso T cell lines in a way dependent on zzso association, since no zzso was detected when the interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso It was also zzso using different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that this zzso zzso was necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso induced by zzso leads to zzso of zzso T cell zzso to B zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso to B cells was blocked by zzso of zzso activity, while zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso was zzso These results emphasize the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso activates both zzso and zzso which lead to a zzso organization zzso for zzso zzso
