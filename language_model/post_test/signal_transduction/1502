Resistance of tumors to zzso therapy may be due to disrupted zzso programs and remains a major obstacle in cancer zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso resistant tumor cells with absent or low zzso expression for zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso drugs by zzso zzso through a zzso dependent zzso Combined treatment using zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso drugs cooperated to trigger zzso in various resistant tumor cell lines derived from Ewing zzso zzso or zzso while single agents exerted only a minimal zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression also in cells with zzso of the zzso gene by zzso although no direct effect of zzso on the zzso status of regulatory sequences of the zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by the zzso specific inhibitor zzso or in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso a prominent role of zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso by zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso or in zzso zzso cells, while zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso restored the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso induced zzso expression thereby zzso cells for zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings provide evidence that the zzso zzso is involved in induction of zzso expression and zzso initiated by zzso and indicate that zzso might be an effective strategy to sensitize various resistant tumor cells with deficient zzso expression for zzso or death zzso zzso
