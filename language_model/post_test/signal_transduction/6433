zzso iron regulates gene expression by zzso the interaction of iron regulatory proteins zzso with zzso motifs called zzso elements zzso To zzso this interaction in living cells we have developed two fluorescent zzso reporters that zzso zzso and specifically respond to changes in cellular iron status as well as signaling that zzso zzso zzso The reporters were also sufficiently sensitive to distinguish zzso from zzso in the zzso to detect the effect of zzso of the zzso zzso such as zzso and to detect the donation or zzso of iron by zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, alternative zzso of the zzso motif either enhanced or zzso fluorescence, permitting a ratio analysis of the zzso zzso These characteristics make it possible to zzso zzso interactions in zzso
