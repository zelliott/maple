Several zzso including zzso growth factor 2 zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the zzso II zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso are largely zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the signaling zzso underlying the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso quantitative zzso and Western zzso showed that zzso II zzso zzso expression and that these effects were attenuated by zzso or zzso but not by zzso zzso analyses revealed that the region between zzso and zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso The existence of an zzso zzso zzso located at position zzso was identified using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso Using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we also showed that zzso II increases binding of zzso to DNA, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of zzso or zzso but not in the presence of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that binding of zzso to DNA is increased by zzso II via zzso zzso protein zzso 1/2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso which increases zzso gene expression in zzso rat zzso
