We describe here the results of a comparison of the properties of several plant zzso differing in their reaction to zzso The hormonal response used to compare the zzso is the zzso variation of the zzso electrical potential difference zzso zzso exhibited by zzso isolated from leaves or root zzso Using this membrane response, we have shown that large variations in the sensitivity to zzso can be induced either by zzso in tobacco or by transformation of various materials by zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from an zzso resistant zzso selected by zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to zzso from the control zzso display an zzso zzso with a 10 fold decrease in their sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso isolated from root tips of various plants transformed by zzso zzso or from the leaves of tobacco plants zzso from transformed roots, exhibit a 100 to 1000 fold increase in their sensitivity to zzso The single zzso zzso B, from the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is able to induce the dramatic modification in the sensitivity to zzso of tobacco zzso The zzso zzso of tobacco zzso is inhibited by zzso directed against an zzso protein zzso zzso from corn zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the external surface of tobacco zzso show that transformed zzso could have more surface receptors than zzso from the normal zzso whereas zzso isolated from the zzso zzso could have less receptors than their zzso zzso These results suggest that the sensitivity of tobacco zzso to zzso could be dependent on the number of functional receptors exposed at the outer surface of the zzso
