zzso proteins have been shown to interact with zzso and cause its zzso when zzso However, their precise role in zzso zzso is still enigmatic, as they are zzso present in cells and found to associate with zzso in zzso regardless of its zzso zzso We have analyzed the function of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso triggers the zzso zzso that controls the zzso of zzso zzso We find that, in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate zzso zzso The effect of zzso requires zzso and zzso activities but not zzso or zzso two recently identified essential components of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling is impaired in zzso derived from females lacking maternal expression of zzso We propose that binding to zzso by zzso is necessary but not sufficient for the zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso zzso requires zzso to activate zzso
