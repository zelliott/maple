zzso zzso by mouse gene zzso is a recently described neuroendocrine zzso zzso protein that is zzso into smaller peptides that may function in zzso zzso zzso and its processing zzso are also potent zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso which is zzso by mouse gene zzso In order to gain insight into the function of zzso we have examined the distribution of several zzso peptides and zzso by zzso throughout mouse zzso The distribution patterns of both zzso and zzso are broad from E9 to zzso with some enrichment in neural zzso zzso By zzso the expression of zzso is largely restricted to neuroendocrine zzso known to produce zzso zzso In general, the expression pattern of zzso zzso with that of zzso and other zzso zzso consistent with the hypothesis that zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso
