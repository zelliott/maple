zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the proliferation and differentiation of various types of zzso One of these protein zzso zzso a member of the zzso family zzso is known to play important roles in zzso signal zzso by zzso zzso growth factors, and other zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso expression and its role in the growth and zzso of human prostate cancer zzso We used a small interfering zzso targeting zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to suppress the expression and signaling of zzso in prostate cancer zzso We detected zzso for zzso family zzso in prostate cancer cell lines by zzso and zzso protein in human prostate cancer specimens by zzso zzso of zzso signaling resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of prostate cancer cells in zzso without affecting the cellular growth zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling in prostate cancer cells facilitate invasion of these cells, and interference with this signaling may be a potential therapeutic zzso
