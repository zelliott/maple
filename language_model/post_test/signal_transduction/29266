To investigate the biological effects of insulin resistance zzso on the zzso zzso cells which is induced by zzso the zzso inhibitor and zzso by key molecules including zzso and zzso during insulin zzso 

The model of zzso zzso zzso cell was established in in zzso culture by treatment of zzso and was assessed the amount of zzso zzso zzso as well as medium zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso The protein and zzso expression of zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso intake was decreased by zzso with treatment of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized mainly to zzso of zzso zzso When zzso cells were insulin zzso the expression of zzso was zzso whereas zzso was zzso as compared with the zzso 

zzso treatment can lead to decreased expression of zzso and increase of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso could induce increased expression of zzso and zzso potential, indicating the zzso between two pathways of insulin signaling within zzso zzso
