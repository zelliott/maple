zzso a zzso zzso inflammation in response to bacterial infection, is a major problem in the dairy zzso We found that cows susceptible to zzso have a zzso zzso in a zzso stretch of the gene for zzso embryonic zinc zzso zzso a zzso factor with a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and induced zzso promotes expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso expression in susceptible cattle but at a lower level than in resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of at least nine genes related to the zzso immune response, including zzso and zzso We propose that zzso to zzso results from an impaired immune response due to the lower zzso activity of susceptible zzso Our results provide an avenue to select for genetic improvement of resistance to zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso might control both zzso development and innate zzso
