zzso are capable of widespread zzso communication via zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso We have used patch zzso dye zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging techniques to show that one mechanism for this zzso zzso signaling in zzso is the release of zzso through zzso channels zzso in individual zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso currents consistent with zzso zzso currents that were inhibited by the zzso channel inhibitor zzso acid zzso zzso also showed molecular zzso influx and release of zzso consistent with flux through zzso zzso zzso dye flux evoked by mechanical stimulation was zzso by low zzso and was inhibited by zzso and zzso Mechanical stimulation also evoked release of zzso that was zzso by low zzso and inhibited by zzso and zzso Similar zzso zzso zzso dye zzso and zzso release were observed in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso but were not observed in parent zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso release and zzso signaling in zzso and in zzso cells expressing zzso The propagation of zzso zzso waves in zzso was also zzso by zzso and inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso through zzso zzso represents a novel signaling zzso for zzso communication in zzso and other zzso zzso
