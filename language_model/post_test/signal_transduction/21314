zzso zzso and zzso proteins have distinct biological properties, despite ubiquitous expression and similar affinities for regulators and zzso zzso zzso regions that distinguish zzso zzso and zzso proteins direct them to distinct membrane zzso where they may encounter regulators and zzso at different local zzso Jura and zzso now report that these zzso zzso direct differential zzso of Ras proteins and so provide a molecular mechanism to explain the sorting process and, perhaps, some of the dramatic differences in biological potency among zzso zzso and zzso zzso
