A zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region of leukemia zzso factor zzso alpha zzso zzso or zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells to induced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with whole zzso zzso on zzso cells in response to zzso zzso and zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of leukemia cell proliferation were evaluated in cells zzso with this zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso of zzso at zzso was detected after 10 zzso zzso treatment in cells zzso with either the zzso or the wild type zzso Cell proliferation was decreased upon zzso treatment in both cell zzso However, expression of the zzso region of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in lower levels of zzso zzso induction by zzso and cell proliferation was zzso zzso zzso indicated an inverse correlation between zzso expression and the levels of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso a cell differentiation marker, was lower in zzso than in zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of the 190 zzso region promotes the zzso zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso of proliferation and stimulation of differentiation in zzso zzso Our results also suggest a signal link between zzso and zzso
