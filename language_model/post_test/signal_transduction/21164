zzso and zzso are members of a new class of regulators of zzso signaling identified by their selective zzso expression either in zzso zzso zzso human B zzso zzso or in blood zzso cells treated with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene shows low zzso zzso expression in freshly zzso blood zzso cells, which increases upon incubation for a zzso In contrast, zzso initially shows high zzso levels of zzso zzso which subsequently zzso zzso of both genes increases in response to zzso with zzso zzso levels increasing briskly to a maximum between zzso and 1 zzso and decreasing to baseline by 6 zzso whereas the zzso zzso increase is delayed reaching a maximum between 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso levels increase much more in response to a protein zzso C zzso zzso than to a calcium zzso zzso whereas the opposite is true for zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its ability to increase zzso zzso and that zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso The distinction between zzso and zzso is further emphasized by studies indicating that zzso zzso does not bind in zzso to two members of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso for which zzso zzso has high zzso
