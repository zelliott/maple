The precise role of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso process of zzso T zzso zzso is not zzso We have recently constructed a zzso line zzso with the zzso gene of zzso A zzso These zzso zzso had lower zzso activity as well as decreased zzso activities, as measured by zzso and by DNA degradation zzso Furthermore, at low zzso ratio zzso in prolonged zzso zzso they could not lyse targets as rapidly as the control zzso When we examined their ability to zzso BLT zzso in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso poorly compared to the parental zzso or control zzso with a zzso zzso Most zzso zzso cells could not release zzso stores of zzso in response to zzso zzso although the zzso flux was normal when they were zzso with zzso When the parental zzso was treated with a specific zzso inhibitor of zzso or zzso zzso the zzso flux induced by zzso was also zzso We propose that zzso A is involved in the signal zzso zzso that causes the rise of the zzso zzso
