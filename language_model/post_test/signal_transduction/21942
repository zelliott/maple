Resource zzso may represent a central force driving zzso A tight link between sensing energy availability and managing energy acquisition and zzso constitutes a common feature among all zzso While such a link was likely zzso during prehistoric evolution, modern lifestyles may zzso perceived cues from actual energy availability so as to promote obesity in zzso A particular illegitimate signal is chronic stress, which may shift body zzso to suit a more conservative state of energy zzso In prehistoric times, such a response likely aided survival during periods of low resource zzso However, new sources of chronic stress have emerged that bear little relationship to contextual energy, which is generally abundant in the modern zzso In addition, modern techniques of zzso and agriculture can produce stress in the food chain, such that food itself can act as an illegitimate signal of chronic zzso zzso livestock and unusual fat profiles in farmed fish, meat, and eggs may reflect stress zzso Consumers of stressed foods may sense those zzso phenomenon known as zzso assume the stressed zzso This zzso process may promote obesity by erroneously zzso hosts towards caloric zzso in the context of energy zzso Regional tissue zzso of fat may indicate local tissue zzso zzso may result from stress signals that induce sympathetic bias and regional fat zzso in vessel zzso zzso such as zzso and foods such as diet drinks may generate illegitimate signals by mimicking molecules used for energy zzso zzso for the prevention and treatment of zzso related to these zzso are zzso New strategies for manufacturing zzso by manipulating stress conditions or controlling fatty acid attachments to proteins are zzso
