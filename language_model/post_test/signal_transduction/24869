The zzso zzso potential of proteins can be zzso in zzso containing a zzso zzso domain that mediates their recruitment to reporter zzso This approach has been widely used in zzso and in transient zzso cell zzso Here, we applied it to zzso the zzso potential of proteins in transgenic zzso zzso We found that a zzso between the zzso bacterial zzso protein and the zzso domain from zzso zzso behaved as a potent synthetic zzso in all embryonic zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso required an unexpected degree of context to function as a zzso zzso We provide evidence to suggest that this context is provided by zzso and Mad (a zzso zzso and that these partner factors need to be activated by signaling from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso behaves as an autonomous zzso zzso in more artificial zzso systems, our data suggest that zzso of zzso factors may be more prevalent than previously zzso
