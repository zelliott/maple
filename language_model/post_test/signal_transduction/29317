The zzso zzso of zzso receptors may be involved in zzso zzso We examined this in the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso sequence in the zzso domain, and found it evokes zzso and zzso zzso In rat zzso smooth muscle cell zzso primary cultures, zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure to zzso gave sustained increases in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso but gave a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sustained from 10 zzso to 48 h compared with zzso control zzso In contrast, zzso II had no effect on zzso and, though it is acutely zzso (up to 5 zzso it had no sustained effect on zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso added alone induced a transient increase in zzso calcium zzso with a characteristic response curve different from that of zzso II zzso The zzso was without effect on an zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter system, though it reduced zzso reporter zzso Such zzso effects on zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso itself might be a target for therapeutic intervention in chronic vascular zzso
