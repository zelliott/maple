zzso a selective zzso zzso is known to possess zzso activity and also zzso zzso in various types of cancer zzso Here, we examined the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in cervical cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso chip containing 225 different genes revealed that zzso zzso arrest and DNA damage zzso zzso a zzso factor involved in zzso showed the strongest differential expression following zzso treatment in all three cervical cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso zzso in all three cell lines, and zzso expression of zzso triggered zzso in cervical cancer cells in the absence of other zzso zzso A zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso stability tests revealed that the expression of zzso was regulated at both the zzso and zzso levels following zzso zzso The region between zzso and zzso containing an intact zzso binding site, is required for zzso stimulation of zzso promoter zzso In terms of signaling pathway, addition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso expression zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso whereas cell zzso with zzso showed lower levels of zzso zzso zzso These novel findings collectively suggest that zzso may play a key role in zzso zzso in cervical cancer cells by regulating the expression of zzso proteins such as zzso
