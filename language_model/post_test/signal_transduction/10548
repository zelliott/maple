The zzso signaling zzso is activated in many human zzso zzso zzso We tried to identify the genes involved in zzso and progression of zzso with zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to compare gene expression between zzso and benign components of a human zzso occurring in pre-existing zzso activated for zzso Two of the genes identified belong to the zzso gene zzso zzso They zzso the zzso zzso 3 alpha zzso and 1 alpha zzso zzso both involved in liver and pancreatic zzso and zzso Using zzso directed against zzso we demonstrated that zzso is a target of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso expression is significantly correlated to the zzso status in 42 zzso and 28 zzso characterized for their zzso zzso Thus, we report strong evidence that both genes are downstream targets of the zzso zzso during liver zzso
