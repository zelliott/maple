zzso are potent regulators of normal and zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso and in zzso but the signaling mechanisms by which they exhibit their growth zzso effects are zzso We have recently shown that zzso is engaged in Type I zzso zzso as shown by its rapid zzso zzso during engagement of the Type I zzso zzso In the present study, we provide evidence that the related zzso protein is also rapidly zzso on zzso during treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso or zzso We also show that both members of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in an zzso manner in primary zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or zzso protein expression by zzso zzso reverses the zzso effects of zzso or zzso on the proliferation of normal bone zzso zzso cells zzso forming zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso are engaged in a signaling zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso
