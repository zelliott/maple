Emerging evidence suggests that the T helper 17 zzso subset of zzso T cells contributes to the development of allergic zzso In this study, we found that mice lacking the zzso zzso on zzso cells did not generate zzso cells in the lung and were protected from airway zzso in response to house dust zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Because loss of zzso cells inhibited airway narrowing without any obvious effects on airway inflammation or zzso zzso we examined the direct effects of zzso zzso on mouse and human airway smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso enhanced zzso force generation of airway smooth muscle through an zzso zzso A zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso of activated B cells zzso zzso gene family, member A zzso zzso containing protein zzso 2 zzso signaling zzso Mice lacking zzso zzso on zzso cells showed impaired zzso of this zzso after zzso zzso and challenge, and the diminished contraction of the zzso rings in these mice was reversed by zzso These data indicate that the zzso produced by zzso cells contributes to zzso airway zzso through direct effects on airway smooth zzso
