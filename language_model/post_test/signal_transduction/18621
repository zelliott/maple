In zzso wings and zzso are the zzso zzso of the second and third zzso zzso zzso In the third zzso segment, zzso zzso gene zzso zzso suppresses wing development to mediate zzso development zzso Lewis, zzso A gene complex controlling zzso in zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso lack stout sensory zzso of the wing margin and veins that zzso the wing zzso Furthermore, wing and zzso zzso differ in the size, shape, spacing and number of zzso zzso The differential development of wing and zzso thus, constitutes a good genetic system to study cell fate zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso zzso is critical for zzso fate zzso zzso of positive components of this zzso causes significant zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso genetic experiments suggest that zzso zzso regulates the expression of the zzso vein as well as the zzso zzso to zzso the signaling zzso zzso shift zzso further suggest that zzso is a potential direct target of zzso These results and other recent findings suggest that zzso genes may regulate cell fate determination by directly regulating few steps at the top of the hierarchy of selected signal zzso zzso
