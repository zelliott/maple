The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso includes death zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Death receptors zzso induce zzso signaling upon engagement of their zzso DR zzso either leading to zzso survival, or zzso zzso The DR signaling is zzso by the recruitment of several death domain zzso molecules such as zzso death domain zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso In this review, we describe DR signaling in zzso and describe recent findings of DR signaling during metamorphosis in the African clawed zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we focus on the cell fate zzso or zzso zzso through a DR zzso zzso or TRAIL in zzso cells or red blood cells zzso In addition, we discuss relationships between zzso zzso metamorphosis and DR zzso
