zzso affect learning and memory but the cellular mechanisms involved are poorly zzso The present studies tested if the zzso zzso zzso zzso is present and regulated within zzso zzso and influences local signaling to the zzso zzso In zzso field zzso 13 % of zzso contained zzso zzso reconstructions of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso are present in both spine heads and zzso zzso with evidence that zzso zzso associates with the translation regulator zzso X Mental zzso zzso zzso spine zzso levels were rapidly increased by group 1 zzso zzso and reduced in mice lacking zzso Treatment of cultured zzso slices with the zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso increased total levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, proteins that regulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment of adult zzso slices also increased numbers of zzso spines containing zzso but reduced numbers of zzso zzso zzso increases in synaptic zzso were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso are present in zzso spines where they mediate acute zzso effects on local spine zzso Through effects on these zzso regulatory zzso zzso are positioned to exert acute effects on synaptic zzso
