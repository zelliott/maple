The rat zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of G zzso receptors that has two adjacent zzso motifs in the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that simultaneous zzso or individual zzso or zzso zzso of the two adjacent zzso motifs to zzso results in zzso with enhanced rates of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was much more effective in enhancing zzso than the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was more effective than the zzso zzso Because in the human zzso the zzso equivalent to zzso and zzso of the zzso are a zzso and a zzso zzso and zzso we also prepared zzso that exchanged these zzso In the zzso an zzso exchange enhanced zzso and in the human zzso an zzso exchange impaired zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso of the zzso domain of zzso In fact, this manipulation reduced the enhanced rate of zzso of zzso back to that of zzso The zzso zzso does not affect the degradation of the zzso zzso or the membrane targeting of the nascent zzso The zzso zzso also did not affect degradation of the zzso zzso but impaired the membrane targeting of the nascent zzso We conclude that the zzso motifs of the zzso inhibit zzso and suggest that this zzso may be due to an impairment in the binding of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso
