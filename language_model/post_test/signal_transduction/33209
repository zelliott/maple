Growth hormone zzso plays a significant role in normal growth and zzso Signaling to the cell is believed to require growth hormone zzso zzso zzso which occurs following binding of a single growth hormone zzso to each of two zzso We have developed human growth hormone zzso zzso zzso one of which was used here to characterize zzso zzso This zzso zzso is directed against the hinge spanning zzso I and II of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the cell surface zzso increases upon zzso binding to growth hormone, but not when it binds a zzso form, zzso which does not trigger zzso zzso Growth hormone binding thus appears to lead to a zzso change in the zzso zzso recognized by zzso giving rise to the active zzso zzso necessary for signal zzso Using a zzso zzso growth zzso zzso cell line, we find that zzso binds to the zzso in the absence of human zzso and delivers a signal leading to cell zzso Finally, zzso treatment of zzso cells, a human cell line expressing a functional human zzso leads to cell proliferation zzso by the generation of zzso signals, including zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
