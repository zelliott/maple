The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of calcium in the production of dengue type 2 virus zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and in transmission of the zzso signal via zzso zzso zzso zzso to recruit the second zzso of zzso zzso zzso Effect of calcium channel blocking drugs, zzso and zzso on the production and activity of zzso was zzso The production of zzso was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by the calcium channel zzso The zzso activity of zzso was also inhibited by calcium channel blocking zzso zzso could not be produced when zzso cells were cultured in a calcium free zzso the production being restored on substitution with calcium zzso Treatment of M zzso with the calcium channel zzso inhibited the transmission of the zzso signal from zzso to zzso cells in a dose dependent zzso The influx of calcium during transmission of the zzso signal was studied by measuring the zzso zzso zzso channel blocking drugs inhibited the zzso zzso by T zzso Thus, presence of calcium is obligatory for the production and zzso activity of zzso and it plays a critical role in transmission of the zzso zzso
