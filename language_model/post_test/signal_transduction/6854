zzso zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in human gastrointestinal zzso zzso and inflammatory states, underlining the need to study zzso roles of zzso in an in zzso genetic zzso Here, we study the significance of zzso in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso and unravel a crucial role of zzso in zzso zzso integrity and zzso The zzso zzso exhibit abnormal zzso architecture and zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso reminiscent of inflammatory zzso disease zzso including zzso of zzso cells, abnormal zzso bacterial overgrowth and zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso The zzso gene expression profile shows enrichment of acute phase response zzso and the zzso zzso zzso stress factors zzso and zzso are robustly activated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso analyses reveal that zzso zzso undergo sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell death, consistent with chronic zzso zzso Furthermore, pharmacological induction of zzso stress by zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso reporter lines replicates the zzso inflammatory zzso suggesting a fundamental role of zzso metabolism and zzso stress in zzso zzso Antibiotics and zzso drugs resolved the zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that bacterial overgrowth can exacerbate zzso stress pathology, whereas persistent zzso stress is sufficient to trigger zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was partially alleviated by chemical zzso suggesting their therapeutic zzso Using zzso genetic and pharmacological models, this study demonstrates a newly identified link between zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso provide a powerful tool for zzso the fundamental mechanisms of zzso human zzso diseases and a platform to develop zzso targeted zzso
