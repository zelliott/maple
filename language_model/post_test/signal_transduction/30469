zzso growth factor zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso is a key protein in the zzso zzso system, which plays a zzso important role in the invasion and zzso of various types of zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso signaling mediates cancer progression and zzso are zzso This study was designed to investigate the roles of zzso in tumor progression and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso peaked 1-3 zzso after zzso treatment and then zzso zzso enhanced the protein level and the activity of zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and the zzso protein level also increased in a zzso zzso zzso zzso increased cell invasion through the zzso A zzso zzso against human zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso tumor cell invasion in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso induced a decrease in in zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso cells express functional zzso which may provide a target for a therapeutic basis to interfere with zzso of cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso
