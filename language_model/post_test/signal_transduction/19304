To investigate the influence of zzso zzso on learning and memory abilities, global neurotransmitter and zzso zzso zzso B zzso signaling zzso of zzso accelerated zzso zzso mice with Alzheimer's zzso zzso 

zzso mice were modeled and divided into the model group, the zzso group and the zzso zzso group, all treated for 90 zzso And a control group was set up with zzso accelerated zzso zzso zzso Morris water maze was used to test the learning and memory abilities of zzso contents of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in brain were measured by zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso B zzso were evaluated by zzso 

Compared with the control group, in the model group, the average escape zzso detected by hidden platform trial and reverse trial on the 3rd day was higher zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso As compared with the model group, the escape zzso zzso the 2nd to 5th day) decreased zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression increased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso treated group after treatment, in addition, the level of zzso zzso protein significantly increased zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could improve the learning and memory ability of zzso model mice, which is probably related to its function in increasing cerebral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
