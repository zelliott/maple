zzso neural development has been extensively zzso However, it is unknown for any zzso gene how the onset of zzso expression in early zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso expression is among the earliest markers of zzso prospective zzso at early zzso in zzso zzso Here, we identified two zzso sequence zzso that are necessary and sufficient to drive zzso expression during zzso in transgenic zzso zzso Each domain contained putative binding sites for the zzso factor zzso which can mediate zzso signaling and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso zzso from zzso transgenic for zzso with zzso zzso or zzso sites demonstrated that signaling through the zzso sites was required for zzso expression at early zzso while signaling through the zzso sites restricted zzso expression to the prospective zzso at zzso zzso with these results, zzso zzso regulatory sequences and zzso zzso responded positively to zzso signaling and zzso to zzso zzso The two zzso sequence zzso were also zzso among zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that signaling through zzso and zzso binding sites regulates zzso of zzso in prospective zzso during zzso
