zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso DNA synthesis in zzso zzso whereas other zzso hormones had no effect on zzso DNA zzso The zzso effect of zzso was seen for zzso and zzso but not for zzso or zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso decreased the ability of zzso to induce cells to progress to S phase of the cell cycle, and time course studies indicated that the effects of zzso were not due to an altered timing of DNA synthesis zzso zzso addition within 30 zzso of adding zzso was necessary to inhibit zzso DNA zzso zzso media from zzso cells from which zzso had been neutralized with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso DNA zzso suggesting that the effect was due to zzso not an zzso factor induced by zzso zzso induced a rapid association of protein zzso C with the membrane fraction of zzso cells, as well as increased zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso eliminated most of the zzso effect of zzso on zzso DNA zzso The protein zzso C inhibitor zzso C restored zzso zzso binding in zzso cells and reversed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
