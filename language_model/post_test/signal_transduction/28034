zzso response to injury requires coordinated regulation of the tension exerted by zzso zzso zzso However, the signals governing relaxation of zzso zzso have not been zzso Our aim was to test the hypothesis that signal zzso pathways initiated by zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso zzso We directly zzso the effects of zzso on zzso tension exerted by cultured human zzso zzso We also measured the effects of zzso on zzso content, zzso regulatory light chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced relaxation of zzso within 10 zzso By 10 zzso relaxation reached a plateau that was sustained for 2 zzso zzso relaxation was zzso with a zzso decrease in tension zzso zzso zzso zzso observed at 250 zzso zzso relaxation in response to zzso constituted approximately zzso of total zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso content and reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso exhibited the same dose dependence as zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased within 2 zzso of zzso exposure and was sustained for at least 45 zzso zzso also zzso a large transient increase in zzso zzso concentration that occurred within 30 s and was nearly complete by 1 zzso We also observed that zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso completely abolished the reduction in zzso zzso induced by zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation through zzso reductions in zzso zzso Moreover, these findings raise the possibility that zzso plays a role in zzso wound zzso
