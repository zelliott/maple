The zzso gene is associated with zzso disease, multiple zzso and type I diabetes, which are all T zzso zzso yet there is no reported analysis of regulator of G protein signaling zzso biology in human T zzso This study shows that zzso expression is substantially higher in T cells from human gut versus peripheral blood and that this can be exaggerated in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels profoundly reduce T cell migration to zzso zzso whereas zzso depletion selectively enhances such zzso in gut T cells and zzso their zzso zzso These findings provide a revised framework in which to view the linkage of zzso to inflammatory zzso
