The present study investigates the direct action and the underlying zzso of zzso zzso zzso effects on the bovine isolated zzso zzso zzso rings were cut from each artery and mounted in a wire zzso system for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso were constructed by adding cumulative zzso of the drug to zzso rings zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso of mechanical zzso cell removal and of selective zzso of the zzso oxide zzso pathways were investigated on the zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxed zzso arteries and maximum relaxation was zzso Mechanical removal of zzso blockade of soluble zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1 and 5 zzso or zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso by zzso zzso 50 and 100 zzso reduced significantly the zzso response to zzso moreover, the NO donor zzso zzso 100 zzso significantly increased the zzso responses to zzso zzso to zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso a blocker of zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, whereas the blockade of zzso channel by zzso (5 zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso channel by zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso Interestingly, also zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and of zzso by zzso (1 zzso markedly decreased the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso induced zzso in zzso arteries with zzso via the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and defined an intriguing role for zzso and zzso as upstream zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso
