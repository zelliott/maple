Growth factor receptors of the zzso zzso family regulate proliferation and migration of a variety of cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso to these receptors zzso multiple cellular responses, including cell cycle progression and zzso in culture model zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, these receptors include zzso growth factor zzso zzso that binds both zzso and transforming growth factor alpha zzso and zzso whose zzso is zzso growth zzso factor zzso zzso signaling via these receptors occurs by several mechanisms, including zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso Growth factor independence is a characteristic feature of transformation in cancer zzso Previous studies have shown that human zzso cell zzso zzso lines do not require zzso or zzso for zzso We show that while these cell lines expressed zzso and zzso stimulation with their respective zzso did not induce proliferation but markedly increased invasion of zzso basement zzso However, zzso zzso activity was required for proliferation and zzso induced invasion by these zzso Signaling via zzso zzso and zzso was required for proliferation of SCC zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso did not significantly reduce invasion by these cells nor completely block stimulation of this activity by zzso and zzso We concluded that zzso signaling was required for proliferation but not invasion of human SCC zzso
