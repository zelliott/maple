The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso which have critical roles in prevention of zzso and regulation of cell cycle zzso plays an important role in zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso has been described in some human zzso but not in zzso zzso disease zzso 

To study the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and to evaluate the relationships among zzso 

zzso tissue samples of 34 patients with primary zzso were subjected to zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso 

Of zzso zzso tissue samples, 34, 34 and 28 were positive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 27, 23 and 17 of the 36 specimens stained positive for zzso zzso and zzso in more than half of zzso cells, zzso There were significant correlations between the zzso and zzso expression as well as between zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is zzso and zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in zzso 

Our study shows that the expression of zzso and the induction of zzso and the zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso The zzso system might be a potential therapeutic target in zzso
