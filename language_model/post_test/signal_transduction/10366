When a zzso is positioned zzso in a dividing cell, the resulting daughter cells are unequal in zzso zzso zzso positioning is driven by regulated forces that can pull or push a zzso The physical and molecular mechanisms that can position zzso zzso have been studied in several systems, and some themes have begun to emerge from recent zzso Recent work in budding zzso has presented a model for how zzso zzso and cortical capture molecules can function in zzso and positioning a zzso The zzso regulation of zzso pulling forces that move a zzso has been examined in one animal zzso Although the zzso positioning force generators have not been identified in most animal systems, the forces have been found to be regulated by both zzso polarity proteins and zzso signaling pathways in more than one animal zzso
