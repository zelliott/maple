In response to environmental zzso zzso membrane zzso generates biologically active lipids that can serve as both zzso and zzso zzso There are several classes of lipids that can mediate inflammatory zzso We report here on a new zzso zzso signal that regulates zzso formation in zzso a key response in microbial killing, inflammation and tissue zzso zzso of zzso extracts rich in zzso zzso lipids revealed a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of biologically active zzso gave four major zzso zzso most abundant was zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso form, zzso zzso zzso undergo rapid zzso At zzso zzso zzso but not zzso inhibit zzso production by human zzso zzso zzso zzso We prepared zzso and zzso by total organic synthesis and matched both the physical properties and biological activity of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso a recognized intermediate of cholesterol zzso is present in immune zzso cells and is a potent regulator of the cellular response in host zzso
