zzso can respond to a zzso zzso stress by zzso their zzso zzso zzso zzso Such increased zzso concentration is likely to be protective against further zzso challenge, and, in fact, zzso to low levels of zzso zzso increased cellular resistance to subsequent greater zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso of rat lung zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases zzso zzso concentration in a zzso and zzso zzso This increase resulted from zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether such increased zzso concentration protected these cells against a subtle loss in function caused by a subsequent challenge with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 200 zzso mimicking a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso with 100 zzso zzso caused an zzso of zzso zzso This response was suppressed by a brief zzso to zzso The zzso however, was alleviated dramatically by a zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso The same zzso zzso also protected the cells from zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso an irreversible inhibitor of zzso prevented the increase in zzso zzso and also completely removed the protection by zzso in maintaining the zzso zzso Thus, zzso to a zzso level of zzso results in protection of cell functions from zzso zzso This protection appears to depend on zzso of the zzso zzso pool, the zzso of which constitutes an zzso response to zzso zzso
