zzso a zzso from the root of zzso zzso is used as a blood zzso and to improve blood zzso in complementary and alternative zzso The present study investigated the influence of zzso on the expression of early growth response zzso zzso and growth factors contributing to wound zzso zzso significantly increased growth factors such as transforming growth zzso 1 zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso factor by zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso increase induced zzso cell proliferation and recovered the migration of wounded zzso In an ex zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a larger zzso zzso area than produced using zzso zzso Cell proliferation and migration of zzso were also greater in the presence of zzso than zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and slightly inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso sustained zzso of zzso was suppressed by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso proliferation and repair in zzso zzso zzso increased the cell proliferation and wound zzso zzso accelerate wound closure rate as early as day 3 after surgery and consistently observed until day 10 after in wound animal zzso These data suggest that zzso promotes zzso repair and wound healing in a process involving the zzso of zzso zzso factor through the regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
