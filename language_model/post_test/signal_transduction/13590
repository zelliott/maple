The molecular responses of zzso to zzso zzso have been investigated via a combination of zzso and zzso approaches, using the zzso cell line as a zzso Both metallic copper and copper oxide zzso have been tested, with copper zzso and zzso oxide zzso used as zzso zzso analysis highlighted changes in proteins implicated in zzso stress responses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins (especially zzso zzso complex zzso zzso studies employing functional analyses showed that the increases in zzso zzso and in zzso complexes observed in the zzso screen were critical to cell survival upon stress with zzso zzso pharmacological zzso of these two pathways enhanced cell vulnerability to zzso zzso but not to copper zzso Furthermore, functional analyses using primary zzso derived from bone zzso showed a decrease in reduced zzso levels, a decrease in the zzso zzso potential, and zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso oxide zzso However, only a fraction of these effects could be obtained with copper zzso In conclusion, this study showed that zzso functions are significantly altered by zzso zzso Also highlighted are the cellular pathways modulated by cells for survival and the exemplified zzso that can occur between zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso
