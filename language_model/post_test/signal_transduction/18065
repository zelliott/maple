The cells forming the rat zzso produce zzso and zzso proteins and express both the long and short forms of the zzso zzso Yet, only a defined zzso the zzso cells, express the zzso zzso zzso This gene is silenced in zzso in the zzso cells and in the zzso cell line, derived from zzso zzso To examine whether the lack of zzso expression is due to defective components in the zzso signaling pathway, we compared the relative expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 a and b zzso a and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso on days 12 and 13 of zzso the time of zzso zzso zzso We found no significant differences in the relative expression of either zzso zzso (a and zzso or zzso in the two cell zzso However, we discovered a profound difference in the expression of zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso This gene was highly expressed in the zzso cells and in the zzso cells, which do not produce zzso zzso experiments with zzso cells revealed that although zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso no zzso of zzso and zzso could be zzso To examine whether zzso plays a role in zzso the zzso zzso we cultured zzso cells in the presence of either a zzso zzso zzso or an irrelevant zzso for 4, 12, and 28 zzso zzso were also treated with zzso Within 4 h of zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso expression was zzso After 28 zzso only cells treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso retained the ability to express the zzso zzso In zzso results of this study reveal that zzso expression of zzso can prevent zzso signaling and that the lack of zzso expression of zzso in a defined zzso cell population is largely due to zzso expression in these zzso
