The zzso zzso zzso in resting cells is an equilibrium between several influx and zzso zzso Here we address the question of whether zzso zzso entry to some extent is active at resting conditions and therefore is part of processes that guarantee a constant zzso We measured changes of zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso An increase of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso to 5 zzso induced an increase in zzso from 105 zzso 10 zzso to 145 zzso zzso zzso This increase could be inhibited by 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Application of those zzso to a resting cell in a standard zzso solution zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso from 105 zzso 10 zzso to zzso zzso 10 zzso with zzso from 103 zzso 12 to 89 zzso 12 zzso with zzso and from 102 zzso 12 zzso to zzso zzso 5 zzso with zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso zzso entry beside its function in zzso signaling contributes to the regulation of resting zzso
