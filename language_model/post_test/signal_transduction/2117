Signaling processes in the course of the formation of the zzso zzso may partake in conveying enhanced stability to the cell zzso To prove the zzso of this reasoning in a model, we have studied the impact of addition of three zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso on zzso zzso of cell zzso formed in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso Using both human zzso and rat zzso to avoid measurement of responses restricted to a single cell type, an enhanced zzso of zzso cell zzso was observed, when zzso and an inhibitor were zzso Among the tested zzso zzso acid and zzso were more potent enhancers of cell zzso than zzso These results suggest that zzso pathways connected with zzso activity as well as the level of zzso zzso groups zzso further stability to zzso cell zzso The systematic evaluation of zzso for defined activities is thus suggested as a tool to disclose the nature and the contribution of individual signaling mechanisms to zzso effects following zzso cell contact zzso
