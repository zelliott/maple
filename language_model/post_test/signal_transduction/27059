zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso differing in the zzso domain, are expressed in a zzso and zzso manner, suggesting an important function for this zzso We report that a zzso protein in which the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are replaced with those of the zzso zzso zzso is able to restore zzso signaling in a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain of zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso signal zzso Moreover, zzso zzso functionally zzso the zzso zzso in a manner that is dependent on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function results in the loss of zzso zzso indicating that zzso function is continuously required for zzso zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso regulation of zzso may have zzso similarities with zzso zzso zzso
