zzso synthesis depends on zzso zzso sensed by the target of zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso affects zzso zzso at the level of zzso gene transcription, expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso factors, zzso processing, and zzso Here, we demonstrate that upon zzso zzso levels of newly zzso zzso zzso drop drastically before the integrity of the zzso zzso I apparatus is severely impaired but in good correlation with a sharp decrease in zzso zzso zzso of translation by zzso mimics the zzso maturation zzso observed immediately after zzso zzso Both zzso addition and the depletion of individual zzso also reproduce zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso precursor zzso We suggest that shortage of newly zzso zzso after short-term zzso zzso is sufficient to explain most of the observed effects on zzso zzso
