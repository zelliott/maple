zzso regulation of zzso is of key importance in the zzso of zzso transport across zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso induction of zzso alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso gene zzso is zzso by an indirect mechanism dependent on the synthesis of a zzso zzso In zzso target cells, while both zzso and zzso increase the levels of zzso alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso zzso and zzso activity, they are diminished by zzso acid zzso the active ingredient of zzso To investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso zzso zzso levels of alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso were measured in rat kidney zzso zzso cells treated with a range of zzso of zzso zzso and GE in the presence of a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of total zzso zzso zzso D zzso and the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso In addition, GE was zzso with the sodium channel zzso zzso zzso The increase in both alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso levels following zzso and zzso was completely abolished by treatment with zzso and zzso while zzso did not affect this zzso Similarly, the zzso decrease in alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso was also completely abolished by zzso and zzso but not by zzso or by zzso The zzso of alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso in these cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated from the rate of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso h zzso This was unaffected by zzso The zzso action of GE on alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso levels was accompanied by a zzso decrease in levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) from 395 zzso 28 zzso zzso total cell protein to between 275 zzso 19 zzso total cell protein zzso zzso zzso and 78 zzso 11 zzso total cell protein (10 zzso zzso This was abolished following zzso of protein zzso C by prolonged treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso toxin zzso but not by zzso toxin zzso Indeed, zzso zzso levels were increased by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CT zzso but not by zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
