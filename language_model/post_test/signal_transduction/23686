zzso salt and water zzso is essential for all cellular zzso zzso salt and water zzso is also important for zzso zzso Many fundamental mechanisms of compensation for zzso zzso are well defined and zzso zzso molecular mechanisms of detecting salt and water imbalances and regulating zzso responses are generally poorly defined for zzso Throughout the last century, researchers studying zzso and zzso cells made critical contributions to our understanding of zzso especially mechanisms of salt and water transport and organic zzso zzso Researchers have more recently started using zzso model organisms with defined zzso and well-established methods of genetic manipulation to begin defining the genes and integrated regulatory networks that respond to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is well suited to these zzso Here, I introduce zzso mechanisms in this model, discuss experimental advantages and limitations, and review important zzso Key discoveries include defining genetic mechanisms of zzso sensing in zzso identifying protein damage as a sensor and principle zzso of zzso stress resistance, and identification of a putative sensor for zzso stress associated with the zzso zzso Many of these processes and pathways are zzso and, therefore, provide new insights into salt and water zzso in other animals, including zzso
