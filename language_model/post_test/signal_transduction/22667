The ability to learn and form memories depends on specific patterns of synaptic activity and is in part zzso zzso However, the signal zzso pathways that connect signals generated at zzso with zzso responses in the nucleus are not well zzso In the present report, we discuss three signal zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso pathway, the zzso pathway, and the zzso pathways that might function to couple synaptic activity to long-term zzso responses, in part through the regulation of new gene zzso Evidence suggests that these pathways become activated in response to stimuli that regulate synaptic function such as the influx of zzso zzso and certain zzso growth factors such as zzso zzso zzso Once zzso the zzso zzso and zzso pathways lead to the zzso and zzso of zzso factors in the nucleus such as the zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso Genes regulated by zzso or other zzso factor targets of the zzso zzso and zzso pathways could mediate important zzso responses to changes in synaptic activity such as changes in synaptic strength and the regulation of zzso survival and zzso
