In the past year, several new components involved in cell migration and zzso guidance have been identified by genetic analysis in zzso zzso taking us a step closer to being able to trace the pathways which mediate these zzso The completion of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing project has provided us with the knowledge of the full spectrum of genes that might be involved in cell migration and zzso guidance, and can facilitate the analysis of components that have been shown to be important for these processes in other zzso
