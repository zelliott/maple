The zzso cells zzso of the zzso in the brain form the anatomical basis of the zzso barrier zzso In the present study, the effects of agents that modify the zzso of a well-established in zzso model of the human zzso were zzso The zzso formed by zzso human brain zzso zzso cell zzso cultures are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and have high electrical zzso Exposure of zzso to various zzso including zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso or zzso zzso decreased zzso electrical resistance zzso mainly by increasing the zzso of the tight zzso zzso cultures of zzso express zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and produce low levels of zzso Treatment with the NO donors sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso with zzso rapidly decreased the resistance, and zzso of zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso partially prevented the zzso increase in zzso Furthermore, NO donors and zzso could also reverse the increased zzso of the zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that NO can decrease the zzso of the human zzso through a mechanism at least partly dependent on zzso production and zzso protein zzso zzso
