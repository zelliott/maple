The negative influence of zzso on the outcome of zzso tumors may be caused by direct oxygen effects, and zzso the selection of resistant tumor cells under repetitive zzso To evaluate whether zzso zzso selects for resistant cells and to analyze the underlying mechanisms, the influence of zzso zzso on zzso death pathways was determined in tumor zzso It could be demonstrated that zzso zzso selects for cells with increased resistance against zzso zzso These cells exhibited a zzso against zzso triggers of zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Thus, zzso zzso selects for cells with defects of the zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells has been described as a consequence of zzso zzso therefore, we evaluated the impact of hypoxic selection on zzso of zzso and downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso function and protein levels of key zzso of zzso zzso remained unaffected by hypoxic zzso However, zzso zzso changes of zzso were reduced after zzso zzso In zzso it could be demonstrated that hypoxic stress zzso a selection pressure on zzso zzso pathways and, zzso to an increased resistance toward zzso death zzso
