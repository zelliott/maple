Like many zzso systems zzso to the zzso cycle, zzso movements in zzso zzso are controlled by both the ambient zzso and input from zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examine the relative influence of these two signals in various species of zzso fish with different latitudes of zzso We find equatorial species show very strong zzso zzso The cones of the zzso zzso for example, continue to go through undiminished cycles of contraction and relaxation that mirror the previous zzso cycle for at least two weeks in continual zzso To zzso the relative effectiveness of the ambient light compared with zzso signals in causing cone contraction, the degree to which seven zzso species responded to light during the dark phase of their zzso cycle was zzso In this situation the zzso receives conflicting zzso while the light is acting directly to cause light adaptation, any zzso signal tends to keep the retinal elements dark zzso The further from the zzso a species zzso the more its cones contracted in response to such zzso suggesting animals from higher latitudes make little use of zzso zzso and rely more on ambient zzso to control zzso zzso species, however, rely on internal zzso to a much greater degree and are relatively insensitive to zzso light zzso Because these data are consistent with published observations in systems as diverse as zzso synthesis in Arctic zzso and the zzso of regional populations of zzso zzso zzso in the efficacy of zzso zzso may be a common feature among zzso
