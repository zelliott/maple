The development of prostate cancer has been linked to high level of dietary fat zzso Our laboratory investigates the connection between cancer cell growth and fatty acid zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells, we found that zzso zzso zzso increased cell growth and zzso the gene expression of its own zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso expression zzso with the highest levels of stimulation seen at the zzso period following zzso zzso The zzso zzso (5 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and cell zzso These data suggest that the levels of local zzso zzso play a major role in the growth of prostate cancer cells through an zzso of zzso gene zzso
