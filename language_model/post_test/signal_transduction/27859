zzso is believed to play a central role in the patterning of the zzso by providing a strong zzso zzso As part of this zzso patterning zzso zzso has to activate a number of zzso factors to fulfill this zzso Among the zzso factors regulated by zzso are the zzso and the zzso zzso A novel zzso gene has been isolated termed zzso which represents a new class of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso soon after the zzso zzso zzso transcripts undergo spatial restriction from the onset of zzso to the zzso marginal zone, and the transcripts will remain in this zzso including at the zzso stage in the zzso zzso of zzso during zzso stages requires normal zzso activity as evidenced from the injection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in a dose dependent zzso zzso loss of zzso activity induced by zzso zzso injection results in the zzso of zzso and the induction of secondary axis zzso zzso can rescue the effects of zzso the dominant negative zzso zzso These results place zzso downstream of zzso during zzso and suggest that it represents a novel zzso family in zzso which is part of the zzso signaling zzso
