Some of the most serious diseases involve altered size and structure of the zzso zzso zzso how zzso walls are built could aid understanding of these diseases, but little is known about how concentric layers of muscle cells and the outer zzso layer are assembled and patterned around zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and genetic analysis in mice, here we show that the pulmonary artery wall is constructed zzso from the inside out, by two separate but coordinated zzso One is sequential induction of successive cell layers from surrounding zzso The other is controlled invasion of outer layers by inner layer cells through zzso regulated cell zzso and zzso zzso We propose that a zzso signal zzso controls these processes and provide evidence that zzso and at least one other signal zzso zzso of such zzso signaling pathways may zzso zzso differences and pathological changes in zzso wall size and zzso
