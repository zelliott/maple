zzso signaling plays an essential role in diverse biological processes during development and in zzso of diseases ranging from cancer to cerebrovascular zzso zzso regulation of zzso signaling is essential for normal function and requires both timely zzso and zzso of the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso In addition, inappropriate buildup of zzso zzso is a hallmark pathological feature of the stroke and zzso disorder cerebral zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, a clear understanding of mechanisms of zzso protein turnover is essential for understanding normal and pathological mechanisms of zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the degradation of zzso of zzso and zzso is controlled by the zzso system zzso though more recent work demonstrated that zzso zzso is also controlled by zzso zzso The mechanism of degradation of zzso has not yet been zzso Here we report that the degradation of zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso in addition, zzso of zzso function by zzso and zzso delayed the degradation of zzso In contrast, zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we find that the zzso zzso domain zzso is also subjected to zzso zzso In sum, our experiments demonstrate a critical role for zzso in the degradation of zzso which zzso it from zzso and zzso
