zzso has been reported as the zzso zzso for zzso In this study, zzso was confirmed to activate zzso resulting in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation in a zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso effects detected using dynamic mass zzso zzso were inhibited with zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating the importance of not only the zzso zzso but also zzso These results show that zzso when expressed in zzso cells couples exclusively through the zzso zzso and acts through zzso not only to inhibit zzso production but also to increase zzso zzso in an zzso zzso dependent mechanism via zzso zzso
