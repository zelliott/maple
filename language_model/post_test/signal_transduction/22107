zzso protein zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of cerebral zzso after zzso zzso The goal of this review is to bring together recent diverse data concerning the roles of zzso in cerebral zzso and to consider the future zzso 

A review of publications in the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health database was conducted in August 2009 using specific zzso search terms pertaining to zzso zzso and zzso 

There are nine in zzso studies and 17 in zzso studies zzso Most of previous studies used zzso zzso or their upstream zzso zzso and showed that zzso inhibitions prevented zzso The zzso cascade appears to interact with other signaling zzso and zzso may be an important final common zzso for the signaling zzso during cerebral zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso causes sustained vascular smooth muscle contraction remains zzso In addition, the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been investigated in cerebral zzso 

The experimental data support the zzso role of zzso in cerebral zzso and warrant further zzso
