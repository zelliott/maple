zzso growth zzso zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in many zzso zzso including pancreatic zzso Previous studies are conflicting with regard to an exact role for zzso signaling in various aspects of pancreatic zzso Here we have investigated the role of zzso zzso signaling in embryonic zzso differentiation and lineage zzso The zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso were localized mainly to both the pancreatic zzso and zzso at early stages of development, but then with increasing age localized to the pancreatic zzso and zzso To determine the specific role of zzso zzso we functionally zzso zzso signaling at different points in the signaling zzso zzso of zzso signaling at the zzso level using mice zzso the zzso zzso type II zzso showed an increase in zzso precursors and zzso zzso cells, with an abnormal zzso of zzso cells around the developing ducts of zzso stage embryonic zzso This pattern suggested that zzso zzso signaling may suppress the zzso of secondary transition zzso cells from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in pancreatic organ culture also led to an increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso hybrid mix-and-match in zzso zzso of transgenic pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso also led to increased zzso cell zzso but with different patterns depending on the zzso of the zzso zzso Together these results suggest that zzso signaling is important for restraining the growth and differentiation of pancreatic zzso cells, particularly away from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in the embryonic period may thus allow pancreatic zzso cells to progress towards the zzso lineage zzso particularly as part of the secondary transition of pancreatic zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in the ducts and zzso may normally serve to zzso the production of beta cells from embryonic zzso
