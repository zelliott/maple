zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso syndromes zzso are characterized by deficient development of several zzso zzso including hair, teeth and zzso zzso The recent cloning of the genes that zzso these zzso zzso zzso and the zzso A zzso zzso and their identification as a novel zzso zzso pair suggested a role for zzso signaling in embryonic zzso In the zzso the genes of the spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso To gain insight into the function of this signaling zzso in development of skin and hair zzso we analyzed the expression and regulation of zzso and zzso in wild type as well as zzso and zzso zzso mouse zzso We show that zzso and zzso expression is confined to the zzso and occurs in a pattern that suggests a role of zzso signaling in the interactions between the zzso compartments and the formation and function of hair zzso By using skin zzso cultures, we further show that this signaling zzso is intimately associated with interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso We also find that zzso zzso lack completely the zzso of the first developing zzso zzso and that they do not show patterned expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the genes for zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso as a zzso signal that stimulates zzso expression and zzso as a signal that zzso zzso zzso suggesting a hierarchy of distinct signaling pathways in the development of skin and hair zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso and zzso are associated with the onset of zzso patterning and that zzso signaling also regulates the zzso of hair zzso
