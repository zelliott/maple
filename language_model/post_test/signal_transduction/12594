The differentiation of zzso and pancreatic zzso cells during zzso is determined by zzso factors zzso by neighboring zzso These factors stimulate and repress the expression of key regulatory genes in zzso cells, thereby establishing unique genetic programs that determine cell zzso The signaling network that controls liver and zzso development is highly dynamic with respect to both concentration and timing of exposure to several key zzso zzso Not only do large changes occur within short time zzso multiple signaling pathways also zzso on the same target zzso Given the intense effort under way to generate certain differentiated cell types from both embryonic and induced zzso stem cells, greater understanding of how different zzso signals interact with each other may be essential for the eventual success of such zzso
