zzso is a zzso preparation mimicking the action of zzso factors and has beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases and zzso The present study investigated the effect of zzso on zzso in a rat model of zzso middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Treatment with zzso at doses of zzso and 5 zzso significantly increased the number of zzso zzso zzso zone zzso neural zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso boundary 28 days after stroke when the treatment was initiated 24 zzso after zzso The treatment also reduced zzso cells by zzso in the zzso zzso However, treatment with zzso at a dose of zzso zzso initiated at 24 and 48 zzso did not significantly reduce zzso volume but substantially improved neurological outcomes measured by an array of behavioral tests 21 and 28 days after zzso zzso of zzso neural zzso cells from zzso rats with zzso dose zzso zzso zzso cells and increased the number of zzso cells (a marker of immature zzso zzso of the zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment promoted neural zzso cell zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso treatment when initiated 24 and 48 zzso after stroke enhances zzso in the zzso brain and improves functional outcome and that zzso zzso zzso and migration of adult zzso neural zzso cells contribute to zzso zzso which may be related to improvement of neurological zzso The zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso cell zzso
