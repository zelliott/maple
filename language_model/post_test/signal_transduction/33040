During development of the limb zzso plays a key role as a zzso of zone of polarizing activity zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso directs zzso patterning in the limb remain zzso Members of the zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso factors and represent likely candidates for being regulators of zzso target zzso In this review we would like to zzso the current knowledge on expression and function of zzso genes in limb zzso
