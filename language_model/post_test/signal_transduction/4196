We report here that zzso molecules expressed on activated T zzso are involved in signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso responses against three different B zzso lines in a zzso manner, while the same zzso inhibited zzso response against zzso T cells expressing zzso zzso of zzso expression on T cells with zzso stimulation was confirmed by flow zzso zzso With the zzso zzso T cells as zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso these primed T cells with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso molecules induced protein zzso zzso in zzso T cells with a zzso pattern distinct from those induced by zzso through other zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso molecules function not only as zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells but as receptors on T cells to zzso the zzso signals into the cells and may play a role for zzso interactions leading to zzso expansion of activated T zzso However, the zzso relevance of our finding remains to be zzso
