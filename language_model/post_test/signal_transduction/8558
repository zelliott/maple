Because of their chemical stability and zzso many zzso compounds zzso can readily accumulate in fatty zzso of zzso Several zzso have been reported to inhibit zzso zzso To determine whether the disruption of zzso zzso by these zzso involves interference with zzso signaling in the zzso the impacts of five zzso zzso on the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated using quantitative real-time zzso The zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso by zzso is not only further direct evidence that zzso expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso hormone but also zzso the use of the zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was administered alone, the expression of zzso gene in cultured zzso zzso was zzso while zzso had no zzso Under zzso exposure to both zzso and an zzso a condition similar to the natural hormonal milieu of zzso zzso of animals impacted by zzso both zzso zzso and zzso were found to be capable of zzso zzso signaling in cultured zzso zzso This zzso effect on zzso zzso signaling can at least partly explain the zzso effects of these two agents on zzso zzso zzso when given together with zzso produced an additive effect on zzso zzso signaling but such an additive effect was not observed when zzso was combined with zzso
