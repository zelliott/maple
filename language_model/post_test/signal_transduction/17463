zzso (or zzso is an zzso host restriction factor that suppresses the release of zzso and other enveloped viruses by zzso them to the cell zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso also acts as an innate sensor of zzso assembly that zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it has been reported that zzso in the promoter and 3' untranslated region of the zzso gene may affect the clinical outcome of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in the zzso open reading frame have not yet been described or functionally zzso 

Mining of the zzso zzso zzso database identified seven very rare naturally occurring zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso analyses showed that none of these sequence zzso significantly affects the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso release or its sensitivity to antagonism by zzso zzso or zzso zzso although zzso alters a potential zzso zzso motif proposed to play a role in zzso zzso Thus, these zzso do most likely not represent an evolutionary advantage in directly controlling zzso replication or zzso Interestingly, however, the zzso zzso selectively zzso the signaling activity of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso release and immune sensing are two zzso functions of human zzso and the latter activity is severely impaired by a single zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso part of zzso
