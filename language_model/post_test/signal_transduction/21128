During active zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso and release zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is converted to zzso by the zzso zzso surface with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso (the basis of zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a polarized human zzso zzso zzso zzso we now characterize the basis of the observed conversion of zzso to zzso required for this zzso signaling zzso An inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso but not to authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be surface expressed on both model and natural human zzso zzso zzso was about zzso greater on the zzso cell surface as assessed zzso by selective cell surface zzso and zzso by zzso Treatment with zzso zzso C zzso released zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso stimulation induced intact zzso cells to shed surface zzso The bulk of zzso zzso ( approximately zzso was released from the cell surface by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 degrees C, but such release was not affected by zzso with zzso or by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso of zzso released by zzso at 4 degrees C was not truly zzso but rather represented zzso release of zzso membrane zzso These membrane fragments displayed light density on zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 degrees C, and contained zzso These data indicate that human zzso zzso express zzso which is zzso polarized and targeted to zzso with zzso zzso zzso likely zzso in translating zzso zzso zzso signals to the authentic zzso zzso These studies define zzso as central to zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso mechanism by which zzso induce zzso zzso zzso zzso
