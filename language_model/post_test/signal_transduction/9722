Bone zzso protein zzso signaling is broadly implicated in zzso zzso patterning of zzso zzso animals zzso and its role in zzso patterning apparently predates the birth of zzso zzso In fly and zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso diffuse and interact to generate signaling zzso that pattern fields of cells zzso Work in other species reveals diversity in essential zzso of this ancient patterning process, zzso Here, we report that zzso signaling patterns the zzso axis of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso featuring stereotyped zzso cell zzso but the detailed mechanisms of zzso patterning in zzso differ markedly from fly and zzso In zzso zzso are expressed broadly, rather than in zzso territory, whereas a zzso expressed zzso specifies zzso fate by short-range zzso A zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso rather than zzso territory, and yet the zzso activity of zzso is required for normal zzso cell zzso zzso promotes zzso fates without zzso zzso fates by selectively zzso zzso not zzso Thus, zzso patterning in the development of the zzso revealed unexpected evolutionary plasticity of the zzso zzso patterning system, presumably reflecting its adaptation to different modes of zzso
