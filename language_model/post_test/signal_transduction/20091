zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains the only zzso vaccine against zzso caused by zzso zzso but gives variable protection against pulmonary zzso The generation of host zzso responses following zzso vaccination is accepted as the major mechanism of protection against zzso tuberculosis zzso Early production of zzso in the lungs following zzso tuberculosis challenge of mice previously vaccinated with zzso tuberculosis peptides in zzso has been shown to be required for efficient zzso cell zzso zzso regulates various processes involved in generation of zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have shown zzso as a negative regulator of the immune response to primary zzso tuberculosis infection, with zzso mice having reduced lung bacterial zzso In this study we show that zzso of zzso signaling during zzso vaccination enhances zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses, and that this regimen gives significantly greater protection against zzso zzso tuberculosis challenge in both susceptible and relatively resistant strains of zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso blockade of zzso specifically during zzso vaccination resulted in additional protection against zzso tuberculosis challenge of zzso compared with equivalent zzso zzso The protection observed following zzso vaccination concurrent with zzso zzso treatment was sustained through chronic zzso tuberculosis infection and correlated with enhanced lung zzso and zzso responses and increased zzso and zzso production by zzso T cells and an zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso optimal zzso protection, therefore suggesting that zzso of zzso may be of great benefit as zzso in preventive vaccination against zzso
