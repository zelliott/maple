In many zzso cell types, zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso transition of the cell zzso As cells approach zzso a dramatic zzso of their zzso accompanies dynamic changes in zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in cell division remains mostly zzso Using two cellular systems, we demonstrate that a point zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso known to decrease zzso activity supports entry into zzso but zzso the assembly of a zzso zzso array focused at the zzso during zzso the formation of a bipolar zzso at zzso and zzso These events are restored by zzso zzso the zzso zzso with specific zzso This is the first demonstration that the zzso zzso tail can regulate zzso function, the assembly of the zzso zzso and zzso
