We have characterized several potential stem cell markers and defined the membrane properties of rat fetal zzso neural stem cells zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates specificity of expression of zzso zzso and shows that zzso labels both zzso and stem cell zzso zzso like zzso stem cells, express high levels of zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso analysis of 96 zzso and channels showed that zzso zzso 1 zzso expression is unique to fetal zzso or other differentiated zzso zzso examination showed that fetal zzso respond to zzso and its zzso such as nicotine and zzso zzso express low levels of zzso zzso sensitive and insensitive sodium channels and calcium channels while expressing at least three kinds of zzso zzso We find that gap junction communication is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and is essential for zzso survival and zzso Overall, our results show that fetal zzso exhibit a unique signature that can be used to determine their location and assess their ability to respond to their zzso
