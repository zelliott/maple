zzso from several zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso of the Ras family of zzso zzso zzso of Ras zzso a zzso cascade that culminates in zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso include the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which zzso zzso a factor that activates zzso of the zzso zzso In this report, we identify a novel 19 zzso gene product as a negative regulator of signaling through the zzso zzso While these studies were in progress, the human zzso of this gene was characterized as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso a zzso that converts zzso groups on zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso of the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso through the zzso zzso by zzso occurs at or downstream from zzso of zzso In zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso is not a direct inhibitor of zzso or zzso activity, although, zzso expression at near zzso levels results in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, a site zzso of zzso lacking zzso activity blocked signaling through the zzso zzso with greater efficiency than zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso of signaling through the zzso zzso is a distinct function of zzso that is not dependent on, but may be regulated by, its activity as a zzso
