This review offers a concise summary of the most recent experimental advances in vascular development using the mouse as a model zzso 

Recent mouse studies have revealed a spread of zzso diversity between zzso of distinct zzso origins and zzso For example, expression of unique zzso factors zzso zzso from zzso zzso within the same zzso zzso of the brain is particularly susceptible to zzso zzso due to zzso zzso and zzso zzso surprisingly these zzso can zzso the zzso by either cell autonomous or zzso zzso zzso mice have been used to understand how multiple signaling pathways integrate and refine cellular zzso In particular, we learned how zzso regulates zzso signaling and zzso coordinates zzso zzso The regulation of zzso by zzso highlighted the contribution of zzso in the induction of zzso zzso Information gained on zzso interactions has further clarified the influence of blood vessels on the zzso of zzso and contributed to our understanding of zzso zzso zzso Finally, mouse models have uncovered zzso cell polarity as a zzso for successful vascular zzso 

Our understanding of the process of vascular development has gained significant refinement in the last two years and has clarified the origin of several disorders rooted in zzso
