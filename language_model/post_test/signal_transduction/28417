Although copper is an essential metal, it is capable of catalyzing the formation of zzso oxygen species that can cause zzso zzso zzso We investigated the hypothesis that zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso pathways mediate the cellular and molecular responses associated with copper zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso or rat zzso zzso reporter genes demonstrate that copper activates zzso via metal and zzso response zzso zzso with copper zzso is a decrease in the level of total zzso and an increase in oxidized zzso zzso of zzso before copper exposure, increases zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso oxygen zzso aspirin or vitamin E provides partial protection against copper toxicity and reduces zzso zzso zzso using signal zzso zzso and a metal zzso factor zzso zzso cell line demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is regulated by protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso signaling pathways and requires zzso The results of these studies indicate that copper activates zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
