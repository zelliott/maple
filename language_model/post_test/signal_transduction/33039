The analysis of multiple zzso zzso generated through targeted disruption indicates that the zzso members of the zzso and zzso clusters determine the skeletal pattern in the limb by regulating the formation and growth of the different zzso precursors for the skeletal zzso While these studies have established that together these genes are the major players in regulating formation of the limb zzso the roles of individual members have often been difficult to evaluate fully due to extensive functional overlap between various zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso provides a complementary approach to zzso gene function in the presence of multiple zzso This approach has recently revealed that zzso can induce Sonic zzso and suggests a new role for certain zzso genes in the initiation of Sonic zzso expression and its maintenance through feedback zzso Thus, some zzso genes may be a part of the regulatory network that positions and reinforces polarizing signals in the zzso limb zzso
