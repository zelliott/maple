Adult stem cells must balance zzso and differentiation for tissue zzso The zzso zzso has provided a wealth of information about the zzso niche signals and intrinsic molecular processes required to ensure appropriate zzso stem cell renewal and zzso The factors controlling behavior of the more recently identified zzso stem cells of the zzso are less zzso but equally important for zzso Here we report that zzso regulators play a critical role in controlling these zzso Specifically, the zzso regulator zzso zzso is required in the zzso stem cell lineage to ensure maintenance of this stem cell population and proper zzso of developing germ cells by zzso stem cell zzso In addition, reduction of one copy of the gene zzso zzso the zzso regulator zzso X Mental zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso and zzso are regulating a common zzso zzso was previously characterized in zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that loss of zzso alters the dynamics of the cell cycle, and we present evidence that zzso of zzso contributes to the disruption in behavior of zzso stem cell zzso Our findings support the idea that zzso regulators may provide a zzso mechanism for oversight of zzso critical cell cycles such as those in stem cell zzso
