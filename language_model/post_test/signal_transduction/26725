In zzso countries, over zzso of the population is allergic to peanuts or tree nuts, which carries a risk of severe allergic zzso Several studies support the efficacy of peanut oral zzso zzso for reducing the clinical sensitivity of affected zzso however, the mechanisms of this effect are still being zzso One mechanism that may contribute is the suppression of zzso cells, such as zzso zzso zzso has been characterized in zzso as a zzso zzso however, this has not been demonstrated to occur in zzso 

To evaluate the hypothesis that zzso zzso occurs in zzso due to chronic zzso exposure in the setting of a clinical oral zzso zzso 

zzso of peripheral blood were obtained from subjects during a zzso clinical trial of peanut zzso zzso zzso to in zzso stimulation with peanut zzso and controls was assessed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso measured by flow zzso 

The zzso of zzso following stimulation of the zzso zzso either specifically with peanut zzso or zzso with zzso zzso was strongly suppressed by active zzso However, zzso did not significantly suppress this response in zzso zzso by the distinct zzso zzso zzso In the subset of subjects with egg zzso active peanut zzso also suppressed zzso zzso in response to stimulation with egg zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the zzso of zzso including in response to stimulation with zzso zzso 

Peanut zzso zzso a zzso state in zzso that is consistent with zzso zzso previously described in zzso This suggests the hypothesis that zzso cell zzso could contribute to clinical zzso
