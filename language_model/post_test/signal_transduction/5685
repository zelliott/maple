Bone zzso zzso derived cells can differentiate into smooth zzso cells zzso resulting in vascular zzso However, the molecular mechanism of the differentiation remains zzso We have recently reported that zzso signaling promotes while a zzso target zzso inhibit the differentiation of zzso cells to zzso During the differentiation of zzso zzso cells into smooth muscle zzso zzso cells, expression of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor prevented the induction of zzso zzso vascular injury was produced in zzso arteries in mice transplanted with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso Many zzso cells for zzso or zzso were detected in the thickened zzso In contrast, only a few zzso cells were positive for zzso in zzso where zzso a zzso for zzso were abundantly zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso plays an important role in differentiation of zzso zzso cells into zzso
