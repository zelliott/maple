The development of the zzso leg is a good model to study processes of pattern formation, cell death and zzso Such processes require the coordinate activity of different genes and signaling pathways that progressively zzso the leg territory into smaller zzso One of the main pathways needed for leg development is the zzso pathway, required for determining the zzso axis of the leg and for the formation of the zzso that separate different leg zzso The mechanisms required to coordinate such events are largely zzso We describe here that the zinc finger zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in cells that will form the leg zzso and needed to establish a correct size and pattern in the zzso zzso There is an early requirement of zzso to establish the correct zzso zzso but zzso is also needed at late third zzso to form the joint between the fourth and fifth zzso zzso The expression of zzso requires zzso activity but zzso is necessary, in turn, to activate zzso targets such as zzso of split and big zzso zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso protein 2 gene and regulates the late expression of zzso In the absence of zzso many cells zzso express the zzso gene head zzso zzso activate zzso and are positive for zzso orange, indicating they undergo zzso Our results demonstrate the key role of zzso in the control of cell death and zzso signaling during leg zzso
