It is well established that the central nervous system zzso especially the zzso plays an important role in regulating energy zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso hormone zzso is critical for stimulating fat loss in response to dietary zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso regulation of zzso zzso fat loss are, however, still largely zzso Here, we used zzso injection of zzso zzso to identify a novel role for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a major downstream zzso of the zzso zzso target of zzso in zzso deprivation stimulation of energy zzso Furthermore, we show that the effect of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our studies provide a new perspective for understanding the regulation of energy expenditure by the zzso and the importance of zzso between nutritional control and regulation of zzso zzso
