zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were used to identify patterns of gene expression in human zzso zzso cells growing in culture and in primary human breast zzso zzso of zzso genes identified through zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor zzso By using zzso with zzso against proteins zzso by a particular gene in a zzso the identity of the cell type within the tumor zzso that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be zzso zzso of genes with coherent expression patterns in cultured cells and in the breast tumors samples could be related to specific features of biological variation among the zzso Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with zzso of the zzso signal zzso pathway, zzso zzso of genes expressed by zzso cells and zzso in the breast tumors also were identified in this zzso These results support the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach to studying variation in gene expression patterns in human zzso as a means to dissect and zzso solid zzso
