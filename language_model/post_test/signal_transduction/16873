zzso affects 200 million people worldwide and places an enormous economic burden on zzso We aim to identify the feature genes that are related to zzso in osteoporosis and to perform function analysis with DNA zzso from human bone zzso 

We downloaded the gene expression profile zzso from Gene zzso zzso database including nine gene chips from bone zzso zzso stem cells of five zzso and four zzso zzso The zzso expressed genes between normal and disease samples were identified by zzso package in R zzso The interactions among the zzso gene zzso and zzso expressed genes were searched and zzso by zzso zzso and Bingo were used to perform module zzso Finally, zzso was used to obtain enriched pathways of genes in an interaction zzso 

A total of 656 genes were identified as zzso expressed genes between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified to interact with zzso directly from the zzso interaction zzso A module containing zzso was screened out, and this module was most significantly enriched in organ zzso zzso enrichment analysis suggested genes in the interaction network were related to focal zzso 

The expression pattern of zzso zzso and zzso can be useful in osteoporosis zzso which may help in identifying those populations at high risk for zzso and in directing treatment of zzso
