A mechanism by which members of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso family regulate zzso in the developing zzso central nervous system was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoted differentiation of cerebral cortical precursor cells into zzso and inhibited differentiation of cortical precursors along a zzso zzso Although zzso zzso both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso signaling pathways in cortical precursor cells, the zzso signaling zzso selectively enhanced differentiation of these precursors along a zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso may be a mechanism by which cell fate is controlled during zzso zzso
