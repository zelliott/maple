The contribution of zzso to working memory has been studied extensively zzso Here, we exploited its well characterized effects zzso to validate a novel human zzso zzso of ongoing synaptic zzso zzso zzso We obtained zzso zzso zzso from subjects performing a working memory zzso task during a zzso zzso pharmacological zzso zzso By applying dynamic zzso modeling zzso a zzso technique for zzso system identification zzso to zzso signals from prefrontal cortex, we demonstrate that it is possible to zzso synaptic signaling by specific zzso channels in behaving zzso zzso enhancement of zzso performance was accompanied by significant changes in zzso signal power, zzso zzso zzso disclosed related changes in synaptic zzso By zzso the contribution of zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso to the observed spectral response, we demonstrate changes in their function commensurate with the synaptic effects of zzso The zzso of our model is reinforced by a striking quantitative effect on zzso and zzso zzso signaling that predicted behavioral improvement over zzso Our results provide a zzso demonstration of a novel framework for zzso zzso zzso influences on zzso channel signaling via specific zzso zzso providing a window on the hidden synaptic events zzso discrete psychological processes in zzso
