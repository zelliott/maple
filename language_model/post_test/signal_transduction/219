We investigated the effects of zzso acids zzso on steroid hormone production and zzso expression of zzso zzso in rat zzso in zzso and in zzso In the rat zzso giant cell line zzso the natural zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and synthetic zzso zzso zzso slightly promoted production of zzso and zzso whereas the natural zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and synthetic zzso zzso zzso did zzso Furthermore, although administration of zzso and zzso into the rat zzso at zzso zzso robustly induced zzso expression of cellular zzso binding protein II, the gene for which is targeted by zzso and/or zzso in the zzso neither zzso affected the expression of zzso zzso zzso and both had little effect on zzso and zzso levels in the zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not regulated by zzso in zzso
