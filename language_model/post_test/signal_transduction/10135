zzso of the nervous system initially requires the acquisition of neural identity, which is achieved through the zzso of zzso zzso A regional patterning then takes place within the neural plate through the activity of zzso zzso These two processes are tightly regulated early in development by the zzso zzso Here, we show that, in zzso zzso two zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso margin, are required for the definition of anterior neural zzso Their zzso results in deletions of anterior head structures associated with an increase of zzso activity at the zzso zzso zzso These zzso can be fully rescued by zzso of zzso zzso or by zzso of zzso Altogether, zzso and zzso cooperate to promote formation of anterior neural tissue by zzso as early as zzso stage, zzso anterior neural cells from an irreversible zzso by the zzso factor zzso
