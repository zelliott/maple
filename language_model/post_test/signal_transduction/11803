In zzso cells radiation zzso the enhanced zzso of several zzso The zzso acting elements in the control region of zzso genes have been zzso by site directed zzso Several different elements have been found in different zzso They do not only activate gene zzso in response to radiation but also in response to growth factors and to tumor promoter zzso zzso The zzso factors binding to these elements are present also in zzso cells, but their DNA binding activity and their zzso capability is increased upon zzso The signal chain linking the primary zzso signal zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso factors involves the action of zzso protein zzso
