zzso and sleep are interrelated zzso Under normal environmental conditions, the rhythms of core body temperature zzso and sleep propensity vary zzso across the day and night in healthy young zzso Although this relationship has drawn considerable interest, particularly in recent years, it is still not known whether this relationship is zzso or merely zzso As zzso brain areas contain zzso cells, it is possible that the zzso cycle may be directly affected by zzso changes zzso That is, that changes in temperature may trigger, either directly or zzso zzso brain areas to initiate zzso There is now an emerging body of evidence from both zzso and zzso studies to indicate that this may indeed be the zzso This paper will examine the literature relating to this relationship and propose a model where zzso changes provide an additional signal to the brain regions that regulate sleep and zzso The model attempts to explain how temperature changes before and after sleep onset act in a positive feedback loop to maintain a consolidated sleep zzso
