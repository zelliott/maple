Human zzso is renewed throughout life from stem cells in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso from the surrounding zzso influence the differentiation of the stem cells, but the nature of the signals is zzso In many developing zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso human zzso 

zzso expression was found in all living zzso zzso but zzso expression was confined to the zzso layer of the zzso with highest expression in those regions where stem cells zzso By zzso zzso or zzso a truncated form of zzso in primary human zzso and zzso zzso sheets containing zzso of zzso cells and zzso cells, we found that cells expressing high levels of zzso or zzso failed to respond to Delta signals from their zzso In contrast, zzso zzso that were in contact with zzso cells expressing zzso were zzso to leave the stem-cell compartment and initiate terminal differentiation after a few rounds of zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso whereas zzso did zzso 

We propose that high zzso expression by zzso stem cells has three zzso a protective effect on stem cells by blocking zzso zzso enhanced zzso of stem-cell zzso which may discourage intermingling with zzso zzso and zzso to cells at the edges of the clusters to zzso zzso zzso in zzso stem cells thus differs from other zzso cell populations in zzso rather than zzso zzso
