A number of signaling molecules and zzso factors play important roles in the development of the zzso nervous zzso Here, we show that mouse trunk neural crest cells can differentiate into zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso in the absence of bone zzso protein zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is induced even in the presence of zzso or zzso which are zzso of zzso zzso Whereas these zzso zzso do not express zzso the zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso zzso promotes the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso is completely prevented by zzso growth factor zzso treatment or by zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the suppression of zzso expression by zzso can be recovered by treatment with zzso small interfering zzso Our data suggest that zzso mechanisms promote the differentiation of zzso zzso and that zzso suppresses zzso zzso by means of the zzso of zzso zzso
