The evolution of a mechanism to generate a zzso axis perpendicular to the zzso body axis was a key event in zzso evolution and facilitated the formation of zzso zzso The study of zzso limb patterning in extant zzso can provide insight into the origin and evolution of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso patterning is mainly organized by zzso zzso zzso signaling is also involved, but is restricted to late stages and zzso leg parts zzso and zzso Here we study the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and pointed zzso in leg development in the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso signaling has a more complex role in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso and is not only required in the zzso leg, but is also involved in formation of the zzso leg (including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are required for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso leads to thickened and fused leg zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso signaling appears functionally separate from its role in zzso regulation, because it is not zzso by the zzso factor zzso This suggests that zzso signaling has a dual role with separate zzso in zzso axis zzso While the regulation of zzso factors like zzso is zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso appears to function in parallel or redundant with zzso zzso thus providing a possible explanation why this role is less zzso zzso in the zzso
