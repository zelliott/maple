The zzso zzso system senses an almost unlimited number of chemical stimuli and zzso a process of neural recognition that influences nearly every aspect of zzso This review examines the organizational principles underlying the recognition of zzso zzso The zzso system is composed of a number of distinct zzso that can be distinguished by the location of their sensory zzso in the zzso zzso the receptors they use to detect zzso zzso the signaling mechanisms they employ to zzso those zzso and their zzso projections to specific regions of the zzso zzso An zzso approach that includes gene targeting methods, optical and zzso recording, and behavioral analysis has helped to zzso the functional significance of this zzso organization for the sense of zzso
