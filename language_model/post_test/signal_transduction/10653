Low plasma levels of zzso zzso and elevated circulating zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso are zzso associated with zzso insulin resistance and cardiovascular zzso However, the mechanism that mediates the zzso production of these two zzso in obesity remains poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso on production of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that ambient zzso markedly suppressed zzso zzso expression and its protein zzso and increased zzso production in mature zzso zzso zzso a stabilizer of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of these two zzso zzso caused a modest zzso of zzso in zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso by antioxidants failed to alleviate zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso On the other hand, the antioxidants could reverse hydrogen zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso binding protein zzso but had no effect on zzso whereas zzso stabilized zzso and decreased expression of zzso but not zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso and zzso decrease zzso production and augment zzso expression in zzso via distinct signaling zzso These effects may contribute to zzso and elevated zzso levels in zzso type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular zzso
