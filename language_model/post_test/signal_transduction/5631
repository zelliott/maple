Recent theoretical work has provided a basic understanding of signal propagation in networks of zzso zzso but mechanisms for gating and controlling these signals have not been investigated zzso Here we introduce an idea for the gating of multiple signals in cortical networks that combines principles of signal propagation with aspects of balanced zzso Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming zzso signals are normally zzso by locally evoked zzso leaving the targeted layer zzso zzso can be gated zzso by modulating zzso and zzso gains to upset this detailed zzso We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of zzso zzso We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed zzso zzso that the individual signals are zzso detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple zzso
