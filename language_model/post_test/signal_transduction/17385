Although we studied previously the mechanisms of resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to zzso zzso prediction of the response to zzso remains zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso expression and the response to zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Changes in the zzso effect of pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso were examined after zzso or suppression of zzso We also examined the effect of zzso on the zzso signaling zzso and investigated whether the altered zzso effect by zzso suppression was weakened after the addition of zzso a zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso showed significantly lower resistance to zzso In the zzso cells, zzso induced significantly larger numbers of zzso cells and S phase zzso compared to control cells, demonstrated by zzso V zzso and flow zzso analysis of the cell cycle, zzso The zzso cells showed zzso of putative target molecules including zzso zzso and zzso and lower zzso of the zzso signaling zzso The addition of zzso weakened the zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso expression zzso significantly with the zzso effect of zzso and that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso the zzso resistance to zzso in pancreatic cancer cell zzso
