zzso acid zzso has been proposed to function as a zzso signaling zzso in zzso of zzso We have shown that rat zzso release zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso thus released can diffuse over sufficient distances within the zzso zzso to activate zzso receptors in neighboring zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso receptors in zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso analysis detected transcripts of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso In zzso zzso recordings, zzso application of zzso activated zzso currents in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso from zzso on pancreatic zzso hormone zzso The zzso increased zzso zzso at 1 zzso zzso twofold and completely abolished the zzso action of 20 zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of insulin and zzso were unaffected by zzso The zzso zzso channel blocker zzso evoked a paradoxical stimulation of zzso zzso This effect was not observed in the presence of zzso and we therefore conclude that zzso stimulates zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso
