The main zzso system of zzso zzso zzso is made up of at least two zzso consisting of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso One zzso subset lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso and responds to zzso acid zzso The second subset has the zzso zzso zzso but as yet suitable zzso are zzso Here we report the identification of zzso as proper zzso stimuli for zzso zzso zzso using functional zzso imaging and slice preparations of the zzso zzso The response profiles of individual zzso to a number of zzso were extremely complex and mostly highly zzso The great majority of zzso zzso responded also to zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Most zzso responses could be attenuated by the zzso zzso channel inhibitor zzso This confirms that most zzso zzso receptors zzso are coupled to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that trace zzso receptors zzso which have been shown to act as specific zzso for zzso in zzso are expressed in the zzso organ of zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso zzso however, explain the complex responses of individual zzso to zzso because there are too few of zzso This indicates that, in addition to zzso there must be other zzso families involved in the detection of zzso
