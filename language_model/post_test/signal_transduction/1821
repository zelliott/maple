In this study we continued decoding the zzso zzso signaling mechanism that zzso the effect of insulin and related zzso We show for the first time that insulin signal zzso via an zzso zzso signaling zzso which is attended by zzso zzso zzso is blocked in the muscle zzso of the rat and the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of: 1) zzso zzso which zzso the action of the zzso zzso protein zzso 2) zzso a specific blocker of zzso zzso and 3) zzso C, an inhibitor of different zzso of protein zzso zzso The treatment of zzso membrane fraction with zzso toxin increases zzso zzso zzso activity and decreases the sensitivity of the zzso to zzso We suggest that the stimulating effect of insulin on zzso zzso involves the following stages of hormonal signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
