Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that protein zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso factor zzso B in zzso a zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso is one of the major zzso of various zzso molecules in human zzso cells and their expression is known to require the zzso of zzso B, we examined the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso treated with zzso rapidly activated zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso this effect was completely abolished by zzso with zzso oxide zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso The induction of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso occurred within 6 h and was also completely zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was found to be effective even when added 3 h after zzso suggesting a rapid mode of action of this zzso Besides zzso other zzso of zzso including zzso and zzso also blocked zzso zzso B zzso and induction of all the three zzso zzso zzso with these results, the attachment of zzso to zzso was also blocked by the zzso zzso Thus, overall, our results demonstrate that a zzso is involved either directly or indirectly in the zzso leading to the induction of zzso cell zzso molecules by zzso Because of their role in cell zzso zzso may provide a novel target of drug development for treatment of zzso zzso and tumor zzso
