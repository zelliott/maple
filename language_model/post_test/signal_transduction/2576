The possible involvement of zzso C beta zzso zzso in a zzso mechanism between zzso coupled receptors and zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso and zzso zzso A basic activity of the zzso for zzso growth factor zzso in the absence of its zzso was found only in zzso cells zzso this zzso zzso of zzso drastically increased zzso zzso activity in both cell lines, suggesting that zzso activity is necessary for the zzso of the zzso zzso in the absence of its zzso zzso of zzso beta and protein zzso C zzso via zzso zzso receptors greatly diminished the basic zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This negative regulation was prevented by the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest a zzso between a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso involving zzso via zzso beta and zzso to a downstream protein zzso zzso functioning in the control of zzso zzso zzso
