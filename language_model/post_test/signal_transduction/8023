zzso is a respiratory disorder characterized by airway inflammation and zzso associated with zzso airway zzso The relative contributions of airway zzso and inflammation are still zzso but ultimately, airway narrowing zzso by airway smooth muscle contraction is the final zzso to zzso zzso effort has been devoted towards identifying the factors that lead to the airway smooth muscle zzso observed in zzso and this will be the focus of this zzso zzso zzso has been observed in severe and fatal zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso plays a protective role or worsens airway zzso zzso muscle plasticity is a mechanism likely implicated in zzso zzso zzso filament zzso lead to zzso force production, independent of muscle zzso Increased smooth muscle rate of zzso via altered signaling pathways or altered zzso protein expression has been demonstrated in asthma and in numerous models of airway zzso Increased rate of zzso is implicated in zzso the relaxing effect of tidal breathing and deep zzso thereby creating a contracted airway smooth muscle zzso Further studies are therefore required to understand the numerous mechanisms leading to the airway zzso observed in asthma as well as their multiple zzso
