A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso or gas zzso in humans by producing numerous zzso toxins and zzso that act in concert to degrade host zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso of the zzso gene that is reported to be responsible for the production of zzso 2 zzso which zzso in zzso sensing in zzso The zzso zzso was constructed using zzso zzso strain 13, and the role of the zzso gene in toxin production was zzso The zzso culture zzso from zzso strain 13 greatly zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas that from the zzso zzso caused no significant zzso indicating that the zzso gene is necessary for zzso production in zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a reduced level of production of zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso gene zzso was lower at zzso growth phase, whereas zzso and zzso gene zzso was not significantly zzso The production of toxins in the zzso zzso was zzso by the addition of the culture zzso from the zzso cells, possibly because of the presence of zzso Moreover, the expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso was apparently activated when the zzso cells were cultured in the presence of culture zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso carrying the zzso gene of zzso zzso A deletion analysis of the zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene alone is responsible for zzso zzso and that the zzso or zzso genes located upstream of zzso are not involved in regulating toxin zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso by zzso plays an important role in the regulation of toxin production in zzso zzso
