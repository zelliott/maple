The zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso to control zzso growth and guidance in zzso motor zzso In part, this is zzso by binding to zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso for zzso zzso We show here that one of the two zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso is essential for zzso motor zzso guidance and for the genetic suppression of zzso function in motor zzso zzso but the zzso zzso domain is zzso zzso with this, we show that zzso and not zzso or zzso interacts genetically with zzso in a manner indistinguishable from that of bona fide zzso signaling zzso We zzso therefore, that zzso is a key component of zzso signaling in zzso motor zzso and specifically that it is the crucial zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
