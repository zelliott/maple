Genes regulating zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso have largely been identified on the basis of their involvement in zzso development or zzso A third zzso zzso is the first zzso stage zzso zzso which is also influenced by zzso a regulator of zzso zzso We reasoned that new regulators of zzso strength might be identified in screens based on the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso six genes were selected for analysis by virtue of their predicted interaction with zzso and screened for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as genes which, when zzso caused zzso arrest without any associated feeding zzso Several tests indicated that zzso strength was weaker and that insulin zzso was defective in these zzso This study highlights the role of the zzso network and the zzso in insulin zzso and provides a new list of genes that zzso zzso in zzso zzso
