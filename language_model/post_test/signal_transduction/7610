Cancer stem cell zzso especially their zzso and zzso zzso play an essential role in zzso progression and response to zzso zzso Currently, it remains largely unknown what pathways are involved in the regulation of cancer cell zzso and zzso Previously, we found that zzso 1 zzso zzso or zzso a zzso regulated zzso plays a critical role in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso 1 zzso and zzso two closely related genes with zzso functions, including regulation of zzso function and gene zzso zzso interacts with the zzso complex via its zzso domain and regulates zzso functions, including zzso membrane potential and production of zzso oxygen zzso We have further found that zzso and especially zzso regulate cancer cell zzso as well as their zzso zzso zzso the zzso interaction constitutes a new signaling zzso that maintains zzso and zzso potential of cancer zzso 

This study provides a new zzso insight into the regulation of the stem cell characteristics of cancer zzso
