zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso predominantly expressed in T zzso crucial for initiating T cell zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso culminating in T cell zzso gene expression and zzso zzso As a consequence of a zzso screen for selective, novel zzso of zzso an zzso compound was identified, zzso which zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso zzso Under similar zzso conditions, the zzso compound was zzso in blocking the zzso zzso zzso activity but was 50 to 100 times less potent against the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso in zzso T cells zzso zzso 35 zzso and blocked T cell proliferation in response to zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary T cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and was zzso A substitution of zzso for the sulfur atom in the zzso ring of the compound completely zzso the ability to inhibit zzso zzso activity and zzso signal zzso zzso with zzso such as zzso or zzso also blocked the ability of the zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis established the zzso modification of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Together these data support an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups within the zzso zzso domain react with the zzso ring, leading to ring opening and zzso bond formation with the zzso zzso Loss of zzso activity due to zzso zzso has been suggested to play a role in the pathology of zzso zzso a similar mechanism of zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso described in this report, may occur in the intact T cell and may zzso certain T cell zzso
