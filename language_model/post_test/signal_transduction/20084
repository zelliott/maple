We previously clarified that zzso zzso II zzso a zzso zzso zzso exerts various protective actions on cardiovascular diseases in both experimental and clinical zzso In the present study, we aimed to clarify whether zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso Male zzso zzso zzso mice and male zzso zzso zzso mice at the age of zzso weeks were subjected to unilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood flow analysis showed that blood flow recovery in response to zzso zzso was delayed in zzso mice compared with that in zzso zzso zzso number, zzso number, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and liver zzso B1 zzso zzso in zzso muscles were decreased in zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso administration almost restored blood flow recovery, zzso density, and zzso number as well as zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso muscles of zzso zzso Although treatment with zzso increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso was abolished by compound C, an zzso zzso and by zzso zzso In a similar fashion, tube formation, zzso and migration of zzso were also promoted by zzso treatment and were zzso by zzso with compound zzso zzso zzso the zzso of vascular zzso cells and the promotion of zzso in response to zzso zzso via an zzso signaling zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a novel therapeutic target for treatment of patients with peripheral circulation zzso
