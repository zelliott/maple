zzso is a key step in tumor growth and zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cells remains zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso zzso enhances the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In turn, zzso zzso activates zzso and the zzso zzso as a positive feedback zzso zzso the feedback signal by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso inhibitor can partially inhibit the zzso human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso proliferation and tube formation, while blocking the signal by zzso or zzso zzso completely abrogates the biological effects of zzso on zzso In addition, blood vessel formation is also investigated in zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso is more effective than that of zzso zzso which only blocks the feedback zzso These data show that zzso enhances zzso directly through zzso and zzso pathways with zzso acting as a positive feedback zzso The results suggest that zzso might be a valuable target for developing novel zzso therapy for treatment of zzso
