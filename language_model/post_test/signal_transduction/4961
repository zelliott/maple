The role of the zzso system in cancer cell zzso has expanded zzso over the last zzso Once thought to participate only in synaptic transmission and zzso zzso the presence of functional zzso receptors has since been demonstrated in peripheral zzso Most notable is the implication of zzso receptors in the zzso of various human zzso We previously described the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso in melanoma development in zzso zzso a transgenic mouse line, developed spontaneous melanoma with zzso zzso in the absence of any known zzso zzso zzso zzso clones display transformed zzso in zzso and were aggressively zzso in zzso Recent reports from other groups zzso two additional members of the zzso zzso zzso family in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso These findings highlight a previously underappreciated link between the zzso signaling zzso and zzso in melanoma biology, raising exciting possibilities in zzso mechanisms in zzso transformation and exploring zzso receptors as novel therapeutic zzso Here we further consider the potential mechanisms by which zzso receptors can function as an zzso leading to zzso zzso
