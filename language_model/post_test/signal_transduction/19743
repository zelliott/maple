The role of the zzso hormone axis in zzso longevity has been studied in diverse experimental models in zzso This zzso axis allows regulation of lifespan via metabolism modifications and zzso stress defense zzso Signaling can be altered at zzso zzso or signal zzso zzso level through zzso zzso mouse models affecting zzso differentiation factors zzso or zzso zzso receptors of zzso zzso or insulin, or zzso zzso zzso or zzso showed that regulation of the zzso zzso axis is pivotal for maintaining an equilibrium between growth, zzso zzso stress defense and zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in similarly zzso zzso indicating that control of longevity is possible by selectively targeting the zzso In addition to genetic zzso lifespan can be efficiently manipulated in mice by altering the environment, for instance by zzso caloric zzso or zzso as has been shown in a recent study about the effects of zzso on zzso Moreover, recent studies of the human zzso of aging revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are more frequent in certain zzso zzso This suggested that these results are in principle zzso to zzso
