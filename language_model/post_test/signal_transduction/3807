zzso expression of zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in a large, zzso zzso zzso response following zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which interact zzso with the G alpha zzso zzso zzso A substantially greater zzso was obtained with zzso targeted zzso compared to zzso expressed zzso To generate a system amenable for the study of zzso activity at virtually any zzso zzso the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso G alpha 16 was either zzso or zzso expressed in zzso cells together with zzso In cells expressing G alpha 16, but not in its absence, zzso at a series of receptors which normally interact with either G alpha s or G alpha i were now able to cause a zzso response from zzso targeted zzso In the case of the A1 zzso zzso this response was clearly a result of zzso of G alpha 16 and not a consequence of the release of the G alpha zzso zzso complex, as the zzso response was unaffected by zzso toxin treatment of the cells, whereas zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was zzso These studies describe the use of zzso zzso as a reporter for zzso zzso calcium zzso Furthermore, zzso of G alpha 16 and zzso provides a basis for a generic zzso cell zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso action at virtually any zzso zzso including orphan receptors for which the zzso signal zzso mechanism may be zzso
