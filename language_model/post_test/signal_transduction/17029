The most challenging and wanted development in zzso therapy is the control of zzso zzso zzso and the mechanism of cell zzso zzso zzso administered to zzso cells as zzso solution accumulates in the zzso membrane zzso where it causes severe zzso and cell zzso In contrast, when incorporated in marine zzso gum zzso zzso the zzso is shuttled through CM allowing its gradual release and zzso in zzso and zzso Little zzso was caused to cells in this case, but compelling zzso are presented showing that zzso changes the zzso and shifts the cell death mechanism from necrosis to zzso In conclusion, both of those challenges can be overcome by zzso of typical zzso such as zzso by using the new concept of zzso treatment with minimal cell damage by targeting specifically some key zzso We are confident that these findings are important for the development of more efficient zzso tailored to induce zzso while minimizing zzso side effects such as zzso
