Previous research demonstrated that the crude zzso of zzso zzso improve zzso metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic zzso however, which individual zzso are the most potent insulin zzso is zzso 

This study investigated which zzso have zzso action in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso actions of six zzso from zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso was determined in zzso zzso Four individual zzso (20 zzso body zzso were orally administered to zzso zzso diabetic mice fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks to evaluate zzso tolerance by oral zzso tolerance testing zzso insulin sensitivity by insulin tolerance testing, and insulin signaling in the liver and zzso zzso 

zzso acid zzso most effectively increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso possibly in part by working as a zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso however, none of the zzso improved zzso insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso diabetic mice exhibited the lowest peak serum zzso levels and highest serum insulin levels during the first part of zzso PA also improved insulin zzso PA increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso storage in liver, which was associated with enhanced zzso insulin zzso while PA zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and improved insulin signaling and increased zzso zzso into the zzso 

PA improves zzso zzso in type 2 diabetic mice, partly by enhancing zzso and zzso insulin sensitivity, possibly by zzso zzso
