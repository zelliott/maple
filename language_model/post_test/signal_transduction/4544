zzso receptors have previously been shown to elicit cellular signaling through the zzso G zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that this functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and native zzso T cells zzso expressing zzso and zzso ), with zzso zzso zzso occurring at zzso while marked zzso zzso became zzso only upon zzso treatment for zzso or zzso By employing signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we further showed that the zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso were independent of each zzso zzso obtained from zzso of zzso cells revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso with the former mainly situated in zzso and zzso while the latter was predominantly located in the zzso Further experiments revealed that the zzso zzso zzso at zzso was significantly suppressed by zzso with zzso (a zzso zzso suggesting that de zzso protein synthesis might play a critical role for this zzso Using zzso media obtained from zzso zzso zzso cells, multiplex zzso revealed that prolonged zzso treatment led to elevated productions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso against zzso but not those for zzso and zzso effectively abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is capable of triggering the production of zzso including zzso and this zzso loop may account for the subsequent zzso zzso at zzso zzso
