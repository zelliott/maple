zzso zzso zzso protein of 27 zzso is a newly identified integral membrane protein constituent of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso We identified its primary structure from zzso clones isolated from a mouse skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso of zzso were found mainly in zzso libraries from excitable zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed the expression of zzso in skeletal muscle and, to a lower extent, in heart and zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso prediction analysis suggested that zzso has four zzso alpha zzso and its zzso domain faces the zzso side of the zzso zzso The expression of zzso is higher in fast zzso skeletal muscles compared to slow zzso muscles and zzso during the first month of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated that zzso is distributed in both zzso zzso and terminal zzso of the zzso as well as in the zzso membrane systems and the nuclear envelope of zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso as well as by zzso a well characterized zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is part of a zzso zzso complex, suggesting the involvement of zzso in the structural organization or function of the molecular machinery underlying zzso zzso
