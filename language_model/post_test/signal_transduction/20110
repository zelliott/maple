There is a pressing need to identify zzso markers of zzso disease and targets for zzso Combining zzso zzso sequencing, functional zzso zzso studies and clinical zzso we identify leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso as a breast cancer zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso and upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in highly zzso tumor cells suppresses zzso by triggering a zzso zzso cascade that leads to zzso zzso retention and functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso loss of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells zzso migration, invasion and zzso colonization through zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in human breast zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso in approximately 1,000 zzso breast tumors, zzso expression status correlated with zzso recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the zzso These findings identify zzso as a zzso zzso that functions through the zzso zzso and has significant zzso zzso
