The zzso zzso tract is critical to AIDS zzso as it is the primary site for viral transmission and a major site of viral replication and zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso disease, a major complication of zzso infection can facilitate zzso of zzso bacterial products causing zzso immune zzso leading to AIDS zzso 

To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso disease we analyzed global gene expression profiles zzso in the zzso of the same animals prior to and at 21 and zzso post zzso infection zzso More zzso we zzso information gathering by examining distinct zzso components zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The use of sequential zzso zzso combined with focused examination of distinct zzso compartments represents novel approaches not previously zzso Here we report data pertaining to the zzso A significant increase zzso in immune zzso cell zzso cell zzso zzso and cell zzso genes were observed at 21 and zzso zzso Genes associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were notably zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso genes at zzso zzso included zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximately 57 genes regulating zzso zzso a critical zzso shift associated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed further zzso of inflammation zzso zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso microbial zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso suggests further deterioration of overall immune zzso 

The reported zzso signatures provide significant new details on the molecular pathology of zzso induced zzso disease and provide new opportunity for future zzso
