A high fat diet zzso has long been linked to immune dysfunction, including diminished numbers or zzso of zzso increased zzso to infection, inhibited zzso function during zzso responses and developed zzso zzso Whereas the molecular zzso events associated with immune zzso remain to be fully zzso Using the DNA zzso system, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of zzso related signal zzso proteins in zzso of zzso mice in order to gain insight on the possible molecular mechanism by which zzso induced zzso stress effects on signal zzso of zzso zzso of present study showed that zzso induced zzso stress and zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso supplement ameliorated that zzso induced zzso stress and zzso by recovering zzso levels of the gene involved in B cell zzso T cell differentiation signaling pathway, and free radical zzso The present study indicates that a zzso can induce chronic zzso stress, suppress signal zzso of zzso zzso and lead to an zzso of zzso zzso
