zzso growth factor zzso zzso regulates growth and zzso Here, we examine the function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso regulates lifespan via the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso As animals enter adulthood, zzso zzso zzso the expression of genes involved in the zzso zzso system zzso including the zzso protein zzso while zzso the expression of zzso zzso Using reporters for global UPS activity, protein zzso and zzso stress, we find that zzso zzso alters protein zzso in adults by increasing UPS activity and zzso while decreasing protein zzso We show that zzso and the zzso zzso that comprise the zzso fusion degradation zzso complex are required for the increase in UPS activity observed in adults, and that animals that lack zzso or the zzso have reduced zzso and indications of zzso zzso We propose that as animals enter fertile adulthood, zzso zzso switches the mechanism for maintaining protein zzso from a zzso approach to an approach involving protein elimination via zzso UPS zzso
