zzso membrane proteins are important zzso sensors, and defects in their zzso may have profound zzso and zzso zzso To determine how sensory receptors zzso to zzso we performed a forward genetic screen and identified 11 zzso with defects in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a transient zzso potential zzso zzso zzso Class A zzso zzso exhibit defects in zzso zzso zzso while Class B zzso zzso zzso accumulate zzso in zzso Further characterization reveals that some genes zzso in zzso zzso act in a zzso manner while others are likely to play more general roles in such processes as zzso transport zzso To this end, we identified a Class B zzso that zzso the function of the zzso zzso light intermediate chain gene zzso Identification of the remaining zzso will reveal novel molecular pathways required for zzso zzso zzso and provide further insight into mechanisms of zzso zzso
