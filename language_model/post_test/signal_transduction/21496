zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso transport zzso However, the means by which zzso regulates zzso protein distribution is zzso We have used zzso zzso protein to dissect the regulation of zzso activity in zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is required for the ability of zzso to zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso act in a zzso cascade initiated by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso which binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain found in zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso interacts with zzso and that zzso by zzso increases zzso zzso We show that a zzso zzso loop zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso This zzso is rapid and requires the zzso zzso Cell extracts from flowers and zzso shoots dramatically increase zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso in which the zzso domain was zzso failed to be activated by the zzso shoot zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells in which zzso expression was inhibited by zzso showed a dramatic reduction in zzso of zzso basic protein zzso These results indicate that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso activity and provide evidence that zzso signaling may play a role in the signaling processes controlling polar zzso zzso
