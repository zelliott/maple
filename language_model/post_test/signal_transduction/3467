zzso characterized by loss of differentiation of liver zzso zzso cells zzso precedes the onset of zzso zzso We investigated whether restoration of zzso differentiation would zzso zzso with activated zzso zzso cells zzso and thereby promote zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso were cultured with zzso and/or zzso and examined by scanning electron zzso for zzso in sieve zzso zzso was induced in rats using zzso followed by administration of BAY zzso an zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso Fibrosis was assessed by Sirius red zzso expression of zzso muscle zzso was measured by zzso zzso 

Maintenance of zzso differentiation requires vascular zzso growth zzso stimulation of zzso zzso signaling (via zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In rats with zzso zzso BAY zzso accelerated the complete reversal of zzso zzso differentiation of zzso without directly affecting zzso of zzso or zzso Restoration of differentiation to zzso led to zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in the absence of further exposure to BAY zzso zzso of zzso with BAY zzso prevented progression of zzso despite continued administration of zzso 

The state of zzso differentiation plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
