zzso has a variety of zzso effects but the molecular basis of its function is still mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is highly dependent on zzso modifications and the assembly of zzso and zzso zzso Several proteins involved in zzso alpha signaling have recently been found to be zzso including zzso alpha itself and zzso a key zzso in the functional regulation of zzso zzso zzso alpha complexes also contain zzso zzso zzso which repress zzso Our purpose was to clarify the role of protein zzso and zzso function in the zzso zzso alpha signaling in zzso zzso zzso We observed that increasing zzso zzso status with zzso A, a potent zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, and even more extensively in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso Several zzso antagonists, such as zzso and zzso were zzso zzso an zzso drug which is recently characterized as a zzso zzso was also able to zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the function of zzso zzso with zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is not involved in zzso alpha zzso Our results reveal that zzso alpha signaling is dependent on protein zzso and zzso zzso
