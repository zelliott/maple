zzso zzso and zzso are the major zzso antioxidants protecting cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso states of zzso and zzso have been used as indicators of zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso and zzso zzso systems regulate cell signaling and zzso pathways differently and independently during diverse stressful zzso In the current study, we used a mass zzso zzso zzso approach to test responses of the zzso zzso zzso to selective disruption of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to inhibit zzso zzso without zzso zzso of the zzso couple, and zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso without zzso zzso of zzso zzso for 606 zzso peptides zzso zzso showed that zzso were oxidized more than zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso zzso was only zzso Mean fold zzso of these peptides was also higher by zzso than zzso zzso Analysis of potential functional pathways showed that zzso oxidized peptides associated with zzso zzso zzso translation and cell zzso Of 60 zzso zzso oxidized due to depletion of zzso 41 were also oxidized by zzso and included proteins of translation and cell zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso Studies to test functional zzso showed that zzso zzso activity and zzso levels were decreased with zzso but not zzso confirming the effects on zzso proteins are sensitive to zzso by zzso These data show that the zzso system regulates a broader range of proteins than the zzso system, support distinct function of zzso and zzso in cellular zzso control, and show for the first time in zzso cells selective targeting zzso zzso and biological pathways due to deficient function of the zzso zzso
