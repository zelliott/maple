The prevailing model of zzso zzso patterning of the zzso zzso predicts that the prospective zzso is zzso at zzso in response to a zzso of zzso This zzso is established by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso An interesting question is whether zzso tissue passively reads graded levels of zzso signals, or whether local zzso regulatory circuits may exist on the zzso side to control cell behavior and differentiation at a distance from the zzso We provide evidence that zzso a zzso zzso protein expressed zzso during and after zzso functions in a negative feedback loop that limits allocation of zzso cells to the extreme zzso fate, with direct consequences for zzso and formation of the blood zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein results in expansion of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso blood islands, indicating that this negative regulation is required for proper patterning of the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is apparently very different from that of other zzso zzso zzso and does not involve zzso of zzso Our data are consistent with the existence of some limited zzso properties of the extreme zzso zzso
