Resistance zzso proteins are involved in specific pathogen recognition and subsequent initiation of host zzso Most R proteins are zzso binding - zzso rich repeat zzso zzso which form a zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso with numerous zzso zzso zzso of these zzso proteins depends on their ability to bind and zzso zzso Since R protein zzso often triggers zzso tight regulation of zzso is zzso zzso which seems to be accomplished by zzso interactions between the various zzso is important to retain R proteins zzso This review summarizes recent data on zzso and zzso interactions that support a model in which pathogen perception triggers a series of zzso changes, allowing the newly exposed zzso domain to interact with downstream zzso partners and activate zzso zzso
