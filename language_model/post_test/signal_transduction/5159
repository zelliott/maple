zzso substance zzso in zzso is the only known zzso zzso hormone responsible for final zzso zzso rendering it functionally analogous to zzso in zzso Recently, we zzso zzso from zzso nerves in the zzso zzso zzso and identified the chemical structure as a zzso composed of two different peptides zzso and zzso with zzso zzso This study examined the hormonal action of zzso on zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso in growing zzso zzso and fully grown zzso zzso zzso and particularly the mode of signal zzso The action of zzso on zzso production by zzso cells in stage V was zzso through the production of zzso In contrast, zzso failed to induce zzso and zzso production by zzso cells in stage zzso According to competitive experiments using zzso and zzso zzso highly specific binding was observed in zzso cells, though their affinities and numbers in stage IV were inferior to those in stage zzso Interestingly, zzso was not detected zzso in zzso cell zzso of stage zzso zzso was also faint in stage zzso Although zzso zzso activity in stage V was zzso activated by zzso in the presence of zzso neither zzso in the presence of zzso nor zzso zzso zzso were effective on the activity in stage zzso These findings strongly suggest that the failure of zzso to produce zzso is because of a lack of zzso in zzso cells at stage zzso
