The molecular zzso behind the development of zzso resistance in breast cancer remains zzso Here, we compare the capability of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso versus zzso zzso cells zzso to handle DNA repair, transmit signals from damaged DNA, initiate cell death via zzso and then to control transmitted signals from the cell cycle and to zzso growth factors and zzso Genes related to these events were studied by zzso zzso zzso human breast cells zzso and human zzso zzso cells zzso were used as zzso Of the 18 genes investigated, 10 genes showed differences in their expression between the cell zzso The zzso cells showed higher expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 2 and a lower expression of zzso beta zzso No differences in the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found between the two cell zzso We found that the zzso cells were characterized zzso zzso a zzso expression of growth factors and cell cycle regulation compounds, zzso improved DNA repair capacity, but zzso no change in DNA damage signals and zzso zzso zzso DNA repair capacity of zzso cells would have a growth advantage over zzso zzso when receiving zzso zzso
