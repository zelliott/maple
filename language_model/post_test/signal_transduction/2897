zzso a natural zzso zzso has significant zzso activity against a variety of cancer cells, yet little is known about its zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso had obvious zzso zzso against the human zzso lung cancer zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso induced cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso zzso also had zzso effects on zzso cells as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which contributed to the cell cycle zzso zzso also increased total zzso protein levels, decreased zzso ratio and expression of the downstream factors zzso and zzso which triggered the intrinsic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso blocked zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which might also contribute to its zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso induced zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso displays significant zzso effects through cell cycle arrest and zzso induction in zzso zzso These effects were associated with intrinsic zzso zzso and disrupted zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso may have therapeutic potential against zzso
