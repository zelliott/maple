The zzso zzso zzso zzso stress response system is activated by zzso zzso zzso components of protein export systems and is essential for zzso The zzso membrane proteins zzso and zzso were proposed to be dual function components of the system, acting both as positive regulators of zzso gene expression and to support survival during zzso zzso In this study we have zzso the regulatory and zzso functions of zzso and discovered unexpected new roles, functional zzso and essential zzso zzso First, we showed that zzso controls zzso concentration by both zzso and zzso zzso We then screened for zzso zzso with altered zzso regulatory zzso zzso we identified zzso and zzso zzso that activated zzso gene expression in the absence of zzso zzso Together with a subsequent zzso analysis, this revealed that the zzso zzso domain plays an unforeseen role in zzso regulating zzso gene zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain abolished its ability to activate zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso unable to activate zzso gene expression retained their ability to support survival during zzso zzso These data provide compelling support for the proposal that these two functions are zzso
