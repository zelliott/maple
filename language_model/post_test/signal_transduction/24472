Human zzso zzso is a member of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso family that has been shown to function as a zzso with the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso However, zzso can also activate the zzso protein zzso and zzso pathways independently of zzso and zzso by an unknown zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso specifically binds to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and activates the zzso zzso zzso triggering the zzso protein zzso and zzso signaling zzso Finally, an active zzso zzso is necessary for zzso to induce in zzso transformation and migration in mouse zzso zzso zzso
