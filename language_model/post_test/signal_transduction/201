The zzso clock regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development and promotes plant zzso zzso identification of clock zzso primarily in zzso has led to recent rapid progress in our understanding of the clock mechanism in higher zzso Using mathematical modeling and experimental approaches, workers in the field have developed a model of the clock that incorporates both zzso and zzso regulation of clock zzso This zzso clock, or zzso generates rhythmic zzso that can be monitored at the cellular and zzso zzso The clock not only zzso daily rhythms in growth and zzso but also interacts with signaling pathways involved in plant responses to the zzso Future work will lead to a better understanding of how the clock and other signaling networks are integrated to provide plants with an zzso zzso
