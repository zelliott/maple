zzso is a complex zzso system characterizing zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso system regulates the initiation of zzso by zzso a myriad of positive and negative signals through the action of zzso sensor zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso the zzso response regulator and zzso factor of the zzso In this study we analyzed the role of the zzso signature motif in protein zzso This family is characterized by a zzso signature motif centered around the sequence zzso zzso scanning zzso was carried out on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso and in zzso activities were zzso The ability of the zzso proteins to interact with zzso approximately P was zzso by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso The results suggested that zzso 43 has a critical role in zzso zzso activity, whereas the other zzso have a role in protein zzso and/or interaction with zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not seem to have any critical functional or structural zzso We propose that zzso of zzso may function in a manner similar to the one proposed for the zzso mechanisms of zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso These proteins use an zzso zzso as their common zzso strategy and the active site of zzso zzso proteins shares a common geometry and identity of zzso zzso acids with the active site of response regulators ( Ridder, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso 339, zzso zzso
