zzso quality control plays a vital role in the maintenance of optimal zzso zzso However, its roles and regulation remain zzso in cardiac zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso an zzso recently described as being involved in the regulation of cardiac zzso is important for zzso the maintenance of normal cardiac zzso zzso and zzso adequate recovery from zzso a condition known to induce zzso zzso injury through poorly understood zzso zzso of zzso and cardiac function were thus performed in zzso and zzso mice at baseline and at 2 different times following administration of a zzso dose of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso injection induced cardiac and zzso zzso that were followed by complete recovery in zzso zzso Recovery was associated with zzso and zzso evidence of zzso suggesting that this process is implicated in cardiac recovery from zzso Under baseline conditions, multiple cardiac zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso These mild zzso did not result in a visibly distinct cardiac zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited impaired recovery of cardiac zzso and constant degradation of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso clearance of damaged zzso was still possible in the absence of zzso likely through zzso mechanisms implicating zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Together, these results thus provide evidence that in zzso zzso zzso is activated during zzso and that compensation for a lack of zzso is only partial and/or that zzso exerts additional protective roles in zzso
