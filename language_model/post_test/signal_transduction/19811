The transition to flowering is known to be regulated by numerous interacting zzso and environmental cues, of which zzso zzso a group of zzso steroid zzso appear to be linked to the regulation of flowering zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited delayed flowering time by at least 10 d compared with the wild zzso The levels of zzso zzso in zzso were below zzso of the wild zzso The timing of flowering was also delayed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso and different zzso precursors were zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this showed that zzso in the zzso zzso content and the level of different zzso precursors affect flowering time in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso also showed that components of the zzso signal zzso zzso affect flowering zzso So far, reports on a connection between zzso and flowering time are zzso This review summarizes recent advances regarding the action of zzso in the transition to zzso
