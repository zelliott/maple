zzso A is the sensor zzso zzso responsible for processing zzso phase information and providing zzso input to the zzso that activates zzso zzso via zzso zzso A protein zzso zzso of zzso A was discovered zzso in an zzso of genes of unknown function but regulated by the availability of fixed zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of the zzso reaction of zzso A but does not inhibit zzso transfer to the zzso response regulator once zzso A is zzso zzso is an inhibitor of the zzso domain of zzso A affecting the zzso reactions and not the zzso functions of this zzso The zzso activity of zzso is zzso by the product of another gene in the zzso zzso This protein may bind to zzso preventing its function as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso may be the first representative of a new class of signal zzso zzso that function by direct interaction with the zzso domain of zzso zzso to counteract signals influencing the zzso domain of such zzso This inhibitor represents yet another way by which the zzso signal zzso system is affected by negative regulators under the control of zzso zzso or cell cycle influences antithetical to the initiation of zzso zzso
