To zzso zzso cells with zzso for zzso of T cells zzso or zzso zzso zzso of which near the zzso region were zzso for zzso by zzso and observe the change in T cell signal zzso after the cross linkage with zzso zzso 

By means of zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso and then subjected to cross linkage with zzso zzso The locations of the fusion protein zzso and zzso were observed with zzso zzso The proliferation activity of the zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso and the content of zzso 2 zzso in cell zzso was detected by zzso Western zzso was used to test the zzso level of zzso in each zzso 

After the cross linkage of zzso zzso zzso could not locate on zzso zzso just as zzso zzso The cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso decreased as compared with the ones zzso with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso was much lower than that of zzso 

The zzso of zzso site of zzso attenuated the signal zzso of zzso in T zzso
