How cell numbers are determined is not zzso zzso activity is involved in precursor cell proliferation and stem cell zzso and its deregulation sustains the growth of many human zzso However, it is not known whether zzso the final zzso of zzso signals, controls stem cell numbers, and how its activity is restricted to curtail zzso Here we have altered the levels of zzso and zzso the major zzso zzso in multiple zzso We show that zzso expression in zzso neural zzso increases precursor and zzso stem cell numbers in zzso and in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso neural stem cell zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity, nuclear zzso and levels of zzso and in turn, zzso zzso zzso establishing an zzso zzso We also find that zzso regulates the zzso of a novel N' truncated putative zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso The balance of zzso and zzso functions, thus, determines cell numbers, and prevalence of zzso restricts zzso stem cell expansion and zzso
