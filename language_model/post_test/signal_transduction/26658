zzso zzso is a zzso with features of skeletal muscle, and the most common soft tissue zzso of zzso Survival for high-risk groups is approximately zzso at 5 years and there are no durable therapies tailored to its genetic zzso During genetic modeling of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we noted that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso 4 zzso was zzso as an early event in zzso zzso we evaluated the expression of zzso in zzso compared with zzso and whether zzso had similar or distinct roles in their zzso 

Human zzso cell lines and tumor tissue were analyzed for zzso expression by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso respectively, were used to study the role of zzso in zzso cell lines in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso was also zzso 

zzso is expressed in both zzso zzso but protein expression is higher in zzso The signature zzso gene fusion product, zzso induced zzso expression in primary human zzso In zzso zzso zzso reduced cell proliferation in zzso and zzso formation in zzso In zzso it diminished cell survival in zzso In zzso and zzso zzso was necessary and sufficient for expression of zzso whereas in zzso this induction was not observed, suggesting differential zzso zzso 

These studies define zzso roles for zzso in zzso zzso and support further study of zzso as a therapeutic zzso
