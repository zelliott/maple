The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso is a zzso protein that mediates the toxic and zzso responses to zzso and related environmental zzso In an effort to better understand the details of this signal zzso pathway, we employed the zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso Through the use of arrayed zzso strains harboring ordered deletions of open reading zzso we determined that 54 out of the zzso zzso genes examined significantly influence zzso signal zzso In an effort to describe the relationship between these zzso zzso we constructed a network map based upon their known protein and genetic zzso zzso Carlo simulations demonstrated that this network represented a description of zzso signaling that was distinct from those generated by random zzso The network map was then explored with a number of zzso and experimental zzso These analyses revealed that the zzso signaling zzso is defined by at least five distinct signaling steps that are regulated by functional zzso of interacting zzso These zzso can be described as zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso level, and a previously zzso nuclear step related to the zzso zzso zzso
