Whether environmental exposure to zzso A zzso may induce zzso disorders is still controversial but certain studies have reported that zzso may cause zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso and female zzso However, little is known about the effect of zzso on zzso in adult zzso To determine whether zzso exposure at an environmentally relevant dose could induce zzso abnormalities in adult male rats, we exposed zzso male zzso rats to zzso by zzso at zzso body weight zzso for 60 consecutive zzso We found that zzso significantly increased the proportion of stage zzso zzso zzso and decreased the proportion of stage zzso zzso zzso was inhibited and zzso was zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso exposure delayed zzso initiation in the early zzso stage and induced the zzso of zzso abnormalities and zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso in the late zzso zzso The latter event subsequently activated the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Our results suggest that long-term exposure to zzso may lead to continuous zzso abnormalities and ultimately put zzso zzso health at zzso
