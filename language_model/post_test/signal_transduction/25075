In zzso mice, zzso are found associated with zzso but not circulating B and T zzso and in the zzso which contains zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and maintenance of mature zzso require the presence of B cells expressing zzso zzso Treatment of mice with soluble zzso zzso results in the disappearance of mature zzso from the zzso We show that this treatment zzso zzso prion zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso are the principal sites for prion replication in the zzso
