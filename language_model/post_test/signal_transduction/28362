The essential zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor in zzso The zzso protein regulates zzso zzso or repression of zzso from a variety of genes required for cell growth, development, zzso or tumor suppression, as well as from genes in some zzso and DNA zzso Among the specific functions attributed to zzso is a role in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein binds to the zzso alpha element, a regulatory sequence found in all zzso zzso zzso We therefore examined the zzso zzso activity and zzso of the zzso protein throughout the cell cycle in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that, whereas the zzso activity of zzso increased dramatically early in S phase, the zzso zzso and protein levels did zzso zzso changed zzso distribution patterns during the cell cycle, from mainly zzso at zzso to mainly nuclear at early and middle S phase, then back to primarily zzso later in S zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso near the zzso boundary coincided with both an increase in zzso zzso activity and the coordinate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The DNA synthesis inhibitor zzso caused a nearly complete loss of nuclear zzso whereas addition of caffeine or zzso to zzso cells restored both DNA synthesis and zzso zzso in the zzso These findings reveal a mechanism by which zzso zzso is coupled to DNA synthesis and responsive to zzso signaling zzso Taken together, our results provide insight into how zzso might participate in the zzso control over a variety of nuclear events required for cell division and zzso
