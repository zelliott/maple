The goals of this study were to determine zzso if zzso enhances human adult zzso stem cell zzso differentiation into zzso as assessed by measuring alkaline zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso identify potential signal zzso pathways that mediate this zzso zzso activity significantly increased in zzso following a 10-day incubation in zzso zzso relative to zzso incubated in zzso growth medium zzso zzso zzso zzso added in combination with the zzso zzso significantly increased zzso activity relative to zzso medium zzso zzso of zzso to zzso medium supplemented with zzso and either zzso toxin or the zzso zzso antagonists, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso increase in zzso activity, indicating the involvement of zzso zzso in particular, zzso zzso Assessment of zzso zzso function following exposure to zzso medium containing either vehicle or zzso produced zzso zzso That is, if the differentiation of zzso into an zzso was induced by zzso medium alone, then zzso binding and zzso zzso function zzso However, examination of zzso zzso function following chronic zzso exposure, an exposure that resulted in a 50% enhancement in zzso activity, revealed that these receptors were zzso This was reflected by a complete loss in specific zzso binding as well as zzso efficacy to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of the mechanisms underlying zzso effects on these differentiation processes revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso were essential while zzso was zzso Our results are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso zzso If so, then, the decrease in plasma zzso levels observed in humans during late adulthood may further enhance zzso to zzso
