In the field of zzso communication, an emerging class of zzso signaling peptides that function zzso has been identified in zzso zzso One illustrative member of this group is the zzso family of zzso signaling peptides of zzso zzso The zzso signaling peptides are zzso by the zzso and then, despite the presence of zzso zzso they are actively transported into the cell where they interact with zzso receptors to regulate gene zzso The zzso receptors are members of a family of zzso zzso the zzso zzso These zzso cause the zzso of response regulator zzso ubiquitous regulatory proteins in zzso Immediately downstream of the genes for the zzso zzso are the genes for the zzso zzso forming rap zzso signaling zzso There are at least seven rap zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso sequence of other zzso zzso bacteria suggests that similar zzso may also function in these zzso In zzso zzso the rap zzso zzso regulate zzso genetic zzso and genes zzso the zzso response zzso the response to high cell zzso This review will address the mechanism of zzso zzso signaling zzso production, zzso response, and their role in zzso zzso
