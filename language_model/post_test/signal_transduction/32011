A major event in zzso male sex determination is the induction of the zzso determining factor zzso and its downstream gene zzso The current study provides one of the first zzso wide analyses of the downstream gene binding targets for zzso and zzso to help zzso the molecular control of zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso A modified zzso analysis using a comparative zzso was used to identify 71 direct downstream binding targets for zzso and 109 binding targets for zzso Interestingly, only 5 gene targets overlapped between zzso and zzso In addition to the direct response element binding gene targets, a large number of zzso binding gene targets were identified for both zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the downstream binding targets identified gene networks and cellular pathways potentially involved in the induction of zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso The specific DNA sequence binding site motifs for both zzso and zzso were zzso Observations provide insights into the molecular control of male zzso sex zzso
