zzso zzso are an important family of plant growth regulators, which are essential for many aspects of plant growth and zzso In the zzso signaling pathway, the action of zzso is opposed by a group of zzso family zzso such as zzso Although the mechanisms of action of the zzso proteins have been studied in great detail, the zzso that act downstream of zzso proteins and bring about zzso growth and development remain largely zzso In this study, we have characterized zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso VI family zzso which is zzso zzso in all the zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso signaling specifically mediate the levels of zzso transcripts in shoot zzso that contain actively dividing zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit retarded growth in many aspects of plant zzso During the zzso phase, zzso zzso develop smaller leaves and shorter roots than zzso zzso while during the zzso phase, zzso exhibits delayed floral transition and lower zzso The reduced stature of zzso partly results from a reduction in cell zzso Furthermore, we present evidence that zzso serves as an important regulator zzso the control of cell proliferation by zzso possibly through two zzso zzso zzso SIM and zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso acts downstream of zzso and promotes cell proliferation in the zzso zzso
