Loss of the zzso gene zzso is responsible for zzso development in zzso sclerosis complex zzso which renders several zzso susceptible to benign zzso zzso the protein zzso by zzso contains a zzso domain and is expressed in most adult zzso although its function is zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso of zzso function in cells containing focal zzso results in loss of zzso to the cell zzso whereas zzso of zzso in cells lacking focal zzso results in zzso of the small zzso protein zzso assembly of zzso stress zzso and formation of focal zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso proteins is required for zzso of zzso by serum or by zzso acid zzso Our data indicate that disruption of zzso to the cell zzso through loss of zzso may initiate the development of zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso zzso regulating cell zzso may constitute a zzso step in zzso zzso
