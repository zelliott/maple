Lung zzso consist of four major types that and for zzso reasons are often divided into two broad zzso small cell lung cancer zzso and zzso cell lung cancer zzso All major zzso types of lung cancer are associated with smoking, although the association is stronger for zzso and zzso cell zzso than zzso To date, zzso studies have identified several zzso zzso hormonal and viral factors associated with lung cancer zzso It has been estimated that zzso of human zzso may have a viral zzso The human zzso zzso is a proven cause of most human cervical zzso and might have a role in other zzso including zzso skin, zzso head and neck zzso zzso has also been speculated to have a role in the zzso of lung zzso To validate the hypothesis of zzso involvement in small cell lung cancer zzso we performed a gene expression profile of transgenic mouse model of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 

Gene expression profile of zzso has been performed using zzso whole mouse zzso (4 zzso zzso representing zzso zzso genes and mouse zzso zzso were obtained from two zzso transgenic mouse models and from zzso normal zzso Data analyses were performed using zzso 10 and the functional zzso of zzso genes was performed using zzso zzso Analysis zzso Systems, zzso 

Analysis of zzso genes induced by the expression of zzso zzso supports the hypothesis of a linkage between zzso infection and zzso zzso As a matter of fact, comparison of zzso genes in our system and those in human zzso showed that many of them are located in the zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso 

In this study, the global gene expression of transgenic mouse model of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso led us to identification of several genes involved in zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, our study revealed that the zzso zzso zzso Signaling is the primarily affected zzso by the zzso zzso expression and that this zzso is also zzso in human zzso Our results provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches against human zzso
