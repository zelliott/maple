Brain derived zzso factor zzso has been suggested to be involved in zzso Both zzso and zzso effects have been reported, but the exact zzso role is still zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso by using transgenic mice zzso truncated zzso a dominant negative zzso of zzso After induction of status zzso zzso by zzso acid, the development of spontaneous zzso was monitored by zzso zzso zzso cell loss, and the number of zzso Y zzso cells were studied as markers of cellular damage, and mossy zzso zzso was investigated as a plasticity zzso Our results show that transgenic mice had significantly less frequent zzso zzso than zzso mice, and the frequency of spontaneous zzso was zzso Furthermore, compared to zzso animals, transgenic mice had less severe zzso with later onset and mortality was zzso In contrast, no differences between zzso were observed in any of the cellular or plasticity zzso Our results suggest that transgenic mice with decreased zzso zzso have reduced zzso
