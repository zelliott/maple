zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is a key zzso of host immune and inflammatory responses and zzso zzso replication by zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects are primarily zzso through the major zzso zzso zzso which is zzso expressed in most cell zzso Here we show that the zzso virus zzso zzso protein zzso prevents zzso zzso of target genes and zzso cell zzso These effects are zzso by zzso of the promoter for zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that expression of zzso is zzso during the zzso zzso replication zzso Thus, zzso has developed a novel mechanism for evading zzso zzso effects during zzso zzso or primary zzso
