zzso zzso is a typical disease resistance zzso protein with zzso zzso repeats zzso Previously, we reported that zzso is physically associated with some zzso hypersensitive induced reaction zzso zzso which are enriched in membrane zzso zzso and genetic analyses suggested that members of the zzso gene family have a function in zzso immune zzso Here, we provide evidence that the pattern recognition zzso zzso zzso is also physically associated with zzso in a zzso zzso transient expression zzso We thus speculate that PM zzso provide a platform for both types of immune zzso R proteins and zzso and that the zzso of the receptors is facilitated by zzso zzso
