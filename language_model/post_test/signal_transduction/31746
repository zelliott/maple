Loss of zzso zzso in zzso appears in zzso cases of zzso zzso Within this region, known as common fragile site zzso the zzso tumor zzso gene is zzso zzso of zzso gene expression levels were observed in many tumor types and were associated with worse zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso tumor zzso gene in zzso tumor zzso We evaluated the correlation between expression of zzso and genes involved in proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso using real-time zzso in 23 tumor zzso We also analyzed the potential causes of zzso gene expression reduction zzso promoter zzso status zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso We revealed a positive correlation between zzso expression and zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative correlation with both zzso Loss of zzso of the zzso gene was observed only at zzso 8, however, it had no influence on the reduction of its expression zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the region covering the 3' end of the promoter and part of zzso 1 was associated with statistically significant reduction of zzso gene expression zzso In the present study we reveal that in zzso tumors the zzso expression levels are positively associated with the process of zzso signal zzso through the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with the regulation of the cell cycle (by zzso E1 and zzso Moreover, our analysis indicates that in this type of tumor the expression of the zzso gene can be regulated by an zzso zzso promoter zzso
