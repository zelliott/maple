The zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso pumps composed of a peripheral zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly of zzso and zzso represents an important regulatory mechanism for controlling zzso activity in zzso Previous work has shown that zzso assembly increases during maturation of bone zzso zzso cells induced by zzso of zzso zzso This increased assembly is essential for zzso processing, which is dependent upon an zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso cells zzso a zzso zzso associated with immune zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells are able to process and present zzso to suppress zzso zzso We have investigated zzso assembly in bone zzso zzso zzso cells and observed an increase in assembly following cluster zzso This increased assembly is not dependent upon new protein synthesis and is associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso with zzso effectively zzso the increased assembly observed upon cluster zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in controlling zzso assembly during zzso cell zzso
