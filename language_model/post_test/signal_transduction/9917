The active form of the zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso partially zzso and partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation and formation of neural zzso A functional zzso promotes differentiation of lateral and zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso and of zzso We show that the active form of zzso in zzso and early zzso stage zzso is generated by removal of zzso 4 and not by an zzso activity in the zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso which contains the basic zzso also contains a nuclear zzso signal and both, the zzso as well as the zzso regions are required for zzso zzso The effects of zzso are in part correlated to a regulatory loop between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso stimulate mutually the zzso of each other, but zzso zzso the zzso target zzso zzso Both, in zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso can interact with zzso the zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso responsive zzso On the other hand, zzso also binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that can act as zzso zzso Based on these data, we conclude that zzso might function as an inhibitor of zzso and neural tissue formation by acting either as zzso zzso or as zzso This dual activity depends upon binding of zzso being involved in the formation of distinct zzso zzso
