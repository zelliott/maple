To investigate the mechanism of inducing zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells with post zzso serum of zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso cell was used as target zzso They were divided into three groups: control group, zzso group and zzso zzso special zzso treated zzso The challenge concentration of serum obtained from zzso 24 hours after zzso was zzso and the treatment concentration of zzso was 10 zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was observed with zzso zzso and the rate of zzso was detected with flow zzso 

It was found that zzso was zzso into zzso in zzso group, and the rate of zzso zzso in zzso cells of zzso group was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control group, after being treated with post zzso serum, the rate of zzso of zzso cells in zzso group was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso group, the rate of zzso in zzso cells in zzso treated group was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso 

These experimental data demonstrates that post zzso serum of zzso can induce zzso of zzso cells, and zzso of zzso from zzso into zzso may play an important role in its zzso signal zzso mechanism in induction of zzso
