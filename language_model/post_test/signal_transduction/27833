zzso smooth muscle contraction is zzso by protein zzso C zzso through a signal zzso cascade leading to zzso zzso protein 27 zzso appears to be the link between these two major events, zzso signal zzso and sustained smooth muscle zzso We have investigated the involvement of zzso in signal zzso and zzso association with zzso proteins zzso zzso myosin, zzso and zzso resulting in sustained smooth muscle zzso We have carried out zzso zzso to investigate the cellular reorganization and zzso of proteins and zzso of zzso with zzso myosin, zzso and zzso as detected by sequential zzso Our results indicate that 1) zzso of zzso to the membrane when zzso with zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso 2) zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso on the membrane in response to zzso and zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso 3) zzso zzso with zzso when contraction zzso and 4) zzso zzso with zzso and with the zzso proteins myosin, zzso and zzso We propose a model in which zzso is involved in sustained smooth muscle contraction and zzso the interaction of zzso myosin, zzso and zzso
