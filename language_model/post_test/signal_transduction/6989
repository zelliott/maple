In zzso zzso cells, the zzso factors zzso and zzso contribute to maintenance of zzso and zzso and are regulated by zzso In the early zzso zzso zzso is necessary for expression of three zzso family members, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso similar to the regulation reported for zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso and zzso stage zzso regulatory networks and their influence on zzso embryonic zzso We show that zzso acts in combination with zzso factors to activate zzso zzso and zzso in the superficial cell layer of the zzso In addition, zzso acts together with the zzso signaling zzso to activate and maintain expression of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We used zzso expression profiles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify zzso target zzso which reveals that zzso participate in zzso of the zzso enveloping layer zzso We discuss zzso implications of simultaneous zzso of zzso targets by zzso like zzso and zzso zzso emerging as a common regulatory motif in early zzso
