zzso use zzso signals or zzso to zzso The signals in zzso bacteria are often peptides activated by zzso removal of an zzso leader zzso While investigating stimulation of zzso zzso production by the zzso zzso synthetic competence stimulating zzso signal zzso we found a zzso similar to the zzso but lacking the three zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso was more potent in inducing zzso zzso formation, and zzso activity than the zzso Our results indicate that zzso of the three zzso zzso occurred post export, and was not regulated by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso abolished the competence and zzso responses to the zzso and the zzso suggesting that signal zzso via the zzso zzso is involved in the responses to both zzso In zzso zzso zzso beside the zzso we also zzso to zzso a zzso zzso which production was zzso by the zzso and the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso revealed the product of the zzso genes recently zzso We found that the zzso zzso was slightly different from the deduced zzso and confirmed the prediction that both peptides zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity against 11 species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, the findings support the involvement of the zzso response in zzso production by zzso and suggest a novel strategy to zzso zzso zzso
