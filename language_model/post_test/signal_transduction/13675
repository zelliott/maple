To test whether bone zzso protein 4 zzso directly regulates differentiation of adult mouse zzso zzso stem cells zzso in zzso 

Animal zzso 

Research zzso 

Adult zzso female zzso 

After zzso from adult zzso by zzso cell zzso zzso were cultured without or with zzso in the absence or presence of the zzso zzso zzso 

Rates of in zzso zzso zzso formation and changes in gene expression were zzso 

zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso signaling can directly affect zzso zzso In agreement with this, zzso significantly increased the number of zzso zzso formed by cultured zzso in a zzso manner, and this response was inhibited in a zzso fashion by zzso with zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso was associated with rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and this response was followed by increased expression of the zzso initiation factors, zzso by zzso acid gene 8 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso In keeping with the zzso zzso formation data, the ability of zzso to activate zzso signaling and zzso gene expression in zzso was abolished by zzso with zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling in adult mouse zzso zzso cultured in zzso drives differentiation of these cells into zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso of key zzso zzso
