Our laboratory has studied the molecular basis of T helper cell zzso We have used reporter transgenic mice, selective zzso techniques, and studies of cell signaling to show that a complex pattern of gene expression is zzso as the decision is made to become either a zzso or zzso zzso Many of these components have been identified, and their mechanisms of action zzso zzso these mechanisms is likely to lead in the long-term to ways to intervene in these processes and, therefore, to direct immune response in zzso useful zzso
