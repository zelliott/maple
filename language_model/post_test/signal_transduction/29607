Three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso release channel share basic properties but differ in terms of zzso To what extent they contribute to complex zzso zzso such as zzso zzso remains largely zzso Here we show that zzso cells express comparable amounts of zzso and zzso but zzso by zzso interference of each zzso results in dramatically distinct zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreases total zzso signals and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to more robust and long lasting zzso zzso than in zzso zzso of zzso zzso are surprisingly similar in zzso cells that predominantly zzso of total zzso express zzso suggesting that zzso functions as an zzso unit without contributing to peak zzso of zzso signals, irrespective of its relative expression zzso zzso differential expression of the zzso zzso is critical for various forms of zzso zzso and, particularly, zzso and zzso have opposite roles in generating zzso zzso
