Drugs that increase zzso levels in the brain reduce cocaine seeking in zzso and humans, suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso We previously reported that repeated cocaine exposure in zzso zzso long-term zzso by reducing the strength of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso area zzso Selective blockade of zzso reduction of zzso zzso in the zzso might diminish zzso zzso synaptic plasticity and addictive zzso Here, we investigated the mechanism for zzso reduction of zzso zzso We show that a zzso relevant concentration of cocaine enables a normally ineffective stimulus to induce long-term depression zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors and group I zzso zzso receptors and subsequent recruitment of zzso signaling are required for zzso zzso We further demonstrate that in zzso zzso with zzso to these receptors blocks zzso reduction of zzso zzso and that repeated cocaine exposure in zzso zzso the subsequent induction of zzso ex zzso Together, these results suggest that repeated cocaine exposure reduces the strength of zzso zzso in zzso zzso by inducing zzso modification in zzso
