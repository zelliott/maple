Previous studies have identified cholesterol as an important regulator of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and its cellular zzso the scavenger zzso class B type I zzso have both been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol zzso but their functions in cancer remain to be zzso 

In the present study, we have examined the role of HDL and zzso in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways in breast cancer cell lines and in the development of tumor in a mouse zzso zzso 

Our data show that HDL is capable of stimulating migration and can activate signal zzso pathways in the two human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso Furthermore, we also show that zzso of the HDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso in both cell zzso Additional investigations show that zzso of the zzso pathway, but not that of the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, could lead to a reduction in cellular proliferation in the absence of zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso led to decreased proliferation and migration in zzso it also led to a significant reduction in tumor growth in zzso Most important, we also show that pharmacological zzso of zzso can zzso signaling and lead to decreased cellular proliferation in zzso Taken together, our data indicate that both zzso zzso entry via zzso and zzso signaling play an essential role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and migration, and, eventually, tumor zzso 

These results identify zzso as a potential target for the treatment of breast zzso
