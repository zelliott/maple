zzso injection of sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso mice causes acute zzso dysfunction characterized by severe zzso acute zzso zzso and cast formation, with increases in serum blood zzso nitrogen and zzso zzso zzso enhancement in zzso zzso zzso expression prompted us to examine its roles in this zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited higher serum blood zzso nitrogen and zzso levels and exaggerated zzso changes, compared with zzso zzso Eventually, zzso mice exhibited a high mortality zzso within 24 hours after zzso challenge, whereas most zzso mice zzso The zzso zzso concentration was significantly higher in zzso mice later than 10 hours after zzso treatment, with attenuated zzso expression of zzso zzso protein zzso 1, a main zzso for zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso factor zzso 2 zzso a zzso factor crucial for zzso gene zzso was similarly increased in the zzso of both strains of mice after zzso zzso In contrast, the absence of zzso zzso transforming growth zzso signal zzso and eventually enhanced the expression of zzso zzso factor 3, which is presumed to repress zzso zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso can protect against zzso acute zzso injury, probably by maintaining zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
