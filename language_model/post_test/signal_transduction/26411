zzso endurance exercise training zzso is accompanied by cardiac zzso changes in zzso function and increased heart failure zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso has been demonstrated to blunt zzso zzso cardiac zzso and heart failure progression in zzso trials and has been approved for clinical use in zzso We examined the in zzso zzso of zzso against zzso cardiac zzso and the underlying molecular zzso Male zzso rats were randomly divided into three groups: sedentary control zzso zzso and zzso with zzso treatment zzso zzso in zzso and zzso groups ran on a motorized treadmill for zzso The results revealed that zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area, zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso markers zzso zzso molecules zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso pathways zzso and zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso These pathways were then expressed lower in the zzso group when compared with the zzso zzso The cardiac zzso level, zzso zzso and zzso signaling were further inhibited in the zzso zzso We systematically investigated the possible signaling pathways leading to zzso cardiac zzso zzso and zzso We also provide evidence for the novel function of zzso in suppressing zzso cardiac zzso and impairment by multiple mechanisms, which suggests that the zzso signaling zzso contributes to zzso cardiac zzso and zzso
