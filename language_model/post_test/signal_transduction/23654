zzso cancer can arise from zzso persistent zzso remnant or rest cells, which are uniquely characterized by the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cancer precursor cells causes zzso rests, and later tumor formation through unknown zzso However, zzso of zzso in adult zzso normally activates zzso and/or zzso signals as an zzso defense mechanism against zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso precursor cells exhibited a zzso diminished zzso response to zzso zzso stress and resistance to zzso factor withdrawal, compared with their adult counterpart cells from the zzso transgenic mouse model of zzso The adult stem cell maintenance factor and zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus integration zzso had a critical role at zzso initiation in the model, by zzso zzso responses in precursor zzso We further show in zzso tumor cells that zzso could directly bind zzso in a complex with other zzso complex zzso zzso or zzso leading to increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signal responses were also seen in precursor cells for other zzso cancer types, zzso and acute zzso zzso zzso these date indicate a general mechanism for zzso zzso in some zzso cell types and zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the point of zzso tumor zzso
