zzso is a chronic inflammatory disease of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may mediate both airway inflammation and zzso It has also been shown that zzso can be the source of zzso zzso In the human zzso mast zzso interactions may have pivotal effects on modulating zzso To study this further, we zzso normal human lung zzso zzso with a human mast cell line zzso and zzso for production of zzso zzso an important zzso zzso When cultured together, zzso contact induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells by a porous membrane inhibited this zzso zzso cellular zzso caused an increase in zzso production in zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also seen in zzso by Western zzso whereas zzso production in zzso was significantly inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso production in zzso was minimally inhibited by a chemical inhibitor of nuclear zzso zzso indicating that nuclear zzso may have a minimal role in signaling zzso production in mast zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and surface zzso with zzso zzso failed to significantly decrease zzso production in our zzso indicating that other zzso associations may be responsible for this zzso These novel studies reveal the importance of zzso interactions in the complex milieu of airway zzso
