zzso are a family of growth factors that regulate the peripheral and central nervous zzso We designed and tested a zzso of small molecules zzso based on zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which is the natural zzso for zzso zzso Biological studies identified a zzso zzso that exhibited selective antagonism of zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso and signaling promoted by zzso and selectively blocks zzso cell zzso zzso also blocks zzso zzso zzso and signals that take place when the zzso is zzso This work adds to our understanding of how the zzso function through zzso zzso and demonstrates that zzso can be designed to selectively disturb zzso zzso and zzso zzso
