The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be an zzso factor for the growth of retinal zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso contains eight zzso repeats and studies using the zzso domain alone demonstrated the zzso effect on retinal zzso The precise role of the zzso zzso domain and the mechanism by which its activity is regulated is not zzso zzso of the structure of the zzso domain of zzso was proposed in an effort to understand the downstream signal zzso mechanism in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso domain of zzso are now zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on the zzso zzso which grew under oil using the zzso method at zzso zzso Native X-ray zzso data were collected to zzso A resolution on a home zzso The zzso belong to the zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso Assuming the presence of two molecules per zzso unit, the zzso value was zzso A3 zzso and the zzso content was zzso
