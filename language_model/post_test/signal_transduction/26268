zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein produced by zzso which can promote zzso The regulation of zzso zzso involves zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso receptors coupled to various protein zzso signaling zzso However, not much is known about the mechanisms regulating zzso expression in primary cortical zzso after a traumatic brain zzso Using an zzso model of central nervous system trauma that stimulates the release of zzso we found that zzso expression and release of zzso involved zzso signaling as both expression and release were significantly attenuated by zzso acid, a zzso zzso zzso Further zzso studies with zzso blue 2 point to a role for zzso as zzso blue 2 is a potent zzso for rat zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression of zzso was significantly attenuated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso whereas zzso release of zzso was significantly blocked by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using an zzso model of a moderate zzso zzso brain injury, we found that zzso levels were increased when compared with those in sham animals in the cortex, thalamus, and zzso We conclude that zzso expression after injury can be regulated by the zzso of zzso receptors coupled with protein zzso signaling pathways and suggest that zzso zzso by regulating zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso and zzso interactions such as those occurring during central nervous system zzso
