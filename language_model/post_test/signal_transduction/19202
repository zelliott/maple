The zzso zzso signaling is zzso important for zzso differentiation and myeloma cell zzso Its zzso in myeloma cells and its zzso in zzso and their zzso have been identified in the previous zzso zzso zzso and myeloma cells from a myeloma patient share the same bone zzso zzso zzso but respond differently to zzso zzso by myeloma zzso The mechanisms remain zzso 

zzso multiple myeloma zzso cells were isolated from zzso zzso cells of 12 zzso zzso Human bone zzso zzso cells zzso were obtained from zzso adherent cells of these zzso patients and 10 healthy zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso in human myeloma cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary myeloma cells and zzso from 12 zzso patients and zzso from 10 healthy zzso The binding capability of zzso binding receptors to zzso on primary myeloma cells and zzso was detected by flow zzso zzso 

The zzso expression levels of zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso in zzso from patients with zzso were significantly higher than those in myeloma cells and in zzso from healthy zzso The binding capability to zzso zzso binding receptors on zzso from zzso patients was obviously higher than those on myeloma cells and zzso from healthy donors by flow zzso zzso Similar to the effects of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso from healthy donors with myeloma cells in the presence or absence of a zzso insert did zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso and zzso their zzso levels of zzso 

Compared with myeloma cells, the zzso from zzso patients zzso zzso binding receptors zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso by myeloma cells, which results in zzso zzso signaling zzso Our study provides a novel insight into mechanisms of myeloma associated zzso zzso
