Stress dramatically affects the induction of zzso synaptic zzso however, the molecular details of how it does so remain zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a crucial role in promoting zzso survival and zzso but its role, if any, in zzso zzso of long term zzso zzso and long term depression zzso is zzso We found here that zzso of zzso signaling blocked the effects of acute zzso shock stress protocol on zzso and zzso zzso the purpose of the present study is to explore the signaling events involving zzso in terms of its role in zzso stress zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We found that stress zzso zzso zzso can be blocked by various zzso including zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso acid for zzso receptors or zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Also, zzso analyses revealed that stress protocol induced a profound and prolonged zzso of numbers of zzso downstream zzso including zzso protein zzso protein zzso B, zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso initiation factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso which was prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso More importantly, we found that stress protocol significantly increased the protein expression of zzso scaffolding protein zzso zzso zzso which is known to be involved in zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso These results identify a key role of zzso signaling in zzso the stress zzso modification of zzso synaptic plasticity and further suggest that zzso may do so by zzso the protein expression of zzso
