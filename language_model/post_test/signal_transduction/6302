zzso zzso mechanisms can potentially be exploited for the treatment of inflammatory zzso Here we report that the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso release from human zzso by signaling through a zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso is more efficient than zzso and zzso zzso release induced by either zzso or tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso stimulation prevents zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through a specific zzso zzso zzso that requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso treatment with nicotine zzso serum zzso levels and improves survival in experimental models of zzso even when treatment is started after the onset of the zzso These results reveal zzso as the first known zzso inhibitor of zzso release from human zzso and suggest that selective zzso zzso for the zzso might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
