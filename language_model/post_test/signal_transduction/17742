To characterize the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso state, the kinetic relationship between net zzso zzso balance zzso and either zzso zzso load zzso or plasma insulin level was determined during zzso infusion using a zzso technique in 36 conscious zzso zzso was infused zzso zzso zzso and peripherally zzso zzso at 39, 56, and 83 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over 2 zzso There was a linear relationship between mean zzso and either mean zzso or plasma insulin levels at each rate in either delivery zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso 99, zzso r zzso zzso The threshold levels for net zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for plasma zzso and 65 and zzso zzso for plasma insulin, zzso The slope of the zzso line against the zzso was four times larger in portal than in peripheral delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These results suggest that the portal signal zzso the threshold of zzso for zzso zzso by increasing zzso extraction rate in a zzso zzso zzso
