zzso of DNA by the innate immune system is central to zzso and zzso defenses, as well as an important contributor to zzso diseases involving self zzso zzso zzso in melanoma 2) and zzso zzso protein zzso have been identified as DNA receptors that induce zzso formation and zzso production, zzso Here we present the crystal structures of zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA recognition is accomplished through zzso attraction between the positively charged zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso An zzso complex of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso state is liberated by DNA zzso which may facilitate the assembly of zzso along the DNA zzso These findings provide zzso insights into zzso as the zzso trigger and zzso platform for the assembly of large innate signaling complexes such as the zzso
