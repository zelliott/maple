zzso zzso C zzso is a zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso consisting of at least 10 zzso The present article summarizes the papers presented at the zzso symposium of the 74th Annual Meeting of the Japanese zzso Society, in which six special topics regarding zzso zzso cellular functions and pathological disorders were zzso Using a zzso zzso expression technique, each zzso zzso was suggested to vary its zzso in each cell in response to each stimulus and that the targeting to the specific compartment is necessary for the specific cellular responses zzso A zzso agent, zzso was shown to zzso zzso zzso injury by mimicking zzso zzso through specific zzso of zzso delta zzso Using an zzso technique, zzso alpha and zzso were shown to be necessary for gene expression of zzso NO zzso by zzso one of the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso B zzso In canine cerebral artery, zzso delta and zzso alpha play important roles in the development and the maintenance of zzso induced by zzso zzso respectively zzso and zzso zzso zzso involves zzso and zzso alpha but not zzso delta activities facilitated by zzso of zzso zzso through zzso activity zzso & zzso To clarify the role of zzso zzso in insulin resistance, the effects of insulin on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso were shown and then zzso zzso beta zzso in diabetic patients with various diabetic zzso including diabetic zzso was reported zzso These studies will zzso open the way to a new era for the development of novel drugs controlling an zzso activity of the protein zzso C zzso and improvement in the knowledge about the role of the protein zzso in health and zzso
