We have characterized the calcium response of a zzso zzso complex zzso zzso T zzso line at the single cell level using a variety of zzso alone and in zzso We are able to distinguish four general patterns of zzso calcium zzso with only the most robust zzso with T cell zzso Whereas all three zzso peptides tested reduce the calcium response to an zzso zzso two give very different calcium release patterns and the third gives none at all, arguing that zzso antagonism does not require calcium release and zzso it involves interactions that are more T cell zzso zzso We have also measured the time between the first T zzso cell contact and the onset of the calcium zzso The duration of this delay zzso with the strength of the zzso with stronger stimuli giving a more rapid zzso The dose dependence of this delay suggests that the zzso step in triggering the calcium response is not the zzso of zzso complexes on the cell surface but more likely involves the zzso of some zzso zzso or complex with a zzso of a few zzso
