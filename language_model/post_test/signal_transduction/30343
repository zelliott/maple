In most animals, the zzso develop zzso but most birds develop only a left zzso A possible role for zzso in this zzso zzso development has been proposed in the zzso but the mechanism underlying this process is largely zzso Here, we identify the molecular mechanism responsible for this zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the left zzso zzso leads to the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses expression of the nuclear receptors zzso and zzso zzso alpha in the right zzso zzso zzso expressed in the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 to stimulate cell zzso These data suggest that early zzso expression of zzso leads to zzso zzso development through zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso
