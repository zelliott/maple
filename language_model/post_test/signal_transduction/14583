Although classical concepts had assigned priority to the zzso steroid signaling zzso of zzso zzso zzso recent studies document that the zzso also possesses the zzso steroid signaling zzso zzso A small fraction of zzso is associated with the cell membrane and mediates the rapid effects of zzso Unlike classical growth factor zzso such as zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso has no zzso and zzso zzso Instead, the initiating signals of MISS action of zzso require a rapid formation of zzso protein complexes with many signaling zzso leading to the zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso signaling zzso In this review, we focus on the MISS action of zzso and its role in the development of hormone resistance in breast zzso A full understanding of the mechanisms, with the ultimate aim of zzso specific steps, should lead to more targeted strategies for treatment of zzso breast zzso
