The zzso region in the zzso coli zzso represents a cluster of zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated promoter structures, zzso factor zzso potential zzso and environmental regulatory patterns for all of these zzso We find that this region constitutes a complex zzso with expression being controlled by three zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso which affects the expression of all five zzso is zzso zzso and activated exclusively upon carbon zzso and stationary zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso and exhibits multiple stress induction like zzso S zzso and zzso zzso suggested by Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso which appears to be zzso zzso and to respond to poor nitrogen zzso In addition, we identify a novel zzso zzso which zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner during early stationary zzso Finally, we propose a zzso role for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in general stress zzso This zzso role is reflected by the zzso of the zzso zzso promoter under the different conditions that also induce zzso zzso which include shifts to zzso pH or high zzso as well as zzso or stationary zzso
