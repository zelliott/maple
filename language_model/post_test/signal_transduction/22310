Bone zzso is controlled by the balance between zzso bone formation and zzso bone zzso zzso bone zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso disorders such as zzso arthritis and zzso To obtain new zzso agents, we searched for natural compounds that can inhibit zzso differentiation and zzso We found that zzso a zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso formation induced by zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in cultures of bone zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso factor and zzso as well as in zzso of bone zzso cells and zzso zzso cells in the presence of vitamin zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso prevented zzso bone zzso in both cell and bone tissue zzso Treatment with zzso (10 zzso also prevented bone loss in zzso osteoporosis model zzso zzso relationship studies showed that the zzso double bond and zzso group of zzso are important for its zzso activity on zzso zzso In zzso studies, we found that zzso inhibited the zzso expression of zzso and subsequent expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso which is a master regulator of zzso However, zzso did not affect early signaling molecules such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso formation via zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso and zzso bone zzso These novel findings may be useful for the treatment of zzso zzso
