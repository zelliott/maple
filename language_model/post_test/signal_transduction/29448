zzso protein 27 zzso was initially identified by its zzso in zzso zzso and is one of three cell zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso has very recently been illustrated to regulate zzso zzso size and promote zzso storage in zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression is zzso We assessed the zzso transcript level in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso differentiation model and found its emergence parallels the zzso transcript zzso fatty acid binding protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is a zzso transcript in zzso of primary zzso and human zzso and in brown zzso The zzso transcript is zzso regulated by zzso and insulin, consistent with an zzso zzso It is nearly abolished with a zzso exposure of zzso zzso to 10 zzso zzso while treatment with 100 zzso insulin increased the zzso transcript zzso In the latter case zzso blocked this response, indicating involvement of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated exclusive expression of zzso in white and brown zzso zzso however, a dramatic zzso occurred in the liver of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells and in zzso zzso led to the appearance of key zzso hallmarks and cell zzso However, despite the zzso for zzso in zzso we failed to detect DNA zzso indicative of zzso in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is accompanied by decreased zzso to the zzso effects of zzso Overall, our findings support roles for zzso in cell death and in zzso zzso
