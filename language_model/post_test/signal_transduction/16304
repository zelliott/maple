The interaction of zzso cells and zzso with their zzso in particular with the basement zzso plays a crucial role during zzso and zzso In this review, we focus on zzso a major family of zzso zzso molecules present in basement zzso zzso interact with cell surface receptors to trigger zzso zzso that shapes cell zzso Each zzso exerts a distinct effect on zzso cells and zzso which largely depends on the zzso zzso profile expressed on the cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso may affect their role in zzso We report in zzso and in zzso data on zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their associated zzso that regulates cell zzso and zzso under normal and pathological zzso We also discuss how zzso deletion of zzso genes affects the zzso of zzso cells and zzso and thus zzso Finally, we examine how zzso systems with defined zzso expression contribute to our understanding of the roles of zzso in normal and pathological zzso and zzso
