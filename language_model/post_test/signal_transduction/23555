Stem cell therapy has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for zzso zzso in recent zzso A variety of stem cells or stem zzso cells can potentially be used for zzso Despite improved cardiac function after treatment, one of the major problems is the poor integration between host and donor cells which can lead to zzso zzso and poor long-term zzso 

In the present study, we zzso zzso embryonic stem cells zzso with zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso in hanging drops to assess the cellular interaction and function of zzso zzso under these zzso 

We found that when zzso are added to a culture system of embryonic stem cells, the number of spontaneously beating areas in zzso bodies zzso increases, zzso gap junction communication is enhanced by zzso of zzso expression at the zzso stage and zzso is distributed more orderly between zzso 

Our findings suggest zzso zzso are able to form effective signaling pathways through zzso with zzso which is important for providing more functional zzso for cardiac cell therapy by improving the integration between transplanted and host zzso
