The zzso properties of the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso were zzso The zzso value was zzso S at 30 degrees C and zzso S at 4 degrees zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with beta zzso zzso from zzso brain resulted in an zzso value of zzso S at 30 degrees C and zzso S at 4 degrees zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso agents, zzso gamma S and zzso decreased the zzso value to zzso S at 30 degrees C and zzso S at 4 degrees zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso is an inactive zzso species at 30 degrees C capable of interacting with zzso beta zzso and responsive to treatment with zzso agents leading to the two activated forms, alpha at 4 degrees C and alpha at 30 degrees zzso
