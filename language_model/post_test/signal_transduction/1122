Wood is an important raw material and environmentally cost-effective renewable source of zzso However, the molecular biology of wood formation zzso secondary zzso is surprisingly zzso A novel experimental system was employed to study the molecular regulation of secondary zzso formation in zzso First, we demonstrate that the weight carried by the stem is a primary signal for the induction of zzso differentiation and the plant hormone, zzso is a downstream carrier of the signal for this zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to examine gene expression profile changes in the zzso stems treated for wood formation by cultural manipulation or artificial weight zzso Many of the genes zzso in zzso stems had zzso responsive zzso elements in their promoter region, indicating zzso regulation of secondary zzso We identified 700 genes that were zzso expressed during the transition from primary growth to secondary zzso More than zzso of the genes that were zzso zzso were associated with signal zzso and zzso zzso Biological significance of these regulatory genes is discussed in light of the induction and development of secondary zzso
