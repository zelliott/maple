zzso zzso play an important role in the regulation of systemic vascular zzso zzso The authors studied the involvement of protein zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso signal zzso in cerebral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso free zzso zzso were measured in rat zzso and zzso artery zzso cells by using Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso in cultured rat zzso and zzso zzso cells and induced a rapid transient and a prolonged plateau phase of zzso response in rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso of 30 or 100 zzso attenuated both zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was separated into low- zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso zzso these zzso were tested separately in these zzso The zzso fraction produced a similar zzso response to that of zzso zzso and the zzso fraction produced a small zzso The zzso responses from both zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 

To the zzso knowledge, this is the first report to show that zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso responses in cerebral zzso zzso
