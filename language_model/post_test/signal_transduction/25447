Transport of zzso between the nucleus and the zzso is an essential necessity in zzso cells, since the nuclear envelope separates zzso from zzso In the past few years, an increasing number of components of the plant nuclear transport machinery have been zzso This progress, although far from being completed, confirmed that the general characteristics of nuclear transport are zzso between plants and other zzso However, zzso components were also zzso Interestingly, several zzso in genes zzso components of the plant nuclear transport machinery were investigated, revealing differential sensitivity of zzso pathways to impaired nuclear zzso These findings attracted attention towards zzso zzso that are transported over the nuclear zzso zzso connections between nuclear transport and components of zzso and zzso zzso The current state of research in plants is zzso in comparison to zzso and zzso systems, and special emphasis is given to plant nuclear transport zzso
