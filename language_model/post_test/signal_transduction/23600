To describe the role of zzso in liver zzso 

For the in zzso animal study, Sprague zzso rats were subjected to zzso duct zzso zzso for 4 zzso zzso liver, zzso tissue zzso zzso and serum were analyzed for zzso zzso For the in zzso experiment, rat primary zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso cells zzso were zzso zzso were exposed to zzso zzso and collagen zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 1 and zzso tissue growth factor expression were zzso zzso gene and protein expression was zzso as was the expression of zzso zzso including tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso migration and zzso were zzso The effects of zzso on zzso were also zzso 

Following zzso rat zzso fat and serum rather than liver showed higher zzso expression compared to control zzso In liver, zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment resulted in enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression and increased zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso diminished zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso facilitated zzso proliferation and migration, but decreased zzso which was via an zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso transforming growth factor zzso from zzso enhanced zzso collagen zzso zzso 

zzso directly and indirectly zzso zzso behavior towards a more zzso zzso
