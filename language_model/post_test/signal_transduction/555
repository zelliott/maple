Based on characterization of both zzso and expression status of zzso and zzso zzso in a series of 60 zzso tumor samples, combined with zzso expression profiling of these tumors, normal mature and fetal kidney controls, we show that zzso expression was a better zzso than zzso zzso We present molecular data supporting that the zzso zzso is involved in both tumor classes, with and without zzso zzso In the tumor class with zzso zzso we identified zzso of 14 previously zzso zzso target zzso including zzso We show that the zzso protein was specifically expressed in these tumors, where zzso was restricted to the zzso nuclear zzso positive, zzso By comparing the state of the zzso zzso in tumors without zzso zzso and fetal zzso we provide evidence that suggests that these tumors have a heightened level of zzso zzso We characterized zzso of the zzso zzso regulator gene zzso in zzso of this tumor zzso Moreover, zzso correlation analysis allowed us to identify three other zzso zzso regulator genes that could participate in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These genes thus represent new potential important actors in zzso zzso
