The zzso zzso zzso in Family A zzso are important for zzso binding and zzso zzso but little is known about the function of Family B zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a Family B zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso in association with three zzso zzso proteins zzso Here, we examined the function of the zzso of human zzso within the zzso and AM zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso of zzso was zzso with that of zzso (a Family B zzso that is unable to interact with zzso and zzso zzso point zzso were constructed and zzso zzso into zzso cells along with each zzso zzso expression of each zzso complex was then measured by flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso led to significant reductions in the induction of zzso zzso by zzso but zzso zzso was barely affected, despite normal zzso expression of the receptors and normal zzso zzso zzso The zzso had significantly decreased zzso but not zzso responses in the presence of zzso Not all zzso zzso zzso supported these zzso 

The human zzso zzso is crucial for zzso zzso responses via three zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso probably relies on zzso zzso zzso This study provides a clue to the molecular basis of the zzso of zzso Family B zzso
