Despite the important role for zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso and wound healing, it has not been investigated in zzso zzso zzso We used zzso animal models to explore the role of zzso in zzso In an acute zzso model, skin zzso water loss was significantly attenuated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling genetically or zzso confirms a protective role for zzso signaling in zzso In a zzso zzso model, zzso treatment of mice with established zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total and zzso specific zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not alter expression of skin barrier junction proteins or zzso peptides in the zzso zzso However, zzso treatment attenuated zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso skin following zzso zzso zzso zzso production was decreased in the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso was increased in zzso mice skin following zzso zzso Whereas zzso and zzso expression was attenuated in the skin of zzso mice, zzso treatment also suppressed zzso zzso production by zzso Given the central role of zzso in zzso zzso differentiation in the skin, this effect of zzso on zzso may contribute to the protective roles for zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a previously zzso protective role for zzso in zzso and a new role for zzso in modulating zzso responses in the zzso
