We have established a heart slice primary culture, which allows us to mechanically separate distinct cardiac cell populations and zzso their relative zzso and zzso effects on cardiac zzso proliferation and zzso Using this system, we have found that a zzso from the zzso but not the zzso and zzso is required in embryonic day 10 zzso chick heart slices for continued cardiac zzso proliferation and zzso An examination of potential zzso growth or zzso factors has revealed that blockade of either zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso signaling from the zzso zzso cardiac zzso proliferation and zzso The blockade of cardiac zzso proliferation following administration of an zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso zzso zzso the blockade of cardiac zzso proliferation following administration of an zzso zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso zzso Thus, our findings suggest that zzso and zzso signals work in parallel to support zzso cell zzso In addition, we have found that these factors do not act directly on zzso zzso Rather, they induce another soluble zzso in the zzso that directly regulates proliferation of cardiac zzso We therefore zzso that the zzso controls normal heart growth in zzso segments of the embryonic chick heart by zzso a cardiac zzso zzso whose expression (or zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso
