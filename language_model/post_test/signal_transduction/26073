Until now, the general importance of zzso present on the surface of almost all differentiated cells has been strongly underestimated and essential functions of these abundant surface zzso remained zzso zzso the role of zzso has been reduced to their putative function of zzso zzso In spite of a large body of detailed knowledge about the specific functions of zzso in sensory zzso cells for sound, light, and odor perception, their functional importance for regulation of basic cell functions remained zzso Here, a number of zzso mechanisms involved in fundamental cell functions are zzso Two structural features enable the extensive functional competence of zzso First, the exclusive location of almost all functional important membrane proteins on zzso of differentiated cells and second, the function of the zzso zzso core of zzso as a structural diffusion barrier modulating the flow of low molecular zzso and zzso into and out of the zzso The specific zzso on zzso of important functional membrane proteins such as zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso pumps, and zzso zzso indicate the importance and diversity of zzso zzso In this review, the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells are discussed as highly specialized adaptations of a general type of zzso mechanisms involved in regulation of important basic cell functions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso channel regulation, generation and zzso of the membrane potential, volume regulation, and zzso zzso Even the zzso cellular zzso against zzso compounds, also called zzso resistance zzso is discussed as a zzso zzso A comprehensive examination of the specific properties of zzso zzso zzso along the zzso core structure of zzso allows the proposal that zzso are specifically designed for using zzso currents as cellular zzso In view of the multifaceted gating and signaling properties of zzso channels, the possible role of zzso as a universal gating device for zzso channel regulation is zzso Combined with the role of the zzso core bundle of zzso filaments as zzso zzso store, zzso may turn out as highly specialized zzso signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso entry zzso and initiation of zzso zzso signals such as waves and zzso
