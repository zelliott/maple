zzso of liver functions leads to insulin resistance causing type 2 diabetes zzso and is often found in chronic liver zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso dysfunction leading to zzso zzso disorder are still poorly understood in chronic liver zzso The current work investigated the role of zzso B virus X protein zzso in regulating zzso zzso We studied zzso zzso mice and zzso mice lacking zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso Here we show that gene expressions of the key zzso zzso were significantly increased in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and in zzso liver zzso of zzso B virus patients with high levels of zzso zzso In the liver of zzso mice, the expressions of zzso genes were also zzso leading to zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso However, this effect was insufficient to cause systemic insulin zzso zzso the actions of zzso on zzso zzso metabolism are thought to be zzso via zzso zzso as evidenced by the fact that zzso of zzso restored zzso zzso by suppressing the gene expression of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso oxide zzso caused a significant increase in the expression of zzso zzso but zzso zzso was completely zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the liver of zzso mice was also suppressed in the absence of zzso indicating the critical role for zzso in the mutual regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings establish a novel mechanism of zzso zzso zzso disorder that is modulated by zzso zzso of zzso
