The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso or zzso zzso communications and is a zzso signal zzso Although a number of studies have described the function of zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso the underlying mechanisms have yet to be zzso By using a validated zzso zzso expression system in the zzso cell line combined with zzso analysis, we identified zzso zzso as a potential downstream zzso target of zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso BC cell invasion, we combined molecular and zzso approaches and showed that zzso induction increased zzso expression levels, which in turn promotes BC cell zzso Further, clinical analysis of breast tissue samples showed that zzso expression patterns paralleled those of the standard form of zzso during breast tumor zzso More interestingly, we identified the zzso zzso as a potential molecular link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to identifying zzso as a target for zzso zzso this investigation provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that zzso the novel function of zzso in breast cancer zzso
