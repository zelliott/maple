zzso migration and spreading of zzso sheets is important during many processes in zzso including zzso and wound zzso However, the signaling pathways that regulate zzso zzso are poorly zzso To identify molecular components that regulate the spreading of zzso zzso we performed a screen for zzso that zzso zzso cell migration during zzso in zzso zzso We identified one zzso zzso as a weak zzso in zzso which encodes the single zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso During the migration of the embryonic zzso zzso zzso display defects including zzso migration or premature zzso of zzso zzso that halt their migration have zzso zzso and display reduced zzso zzso activity at their leading zzso Furthermore, some zzso formed by zzso cells in zzso zzso exhibit zzso long zzso zzso studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso these zzso confirming that zzso function is important for proper zzso zzso Our results provide the first molecular evidence that movements of embryonic zzso cell sheets can be controlled by zzso and suggest that such regulation may be a widespread mechanism for zzso zzso cell movements during zzso
