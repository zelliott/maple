zzso pressure represents a strong selective force that influences the development and evolution of living zzso An increasing number of studies have shown that both environmental and social factors, including exposure to zzso substantially shape the structure and function of the zzso However, our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the brain to environmental stimuli is zzso In this study, we used zzso comparative zzso zzso to investigate the brain zzso response to cues of a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that repeated exposure to zzso visual and tactile cues of a zzso zzso trout, zzso zzso for 6 days resulted in subtle but significant zzso changes in the brain of zzso Gene functional analysis and gene zzso enrichment revealed that the majority of the transcripts zzso expressed between the fish exposed to cues of a zzso and the control group were related to zzso processing and presentation involving the major zzso complex, transmission of synaptic signals, brain zzso zzso gene regulation and visual zzso The top four identified pathways were synaptic long-term depression, zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso Our study demonstrates that exposure of zzso to cues of a zzso results in the zzso of a wide range of biological and molecular processes and lays the foundation for future investigations on the molecular factors that zzso the function and evolution of the brain in response to zzso
