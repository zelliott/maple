It is now established that a family of zzso protein zzso are able to interact with zzso and zzso protein zzso in a highly specific manner to zzso regulate these zzso in zzso zzso A role for these proteins in negative feedback regulation of zzso zzso activity is also supported by genetic and zzso studies in zzso and zzso More recently it has become clear that other classes of protein zzso also play key roles in the regulated zzso of zzso zzso including zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso It is likely that a complex balance between upstream zzso and these different classes of zzso zzso specific zzso are responsible for zzso at least in part, the magnitude and duration of zzso zzso zzso and hence the zzso outcome of zzso
