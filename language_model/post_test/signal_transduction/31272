zzso are a distinct population of zzso cells that share markers of zzso as well as zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso migrate into the kidney in response to secondary zzso tissue zzso zzso and contribute to zzso zzso To investigate this hypothesis, zzso zzso was induced by unilateral zzso obstruction in zzso A considerable number of zzso zzso for zzso and type I collagen zzso or zzso and zzso infiltrated the zzso reaching a peak on day zzso Most zzso were positive for zzso and zzso blockade reduced the number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso vessels were also detected in the zzso The blockade of zzso signaling by zzso zzso reduced zzso fibrosis, which was confirmed by a decrease in zzso in zzso mice with zzso reduction in zzso transcripts of pro zzso chain of zzso and zzso The number of zzso zzso decreased along with zzso transcripts of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso after the blockade of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso the kidney via zzso vessels, thereby contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso signaling of zzso may provide therapeutic targets for combating zzso zzso
