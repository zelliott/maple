The zzso and zzso zzso systems play central roles in the control of zzso zzso and feature prominently in many behaviors and zzso zzso In addition, the regulation of these receptors and their zzso mechanisms has been the focus of intense interest because of their potential importance in the therapeutic actions of zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by receptors which activate zzso signaling zzso Although it might be expected that these two highly zzso zzso receptors would be regulated similarly by zzso of zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have found that the regulation differs markedly between these zzso zzso Further, our data suggest that the zzso of zzso efficacy at these zzso zzso is dependent on the nature of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, regulation at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to play a significant role in the regulation of both the zzso and zzso zzso systems by the zzso signaling zzso Such data illustrate multiple levels for control of zzso signaling zzso within cells and demonstrate that although different receptors may couple to the same zzso zzso the ultimate cellular effects produced by these receptors may differ due to differential zzso zzso
