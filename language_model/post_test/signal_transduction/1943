zzso class II expression defects have been evidenced in several human tumor cell lines originating from lung zzso or zzso zzso the mouse zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso do not express I-A and zzso molecules even when treated with zzso Here we show that fusion of both cell lines restores the zzso expression of zzso class II, thereby demonstrating that they present different and zzso zzso outside the zzso class II zzso zzso the zzso class II zzso controls the zzso expression of zzso class II genes and creates the architecture of the zzso complex that binds to the zzso class II gene zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso expressed from the gene zzso zzso were indeed detected in severely limited zzso with a zzso in zzso zzso zzso In agreement we show here that the zzso cell line does not express the zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso cell line, zzso transcripts were expressed at normal levels, from the proper initiation zzso The zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso from zzso did not reveal any zzso However, the zzso protein was not zzso These data evidence a new type of zzso in a zzso class zzso tumor cell line, as we show here that the zzso in the zzso cells occurs downstream of zzso zzso The zzso zzso might therefore reside in the zzso transcript nuclear export or translation, or in the stability of the zzso zzso
