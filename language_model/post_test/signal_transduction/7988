The kidney cortical collecting duct is an important site for the maintenance of sodium zzso Previous studies have shown that, in zzso zzso cells, zzso stress zzso expression of zzso zzso via zzso zzso but little is known about zzso expression in response to zzso in the cortical collecting zzso zzso we examined the mechanism of zzso induction of zzso in zzso cells derived from mouse cortical collecting zzso zzso of zzso protein was detected within 6 h of treatment with zzso sodium zzso The treatment also increased zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting that ongoing protein synthesis is not required for zzso zzso Using reporter plasmids containing zzso zzso and zzso fragments of the zzso promoter, we found that zzso induction of zzso was due to an increase in promoter zzso The zzso effect of zzso was inhibited by zzso indicating that the effect is zzso by zzso zzso Since zzso zzso can activate zzso we made point zzso in the zzso binding site within the zzso zzso The zzso did not block the induction of zzso promoter activity by zzso sodium zzso and zzso sodium zzso failed to activate zzso binding zzso reporter gene zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activated zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso activate zzso by different zzso Thus, induction of zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso sodium zzso does not involve zzso of zzso Furthermore, the signal zzso pathways that respond to zzso stress vary for different zzso in cortical collecting duct zzso
