zzso regulation of adrenal function occurs primarily through zzso of zzso zzso are central to many of the body's zzso and neurotransmitter zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso induced zzso locomotor activity, and zzso rate, and zzso is zzso in zzso tissue of obese zzso Given that the adrenal zzso is a pivotal organ for energy balance and zzso we hypothesized that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso we mapped both zzso and zzso in human fetal and adult adrenal zzso as well as rat zzso Both were primarily localized in the adrenal zzso but not in the zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells led to a decrease in zzso zzso and an increase of zzso zzso zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso induced zzso and cortisol zzso as measured by zzso These increases were accompanied by increased expression and activity of zzso zzso and zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso Using specific zzso we also demonstrated that zzso induction involves zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso These novel data demonstrate that zzso zzso adrenal zzso in zzso by regulating key zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso signaling zzso
