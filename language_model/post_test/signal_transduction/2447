The stimulation of zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis by insulin was examined during the differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso treatment barely changed the low levels of zzso synthesis measured in zzso Following differentiation into zzso insulin increased zzso synthesis up to zzso After further zzso of the zzso for a week, insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells also resulted in the increased expression of zzso zzso and in increases in both total zzso zzso activity and zzso stimulation by zzso While the levels of zzso protein were unchanged by zzso zzso specific activity decreased over zzso although sensitivity to insulin treatment was zzso zzso levels of the zzso inhibitor protein zzso were dramatically induced upon zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and primary rat zzso was exclusively localized to the particulate zzso including the zzso zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso exhibited a kinetic lag in zzso which was not present in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells overcame the in zzso lag in zzso activity, resulting in up to zzso stimulation of zzso activity being measured at early zzso time zzso These results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso may maintain zzso zzso activity in a low zzso state, zzso the zzso for stimulation by zzso
