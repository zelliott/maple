zzso to DNA zzso are the zzso hallmark of systemic lupus zzso zzso and unique markers of the zzso disturbances critical to disease zzso In the form of immune complexes, zzso zzso can deposit in the tissue to incite inflammation and zzso in addition, these complexes can induce zzso production, most zzso type 1 zzso Studies in both patients and animal models have implicated genetic as well as environmental factors in the zzso of the zzso zzso Because bacterial DNA is a potent stimulant of innate immunity by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso foreign DNA introduced during the course of bacterial or viral infection could have a dual role in zzso zzso This DNA could serve as an zzso to activate innate immunity as well as an zzso to drive an zzso zzso zzso In this scenario, the generation of zzso zzso in contrast to highly specific zzso to bacterial DNA, most likely depends on genetically determined abnormalities in the zzso repertoire in patients with zzso Given the universal expression of DNA, this model suggests that many different kinds of infections could trigger zzso zzso responses in zzso as well as induce zzso
