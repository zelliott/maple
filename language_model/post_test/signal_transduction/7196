We identified a novel zzso compound, zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated its effects and mechanisms in primary cortical zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso In primary rat cortical zzso against zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso death in a zzso zzso In addition, treatment with zzso resulted in decreased zzso zzso death, as assessed by nuclear zzso zzso To clarify the zzso mechanism of zzso we explored the downstream signaling pathways of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Treatment with zzso leads to early zzso of zzso which in turn leads to zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso However, zzso with zzso resulted in significantly attenuated zzso of zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso leading to subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso We confirmed the critical role of zzso zzso in zzso effects of zzso using specific inhibitor zzso In the zzso zzso injury in mice, treatment with zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso volume, zzso size, and improved neurological zzso zzso effectively prevents cerebral zzso damage through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso showed zzso effects through zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso might be a useful therapeutic agent for brain disorder such as zzso zzso
