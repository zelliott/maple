Tight regulation of gene zzso is critical in muscle development as well as during the formation and maintenance of the zzso junction zzso We previously demonstrated that the zzso of G protein zzso zzso is enhanced by treatment of cultured zzso with zzso zzso a zzso factor that plays an important role in neural zzso In the current study, we report that the transcript levels of zzso and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle are zzso following zzso nerve injury or blockade of nerve zzso These observations prompted us to explore the possibility that G protein zzso regulate zzso signaling and gene zzso We showed that zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso whereas suppression of zzso expression in zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that expression of zzso protein zzso regulates zzso gene zzso in cultured zzso Taken together, our observations provide evidence that specific zzso G proteins regulate zzso signaling and gene zzso during rat muscle zzso
