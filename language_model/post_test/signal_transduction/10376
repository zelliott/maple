zzso regulatory controls of microbial zzso zzso zzso are described in this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified genes essential for zzso zzso including those coding for a zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso interrupted a response regulator gene zzso to as zzso which encodes an zzso protein and is immediately downstream of a gene zzso zzso a protein with primary structural features found in sensor zzso zzso The structural genes for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were downstream of zzso The zzso could not be zzso by zzso in trans but was zzso by a clone containing zzso and consistent with reverse zzso zzso zzso experiments, which demonstrated these genes are zzso as an zzso zzso of zzso was monitored by zzso and found to be zzso by the addition of zzso to cell zzso zzso of zzso was also controlled in a fashion consistent with zzso sensing in that zzso expression of zzso was absent in zzso zzso cells but was observed in zzso zzso cells and zzso treating zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso culture zzso also resulted in zzso zzso Under inducing conditions, zzso expression was readily observed in the zzso strain but significantly reduced in the zzso indicating that zzso is zzso and at least partially controls the expression of the zzso zzso In zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is complex, apparently being controlled by zzso exposure, a zzso signal zzso system, and zzso zzso
