zzso and their receptors are part of polarized T helper 1 zzso and zzso immune responses which control trafficking of zzso cells to sites of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso zzso are important regulatory zzso zzso is expressed on the surface of zzso T cells, zzso cells and B zzso zzso of zzso zzso were increased in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso of zzso non-obese diabetic zzso mice in comparison to zzso zzso However, a significant reduction of zzso was noticed at 12 weeks both at the zzso and protein levels while expression increased in the inflamed zzso The percentage of zzso attracted zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso attracted T cells completely abolished the capacity of zzso T cells to transfer diabetes in the recipients of an adoptive cell zzso When T zzso from zzso females treated with zzso a specific zzso zzso were mixed with zzso T cells during adoptive cell zzso experiments, prevalence of diabetes in the recipients rose from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was associated with an increase of zzso zzso zzso and a reduction of zzso zzso zzso levels both in zzso and isolated zzso zzso also reduced zzso and zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso reduced the number of zzso and zzso positive cells in the inflamed zzso We can conclude that the zzso zzso has protective effects against zzso zzso
