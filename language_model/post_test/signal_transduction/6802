Recent zzso efforts such as zzso have generated a large body of zzso zzso data in multiple conditions zzso zzso and disease zzso zzso these data is especially important for network-based approaches to human disease, for instance to identify coherent zzso zzso zzso that can inform functional disease mechanisms and pathological zzso Yet, zzso network analysis across conditions is significantly hampered by the paucity of robust and zzso zzso Building on the zzso zzso zzso Value zzso we introduce a new zzso approach for efficient, zzso and zzso identification of zzso simultaneously across multiple zzso Our method can accommodate weighted (and zzso networks of any size and can similarly use zzso or raw gene expression input data, without zzso upon the definition and stability of the correlation used to assess gene zzso In simulation studies, we demonstrated distinctive advantages of our method over existing methods, which was able to recover accurately both common and zzso zzso without zzso ad-hoc input parameters as required by other zzso We applied our method to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from rats zzso and humans zzso and identified several common and zzso zzso with functional significance, which were not detected by other zzso In humans we zzso the zzso between zzso progression and zzso zzso interactions processes in zzso zones during zzso expansion and further, we uncovered pathways related to development of later cognitive functions in the cortical plate of the developing brain which were previously zzso zzso of seven rat zzso identified a zzso zzso of zzso heat shock protein zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was significantly zzso using separate failing heart and liver gene expression zzso in humans, thus revealing a zzso functional role for zzso genes in cardiovascular zzso
