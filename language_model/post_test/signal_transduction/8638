zzso sense environmental stimuli and zzso this information to zzso components of the signal zzso machinery to cope with and to adapt to ever changing zzso zzso bacteria are equipped with numerous zzso proteins responsible for sensing such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There is increasing evidence that sensors employ transport proteins as zzso Transport proteins are zzso information carriers as they bind zzso molecules in the external medium and transport them into the zzso allowing them to provide dynamic information on the zzso zzso This review explores the sensing capabilities of secondary zzso primary zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso seems to be a sophisticated and probably widely distributed zzso
