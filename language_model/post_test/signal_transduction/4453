zzso is a recently discovered gastrointestinal zzso with established zzso actions, which is linked to diabetes and may exert cardiovascular zzso Here we aimed to investigate the specific effects of zzso on vascular zzso 

zzso relaxation responses to zzso peptides were assessed in rat isolated zzso and zzso artery zzso 8) in the presence and absence of selective zzso zzso studies were performed in cultured bovine zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso peptides zzso zzso relaxation in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to full-length zzso were greater than those to zzso and zzso zzso relaxation was attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it is zzso by an zzso NO zzso cascade involving an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso and zzso of vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso Supporting data from zzso indicated that zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased after exposure to zzso zzso to zzso were zzso by zzso of candidate zzso zzso factors zzso and combined zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso pathways were not zzso 

zzso produces significant vascular relaxation via specific zzso of zzso NO zzso These actions may be important in normal regulation of vascular function and are clearly relevant to diabetes, a condition characterized by zzso dysfunction and cardiovascular zzso
