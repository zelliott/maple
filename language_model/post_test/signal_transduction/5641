The dogma that solid tumors are composed of tumor cells that all share the same ability to produce zzso daughter cells has been challenged in recent zzso There is growing evidence that many adult zzso contain a set of tissue stem cells, which might undergo zzso transformation while retaining their stem cell zzso These include the ability of indefinite zzso and the capability to differentiate into daughter cells of zzso zzso Brain tumors such as zzso or zzso often contain areas of divergent zzso which raises the intriguing question of whether these tumors could derive from neural stem cells zzso chapter reviews the current knowledge of zzso and relates them to brain tumor zzso Current therapy protocols for zzso brain tumors are targeted toward the reduction of bulk tumor zzso The concept of zzso stem cells could provide new insights for future therapies, if the capacity for zzso of tumor cells and growth of the tumor mass would reside within a small subset of cancer zzso
