zzso death may occur in neurodegenerative disorders and zzso the outcome of brain zzso a condition associated with high zzso levels of zzso and zzso We show that pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso respectively, protects cultured zzso against zzso induced by a zzso exposure to zzso deprivation zzso Protection by zzso and zzso was less than additive and was zzso by zzso blockade with selective competitive zzso or zzso zzso Both in control zzso and in zzso exposed to zzso zzso and zzso induced a rapid zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which are known to support cell zzso In cultures exposed to zzso zzso and zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced the levels of the zzso protein zzso increased the levels of the zzso protein zzso and were highly protective against zzso death, as shown by nuclear zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso All of these effects were attenuated by treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which inhibit the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that pharmacological zzso of zzso and zzso receptors protects zzso against zzso damage by stimulating the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
