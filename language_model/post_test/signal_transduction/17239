Target specific short zzso DNA zzso zzso called zzso are zzso zzso for numerous in zzso zzso However, zzso are synthetic zzso which might be recognized by the immune cells in zzso and induce an zzso of the innate immune zzso Thus, immune zzso potential of synthetic zzso zzso zzso was determined using a well established zzso circulation zzso Fresh human blood was incubated at zzso for 2 or 4 hours with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as positive zzso zzso changes were determined by zzso zzso Blood samples containing zzso demonstrated after 4 hours a significant regulation of 295 zzso zzso others, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highest regulated zzso Gene zzso terms and zzso zzso analyses exhibited that the zzso expressed genes belong to the transcripts that are regulated during an immune and inflammatory response, and were overrepresented in zzso signaling zzso This study shows for the first time the potential of zzso to activate immune system after systemic application into the human zzso Thus, we highly recommend performing of these zzso tests with potential zzso zzso
