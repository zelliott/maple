A cross talk between zzso zzso receptors and zzso protein zzso zzso is proposed as involved in zzso zzso We wanted to investigate zzso levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso and breast cancer corrected survival zzso after zzso zzso treatment, mainly tamoxifen for 2 or 5 zzso We also wanted to investigate these markers in relation to early and late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso from primary BC diagnosed zzso Wide ranges of zzso and zzso proteins were zzso median zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were registered in zzso and classified zzso Higher zzso were correlated to higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso larger tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso grade III zzso zzso zzso distant zzso zzso zzso zzso shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso and shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso and with early relapses zzso zzso zzso while no difference was seen during the later follow-up period zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso had a significant negative impact on both early zzso zzso zzso and later zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso only predicted later relapses zzso zzso zzso Our preliminary results suggest higher zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso as candidate markers of intrinsic resistance for zzso zzso zzso
