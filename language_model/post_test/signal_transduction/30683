A full zzso understanding of how zzso cargo proteins are exported from the zzso zzso for passage through the early zzso zzso is essential for us to comprehend how cells are zzso maintain compartment identity, as well as how they selectively zzso proteins and other zzso to the zzso zzso This process depends on the function of a zzso complex, the zzso zzso Here we describe progress towards a full zzso understanding of zzso coat function, including the latest findings in this zzso Much of our understanding of how zzso functions and is regulated comes from studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and single cell zzso New developments arising from clinical cases and model zzso biology and zzso enable us to gain far greater insight in to the role of membrane traffic in the context of a whole zzso as well as during zzso and zzso A significant outcome of such a full understanding is to reveal how the machinery and processes of membrane trafficking through the early zzso zzso fail in disease zzso
