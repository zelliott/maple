Since zzso was first isolated and characterized as a plant hormone, the underlying molecular mechanism of zzso signaling has been zzso primarily in zzso plants represented by zzso In zzso plants, the molecular mechanism of zzso signaling has remained zzso despite various zzso zzso To understand the function and mechanism of zzso signaling in rice zzso zzso we focused on the zzso zzso a well-studied gene in zzso that serves as a negative regulator of zzso zzso We found 24 zzso gene family members in the rice zzso zzso is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to zzso We produced transgenic rice harboring zzso which can zzso zzso zzso protein containing an zzso acid change in domain II to cause a zzso zzso by treatment with zzso The transgenic rice was insensitive to zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited short leaf zzso reduced crown root formation, and abnormal leaf zzso These results suggest that, in rice, zzso is important for development and its signaling is zzso by zzso zzso
