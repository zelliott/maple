Lack of physical activity zzso is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease zzso and PA interventions are believed to provide an effective zzso approach for attenuating the symptoms of this zzso However, the mechanism of action of these positive effects is currently zzso It is possible that the benefits may be at least partially zzso by the effects on the neuroendocrine stress zzso zzso stress can lead to dysfunction of the zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso patterns of cortisol zzso and a cascade of negative downstream zzso These factors have been linked not only to reduced cognitive function but also increased levels of zzso plaques and protein zzso zzso (the zzso hallmarks of zzso in the zzso mouse models of this zzso However, there is evidence that PA can have zzso effects on the stress neuroendocrine system and related risk factors relevant to zzso We explore the possibility that PA can positively impact upon zzso by restoring zzso zzso axis function, with zzso downstream effects upon underlying zzso and associated cognitive zzso We conclude with suggestions for future research to test this hypothesis in patients with zzso
