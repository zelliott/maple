zzso is a ubiquitous protein modification in zzso signaling and forms zzso from zzso oxide zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso leads to impairment of cellular zzso zzso zzso C zzso is an important signaling protein that plays a role in the regulation of vascular function, and it is not known whether zzso affects zzso role in vascular zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso in vascular smooth muscle would inhibit its zzso zzso zzso rings from male zzso mice were treated with zzso or zzso zzso as pharmacological tools, which lead to stabilize zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as NO zzso zzso responses of zzso to zzso a zzso zzso were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was increased by zzso or zzso and zzso as compared with control zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and subsequently downstream signal zzso These data suggest that zzso is zzso by zzso and this modification zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of target proteins related to contraction, this zzso modification may be a key player in conditions of decreased vascular zzso
