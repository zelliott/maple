Although zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso it triggers an zzso defense mechanism known as premature zzso in normal zzso In this study, we investigated the induction of cellular responses by different expression levels of zzso zzso in primary human zzso We found that a moderate, zzso increase in zzso expression promoted cell zzso Further zzso of zzso expression initially enhanced proliferation but eventually induced zzso expression and zzso The induction of these opposing cellular responses by zzso signals of different intensity was achieved through differential zzso of the zzso pathways that zzso these zzso Whereas moderate zzso activities only zzso the zzso zzso pathway, high intensity zzso signals induced zzso and zzso to higher levels, leading to stimulation of the zzso pathway, which had been shown previously to act downstream of zzso to trigger the zzso zzso Thus, these studies have revealed a mechanism for the differential effects of zzso on cell zzso Furthermore, moderate zzso activity zzso transformation in cooperation with zzso and zzso suggesting that a moderate intensity zzso signal can provide sufficient zzso activities for zzso This result also implies that the ability of zzso to promote proliferation and zzso transformation can be zzso with that to induce zzso in cell culture and that the development of tumors with relatively low zzso activities may not need to acquire genetic zzso that bypass premature zzso
