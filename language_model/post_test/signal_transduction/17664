Conventional zzso mechanics models considering living cells as viscous fluid balloons are unable to explain some recent experimental zzso In contrast, new zzso models provide the desirable zzso These models emphasize the role of the cell zzso built of zzso and zzso A specific architectural model of the zzso framework called zzso deserved wide attention zzso zzso models particularly account for the phenomenon of linear stiffening of living zzso These models are discussed from the structural mechanics zzso zzso of structural zzso is given and the meaning of zzso is zzso zzso sources of zzso leading to cell stiffening are zzso The role of local zzso of zzso and overall stability of the zzso is zzso zzso studies play a central role in the development of the zzso theoretical framework allowing for the prediction of the cell behavior from zzso zzso zzso of computer analysis of the zzso that consider unilateral response of zzso and deep zzso of zzso are zzso
