The onset of zzso is controlled by the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso activity is controlled through the balance of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso detection of DNA damage in zzso activates a checkpoint that prevents entry into zzso through the maintenance of zzso zzso of zzso thus ensuring DNA repair precedes zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso is the zzso of this checkpoint zzso We have previously reported that zzso of zzso causes a zzso zzso arrest, and this or zzso leads to zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso directly zzso zzso in zzso These data suggested that zzso is a key target of zzso action in checkpoint zzso However, cells lacking zzso are checkpoint zzso and sustained zzso zzso arrests cell cycle progression independently of zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone cannot enforce a checkpoint zzso zzso can also zzso zzso in zzso These zzso events are thought to promote the interaction with zzso proteins the zzso retention of the zzso zzso However, we show here that the zzso DNA damage checkpoint is intact in cells that regulate zzso entry independently of zzso Further, these cells are still sensitive to zzso arrest, and so zzso of zzso is also insufficient to regulate checkpoint zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso checkpoint zzso We also show that zzso of the zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso a transient increase in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso DNA damage checkpoint simultaneously signals via both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso thus providing a zzso mechanism to ensure cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso
