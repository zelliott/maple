Current knowledge of molecular signaling during zzso development is advancing zzso We know that cells can respond to mechanical stimuli by zzso zzso Thus, the link between mechanical stimuli and gene expression has become a new and important area of the zzso zzso This field of research seems to be a revival of the old approach of zzso mechanics, which goes back to the zzso His zzso Carey zzso and zzso zzso These researchers argued that forces play a fundamental role in tissue differentiation and zzso They understood zzso as a closed system with living cells as the active part and zzso chemical, and physical laws as the zzso This review reports on linking mechanical aspects of zzso biology with the contemporary knowledge of tissue zzso We focus on the formation of cartilage (in relation to zzso bone (in relation to zzso zzso and muscles (in relation to zzso zzso The cascade of molecules may be triggered by forces, which arise during physical cell and tissue zzso zzso zzso knowledge is mandatory to zzso the exact location and timing of the regions where forces are zzso Because this finding also holds true for the exact timing and location of signals, more zzso images of the zzso processes are zzso Further research is also required to create methods for measuring forces within a zzso The molecules whose presence and zzso we are investigating appear to be zzso rather than creators of zzso
