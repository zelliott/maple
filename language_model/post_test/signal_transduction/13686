zzso acid zzso is an important zzso involved in many zzso zzso including neural zzso body axis formation, and zzso During early embryonic development, zzso is zzso from zzso zzso in an irreversible reaction mainly zzso by retinal zzso 2 zzso whereas zzso is converted from zzso via zzso zzso by zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso family 26 zzso We have previously identified a zzso zzso 3 zzso which showed differential expression patterns in zzso zzso We show here that the expression of zzso was induced by zzso treatment and zzso of zzso zzso related 1 zzso in animal cap zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso of excessive zzso In zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso in the presence of their respective zzso zzso zzso the action of zzso or zzso indicating that zzso acid signaling is zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso of shortened zzso zzso reduced head structure, and zzso zzso which were also found in zzso treated with an excess of zzso zzso of the expression of zzso not, zzso and zzso indicated that zzso extension movement was defective in zzso zzso Taken together, these studies suggest that zzso zzso in zzso metabolism by reducing zzso levels and is required for proper zzso axis formation, zzso zzso and zzso
