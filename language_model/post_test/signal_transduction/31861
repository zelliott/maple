The zzso growth factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso one of the main zzso receptors of zzso have been reported to play important roles in tumor growth by zzso zzso signaling zzso In human gastric zzso zzso however, expression of the zzso and zzso zzso have not been zzso Here we examined the zzso levels and protein expressions of these two genes and their relationship in human normal gastric zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso real-time zzso was used to analyze the zzso expression of both zzso and zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso zzso expression and the zzso characteristics of tumors were zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to investigate the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The expression patterns of zzso and zzso zzso in 45 frozen slides of zzso zzso were identified by zzso Our results indicate that the expression of zzso and of zzso zzso was significantly associated with tumor zzso zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso A significant positive correlation was also found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that expression of zzso and zzso zzso has mechanical significance in the early stages of human gastric zzso zzso
