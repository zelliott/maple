Since the first reports of zzso retrograde signaling in 2001, great advances have been made toward understanding the molecular basis and functions of the zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that the zzso system is functional at various types of zzso throughout the zzso Basic mechanisms have been clarified as to how zzso are produced and released from zzso zzso and regulate neurotransmitter release through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although there remain zzso questions and some zzso In addition to this major function, recent studies suggest diverse functions of zzso including control of other zzso forms of synaptic zzso regulation of zzso zzso stimulation of zzso interaction, and induction of zzso zzso Using recently developed pharmacological and genetic tools, behavioral studies have zzso the roles of the zzso system in various aspects of neural zzso In this review, we make a brief overview of molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso synaptic zzso and also zzso recent findings, which shed new light on a diversity of functional roles of zzso
