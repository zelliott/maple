During zzso development, neural precursor cells zzso or neural stem zzso produce zzso first and zzso zzso Although the timing of the fate switch from zzso to zzso is critical for determining the number of zzso the mechanisms are not fully zzso Here, we show that the zzso group complex zzso restricts zzso competence of zzso and promotes the transition of zzso fate from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso by knockout of the zzso or zzso gene or zzso zzso prolonged the zzso phase of zzso and delayed the onset of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was found to repress the promoter of the zzso gene zzso in a zzso zzso These results demonstrate a role of zzso the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
