zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso function as key communication systems between cells of the immune system and mediate inflammation and tissue zzso LIGHT zzso is a key component of the communication system that controls the responses of zzso LIGHT activates two cell surface zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and is inhibited by soluble decoy zzso The zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso for zzso whereas zzso zzso the functions of zzso cells and zzso cells by creating tissue zzso which promote immune zzso zzso also binds an zzso zzso member, B and T zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso serves as a molecular switch between zzso and zzso zzso Studies in humans and experimental animal models reveal that LIGHT contributes to inflammation and zzso in zzso zzso joint and vascular zzso LIGHT is accessible to zzso zzso which can be used to target this zzso during zzso zzso
