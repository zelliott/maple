There is ongoing interest to identify signaling pathways and genes that play a key role in zzso and the development of resistance to zzso zzso Given that zzso zzso zzso interact with various partners through complex molecular zzso leading to the control of gene zzso they have captured the attention of a large number of zzso As a family of zzso zzso they have emerged as important regulators of cell zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso zzso have been shown to efficiently protect against the growth of tumor cells in zzso as well as in zzso The pancreatic cancer which represents one of the most aggressive cancer still suffers from inefficient zzso Recent data, although using in zzso tumor cell cultures and in zzso zzso mouse model, have shown that some of the zzso do express zzso tumor zzso This provides hope that some of the zzso could be potential efficient zzso cancer zzso The purpose of this review is to analyze some of the current data of zzso as possible targets of drug development and to provide some insight into the current problems with pancreatic cancer and points of interest for further study of zzso as potential molecules for pancreatic cancer zzso zzso
