We report the solution structure of zzso an zzso zzso agent that can amplify zzso zzso signal through the zzso death zzso after zzso 8 zzso zzso contains eight alpha zzso where two central zzso zzso are surrounded by six zzso zzso The fold resembles zzso bacterial toxins and shows similarity to zzso although sequence zzso to zzso is limited to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we modeled a complex of zzso and zzso by aligning the zzso and zzso zzso motifs in the known zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we show that the overall structure of zzso is preserved after zzso by zzso zzso We propose that zzso has both zzso zzso and zzso modes of action in inducing zzso zzso
