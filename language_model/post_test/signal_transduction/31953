zzso of animals and plants are maintained through balanced cell growth, movement, and zzso Although cells are exchanged zzso the whole structure of the tissue is zzso This form of maintenance is called cell zzso Here I propose a zzso model of patterns that zzso through zzso This model is derived from the zzso system, which has recently attracted much attention because it is considered to facilitate zzso in insect zzso In this model, I zzso the manner of the zzso of zzso and Fat during cell division, and then derived equations in the parameters that enable the patterns to zzso and maintain themselves through zzso I extended the equations derived in the one-dimensional model into a two-dimensional zzso Finally, I discuss a possible relationship between zzso and zzso
