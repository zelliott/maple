zzso and molecular studies of touch avoidance in the zzso zzso zzso have resulted in a molecular model for a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins hypothesized to be zzso of a mechanically gated zzso channel that are related to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Products of zzso a novel zzso and zzso a protein that includes multiple zzso zzso inhibitor repeats and zzso repeats, may interact with the channel in the zzso zzso Inside the cell, specialized zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be linked to the zzso channel by zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of a large family of zzso zzso zzso the zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso are candidate components of a zzso channel in motor zzso zzso for advancing understanding of zzso in other systems are zzso
