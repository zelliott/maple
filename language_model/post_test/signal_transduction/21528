zzso virus zzso the development of zzso in mice through the interaction of a viral zzso zzso with a truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso short zzso zzso and the zzso We have shown previously that the ability of zzso to participate in the transformation of zzso zzso cells requires the zzso activity and zzso site of zzso Here we show that zzso zzso mice exhibit decreased zzso to zzso zzso and that expansion of zzso zzso in response to infection requires the zzso zzso domain of zzso A fusion protein in which the zzso site in zzso is replaced by zzso supports the growth of zzso from mice lacking zzso whereas a zzso fusion protein does zzso zzso is expressed in zzso from zzso zzso mice, zzso with zzso and is zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Mice with a targeted deletion in zzso are less susceptible to zzso zzso and the expansion of zzso zzso cells in response to infection can be rescued by expression of zzso but not zzso Taken together, these data indicate that a zzso complex mediates the growth of primary zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso
