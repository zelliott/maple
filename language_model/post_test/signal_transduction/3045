To investigate whether zzso zzso rat zzso proliferation and zzso zzso expansion through suppression of transforming growth factor zzso tissue growth factor zzso pathway, and to explore experimental evidence for its effect on zzso zzso zzso 

A rat model of zzso zzso zzso zzso was established and zzso intervention was zzso zzso blood zzso count, urine protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and gene expression of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein including zzso zzso and collagen IV in isolated zzso were documented at 1, 3 and 7 days after injection of zzso zzso 

The model group developed zzso at 1, 3 and 7 days after injection of zzso zzso which were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso intervention group showed significantly decreased zzso at 3 and 7 days after injection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than model group zzso zzso zzso although higher than the control group zzso zzso zzso After intervention for 3 and 7 days, zzso significantly zzso both zzso and zzso gene and protein expression in cultured zzso and suppressed the production of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso leading to attenuated zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso expansion in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso expansion through zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and thus ameliorates the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso
