zzso growth factor zzso signaling is essential for the development of the zzso hormone zzso zzso Mice harboring deficiencies in zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso suffer a significant loss of zzso zzso but their zzso zzso have not been zzso This study examined if female mice zzso for zzso zzso or both zzso zzso exhibited altered parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, we examined the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these mice to assess if changes in the zzso system, which stimulates the zzso system, could contribute to the zzso zzso Single zzso zzso or zzso had normal timing for zzso opening zzso but delayed first zzso However, after achieving the first zzso they underwent normal expression of zzso zzso In contrast, the compound zzso underwent early zzso and normal first zzso but had zzso zzso cycles that subsequently reduced their zzso zzso zzso on zzso Day 15, 30, and 60 transgenic female mice revealed that female compound zzso had significantly more zzso zzso in the zzso compared to their zzso zzso suggesting increased zzso zzso may drive early zzso but could not maintain the zzso changes in zzso zzso activity required for female zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso signaling deficiencies zzso alter the parameters of female zzso onset and zzso Further, these deficiencies led to changes in the zzso zzso zzso that may have contributed to the accelerated zzso in the compound zzso
