Bone zzso depends on the precise coordination of bone zzso and subsequent bone zzso zzso of this process are associated with skeletal diseases, such as zzso disease zzso We show using in zzso and in zzso models that active zzso released during bone zzso coordinates bone formation by inducing migration of bone zzso zzso cells, also known as bone zzso stem cells, to the bone zzso sites and that this process is zzso through a zzso signaling zzso zzso mice carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which show the typical progressive zzso zzso seen in the human disease, we found high levels of active zzso in the bone zzso Treatment with a zzso type I zzso inhibitor partially rescued the zzso bone zzso and prevented the zzso Thus, as zzso functions to couple bone zzso and formation, zzso of zzso activity could be an effective treatment for bone zzso zzso
