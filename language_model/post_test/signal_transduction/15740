zzso & zzso signaling are widespread both in zzso and in zzso and are particularly important in embryonic stem cell zzso zzso and lineage zzso Although zzso signaling via zzso growth zzso zzso is known to be required in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso the question of whether zzso zzso signaling is zzso or whether other soluble zzso are also involved in fate zzso is zzso The zzso confined and zzso nature of zzso signaling makes its experimental control zzso current experimental approaches typically require prior knowledge of the zzso in order to zzso the zzso A new approach explored in this work is to leverage transport phenomena at cellular resolution to zzso overall zzso signaling through the physical removal of zzso zzso 

We develop a multiplex zzso platform to continuously remove zzso zzso factors to zzso zzso zzso By comparing cell growth and differentiation in side-by-side chambers with or without added zzso factors, we isolate the effects of zzso signaling from artifacts such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects, and find that zzso growth zzso are required during zzso zzso Then we induce zzso signaling in minimal chemically defined medium zzso and inhibit zzso signaling in fully supplemented differentiation medium with zzso factors to determine that the zzso zzso factors are required to promote growth of zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate for the first time that flow can zzso zzso signaling and examine zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso signaling drives zzso commitment of zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso Overall, by uncovering zzso processes previously hidden in conventional culture systems, our results establish zzso zzso as a technique to study and manipulate zzso signaling in cell zzso
