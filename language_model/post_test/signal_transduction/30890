Type 2 zzso diabetes zzso is a progressive zzso disorder arising from genetic and environmental factors that impair beta cell function and insulin action in peripheral zzso We identified reduced zzso zzso delta zzso expression and zzso activity in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic zzso In diabetic animals, reduced zzso protein and zzso zzso activity were restored upon correction of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso content, reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, insulin zzso and zzso zzso and led to zzso zzso zzso flexibility, evident by the transition between zzso and zzso zzso during zzso and fed conditions, was impaired in zzso zzso zzso We reveal a previously zzso role for zzso in contributing to zzso peripheral insulin resistance and thereby zzso the severity of type 2 zzso zzso zzso causes peripheral insulin resistance and zzso zzso These defects in zzso and energy zzso contribute to mild obesity later in zzso
