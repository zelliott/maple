zzso acts on cells through zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso Here, we show that mouse zzso zzso lack the classical zzso yet exhibit specific zzso responses to zzso These manifest themselves as zzso rapid increase in zzso free zzso which is due to release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is also zzso by plasma zzso zzso It is not affected by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas it is completely inhibited by the zzso C inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites for testosterone are zzso on the surface of intact zzso cells, which become selectively zzso independent on zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso is dependent on temperature, zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso our data provide evidence for the existence of zzso zzso receptors for testosterone in plasma zzso which initiate a zzso signaling zzso of zzso
