zzso an zzso zzso fusion protein composed of the first zzso domain of zzso fused to the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has recently been shown in phase II and III clinical trials to safely reduce disease expression in patients with chronic plaque zzso zzso zzso the function of and selectively zzso zzso of zzso human zzso T cells in zzso We have sought to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of action that influence the biological activity of zzso and may contribute to its efficacy and patient zzso zzso evaluated is the ability of zzso to activate zzso signals zzso via zzso and/or zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso using zzso of zzso engineered to have zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso domain that impact zzso gamma R binding indicate that zzso mediates zzso interactions between cells expressing human zzso and zzso to activate cells, zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell surface expression of the zzso marker zzso and induce release of zzso zzso In the systems used, this signaling is shown to require binding to zzso and zzso and be zzso through zzso but not zzso zzso using human zzso mice and zzso of zzso confirmed the requirement for zzso gamma R binding for detection of the pharmacological effects of zzso in zzso Thus zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions to activate zzso gamma zzso cells zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso of sensitive zzso target zzso
