zzso is an abundant zzso with potent zzso activities and accumulates in zzso zzso However, its zzso functions are poorly zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso of zzso for 4 d in zzso zzso zzso alters the expression of genes related to insulin zzso 

The zzso zzso were treated zzso 10 or 20 zzso zzso during differentiation for 4 zzso The cells treated with 10 zzso zzso for 4 d were subsequently incubated zzso 5 zzso of tumor necrosis zzso for 48 h in the medium without zzso The zzso levels of genes in the cells and zzso protein levels in the medium were determined by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species levels in the cells were assessed by zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso treatment at a concentration of 20 zzso but not 10 zzso in zzso zzso during differentiation for 4 d enhanced the expression of genes related to insulin sensitivity, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in the zzso zzso necrosis zzso treatment zzso the expression of these genes and zzso protein in the medium and induced zzso oxygen species zzso In contrast, cells that accumulated zzso at a concentration of 10 zzso did not show these zzso 

The zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso restores the expression of genes related to insulin sensitivity and zzso oxygen species levels in zzso zzso
