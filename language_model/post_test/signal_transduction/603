zzso zzso and zzso zzso remain sources of cell and tissue zzso zzso to restore blood flow and limit zzso injury represents a challenge in surgical tissue repair and zzso zzso oxide zzso is a central regulator of blood flow, zzso signaling and zzso De zzso NO synthesis requires oxygen and is limited in zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso has been discovered to convert to NO via zzso reduction during zzso providing a NO zzso independent and zzso NO zzso Furthermore, blockade of the zzso protein zzso zzso or its zzso zzso has been shown to promote downstream NO signaling via soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso would provide an zzso NO source that could be zzso by zzso blockade enhancing zzso tissue survival, blood flow and zzso Both low dose zzso and direct blockade of zzso interaction using zzso or gene zzso increased acute blood flow and late tissue survival in zzso full thickness zzso zzso and zzso blockade both enhanced in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect could be abolished by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Potential therapeutic zzso was tested in a more severe zzso zzso zzso We found that combined therapy with zzso and zzso blockade enhanced zzso zzso survival and zzso to a greater extent than either agent alone, providing approximately zzso zzso zzso These data provide a new therapeutic paradigm for hypoxic NO signaling through enhanced zzso zzso by zzso blockade and zzso zzso
