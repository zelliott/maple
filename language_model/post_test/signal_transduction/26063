The generation of zzso precursors zzso from zzso zzso zzso in bone zzso is dependent on signals provided by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Mice deficient in FL exhibit striking reductions in LHP and zzso Currently, the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso development is zzso Here, we show that zzso of FL zzso zzso ) reduced the numbers of zzso common zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that FL levels set a threshold for B zzso zzso dilution analysis confirmed reduced zzso frequency in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of LHP from zzso zzso animals showed increased transcripts of the B lineage inhibitor zzso However, targeted deletion of zzso did not restore the zzso lineage deficiencies in zzso mice, supporting zzso zzso zzso incorporation studies established that FL is not essential for the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso expressing low levels of zzso revealed decreased levels of the zzso factor zzso zzso the zzso LHP progeny of zzso zzso cells exhibited increased zzso V zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso signaling zzso a cascade of events in zzso precursors that promote the survival of LHP from which zzso are zzso
