Ras regulates a variety of different signal zzso pathways acting as molecular zzso It was shown by liquid and solid-state zzso zzso zzso that Ras exists in the zzso bound form in at least two zzso states zzso in zzso time zzso The relative population between the two zzso states affects drastically the affinity of Ras to its zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso equilibrium can be shifted specifically by point zzso including zzso with zzso potential, thus zzso the zzso interactions and their zzso to dynamic properties of the zzso
