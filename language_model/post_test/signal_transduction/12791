The human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to three copies of zzso repeats within the long terminal zzso Interestingly, the zzso motif found in the center of the zzso zzso element zzso is also present in the zzso zzso zzso elements zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also bind to various zzso and zzso sites and that the zzso can zzso upon a zzso promoter responsiveness to various inducing agents, including tax, zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by tax can be inhibited by several protein zzso zzso including zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso sites are similar zzso elements and further suggest zzso that the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by tax involves the action of a protein zzso and zzso that induction by tax, zzso and zzso might be zzso by distinct factors or zzso
