zzso zzso cells zzso recognize zzso virus infection via zzso and consequently produce vast amounts of type I zzso Because zzso zzso zzso reside in the zzso membrane zzso it is zzso that zzso do not require zzso viral replication to recognize the zzso By checking zzso disease virus zzso zzso abundance in zzso and zzso zzso from zzso mice, we found that zzso replication was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in response to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso in type I zzso zzso The lack of zzso signaling led to the replication of zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso zzso production in zzso These results showed that detection of viruses via zzso together with a type I zzso feedback system zzso the requirement for viral zzso recognition in zzso
