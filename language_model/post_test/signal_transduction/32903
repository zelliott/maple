Although zzso zzso are zzso compounds, zzso zzso zzso rapidly accumulates during the zzso of zzso zzso This review considers the kinetic characteristics of zzso transport through the plasma membrane and its zzso zzso The influx and zzso of zzso occur via different zzso At zzso zzso of zzso the influx of zzso does not significantly contribute to regulation of the zzso content of the zzso zzso but it is responsible for the zzso of zzso in experiments at zzso approximately 1 zzso In contrast, the high rate of zzso zzso is mainly responsible for zzso of zzso during long-term zzso of zzso zzso The possible involvement of zzso cassette proteins (ABC zzso in the zzso of zzso from the cell is zzso In zzso zzso is a signal zzso during the generation of cell zzso acting on special receptors that interact with zzso zzso Such receptors have not been found in zzso and in most cases the signal functions of zzso are zzso by its degradation by zzso zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso
