To investigate the zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso in the zzso of mice during zzso status zzso zzso and its relationship with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso models were established by zzso injection of zzso The intervention group received the zzso signaling zzso inhibitor zzso before the zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso model group, the intervention group and the control zzso group, at 6 hours and 3 days after initiation of the zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were labeled with both zzso and sequential zzso zzso zzso 

Among the zzso zzso zzso mice, strong zzso zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso and zzso of the zzso at 6 hours after initiation of SE, whereas zzso on the third day of zzso was not different from the control zzso zzso In the zzso mice zzso group), zzso effectively blocked the zzso zzso and little zzso could be detected at 6 hours and 3 days after initiation of SE; the levels of zzso remained low, but the level of zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso 

The zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in the early stage of zzso zzso in mice with zzso zzso
