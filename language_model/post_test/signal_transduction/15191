The zzso domain death zzso Bid has been shown to be critical for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, some studies have suggested that zzso of Bid may determine its zzso function and may act as a switch to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Bid and zzso Bid for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and a zzso form of zzso zzso were used to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso Bid transgenic mice expressing a zzso form of Bid and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was determined in healthy mice and in mice following zzso duct zzso partial zzso or zzso zzso As previously reported, loss of Bid protects mice against zzso liver zzso Remarkably however, zzso mice are highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed a typical type I cell signaling behavior with zzso of zzso without zzso zzso to the zzso and no zzso zzso release into the zzso In contrast to previous in zzso findings, zzso of Bid does not affect the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Our data suggest that Bid mainly zzso a weak death zzso signal in zzso and zzso zzso rendering the liver more sensitive to zzso zzso Thus, depending on the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells can either behave as type I or type II zzso
