zzso zzso are zzso zzso receptors for zzso that bear an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in their zzso domain and that zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso motif zzso cell zzso In B cells, zzso of the B cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso leads to an zzso of B cell zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso have been related to the recruitment of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to as zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could also bind to the zzso zzso zzso As a model, a zzso zzso deficient B cell line zzso zzso with a zzso zzso either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso whose zzso zzso was zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso and association to the zzso protein zzso were only found in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to bind to a zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of zzso zzso There was no binding to the zzso zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso upon zzso with zzso in zzso zzso
