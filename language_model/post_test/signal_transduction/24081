In order to improve pear resistance against fire blight caused by zzso zzso a search for promoters driving high-level expression of zzso specifically in response to this bacterial pathogen has been zzso We have examined the ability of zzso zzso and zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso promoters to drive expression of the zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso pear clones were obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined zzso and zzso in these plants grown in zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and compared to cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter appeared to be very zzso activated following zzso in zzso which is the converse of the situation in zzso The zzso promoter was rapidly activated in pear during compatible and incompatible zzso by wounding and following the application of several zzso zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid and zzso zzso The zzso promoter, a deletion zzso of zzso exhibited a low level of expression after bacterial zzso was zzso activated by wounding and zzso and was not activated by zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso promoter was locally activated in zzso whereas the zzso promoter was activated zzso from the infection zzso Taken together, these data show that, although the s zzso and zzso promoters are less active than the zzso promoter in zzso their zzso would permit them to be used to drive the expression of zzso to promote bacterial disease zzso
