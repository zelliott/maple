Energy balance is regulated by circulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling via zzso but is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso signaling enhances zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated in a zzso manner the early zzso and late zzso zzso zzso mechanisms in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and combined zzso calorie and growth zzso At zzso both male and female zzso were zzso but zzso zzso signaling in females was activated as seen by enhanced zzso In addition, increased zzso and zzso supported early initiation of zzso resistance in females that led to elevated zzso but diminished zzso and zzso In contrast, males demonstrated zzso sensitivity seen as a reduction in zzso and zzso and zzso with no effect on zzso zzso At zzso with adequate zzso caloric zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso was seen in zzso with zzso in males indicative of zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso in females consistent with zzso resistance, both with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and energy zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso led to diminished zzso zzso with enhanced zzso and an imbalance in zzso nuclear zzso and zzso expression that favored exponential zzso and diminished energy expenditure zzso We conclude that zzso results in zzso zzso resistance observed mainly in zzso whereas zzso and zzso abolish this zzso setting the stage for acquiring obesity after zzso
