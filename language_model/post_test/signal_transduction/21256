Despite the presence of tumor zzso the paucity of clinically significant zzso zzso immune responses against human tumors is zzso This may, in part, be because of the inability of cancer cells to function as efficient zzso zzso For full zzso T cells must receive two signals delivered by zzso zzso The first is zzso and is delivered by presentation of zzso zzso by the major zzso complex molecules to the zzso zzso This zzso although necessary, is in itself insufficient to mediate zzso zzso zzso release, and subsequent zzso proliferation and zzso For full zzso zzso T cells require delivery of a secondary, zzso zzso such as that delivered by members of the B7 family to their zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso signal in the absence of zzso does not result in productive zzso but rather in zzso a state of zzso zzso zzso To induce zzso proliferation against zzso zzso the tumor cell must first be induced to express B7 or the tumor zzso must be presented by an efficient zzso zzso zzso expression of B7 on the tumor cell alone, however, cannot reverse zzso Reversal of zzso is a complex process involving zzso repair of the zzso zzso and can be accomplished by prolonged exposure to zzso signaling through the zzso pathway, followed by zzso presentation with zzso zzso zzso zzso strategies in the zzso zzso will likely require steps to reverse established zzso in the zzso host as well as effective zzso zzso
