The zzso hormones growth hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are members of an extensive zzso zzso of hormones and receptors that share many of the same general zzso relationships in expressing their biological zzso The biology of the zzso hormones involves a very sophisticated interplay of zzso and zzso Biological activity is triggered via a zzso zzso zzso process that is regulated by zzso features of the zzso These hormones have an zzso four zzso bundle structure that gives rise to two zzso binding sites that have distinctly different zzso and zzso zzso This feature plays an important role in the regulation of these systems by producing binding surfaces with dramatically different binding affinities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, the signaling complexes for systems that activate through zzso zzso are formed in a controlled sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the two zzso zzso indicate that the energetic properties of the two binding sites are fundamentally different and that the zzso shows extraordinary zzso plasticity to mate with the zzso dissimilar sites on the zzso An unexpected finding has been that the two hormone binding sites are zzso zzso a certain set of zzso in the higher affinity site can produce both zzso and energetic effects in the lower affinity zzso These effects are so large that at some level they must have played some role in the evolution of the zzso
