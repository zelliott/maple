Natural killer zzso cells express receptors that are specific for zzso class I zzso These receptors play a crucial role in regulating the zzso and zzso expression capabilities of zzso zzso In humans, three distinct families of genes have been defined that zzso for receptors of zzso class I zzso The first family identified consists of type I zzso molecules belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and are called killer cell zzso receptors zzso A second group of receptors belonging to the zzso zzso named zzso (for zzso like zzso has more recently been zzso zzso are expressed mainly on B, T and zzso cells, but some members of this group are also expressed on zzso zzso They are also referred to as zzso (for zzso zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso and some of the zzso receptors include classical zzso zzso zzso class I zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The third family of zzso class I receptors are zzso zzso family members and are composed of zzso of zzso zzso associated with a member of the zzso family of zzso The zzso for most members is the zzso class I zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, is expressed as a zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso include the human class I like molecules zzso and zzso and the recently described zzso Each of these three families of receptors has individual members that can recognize identical or similar zzso yet signal for zzso or zzso of cellular zzso This zzso zzso with particular structural features present in the zzso and zzso portions of these zzso In this review we will discuss the molecular structure, zzso cellular expression patterns, and function of these zzso class I zzso as well as the zzso location and genetic zzso
