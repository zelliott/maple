zzso and ligaments mediate the attachment of muscle to bone and of bone to bone to provide connectivity and structural integrity in the musculoskeletal zzso We show that zzso signaling plays a major role in the formation of these zzso zzso signaling is a potent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso marker zzso both in organ culture and in cultured cells, and disruption of zzso signaling in zzso double zzso zzso or through zzso of the type II zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso results in the loss of most zzso and ligaments in the zzso zzso tail and zzso The induction of zzso zzso is not affected in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is first zzso at zzso a zzso stage in which zzso are positioned between the zzso muscles and cartilage, and in which zzso or zzso is expressed both in zzso and in the zzso muscles and zzso zzso signaling is thus essential for maintenance of zzso and we propose that it also mediates the recruitment of new zzso cells by zzso muscles and cartilage to establish the connections between zzso zzso and their respective musculoskeletal counterparts, leading to the formation of an interconnected and functionally integrated musculoskeletal zzso
