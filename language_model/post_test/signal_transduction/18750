Studies of zzso pigmentation have identified many genes involved in the development, migration, and function of zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms that switch zzso between the production of zzso or zzso involve the opposing action of two signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Signal zzso zzso zzso affects various aspects of zzso behavior, stimulating zzso zzso attachment to zzso zzso zzso but also zzso the expression of zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso switch from producing zzso to zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso genes zzso Since zzso of signaling pathways leads to zzso zzso zzso technology can provide a quantitative assessment of the consequences of this zzso zzso zzso regulation of all known zzso genes by zzso in cultured zzso has been previously zzso We have now used the zzso zzso technique to screen zzso zzso to identify genes that are zzso enhanced by this zzso We report the zzso expression and zzso zzso of 11 genes spanning 7 functional categories such as zzso body weight control, zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso factors and genes coding for zzso associated zzso
