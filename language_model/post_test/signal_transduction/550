zzso growth factor zzso is involved in many cellular responses, such as zzso and zzso zzso however, its effect against zzso injury induced by ethanol metabolism is not well zzso The aim of this work was to address the mechanism of zzso protection against zzso zzso stress damage in the human cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with 50 zzso zzso for 12 h and then treated with 100 zzso ethanol for zzso zzso Some parameters of zzso damage were zzso We found that ethanol induced zzso formation zzso and zzso damage as judged by zzso zzso zzso zzso was prevented by zzso To address the mechanisms of zzso protection we investigated the cellular zzso zzso We found that zzso increased the zzso ratio, as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To explore the signaling pathways involved in this process, zzso cells were zzso with zzso against zzso zzso and zzso We found that all treatments decreased the expression of the zzso zzso thus zzso the zzso protection against zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso protects cells from the zzso damage induced by ethanol metabolism by a mechanism driven by zzso and zzso zzso
