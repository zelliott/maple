zzso of the order zzso zzso are involved in a wide spectrum of zzso zzso with various plants, thereby exhibiting unique potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso a model zzso of this zzso order, is able to increase the biomass and grain yield of crop plants, and zzso local and systemic resistance to zzso diseases and tolerance to zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis for root zzso we characterized the interaction of zzso zzso with barley roots by combining global gene expression zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso At the zzso level, we show that zzso colonization reduces the availability of free zzso and zzso acids to the root zzso At the zzso level, consecutive interaction stages covering zzso events and progressing through to root colonization showed differential regulation of signal perception and zzso zzso secondary zzso and genes associated with membrane zzso Moreover, we observed zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso mainly encompassing zzso zzso and zzso acid, but salicylic zzso gene expression was zzso The changes in hormone zzso were accompanied with a general suppression of the plant innate immune zzso Further genetic studies showed reduced zzso colonization in zzso that are impaired in zzso synthesis as well as perception, and zzso zzso as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our data further reveal the complexity of zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso and identify zzso signaling as potential target for successful zzso
