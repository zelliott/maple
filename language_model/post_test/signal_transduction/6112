zzso is an essential process for the selection and survival of zzso Resistance to zzso can promote zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso that regulate zzso may therefore be critically involved in the development of zzso zzso A delicate balance between zzso and zzso mechanisms determines whether a cell death signal can activate the execution of the zzso cell death zzso The family of inhibitor of zzso zzso proteins is a recently identified, novel category of zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the zzso of zzso that are the executioners of zzso activated by both the zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso may thereby set the threshold for zzso and play a key role in the regulation of zzso cell zzso zzso themselves are also subject to strict regulation through feedback zzso This paper focuses on the role of zzso family proteins in the regulation of zzso and discusses implications for their involvement in cancer and possible use for cancer therapy, especially in zzso and zzso
