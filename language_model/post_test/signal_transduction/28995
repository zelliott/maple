To evaluate the effects of zzso on the zzso expression of zzso stimulating protein zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and the zzso protein expression on the cell zzso 

zzso of the line zzso were cultured and induced to zzso zzso of the doses 0 - 1 zzso zzso zzso was added into the cultured fluid of the mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to detect the zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso treated and zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso for 4 hours, then the cell protein was extracted and the expressions of G protein (including zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso C (including zzso and zzso were measured by Western zzso 

The zzso protein expression level of the mature zzso zzso by zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso for 18 h was zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso compared with that of the zzso zzso by zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with a zzso rate of zzso The zzso zzso and protein expression levels of the zzso zzso by zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso for 18 h were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly lower than those of the zzso zzso by zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 51% zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso with the zzso rates of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels of the mature zzso after overnight exposure to zzso 1 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso were suppressed zzso For example, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels of the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso group were significantly lower than those of the zzso 0 zzso group by zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso to P zzso zzso In the zzso the reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were observed at the concentration of zzso as low as 1 zzso zzso zzso and all the four proteins were inhibited significantly at the 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso and zzso zzso resistance may contribute to the zzso abnormalities associated with insulin resistance induced by zzso
