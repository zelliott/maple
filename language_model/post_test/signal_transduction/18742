A remarkable inherent feature of cellular metabolism is that the zzso of a small but significant number of zzso are strongly correlated when zzso of biological replicates are zzso This review seeks to zzso the recent efforts to zzso the origin of these observed correlations and points out several aspects concerning their zzso It is argued that correlations between zzso differ profoundly from their zzso and zzso counterparts, and a straightforward interpretation in terms of the underlying zzso pathways will unavoidably zzso It is demonstrated that the comparative correlations analysis offers a way to exploit the observed correlations to obtain additional information about the zzso state of the zzso
