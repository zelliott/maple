zzso scavenger receptors facilitate the zzso of modified zzso zzso zzso formation of foam cells, and development of zzso Given that zzso zzso including zzso can zzso the zzso zzso process, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the synthetic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which is also an zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso and foam cell zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso production induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso II in mouse zzso zzso It also suppressed expression of the 2 major scavenger receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso in part by zzso zzso and inhibited zzso foam cell zzso zzso administration of zzso led to reductions in the areas of zzso zzso and foam cell zzso in the zzso of zzso E zzso mice and reduced serum zzso of zzso and zzso without affecting body zzso serum zzso profiles or zzso zzso 

zzso suppresses scavenger zzso expression and zzso foam cell formation in zzso and prevents zzso in zzso mice in zzso This suggests zzso is a novel candidate agent that could be highly useful in the prevention and treatment of zzso
