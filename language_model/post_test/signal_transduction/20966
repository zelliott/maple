The type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium release channel is present on the zzso zzso of most cell zzso T zzso which have been made deficient in zzso lack zzso zzso zzso calcium release and exhibit defective signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Harnick, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso We now show that zzso T cells are resistant to zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation, and zzso Resistance to zzso zzso in zzso cells is reversed by zzso raising zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso can be induced in zzso media, indicating that zzso calcium influx is not zzso These findings suggest that zzso calcium release via the zzso is a critical zzso of zzso
