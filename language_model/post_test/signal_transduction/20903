A significant proportion of human zzso express high levels of zzso protein in the absence of an underlying zzso in the zzso Using transformed zzso and zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cell lines as a model, we have examined the mechanisms by which high levels of zzso zzso may be zzso zzso zzso with zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is not associated with a comparable increase in zzso zzso (though the response to zzso zzso is zzso zzso which binds zzso and zzso its zzso activity, is zzso in zzso cells in the absence of gene amplification and in a zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso complex formation in zzso cells by zzso of an zzso to the zzso domain of zzso resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso zzso Since only a small proportion of the zzso in zzso cells was found to be in complex with zzso (the majority of zzso protein being in a zzso zzso this suggests that zzso selectively binds a pool of zzso that would otherwise be active as a zzso zzso of zzso We suggest that, in some types of zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso feedback loop may be sufficient to prevent free, active zzso reaching the level required for growth arrest or zzso making them an ideal target for therapies designed to disrupt zzso zzso
