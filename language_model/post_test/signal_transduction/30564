zzso is a potent zzso of an zzso sequence from the second type 1 repeat of zzso zzso and the original zzso zzso from which it was zzso zzso are similarly active for zzso vascular outgrowth in a zzso melanoma zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxide signaling by zzso the fatty zzso activity of zzso we examined the ability zzso to zzso fatty acid zzso into vascular cells and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is less active than zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso into both zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso is less potent than zzso for blocking a zzso increase in cell zzso to collagen and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso sufficient to inhibit zzso fatty acid zzso activity zzso with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the activity of NO to delay zzso but again less than zzso In contrast, zzso is more potent than zzso for inducing zzso zzso in vascular zzso Thus, we propose that zzso is a drug with at least two mechanisms of action, and its potent zzso activity may be in part independent of zzso fatty acid zzso zzso
