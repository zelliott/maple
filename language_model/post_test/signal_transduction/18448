The zzso zzso zzso is a novel member of the Ras zzso of zzso which shows highest sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in both human and mouse brain and zzso expression of a zzso active zzso of zzso zzso cellular transformation in zzso zzso To gain further insight into the normal cellular function of zzso we examined the ability of zzso in zzso several known zzso signaling zzso We observed that zzso is a relatively weak zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso On the contrary, both zzso and zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a similar zzso Under similar experimental conditions, zzso significantly zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso which has been extensively implicated in zzso cell survival zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was most likely to be zzso since this zzso event was blocked by the pharmacological zzso zzso and zzso as well as by a dominant negative zzso of zzso More importantly, zzso zzso zzso from cell extracts in a zzso manner, and associated zzso zzso activity was readily zzso in zzso immune zzso The biological significance of zzso in inducing zzso zzso activity is evidenced by the ability of an activated zzso to zzso cell survival in the rat zzso cell line, zzso As expected, this biological activity of zzso was also zzso by the addition of zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel zzso which may play a role in cell survival of zzso zzso
