The migratory route of neural zzso cells zzso has a central role in central nervous system zzso Although the role of the zzso zzso in zzso migration has been zzso the zzso signaling cascade involved remains largely zzso Here we studied the molecular mechanisms that promote zzso zzso migration in response to zzso in zzso and ex zzso zzso was highly dependent on signaling by the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso was activated following zzso stimulation of zzso zzso activity was not necessary for zzso migration in zzso Whereas zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso only zzso participated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso slice cultures showed that zzso blockade impaired zzso exit from the zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments using in zzso zzso nonetheless showed that zzso is zzso for zzso migration of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is activated in zzso in response to zzso and its activity is necessary for immature zzso migration to the cerebral zzso
