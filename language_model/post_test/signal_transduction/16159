When and how newborn zzso are organized to form a functional network in the developing brain remains poorly zzso An attractive model is the zzso hormone zzso zzso system, master regulator of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso a central zzso signaling pathway, by the induced expression of a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso or specific zzso zzso delayed the emergence of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso bulb zzso zzso of zzso signaling also resulted in an abnormal appearance of zzso zzso outside of the zzso bulb region, although it did not change the locations of other zzso zzso zzso zzso or brain zzso This zzso action is zzso zzso because the blockade of zzso signaling in advanced zzso had no such zzso An application of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling deficient zzso whereas the zzso zzso had no effect, suggesting that this zzso action is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso in zzso imaging studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso emerged at the same time as the normal zzso zzso in zzso zzso Further experiments suggest that zzso signaling affects the spatial distribution of newborn zzso zzso by influencing neural crest cell migration and/or zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso regulates the precise zzso and spatial organization of zzso zzso in zzso and provides new insights into the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
