We have recently demonstrated that the decreased ability of hormones, zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso zzso in heart and zzso from spontaneously zzso rats zzso as compared to their zzso zzso control rats zzso was associated with enhanced levels of zzso and not with zzso zzso In the present studies we have investigated the expression of zzso proteins at the zzso level by Northern zzso Total zzso of heart zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected a message of 2-3 and 3-5 zzso respectively, in both zzso and zzso however, the message was significantly enhanced in zzso as compared by zzso On the other hand the zzso probe zzso zzso alpha detected a message of zzso zzso in heart and zzso from both zzso and zzso however, no difference in the levels of zzso alpha zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and not of zzso are zzso in heart and zzso from zzso which may be responsible for the increased levels of zzso as shown earlier by zzso zzso It may be suggested that the enhanced vascular tone and impaired cardiac zzso in hypertension may partly be the consequences of increased levels of zzso in heart and zzso
