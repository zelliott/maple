zzso zzso molecules are used by several zzso to zzso various zzso including zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso Certain food zzso including ground beef zzso possess compounds capable of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we identified and characterized these zzso zzso from ground beef extract using zzso zzso extraction and gas zzso Gas zzso analysis revealed the presence of several fatty acids such as zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso that were capable of zzso zzso zzso These fatty acids were tested zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso at different zzso zzso 5, and 10 zzso to identify differences in the level of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso ranged from 25 to zzso A mixture of these fatty acids zzso at zzso equivalent to those present in the ground beef zzso produced 52 to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The fatty acid mixture also zzso influenced zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso These results demonstrate that both zzso and zzso fatty acids in ground beef have the ability to interfere with zzso cell zzso
