In response to viral infection, zzso zzso zzso bind to viral zzso and activate the zzso protein zzso which in turn activates the zzso factors zzso and zzso to induce type I zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso chains and that this binding is important for zzso zzso however, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso is not zzso Here, we show that viral infection zzso the formation of very large zzso zzso which zzso activate zzso in the zzso We find that a fraction of zzso zzso protein forms zzso that are capable of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso behave like zzso and effectively convert zzso zzso into functional zzso We also show that, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso on the zzso membrane to zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso zzso switch of zzso activates and zzso the zzso signaling zzso
