High expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is found in a variety of solid tumors, including zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a rational target for zzso zzso zzso the yellow zzso of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and zzso We recently reported that zzso inhibited the growth of human colon zzso zzso cells by suppressing gene expression of zzso and zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of gene expression of zzso in colon cancer zzso The zzso of the zzso effect of zzso on gene expression of zzso was verified in other human colon zzso cell lines, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso identified a binding site for the zzso factor early growth zzso zzso in zzso promoter as a putative zzso response element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso significantly reduced the zzso activity of the zzso factor zzso to the zzso response zzso In addition, zzso reduced the zzso activity of zzso by suppressing zzso gene zzso which required interruption of the zzso signal zzso and reduction of the level of zzso of zzso and its zzso Taken together, our results demonstrated that zzso inhibited human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of zzso through reducing the zzso activity of zzso These results provided novel insights into the mechanisms of zzso zzso of colon cancer cell growth and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of colon zzso
