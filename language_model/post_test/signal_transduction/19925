J proteins are a diverse family of zzso that cooperate with heat shock protein 70 zzso to coordinate protein quality control, especially in response to cellular zzso Current models suggest that individual J proteins might play roles in recruiting zzso to specific functions, such as maintaining cell wall integrity or promoting zzso zzso However, relatively few stresses have been used to test this model and, as a result, only a few specific activities have been zzso To expand our understanding of the J protein network, we used a synthetic lethal approach in which 11 zzso zzso deletion strains were treated with 12 zzso chemical zzso The results defined new roles for specific J proteins in major signaling zzso For example, an important role for zzso in cell wall integrity was identified and activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso More generally, these findings support a model in which some J zzso such as zzso and zzso play zzso roles, while others, such as zzso and zzso are zzso having roles in relatively few zzso Together, these results provide new insight into the network of J zzso
