In zzso growth hormone zzso is under a dual zzso control exerted by growth zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso We investigated zzso release in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso primary culture of dispersed zzso zzso zzso released zzso for up to 12 days in culture, indicating that zzso zzso do not require releasing hormone for their zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso release up to a zzso zzso effect of zzso None of the potential zzso tested induced any change in zzso zzso zzso Also, neither zzso an zzso of zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, were able to modify zzso release, suggesting that spontaneous zzso release already represents the zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were able to increase zzso release in the presence of zzso In this condition zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release, whereas none of the other zzso tested zzso sea zzso or salmon or chicken II zzso zzso zzso had any significant zzso These data indicate that zzso control by zzso may be the basic control of zzso production in zzso and lower zzso while zzso may represent the ancestral growth zzso factor in zzso a role taken over in higher zzso by zzso
