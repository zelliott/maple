zzso Numerous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso protects adult rats from zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests compromised zzso by zzso in aged zzso The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that zzso protects against zzso injury in aged hearts, potentially through a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hearts from adult zzso zzso or aged zzso zzso zzso rats were subjected in zzso to 30 zzso zzso followed by 3 h zzso zzso zzso (four cycles of 10 s zzso s zzso was applied at the beginning of zzso either alone or in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso size and the zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso size in both adult and aged rat zzso This protection was accompanied by a significant increase in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the zzso effect of zzso in adult and aged zzso In addition, zzso significantly attenuated plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso in both adult and aged zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso at the onset of zzso reduces zzso zzso size in both adult and aged rat hearts, potentially through a zzso zzso and zzso zzso
