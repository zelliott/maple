zzso zzso has been studied in zzso dog kidney cortical zzso At pH 9, using zzso as zzso zzso most of the zzso groups appeared incorporated into zzso the activity showing an apparent zzso of 16 zzso This zzso activity was unchanged by the presence of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso zzso was also unchanged after treatment of intact zzso with zzso II, zzso hormone or zzso An increased zzso synthesis was observed in the remnant kidney cortical zzso after zzso through an zzso of zzso zzso without zzso modification of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso is not regulated by these zzso or functional stimuli tested in canine zzso cortical zzso
