In normal human zzso cells, zzso dysfunction causes cellular zzso a stable zzso arrest with zzso suppressing zzso Whether zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses cancer growth in humans, however, is zzso Here, we demonstrate that multiple and distinct human cancer precursor zzso but not corresponding zzso zzso are comprised of cells that display hallmarks of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso frequently associated with initiating cancer growth in humans, dramatically affected zzso structure and function by causing zzso replication stress, rapid and zzso zzso attrition, and consequently zzso dysfunction in cells that lack zzso zzso DNA replication stress induced by drugs also resulted in zzso dysfunction and cellular zzso in normal human cells, demonstrating that zzso repeats indeed are hypersensitive to DNA replication zzso Our data reveal that zzso accelerated by zzso DNA replication stress, is a biological response of cells in human cancer precursor zzso and provide strong evidence that zzso is a critical zzso suppressing mechanism in zzso
