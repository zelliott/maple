zzso such as the product of the zzso cluster region, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are zzso zzso proteins zzso for members of the zzso zzso of small zzso proteins zzso proteins or zzso A zzso region, named the zzso cluster zzso zzso domain, is responsible for the GAP zzso We describe here the crystal structure of the zzso domain from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The domain is composed of seven zzso having a previously zzso zzso A core of four zzso contains most zzso that are zzso in the zzso zzso Their packing suggests the location of a zzso binding zzso This structure of a zzso domain for small zzso proteins provides a framework for analyzing the function of this class of zzso
