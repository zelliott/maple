zzso and zzso signaling control zzso behavior, energy balance, and zzso zzso but only zzso signaling defects cause zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso do not express zzso zzso zzso influences zzso zzso activity via regulation of immediate downstream zzso including the zzso zzso Y and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso signaling in female zzso mice through zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso 4 zzso restores the timing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso 4 zzso zzso increases action potential firing and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso providing further evidence that zzso signaling influences zzso zzso zzso These studies thus establish zzso signaling as an important component in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity, initiation of zzso and zzso
