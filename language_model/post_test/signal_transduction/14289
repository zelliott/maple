The fruit fly zzso zzso is an excellent model system for studies of genes controlling development and zzso However, its zzso to zzso systems is less clear because of zzso differences between insects and zzso zzso signaling has been studied in zzso because of relevance to diabetes and other diseases but there are many parallels between zzso and insect zzso For example, deletion of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso flies with elevated circulating sugar zzso Whether this situation reflects failure of sugar zzso into peripheral zzso as seen in zzso is unclear and depends upon whether flies harbor the machinery to mount zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso Here we asked whether zzso fat cells are competent to respond to insulin with zzso regulated trafficking of sugar zzso zzso zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso the sugar zzso expressed primarily in zzso zzso were zzso After expression in fat bodies, zzso zzso trafficking and zzso were monitored by zzso and total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso We found that fat body cells responded to insulin with increased zzso trafficking and zzso to the plasma zzso While the zzso of these responses was relatively weak in animals reared on a standard diet, it was greatly enhanced in animals reared on zzso zzso suggesting that flies fed standard diets are insulin zzso Our findings demonstrate that flies are competent to mobilize zzso of sugar zzso to the cell surface in response to zzso They suggest that zzso fat cells are primed for a response to insulin and that these pathways are zzso when animals are exposed to constant, high levels of zzso Finally, these studies are the first to use zzso to monitor zzso pathways in zzso demonstrating the utility of zzso of zzso sugar zzso to monitor signaling pathways in zzso
