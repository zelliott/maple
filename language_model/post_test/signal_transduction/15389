zzso zzso zzso is the third leading cause of adult heart disease and the most common form of acquired zzso disease in developed zzso However, the molecular pathways leading to zzso are poorly zzso We reported two families in which zzso zzso in zzso caused zzso zzso valve and severe zzso valve zzso zzso is part of a highly zzso signaling zzso involved in cell fate decisions, cell zzso and cardiac valve zzso In this study, we examined the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso valve zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had greater than fivefold more zzso valve zzso than zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in cultured sheep zzso valve zzso cells zzso also increased zzso more than fivefold and resulted in gene expression typical of zzso We found that zzso normally zzso the gene zzso bone zzso protein 2 zzso in zzso zzso valves in zzso and in zzso valve cells in zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked the zzso induced by zzso zzso in zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling in zzso valve cells zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso by zzso
