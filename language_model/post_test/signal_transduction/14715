To define the role of the zzso zzso zzso in nervous system development, we zzso targeted zzso and zzso two of the three known zzso zzso zzso using a mouse line expressing zzso zzso driven by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso markedly attenuated baseline zzso of zzso in neural zzso and led to growth zzso zzso elimination of zzso in zzso root zzso zzso zzso did not interfere with survival, but instead caused marked reduction in expression of the zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso at zzso zzso associated with a profound reduction in levels of zzso factor zzso zzso of both zzso of zzso which encodes zzso and one zzso of zzso which encodes zzso affected zzso zzso maturation as well as zzso zzso projection toward the zzso horn in the spinal zzso Finally, conditional elimination of all zzso and zzso zzso strongly reduced zzso zzso growth in zzso as well as zzso zzso terminal zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso function is crucial for several aspects of zzso zzso development, including differentiation and zzso zzso
