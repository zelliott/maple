Over the last decade, many of the molecular components that mediate the zzso of taste signaling have been zzso The zzso receptors for taste have been identified as G zzso receptors zzso and zzso channels that are expressed on the surface of highly specialized taste sensory zzso zzso molecules act as zzso binding to and stabilizing active zzso of zzso resulting in the initiation of signal zzso zzso Taste zzso therefore, should be amenable to the methods of zzso This review focuses on the zzso signaling of bitter, sweet, and zzso tastes and emphasizes the opportunities for zzso zzso
