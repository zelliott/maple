zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso and can cause DNA damage and gene zzso zzso and long-term treatment with zzso has been linked with zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in DNA base zzso repair zzso When it is zzso or zzso in cells, DNA zzso can cause genetic zzso zzso DNA zzso has also been reported in several human zzso Here, we report that zzso at 2, 10, 20 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso In the process, protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso are zzso zzso also increased zzso binding to the zzso response element zzso consensus zzso which is present in the DNA zzso gene zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was able to block zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding activity and decrease DNA zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso can zzso DNA zzso expression through the zzso signal zzso zzso
