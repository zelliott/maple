zzso zzso is one of the most common complications of diabetes, one hallmark of which is tactile zzso zzso hypersensitivity to innocuous zzso The underlying mechanisms of tactile zzso are, however, poorly zzso Emerging evidence indicates that, following nerve injury, activated zzso in the spinal zzso play a crucial role in tactile zzso However, it remains unknown whether spinal zzso are activated under diabetic conditions and whether they contribute to zzso tactile zzso In the present study, using zzso zzso diabetic rats that displayed tactile zzso we found several zzso changes of activated zzso in the zzso zzso These included increases in zzso and zzso labeling zzso of zzso zzso zzso the thickness and the zzso of zzso and in the number of activated zzso zzso Furthermore, in the zzso horn of zzso diabetic rats, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and an upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which are implicated in zzso functions, were activated exclusively in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso horn by zzso administration of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso produced a striking zzso of existing, long-term tactile zzso of diabetic zzso We also found that a single administration of zzso reduced the expression of zzso Together, these results suggest that activated zzso horn zzso may be a crucial component of zzso tactile zzso zzso in part, by the zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso horn may represent a therapeutic strategy for treating diabetic tactile zzso
