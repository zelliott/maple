The zzso zzso channel zzso mediates cellular signaling processes associated with dysfunction of zzso However, the role of zzso in diabetic zzso is zzso We sought to assess whether zzso mediates the development of zzso zzso in two animal models of diabetic zzso zzso and zzso mice, and zzso zzso mice, had diabetes induced with zzso and then were treated zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso ratio significantly decreased in diabetic zzso mice compared with diabetic zzso mice and in diabetic zzso mice treated with zzso compared with diabetic zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso and type III and IV collagen significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso in zzso of diabetic zzso mice compared with diabetic zzso zzso Similarly, zzso reduced the expression of the inflammatory and zzso markers described above in diabetic zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking the zzso channel in both animal models led to a reduction of transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso type II zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso mediates zzso zzso in diabetic zzso through the zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso may be a novel target for therapeutic intervention in patients with diabetic zzso
