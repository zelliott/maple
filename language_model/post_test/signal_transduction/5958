A binding pocket for zzso hormone zzso within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso type 1 zzso has been identified based on experimental evidence and computer zzso To determine the binding site for a competitive inverse zzso zzso three of the four zzso that directly contact zzso and other zzso that restrain zzso in an inactive zzso were screened by zzso and binding zzso We found that two zzso that directly contact zzso zzso in zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 7 zzso were important for zzso binding but another, zzso in zzso zzso 6 zzso was zzso A highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 6 zzso which was reported to be critical in stabilizing zzso in an inactive state but not for zzso zzso was critical for zzso zzso We used our previous model of the unoccupied zzso to generate a model of the zzso zzso The experimental results and the molecular model of the complex suggest that zzso binds to zzso within a zzso zzso pocket that partially zzso the zzso binding zzso This result is consistent with the competitive antagonism of zzso zzso We suggest that the mechanism of inverse zzso zzso by zzso involves its direct interaction with zzso which contributes to the stabilization of the inactive zzso of zzso
