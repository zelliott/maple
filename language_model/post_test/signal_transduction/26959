We have isolated seven proteins from earthworm preparations that are zzso to zzso zzso Three of these proteins have been zzso to zzso two from zzso earthworm wash zzso and one from electric zzso earthworm zzso zzso One of the two highly zzso proteins from zzso has a relative molecular mass of 20 zzso and contains free zzso groups that appear to play a functional role in its zzso The other zzso protein from zzso has a molecular mass of 3 zzso zzso molecular weight zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso is a zzso having a minimum molecular mass of zzso zzso calculated from its zzso acid and zzso zzso It consists of a single zzso zzso The sequence of terminal 15 zzso acid zzso from its zzso zzso terminal has been zzso It binds specifically to the zzso of zzso sensory zzso in a zzso and zzso fashion with a zzso value of about zzso zzso and zzso value of zzso zzso of zzso This protein causes an increase in firing rate of individual zzso in the accessory zzso bulb of zzso zzso the projection site for zzso zzso All the isolated zzso proteins from both earthworm preparations can be divided zzso into three groups: zzso those closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso those closely related to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso those unrelated to either zzso or the zzso zzso
