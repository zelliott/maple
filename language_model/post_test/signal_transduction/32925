zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso pathways zzso by zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the outer zzso collecting duct zzso and zzso thick ascending limb zzso zzso from the rat zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso of zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso inhibited by about 50% a same pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content through a same process insensitive to zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The concentration zzso zzso zzso was of about 50 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso inhibited by about zzso a same pool of zzso zzso zzso content through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso decreased by about 50% zzso zzso zzso synthesis by a process sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso induced the same level of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and zzso cells of the zzso or through a zzso increase of zzso zzso concentration in zzso cells of the zzso
