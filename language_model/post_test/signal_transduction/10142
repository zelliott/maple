Many zzso factors in zzso bacteria are zzso anchored to the zzso zzso by zzso zzso a group of widely distributed zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso A protein zzso is the zzso member of the zzso family and is activated by zzso an adaptation that may facilitate host colonization as elevated zzso of this zzso are encountered in human zzso Here we show that a single zzso zzso bound to an ordered pocket on zzso zzso activates zzso by modulating both the structure and dynamics of a large active site zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso indicate that zzso may facilitate the zzso recognition of the zzso by inducing slow zzso to zzso zzso dynamics in the active zzso Interestingly, relaxation compensated zzso experiments suggest that the time scale of these motions is directly correlated with zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso indicate that this zzso zzso is zzso by the side chain of zzso which is positioned within the zzso loop and shown to contribute to zzso zzso The available structural and dynamics data are compatible with a loop closure model of zzso zzso in which the zzso loop fluctuates between a binding competent closed form that is stabilized by zzso and an open, highly flexible state that removes key zzso zzso zzso from the active zzso
