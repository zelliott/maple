The identification of zzso factors that can selectively stimulate the generation of insulin producing zzso from stem and/or zzso cells represent a significant step in the development of stem zzso zzso replacement zzso By zzso the molecular mechanisms that regulate the generation of zzso during normal pancreatic development such putative factors may be zzso In the zzso zzso increase markedly in numbers from embryonic day zzso zzso and zzso but the zzso zzso that promotes the selective generation of zzso at these stages remains to be zzso Here we show that the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in developing mouse and human zzso at stages when zzso are zzso We also provide evidence that zzso zzso the generation of zzso zzso zzso cells and stimulates their further differentiation into zzso by zzso a program of cell differentiation that zzso the normal zzso program of zzso zzso
