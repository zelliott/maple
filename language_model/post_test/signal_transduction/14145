The zzso zzso zzso is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors acts at the downstream end of the zzso to mediate zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms are important for the output of zzso zzso Daz interacting protein 1 zzso has zzso positive and negative functions in the zzso zzso The positive zzso regulatory function appears to be attributed to a requirement for zzso during zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso however, remains largely zzso We recently found that zzso is required for zzso zzso which may account for its zzso function in zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso regulates zzso turnover by preventing degradation of zzso zzso protein zzso a protein that promotes zzso turnover of zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso regulates the stability of zzso independent of its function in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to levels insufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso leading to zzso that resemble zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was able to restore proper zzso protein turnover and rescue zzso in zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and increased the level of zzso Thus, zzso stabilization of zzso is zzso zzso and essential for proper regulation of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso
