zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is a type II zzso zzso displaying expression in a broad range of zzso and exhibiting a high grade of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Interest in TRAIL grew after evidence emerged, that induction of zzso signaling destroyed zzso cells while sparing normal zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is characterized by initial zzso recruitment and the subsequent zzso of zzso Besides promoting zzso stimulation of the TRAIL receptors may also activate survival signals via the zzso factor zzso Moreover, evaluation of the zzso roles of zzso signaling pathways provides evidence for a regulatory function within the immune zzso Thus a complex picture of zzso signaling zzso zzso the necessity to define its modes of action while assessing its therapeutic zzso This review outlines the current knowledge on the zzso role of TRAIL and discusses its therapeutic potential with particular focus on zzso of the zzso zzso
