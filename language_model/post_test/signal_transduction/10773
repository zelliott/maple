zzso zzso is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independent of other risk zzso zzso overload zzso the development of left zzso zzso zzso and left zzso enlargement zzso in the zzso zzso To systematically investigate the zzso changes, which mediate these zzso we have performed a zzso zzso profiling of each of the four heart chambers from mice subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso A major new finding of this analysis is that during enlargement the left atrium zzso radical changes in gene zzso that may play a significant role in zzso zzso changes in the LA and zzso are correlated with significant changes in the zzso profile of these chambers, with thousands of zzso expressed known and novel zzso zzso analysis of the results identified Gene zzso biological process groups with significant zzso changes, including zzso energy zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso To facilitate future research, a zzso zzso Internet database has been constructed that allows access to the expression data presented zzso Further study of these genes and processes will lead to better understanding of pathways involved in the zzso of the cardiac response to pressure zzso
