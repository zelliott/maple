zzso cells are believed to have a zzso ability to increase zzso metabolism in response to zzso Here we show that the ability of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso is dependent on zzso signal zzso In the absence of growth factor zzso zzso cells fail to express zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso cells do not engage in zzso anabolic synthesis and neither express zzso zzso nor require zzso protein to regulate cell survival in response to zzso However, zzso is zzso for the survival of growth zzso cells, as suppression of zzso results in death when growing cells are exposed to zzso Growth zzso zzso expression zzso the zzso fate of zzso resulting in decreased zzso anabolic synthesis and increased zzso production, an effect that is enhanced when zzso protein is stabilized by zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso contributes to the regulation of growth zzso zzso metabolism even in the absence of zzso
