zzso of zzso zzso factor signaling is one of the hallmarks of zzso zzso Recently, the zzso shuttle was revealed to mediate this zzso signaling linking DNA damage to the zzso of zzso zzso DNA damage is the zzso factor of several zzso zzso zzso such as zzso syndrome and zzso zzso Although the gene defects have been well zzso the molecular mechanisms of premature aging process still need to be zzso Here we review the details of the zzso zzso a zzso sensor linking DNA damage to zzso zzso and present evidence for the hypothesis that DNA damage in zzso syndromes may activate the zzso shuttle and subsequently increase the pressure on the zzso of zzso system evoking a premature aging zzso The zzso shuttle may link zzso stress to the zzso of the innate immunity system and cause premature aging via zzso zzso
