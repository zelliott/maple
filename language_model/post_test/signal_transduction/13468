Growth factors, including nerve growth factor zzso have been hypothesized to play a role in resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of resistance to zzso is primarily thought to be the result of its binding to its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has long been thought merely to facilitate zzso binding to zzso However, we have previously shown that the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso protects zzso cells that do not express zzso against zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso In cells that express both zzso it is not clear what determines which zzso is responsible for the protective effect of zzso We now show that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso with native levels of zzso and a low zzso ratio zzso the zzso effect of zzso requires binding to zzso In contrast, in zzso with native levels of zzso and a high zzso ratio zzso zzso treatment prevents zzso zzso by a mechanism independent of zzso zzso Treatment of low zzso ratio cells with zzso results in zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso treatment of high zzso ratio cells results only in zzso of zzso even though nuclear factor zzso signaling is not inactive and can be initiated by other zzso The ratio of zzso in cells that express both receptors probably contributes to the determination of which of the two known roles of zzso zzso zzso independent or zzso zzso are responsible for zzso protection from zzso zzso
