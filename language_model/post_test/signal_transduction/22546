zzso proteins are critical signal zzso downstream of the receptors of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso On zzso and zzso by the active zzso zzso complex, zzso and zzso form zzso with zzso and zzso into the nucleus, where they interact with different cellular partners, bind to DNA, regulate zzso of various downstream response zzso and zzso with other signaling zzso Here we show that a nuclear zzso zzso can interact directly with zzso zzso and zzso on a zzso promoter element and repress their abilities to activate zzso through recruitment of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and possibly its associated zzso zzso zzso zzso of Ski in a zzso cell line renders it resistant to zzso growth zzso and defective in zzso of zzso zzso This ability to overcome zzso growth arrest may be responsible for the transforming activity of Ski in human and avian cancer zzso Our studies suggest a new paradigm for zzso of the zzso proteins by an zzso through zzso zzso
