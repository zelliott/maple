We sought to investigate the role of zzso zzso on the interaction between pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in an effort to disrupt zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cultures were established from human zzso surgical zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso subcutaneous zzso were developed in the presence and absence of zzso and were subsequently treated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were found to zzso zzso zzso which promoted proliferation via zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso This zzso cascade was effectively inhibited both in zzso and in zzso by specific zzso blockade with zzso with greater degree of zzso zzso when combined with zzso The zzso pancreatic cancer zzso reached significantly greater zzso volume than those zzso lacking zzso and were resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso promote zzso zzso via zzso zzso and overcomes zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso mechanism is best obtained through combined zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso We have identified the zzso axis as an attractive molecular target for the interruption of zzso zzso interactions within the zzso zzso
