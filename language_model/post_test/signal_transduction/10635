zzso features of the persistent zzso zzso cycle, associated with chronic infections in both humans and animals, include the generation of zzso zzso zzso bodies which are distinct from normal zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have correlated these zzso and zzso changes with differential expression of diverse functional zzso of zzso zzso To further investigate these zzso we compared zzso expression of predicted zzso signal zzso genes between normal zzso zzso zzso infections in zzso cells and those treated with gamma zzso zzso by using real-time zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed at least 39 candidate signal zzso zzso of which 30 were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressed signal zzso genes include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso linked to bacterial cellular processes such as cell cycle control and zzso assembly and zzso Other zzso signal zzso genes sharing similarity to bacterial stress response genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The zzso changes observed for the majority of signal zzso genes appear to be unique for zzso pneumoniae, as similar changes were not observed in recent whole zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signal zzso genes play potentially important roles in the establishment and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso likely as part of the zzso response zzso as described for zzso zzso but with considerable differences in the zzso zzso
