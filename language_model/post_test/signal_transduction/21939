zzso that terminate with a consensus sequence known as zzso undergo a series of zzso modifications that include zzso zzso and zzso zzso These modifications render otherwise zzso proteins zzso at their C zzso such that they associate with zzso Whereas zzso occurs in the zzso zzso processing is accomplished on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the numerous zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso are many signaling molecules such as zzso zzso including the Ras proteins that play an important role in zzso In the course of their processing, nascent Ras proteins traffic from their site of synthesis in the zzso to the zzso and then out to the plasma membrane zzso by at least two zzso Recently, retrograde pathways have been discovered that deliver mature Ras from the PM back to the zzso The zzso has been identified as a platform upon which Ras can zzso Thus, the zzso trafficking of Ras proteins has the potential to increase the complexity of Ras signaling by adding a spatial zzso The complexity of Ras trafficking also zzso a wider array of potential targets for the discovery of drugs that might inhibit tumors by interfering with Ras zzso
