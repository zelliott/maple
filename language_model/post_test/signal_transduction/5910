zzso zzso zzso the zzso transfer of the zzso group from zzso to zzso to generate zzso and plays a key role in highly zzso processes such as muscle contraction and zzso zzso however, its role in signal zzso (which frequently involves zzso zzso and zzso zzso decisions remains largely zzso Here we report that zzso zzso B was significantly zzso during the differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso B led to increased zzso level and enhanced zzso of the zzso signaling zzso zzso transgenic expression of zzso zzso B promoted the expression of zzso and zzso proteins and the cell death of zzso signaled zzso In addition, the zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of T cells were also enhanced by the expression of zzso zzso B zzso In contrast, treatment of T cells with specific zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso B zzso resulted in severely impaired T cell zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso B plays an unexpected role in modulating zzso signaling and critically regulates zzso selection and T cell zzso
