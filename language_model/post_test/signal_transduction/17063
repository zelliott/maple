The purpose of this study was to identify the zzso zzso signaling zzso and biological themes involved in the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing zzso was performed on the zzso zzso of rats with the Penn et zzso zzso Res zzso 1994) zzso zzso model of zzso at the height of vascular zzso zzso day zzso 19, and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso pathways with potential relevance to known zzso zzso were evaluated for significant regulation in zzso The three major zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso cell polarity zzso and zzso two signaling pathways zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are, respectively, thought to intersect with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide signaling pathways zzso by two zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso signaling zzso zzso of other biological pathways and themes was detected by gene zzso using the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso and the zzso Database for zzso zzso and Integrated zzso GO terms zzso 

zzso zzso signaling was found to be zzso but the zzso zzso and zzso pathways were zzso zzso oxide zzso as measured by the zzso of zzso and zzso was also zzso as was zzso zzso Biological themes related to protein translation zzso neural zzso inflammation and zzso cell cycle, and cell death were (among others) highly regulated in zzso zzso 

These several genes and pathways identified by zzso might provide novel targets for intervention in zzso
