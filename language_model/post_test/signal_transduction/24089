zzso of zzso of zzso zzso is facilitated by the maturation promoting factor zzso and accompanied by zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso which are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In this study we examined the effects of zzso zzso which zzso the activity of zzso on in zzso maturation of pig zzso zzso complexes zzso were cultured in the presence or absence of the drug zzso zzso for various time zzso To zzso the influence of zzso cells, zzso were first cultured in zzso zzso subsequently zzso and incubated further in zzso zzso supplemented zzso zzso of drug action as tested following zzso zzso treatment of zzso by transferring them to drug-free zzso Culture of zzso in medium supplemented with zzso zzso prevents resumption of nuclear maturation in the majority of zzso This zzso was zzso and accompanied by a zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor to extracts of in zzso matured zzso revealed that the zzso activities were not directly influenced by the zzso suggesting a link between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso medium for 6 h followed by further culture of zzso or zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso for various periods resulted in elevated zzso and zzso zzso activities, indicating an early and transient zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These results support the idea that zzso and zzso are involved in the induction of zzso zzso breakdown in zzso zzso
