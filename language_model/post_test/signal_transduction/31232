Members of the zzso zzso family are associated with several zzso and appear to be providing useful targets for pharmacological zzso for zzso of the lung and zzso Further improvements of these therapies may be guided by a zzso dynamic zzso systems understanding of the complexities of zzso zzso trafficking and zzso for it is these complexities that render difficult zzso how zzso such as drug intervention will affect zzso zzso zzso zzso this goal, we have developed a zzso model implementing commonly accepted principles governing zzso zzso interaction, trafficking, zzso and zzso Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the zzso zzso of zzso Model results applied to experimental data on zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human lung zzso cells support a hypothesis that key zzso activity for these receptors occurs largely in an zzso zzso compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso may define a critical aspect of the zzso zzso response to zzso
