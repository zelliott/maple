A very small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first identified in the brain zzso zzso Further studies found that zzso was expressed in zzso The biological role of pancreatic zzso is still not zzso Growing evidence indicates that zzso expression in the zzso may play a pivotal role for pancreatic development in the early prenatal zzso However, the role of zzso in adult zzso still needs to be zzso zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso cell zzso flow and stimulation of zzso insulin synthesis and release suggest that zzso involved in zzso metabolism may directly act on the zzso cell separate from any effects via the central nervous system zzso zzso zzso animal models have shown that loss of zzso expression causes zzso which cannot be reversed by administration of zzso hormone, suggesting that the absence of zzso itself is the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified in zzso which provides a possibility for zzso zzso and zzso regulation in pancreatic zzso During pancreatic damage in adult zzso zzso may protect beta cell from zzso and initiate its zzso through signal pathways of growth hormone in zzso zzso zzso has recently been discovered to affect a broad array of gene expression in the zzso including growth factor zzso Signal pathways linked between zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso may be an important factor for adult zzso zzso which could involve adult stem cell zzso These effects suggest that zzso may benefit pancreatic zzso cells and diabetic therapy in zzso
