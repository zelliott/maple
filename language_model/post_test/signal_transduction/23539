Plant behaviors across levels of cellular organization, from zzso components to zzso and zzso relate and reflect growth zzso zzso of the relationship between behaviors captured in various zzso characteristics and growth zzso can help reveal molecular mechanisms of plant zzso The aim of this article is to introduce the power of using statistics originally developed in the field of geographic zzso analysis together with prominent network models in zzso principles of biological zzso We provide a critical systematic review of the existing statistical and network-based approaches that can be employed to determine patterns of zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso characteristics in zzso We demonstrate that zzso network-based approaches result in robust insights about zzso zzso These insights can be zzso and tested by applying well-established statistics combining the network structure with the zzso zzso We show that the reviewed network-based approaches are zzso from the level of genes to the study of individuals in a population of zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the patterns of zzso can be generalized to quantifiable biological principles of zzso zzso these network-based approaches facilitate not only interpretation of large-scale data sets, but also prediction of zzso and biological behaviors based on measurable zzso
