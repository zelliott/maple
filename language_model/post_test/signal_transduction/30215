Many aspects of zzso activity are regulated by zzso zzso The zzso of temporally and zzso distinct zzso signals requires the action of zzso proteins including various zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sensor zzso protein family and the related zzso proteins zzso have begun to emerge as key players in zzso zzso Many of these proteins are expressed predominantly or only in zzso sometimes with zzso patterns of zzso Their ability to associate with zzso either zzso or in response to elevated zzso concentration allows the zzso proteins to discriminate between different spatial and zzso patterns of zzso zzso Recent work has established several zzso roles of these zzso including diverse actions on gene zzso zzso channel function, membrane traffic of zzso channels and zzso and the control of zzso
