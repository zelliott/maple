At the end of each zzso insects shed their old zzso by performing the stereotyped behavior of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso this behavior is triggered by the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso into the mechanism of action of zzso have come from the identification of a small network of zzso zzso that shows increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in insects from many different zzso Here we present further evidence that strengthens the association between zzso and the occurrence of this zzso response in zzso We found that the zzso increases occurred at every zzso although some of the zzso that showed a response at zzso zzso did not participate at zzso and adult zzso Both zzso and the zzso increases only required an intact connection with the brain for the first 30 zzso after zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso in zzso animals only occurred if the zzso response had been zzso suggesting that the onset of this response marks the time at which the central nervous system is first able to drive zzso Finally, we found that the appearance of sensitivity to zzso for triggering the zzso response coincided with the time at which zzso first triggers zzso
