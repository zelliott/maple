Cell swelling causes an immediate zzso response in various cell zzso zzso zzso possesses some unique features suggesting the involvement of a specific signal zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso on cell zzso hormone zzso zzso 80 zzso ethanol or zzso zzso zzso from incubated rat zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso cells zzso were zzso To determine how general the effect of cell swelling is on zzso zzso the release of two different zzso zzso releasing hormone zzso and zzso from the same tissue zzso were zzso Both zzso medium or zzso ethanol containing medium induced immediate zzso and zzso release from the tested zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso or zzso showed no zzso of cell swelling induced zzso In contrast to zzso zzso release was not induced by zzso ethanol containing medium from the zzso or zzso zzso 

These data indicate that signal zzso leading to zzso after cell swelling does not involve zzso sensitive stretch activated channels, mercury sensitive zzso or zzso and zzso sensitive zzso including zzso and zzso Cell zzso zzso possesses limited zzso cells specifically involved in water and salt regulation retain their specific response to zzso zzso
