zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that develops in response to zzso on a solid zzso The cells assemble into zzso zzso in which they differentiate from zzso cells into zzso environmentally resistant zzso Previously, we have shown that the induction of zzso is associated with zzso zzso in liquid culture zzso zzso O'Connor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso induced during zzso The specific activity of the zzso begins to increase during zzso before spores are zzso The addition of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso the onset of zzso and zzso in developing populations of zzso In addition, the zzso induction of zzso allows zzso zzso to fruit on media containing zzso of nutrients that are normally too high to support zzso We propose that the induction of zzso is an integral step in the development of zzso zzso and that this induction is likely to play a role in zzso and in the restructuring of zzso which occurs during the differentiation of zzso In support of this hypothesis, we show that zzso induction of zzso can rescue zzso and zzso of certain zzso zzso body spores from a rescued zzso are indistinguishable from zzso zzso body spores when examined by transmission electron zzso These results show that the signal zzso zzso leading to the induction of zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
