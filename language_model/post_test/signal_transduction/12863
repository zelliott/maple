Cell proliferation and patterning must be coordinated for the development of properly zzso zzso If the same molecules were to control both zzso such coordination would be zzso Here we address this possibility in the zzso wing using the zzso signaling zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso forms a zzso along the zzso axis that patterns the wing, that zzso receptors are autonomously required for wing cell zzso and that zzso expression of either zzso or an activated zzso zzso zzso causes zzso We extend these findings with a detailed analysis of the effects of zzso signaling on wing cell growth and zzso zzso zzso signaling by expressing zzso accelerated wing cell growth and cell cycle progression in a coordinate and zzso zzso zzso autonomously zzso zzso signaling using a zzso specific zzso Dad, or a zzso in zzso slowed wing cell growth and division, also in a coordinate zzso zzso of cell cycle progression by zzso was blocked by the cell cycle inhibitor zzso and required normal activity of the growth zzso zzso Among the known zzso targets, vestigial was the only one tested that was required for zzso zzso The growth response to altering zzso signaling varied regionally and temporally in the wing disc, indicating that other patterned factors modify the zzso
