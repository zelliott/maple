zzso pancreatic cells develop from zzso that zzso and differentiate into zzso and zzso zzso This development is thought to be controlled by zzso soluble factors acting on their target cells after binding to membrane zzso Here, we analyzed the impact on embryonic pancreatic development of zzso that bind to protein zzso receptors and increase zzso zzso We found that embryonic pancreatic zzso cells were sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These factors generate signals after binding to the zzso zzso which is expressed by immature pancreatic zzso cells between embryonic days 12 and zzso Finally, in zzso zzso exposure increased the survival and proliferation of immature pancreatic cells, leading to an increase in the number of zzso cells that will zzso
