zzso zinc promotes cell proliferation and its zzso leads to impairment of this process, which is particularly important in zzso zzso We have recently characterized a zzso zzso zzso linking zzso zinc to zzso release of zzso In the present study, we addressed the role of zzso zzso acting via the zzso in regulating the zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange in zzso We demonstrate that zzso release, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is highly zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso is followed by approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso is a principal link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Application of both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso largely inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso significance of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was addressed by monitoring zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and in native colon zzso zzso of the cells with zinc was followed by robust zzso of zzso exchange, which was eliminated by zzso zzso zzso indicating that zinc enhances the activity of zzso zzso of zzso by zinc was totally blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, stimulates zzso by a distinct zzso that is not affected by zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity eliminates the zzso zzso but not the prolonged zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is specifically zzso by the zzso Our results support a role for zzso zzso acting through the zzso in regulating multiple signaling pathways that affect pH zzso in zzso zzso zzso of both, zzso and zzso by zzso zinc may provide the mechanism linking zinc to enhanced cell zzso
