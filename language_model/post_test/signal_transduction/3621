zzso zzso and the zzso are responsible for maintaining zzso in peripheral zzso zzso zzso cells form the zzso barrier zzso The molecular pathways responsible for zzso zzso barrier formation in humans are not fully zzso We tested the effect of different zzso on the zzso electrical resistance zzso of zzso primary human zzso zzso cell zzso cultures following serum withdrawal zzso diffuse zzso zzso in zzso We show that zzso zzso factor zzso 1 zzso sufficiently induced a zzso zzso recovery in zzso over zzso conditions 48 h after serum zzso zzso zzso to high molecular weight zzso was reduced by zzso following zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso was dependent on zzso zzso signaling pathways and mildly enhanced by zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso of multiple redundant zzso There was no significant increase in zzso or tight junction proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso zzso induced a small increase in total zzso protein expression without significant increase in zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso following serum zzso zzso zzso revealed membrane relocation of zzso zzso zzso filaments in zzso following zzso treatment, resulting in more continuous zzso contacts that formed zzso and tight zzso Together, these results demonstrate a sufficient role for zzso in human zzso recovery following serum withdrawal in zzso facilitated primarily by zzso cell zzso zzso These observations provide insights into the regulation of human zzso function during recovery from peripheral nerve zzso
