Type 2 zzso zzso zzso activates T4 by zzso to zzso a process being the source of most zzso present in the zzso In the zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene is zzso activated by administration of bacterial zzso zzso which in turn mediates the modifications in zzso zzso typically observed in patients with zzso illness zzso Here we show that zzso zzso expression is also observed in human zzso cells that zzso express zzso Exposure to zzso rapidly doubled zzso activity by a mechanism that was partially blocked by the nuclear zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Next, the human zzso zzso region promoter zzso was used in zzso cells and the zzso B responsiveness mapped to the 3' approximately zzso region of zzso zzso region, with an approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the strongest zzso binding sites at the positions zzso zzso (called zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso to the zzso starting zzso Despite the very similar zzso B binding affinity of these two sites, zzso zzso and promoter zzso indicated that only site zzso 5 possessed zzso potency in the presence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Other zzso zzso such as signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso or signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso did not induce zzso of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that inflammatory signals regulate zzso expression predominantly via the zzso B zzso in a direct zzso manner and could contribute to the changes in zzso economy observed in zzso illness syndrome during zzso
