The mechanisms of G protein zzso to G zzso receptors zzso share general characteristics but may exhibit specific interactions unique for each zzso protein zzso The extreme C zzso zzso of G protein zzso has been shown to be important for association with zzso zzso that the extreme CT of zzso is an essential component of the molecular landscape of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a model cell system was created for the expression and manipulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells that lack zzso zzso On the basis of studies involving zzso zzso and chain extensions of zzso the CT was found to be necessary for zzso and zzso zzso Some general similarities were found for the responses of the two zzso but significant differences were also zzso zzso modeling was performed with a combination of comparative zzso molecular dynamics simulations, and rigid body zzso The resulting models, focused on the zzso CT, are supported by the experimental observations and are characterized by the interaction of the four extreme CT zzso acid zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 3, (including R of the zzso zzso zzso 6, and zzso loop zzso This portion of zzso recognizes the same regions of the two zzso although with differences in the details of selected zzso The predicted longer zzso extensions of zzso 5 and 6 of zzso are expected to contribute significantly to differences in zzso recognition by the two zzso
