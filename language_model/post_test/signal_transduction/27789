zzso information is an important zzso in the establishment of cellular identity in zzso It is established during pattern formation and is maintained in growing zzso zzso maintain the ability to respond to changes in zzso information during development indicating that the mechanism for zzso such information must remain intact until relatively late in zzso Once zzso cues are perceived they set in motion a number of zzso resulting in the differentiation of particular cell types in defined zzso The zzso underpinning these later events is being teased out using zzso Evidence is emerging for the existence of an array of both positive and negative genetic regulators from studies in a number of diverse plant model systems
