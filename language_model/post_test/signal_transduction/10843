zzso sclerosis is a complex disease zzso itself by zzso of skin and other internal zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and cultured in zzso are characterized by increased synthesis of collagen and other zzso zzso zzso consistent with the disease zzso zzso systemic sclerosis zzso therefore serve as a principal experimental model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in collagen overproduction in this zzso This review will discuss recent findings related to zzso signal zzso pathways implicated in zzso zzso zzso deposition by systemic sclerosis zzso 

Recent findings suggest that zzso elevated synthesis of zzso zzso by cultured systemic sclerosis zzso is, at least in part, due to the zzso zzso of the zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso signaling may result from the elevated levels of transforming growth zzso zzso type I and/or inappropriate zzso of zzso These zzso of the transforming growth zzso signaling in systemic sclerosis zzso may facilitate increased collagen production in zzso even under conditions of low zzso zzso However, there exist many inconsistencies among published reports regarding the detailed mechanisms of this zzso in systemic sclerosis zzso and additional studies in this area are zzso Other signaling molecules implicated in zzso zzso include several members of the protein zzso C family, zzso target of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, and zzso These signaling pathways may work in conjunction with transforming growth zzso signaling to regulate the behavior of systemic sclerosis zzso 

zzso in multiple signaling pathways contribute to elevated zzso zzso synthesis by systemic sclerosis zzso zzso understanding of the key signaling molecules may provide a novel avenue for therapeutic zzso
