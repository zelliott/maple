Many zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso are recognized as zzso by the quality control apparatus at the zzso zzso zzso and are targeted for zzso The mechanism zzso nascent chains are distinguished as either competent or incompetent for zzso export has not been zzso Here we show that zzso chains display multiple zzso zzso sequences like the one recently identified in zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to zzso four of these motifs simultaneously causes delta zzso zzso present in approximately zzso of zzso patients, to escape zzso quality control and function at the cell zzso zzso with recognition of these signals may be helpful in the management of zzso
