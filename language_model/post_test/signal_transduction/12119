Given its zzso activity to generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso C zzso is implicated in promoting cell zzso However, we found that zzso mice develop zzso disease, lymphoma, and other zzso The zzso mice have increased numbers of zzso stem cells with increased zzso survival, and zzso zzso These properties are dependent on zzso and can be antagonized by the protein zzso zzso zzso cooperative transformation by active zzso and zzso zzso was suggested in mouse zzso in zzso and in zzso mice and human zzso zzso zzso The same mechanism for zzso transformation seems to be operative in other human zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is likely a tumor zzso
