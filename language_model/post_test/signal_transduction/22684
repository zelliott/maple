These experiments were designed to assess the role of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso cascade in behavioral zzso to zzso The first experiments evaluated the effect of three daily zzso zzso area zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso on the zzso effects of a subsequent challenge injection of cocaine in zzso zzso indicated that, although zzso did not influence behavior across the three zzso days, animals displayed a zzso behavioral response to the subsequent cocaine challenge zzso In contrast, zzso zzso resulted in a progressive increase in behavioral activity but did not influence the subsequent behavioral response to zzso A second series of experiments assessed the effect of zzso the zzso zzso signal zzso cascade on the initiation of behavioral zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or its vehicle, was zzso into the zzso before three daily cocaine zzso Although zzso did not influence the acute behavioral response to cocaine, it blocked zzso Finally, the effects of acute and repeated cocaine injections on zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso indicated that an acute cocaine injection resulted in a transient increase in zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso contributes to the initiation of behavioral zzso to cocaine by zzso the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The present data also indicate that zzso itself produced a progressive zzso in behavioral zzso with repeated zzso
