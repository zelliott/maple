The relative contribution of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso two key signal zzso systems in the normal and diseased liver, to fate decisions of adult zzso zzso cells zzso has not been zzso Here, we developed a robust culture system that permitted expansion and genetic manipulation of cells capable of zzso differentiation in zzso and in zzso to examine the individual roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell fate zzso By employing zzso and rescue experiments in zzso we showed that both receptors collaborate to increase the zzso of zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a strong zzso of zzso differentiation by zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively induced zzso to promote zzso zzso and branching zzso while zzso suppressing zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike the deleterious effects of zzso zzso the zzso conditional loss of zzso facilitated rather than suppressed zzso liver zzso by switching zzso cell differentiation toward zzso zzso These data provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating the zzso properties of adult zzso and reveal a previously zzso link between zzso and zzso in directing zzso zzso
