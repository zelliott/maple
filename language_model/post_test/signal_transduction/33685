Several models zzso detectors and a flux zzso for coding of odor intensity in zzso sensory zzso are zzso zzso of the system is described by different zzso processes of binding the zzso molecules to the receptors and their zzso zzso how well the zzso concentration can be estimated from the knowledge of response, the number of activated zzso are zzso The approach is based on the Fisher information and analogous zzso These measures of zzso are zzso and applied to locate the zzso concentration which is most suitable for zzso The results are compared with the classical deterministic approach which judges the optimal zzso concentration via zzso of the zzso zzso
