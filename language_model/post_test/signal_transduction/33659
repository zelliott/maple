To compare zzso and zzso class zzso zzso zzso survival signaling in normal zzso and retinal zzso cells zzso 

zzso rat zzso and zzso cells were used for zzso zzso and zzso studies to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine zzso and zzso class zzso zzso zzso survival zzso in comparison with insulin or IGF-1 zzso Furthermore, zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess the zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso as a function of serum zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso was observed in rat retinal zzso cells and in the zzso layer and blood vessels, zzso In addition, zzso and zzso protein expression was observed in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso cells exhibited a similar pattern of zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso activity, which was zzso in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso cells showed zzso zzso zzso that induced the zzso regulatory zzso to activate zzso class zzso zzso zzso which in turn enhanced zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso to zzso zzso as revealed by zzso and zzso zzso 

The present findings provide direct evidence of two distinct modes of retinal class zzso zzso zzso zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso axis may provide new therapeutic approaches to zzso cell death in diabetic zzso and other retinal zzso
