zzso zzso zzso is a selective, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been previously characterized as a competitive zzso zzso zzso that has a long duration of activity in zzso It is active in two zzso models of anxiety and has an improved zzso profile compared with zzso In this study, we further characterized the pharmacological properties of zzso zzso by measuring its effects on each of multiple responses coupled to the zzso zzso In Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso was an inverse zzso for the zzso zzso response, for zzso zzso zzso for reduction of zzso zzso and for enhancement of zzso release in the rat nucleus zzso with relative zzso of zzso 1, 1, and zzso zzso However, for the zzso C zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso behaved as an zzso Although zzso zzso was previously characterized as a competitive zzso for the zzso response, the magnitude of the zzso shift of the zzso zzso curve was zzso and the zzso zzso response to zzso was zzso probably as a result of the slow zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso times slower than zzso a zzso zzso zzso inverse zzso Taken together, these data show that the pharmacological characteristics of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso differ depending upon the response measured, and they support the hypothesis that different drugs, acting at the same zzso zzso can zzso regulate multiple cellular signaling zzso
