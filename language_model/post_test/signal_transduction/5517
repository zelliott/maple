The cell cycle needs to strictly coordinate with zzso processes to ensure correct generation of the body plan and different zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the coordination remains largely zzso In this study, we investigate how the cell cycle coordinates zzso cell movements in zzso We present a system to zzso the cell cycle in early zzso zzso by manipulating the zzso zzso zzso of the cell cycle change the zzso level during zzso which zzso with the nuclear level of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso promoter region on the zzso and directly activates zzso an important factor controlling cell zzso which is the initial step of zzso cell movements during zzso In effect, the cell cycle coordinates the zzso of zzso cells through the zzso of zzso Our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which zzso and zzso coordinate the cell cycle through zzso
