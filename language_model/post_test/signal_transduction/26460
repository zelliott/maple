Early brain patterning depends on proper arrangement of zzso zzso This information is given by zzso of zzso signaling molecules zzso detected by individual cells within the responding zzso leading to specific fate zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso exerts initially a differential signal activity along the zzso mouse neural zzso We demonstrate that this polarizing activity codes by zzso zzso signaling and depends on the topographical location of the secondary zzso the zzso organizer zzso and the anterior neural zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso a negative zzso of zzso pathway, is important for regulating zzso zzso signal activity by controlling zzso signaling pathways and zzso information during early brain zzso
