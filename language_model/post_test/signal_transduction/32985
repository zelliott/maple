The zzso (target of zzso signal zzso zzso is an important mechanism by which cell growth is controlled in all zzso zzso Specifically, zzso signaling adjusts the protein zzso capacity of cells according to zzso zzso In zzso cells, one branch of this zzso controls general zzso zzso whereas a separate branch specifically regulates the translation of zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso similarly regulates general zzso zzso but its specific role in the synthesis of zzso components is not well zzso Here we demonstrate that in zzso control of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is surprisingly zzso In addition to general effects on zzso zzso zzso exerts drastic control over zzso gene zzso as well as the synthesis and subsequent processing of zzso precursor zzso We also find that zzso signaling is a prerequisite for the induction of zzso gene zzso that occurs in response to improved zzso zzso This induction has been shown previously to involve both the zzso zzso as well as the zzso growth zzso zzso and our results therefore suggest that these three pathways may be intimately zzso
