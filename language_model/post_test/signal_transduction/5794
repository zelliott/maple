The zzso protein of zzso zzso is required for efficient spore zzso in zzso and for zzso in the alternative zzso combination of zzso acids plus zzso Only zzso via zzso receptors is affected in the zzso The zzso protein is predicted to be a zzso that is produced in the zzso compartment of the zzso zzso Using zzso raised against the zzso zzso Western blots of proteins from spore zzso revealed that, as might be expected, the protein was detected in the inner membrane of spores, but it was also present at a high level in spore zzso zzso coat, zzso and germ cell wall zzso and to some extent in the soluble zzso It is likely that the zzso protein in the outer layers of dormant spores is located in the germ cell wall, as it was detected in zzso spores, and in the cell wall fraction of cells that were zzso from zzso Which of the multiple locations of zzso is important for its function is not known, but the inner membrane association would be appropriate for any interaction with zzso zzso proteins or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso site of the predicted zzso signal sequence of zzso resulted in zzso spores that lacked the zzso protein zzso
