zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso are involved in T cell zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a key role in establishing negative feedback zzso of T cell zzso These structurally related adapter molecules contain a zzso zzso zzso domain generally acting as a zzso zzso We show that the presence of this zzso domain is necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso proteins and their negative functions in T zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso bind in zzso to the rare zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso production in T cells upon zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso increase regulates zzso zzso zzso in zzso Together, our data identify a novel zzso zzso in T cell signaling and suggest that zzso interactions regulate T cell zzso
