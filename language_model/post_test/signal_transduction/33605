A zzso model was developed and used to explore dynamics of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso depression in zzso zzso depends on coincidence detection of climbing fiber stimulus evoking zzso calcium flux into the cell and parallel fiber stimulus evoking zzso zzso calcium release from the zzso zzso Experimental evidence shows that large zzso of zzso are required for calcium zzso This study uses zzso analysis to explore how the zzso cell provides sufficient zzso to produce large amounts of zzso zzso indicate that baseline zzso concentration levels in the plasma membrane are zzso even if the model allows for zzso zzso by lateral diffusion from neighboring zzso zzso zzso diffusion analysis indicates apparent anomalous diffusion of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso due to restricted diffusion through spine zzso zzso zzso synthesis and elevated spine zzso zzso by a local zzso protein were explored as candidate mechanisms to supply sufficient zzso zzso synthesis can indeed lead to high zzso zzso of long zzso local zzso produces high zzso zzso but of short zzso zzso results indicate that local zzso could explain the zzso observed finely tuned timing between parallel fiber and climbing fiber zzso
