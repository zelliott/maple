zzso information is zzso by a series of zzso signal zzso events thought to be zzso primarily by the second zzso zzso We have found a subset of zzso zzso that express the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso in these zzso also can have an important regulatory function in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both expressed in zzso zzso where zzso signaling is zzso however, only zzso is expressed in zzso In contrast to most other zzso zzso these zzso appear to project to a distinct group of zzso in the zzso bulb that are similar to the subset that have been termed zzso zzso Furthermore, this subset of zzso are unique in that they do not contain several of the previously identified components of zzso signal zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso including a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso III, and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these latter three proteins are expressed in the same zzso however, their zzso distribution is zzso zzso and zzso zzso III are expressed almost exclusively in the zzso zzso whereas zzso is present only in the cell bodies and zzso These data strongly suggest that selective zzso of different zzso and zzso is an important feature for the regulation of signal zzso in zzso zzso and likely in other zzso as zzso In addition, the data implies that an zzso signal zzso zzso specifically modulated by zzso is present in some zzso of the zzso zzso
