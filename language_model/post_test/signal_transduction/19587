zzso zzso zzso catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso In human zzso where zzso is the main zzso zzso three zzso are detected with specific patterns of expression depending on the zzso zzso differentiation zzso Previous zzso of the zzso gene promoters have shown that zzso regulation alone is not sufficient to explain this specificity of zzso In this work, we describe an zzso highly zzso zzso segment located in the first zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that it enhances the activity of the zzso promoter, in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso markedly reduced its zzso activity, which also confirmed its potential regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso evidenced the binding of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso interference zzso zzso confirmed that zzso contributes to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and promoter of zzso potentially interact through zzso looping, as indicated by zzso zzso capture zzso Our findings provide evidence that an zzso signaling zzso is involved in zzso regulation in human zzso zzso
