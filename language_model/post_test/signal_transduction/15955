The large zzso protein zzso has been characterized as an important positive regulator of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso associates with zzso complexes and is proposed to have roles in both zzso hormone binding and zzso zzso zzso Data from zzso and cellular studies have been zzso in whole animal models as zzso male and female mice display characteristics of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity and the specific zzso displayed by the zzso mice have firmly established zzso as a promising target for the treatment of a variety of zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso domain and the zzso loop within this domain are functionally important for zzso regulation of zzso zzso Based on these data, efforts are currently zzso to target the zzso zzso domain and the zzso loop with small zzso zzso
