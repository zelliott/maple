We look back on the discoveries that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso are required for the cellular response to type I zzso This initial description of the zzso zzso led quickly to additional discoveries that type II zzso and many other zzso signal through similar zzso This zzso zzso now serves as a paradigm showing how information from zzso contacts at the cell surface can be conveyed directly to genes in the zzso We also review recent work on the zzso proteins showing the importance of several different zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These remarkably zzso proteins also provide zzso functions in zzso regulation and they also function in zzso zzso and zzso organization in ways that may not involve zzso at zzso
