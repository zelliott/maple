zzso of the zzso facial skeleton involves the progressive zzso of zzso skeletal precursors into distinct zzso along the zzso (AP) and zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that complex interactions between multiple signaling zzso in particular zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso are needed to pattern skeletal precursors along the zzso zzso Rather than directly determining the zzso of individual skeletal zzso these signals appear to act through several families of zzso factors, including zzso zzso and zzso to establish dynamic zones of skeletal zzso zzso this patterning mechanism is largely zzso from mouse and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso This implies that the diversification of the zzso facial zzso including the evolution of the zzso was driven largely by modifications downstream of a zzso zzso zzso patterning zzso
