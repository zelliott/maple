Despite extensive studies on the zzso (AP) axis formation of limb zzso mechanisms that specify zzso identities along the zzso axis remain zzso Using the zzso chick leg as a model, we report here that zzso and zzso specify the zzso identities of digits IV and III, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso transformation of zzso III to zzso IV and zzso II to zzso III, zzso zzso zzso of their zzso zzso Delta zzso and zzso Delta zzso induced anterior zzso In both cases, zzso in the expression of several markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso and zzso rescued zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling which is pivotal in establishing zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso specifies zzso III, and the combination of zzso and zzso specifies zzso IV, acting together with the zzso zzso signaling zzso
