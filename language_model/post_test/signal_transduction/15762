zzso tissue damage limits the efficacy of zzso zzso For zzso the clinically most relevant adverse effect is zzso The mechanisms involved are poorly understood and putative zzso are zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso drug zzso protects rat zzso zzso from zzso in zzso Protection by zzso is related to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It rests on a reduced formation of DNA zzso breaks, resulting from the zzso of zzso II by zzso zzso transport and zzso oxygen species are not zzso Protection by zzso was confirmed in zzso In mice, zzso zzso acute zzso heart and liver damage as indicated by reduced zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso tissue growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also protected from zzso zzso cardiac damage as shown by lowered zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the serum concentration of zzso I and cardiac zzso following zzso treatment were also reduced by zzso Whereas protecting the heart from harmful zzso effects, zzso zzso its zzso efficacy in a mouse zzso model with human zzso zzso These data show that statins lower the zzso of cardiac tissue injury after zzso treatment in a zzso manner, without zzso the therapeutic zzso
