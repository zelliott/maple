The zzso hydrocarbon (or zzso zzso zzso is a zzso basic zzso zzso protein that zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso hydrocarbon nuclear zzso forming a complex that binds to zzso regulatory elements in target gene zzso zzso zzso and molecular biology studies have revealed that the zzso mediates the toxic and biological effects of environmentally persistent zzso and related zzso Cloning of the zzso and its zzso partner, zzso has facilitated detailed efforts to understand the mechanisms of zzso signal zzso These studies have determined that this unique zzso consists of several functional zzso and belongs to a zzso of zzso proteins that share a zzso motif termed the zzso zzso In addition, recent genetic studies have revealed that expression of the zzso is a requirement for proper zzso development, which appears to be a common function shared by many other zzso zzso This review is a summary of recent molecular studies of zzso gene zzso
