zzso in resource allocation have been widely stated as the means by which the honesty of ornamental traits is zzso but an alternative to this resource zzso hypothesis is that production of zzso is linked to the zzso efficiency of vital cellular zzso zzso are zzso potentially tying zzso zzso to the zzso state of an zzso and some zzso are also precursors for vitamin A, which regulates numerous cellular zzso We present a zzso model for regulation of ornamental zzso based on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We propose that vitamin A regulatory mechanisms, zzso systems, and zzso pigmentation pathways link zzso zzso to zzso state and to a host of important aspects of performance, such as immune zzso The activity of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of yellow zzso into red zzso is responsive to the states of vitamin A pools and zzso systems such that zzso is a direct reflection of the zzso state of an zzso According to the vitamin zzso hypothesis, feather zzso is associated with a range of performance measures because performance emerges from functionality of the same basic cellular processes that regulate zzso We present the vitamin zzso hypothesis as a testable alternative hypothesis to the resource zzso hypothesis for the maintenance of honesty of zzso zzso
