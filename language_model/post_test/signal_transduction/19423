During development, skeletal muscles are established in a highly organized manner, which persists throughout zzso zzso and genetic experiments over the last decades have identified many zzso control genes critical for skeletal muscle zzso zzso studies have shown that skeletal muscles of the body, limb and head have distinct embryonic and cellular origin, and the genetic regulation at work in these zzso and during adult zzso are starting to be zzso In this review we will zzso the current knowledge on the regulatory circuits that lead to the establishment of skeletal muscle in these different anatomical zzso
