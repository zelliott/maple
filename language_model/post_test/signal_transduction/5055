zzso regulates many cellular zzso but the full impact of insulin zzso on cellular functions remains to be zzso zzso a mass zzso zzso zzso approach, we report here zzso of 330 plasma zzso representing 33 zzso pathways during an zzso insulin deprivation in type 1 diabetic zzso These pathways included those known to be affected by insulin such as zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso cycle, and immune responses and those zzso unknown to be altered including zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A significant zzso of zzso and skeletal muscle zzso pathways supports an assumption that plasma zzso are chemical fingerprints of cellular zzso Although insulin treatment zzso plasma zzso and many other zzso there were 71 zzso and 24 pathways that differed between zzso and zzso type 1 zzso Confirmation of many known pathways altered by insulin using a single blood test offers confidence in the current zzso Future research needs to be focused on newly discovered pathways affected by insulin zzso and systemic insulin treatment to determine whether they contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in zzso despite insulin zzso
