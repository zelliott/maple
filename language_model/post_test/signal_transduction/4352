In the developing zzso region, zzso interactions induce a differentiation cascade leading to bone and cartilage zzso Although the nature of this interaction is unknown, bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso have been suggested as putative zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso the expression patterns of zzso and zzso zzso were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso during and following the time of the zzso interaction leading to zzso zzso At embryonic age zzso zzso days, a restricted pattern of zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso of the developing facial zzso This decreased zzso with little or no signal on zzso or zzso By zzso zzso signal was restricted to the dental zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was not prominent in the developing face until zzso At this stage, signal was widespread throughout zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso Different zzso of expression were present in the developing zzso for example, there was strong signal in the floor of the mouth and the zzso zzso in contrast to that of the zzso of the tongue and primary zzso which were zzso These results support the role of zzso and zzso as regulators of zzso development and demonstrates different fields of zzso expression in developing oral zzso zzso
