To meet the growing need for bone replacement of our aging population, development of new zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are major components of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We manufactured native and zzso zzso zzso evaluated how these components zzso different functions of zzso the cells that zzso bone, and analyzed the underlying zzso zzso were tested for their effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso using zzso zzso cells and primary human zzso Native and zzso zzso were stable and largely zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant zzso of zzso differentiation and zzso which was largely dependent on the degree of zzso of zzso rather than the zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso function by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso K, zzso and OSCAR by zzso and inhibited proteins involved in zzso zzso In conclusion, highly zzso zzso significantly inhibit various functions of zzso zzso Whether these properties locally contribute to improved fracture or bone zzso healing needs to be validated in zzso
