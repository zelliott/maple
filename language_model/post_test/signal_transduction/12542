Gene expression zzso have previously been associated with type 2 diabetes, however whether these changes are primary causes or secondary effects of type 2 diabetes is not zzso As healthy first degree relatives of people with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, they provide a good model in the search for primary causes of the zzso 

We determined gene expression profiles in skeletal muscle zzso from Caucasian males with type 2 diabetes, healthy first degree relatives, and healthy zzso Gene expression was measured using zzso Human Genome zzso Plus zzso zzso covering the entire human zzso These zzso have not previously been used for this type of zzso We show for the first time that genes involved in insulin signaling are significantly zzso in first degree relatives and significantly zzso in people with type 2 zzso On the individual gene level, 11 genes showed altered expression levels in first degree relatives compared to controls, among others zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to have a decreased expression in both groups compared to zzso 

We zzso that increased expression of insulin signaling molecules in first degree relatives of people with type 2 diabetes, work in concert with increased levels of insulin as a zzso zzso zzso otherwise reduced insulin signaling activity, protecting these individuals from severe insulin zzso This compensation is lost in people with type 2 diabetes where expression of insulin signaling molecules is zzso
