Public interest in zzso is growing zzso Unfortunately, there is little scientific evidence to support claims of efficacy of this widely used zzso and little information about potential mechanism of zzso This study examines the ability of zzso to zzso zzso function and begins to zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured with zzso zzso extracts enriched for plant zzso zzso zzso was used to measure zzso zzso zzso were blocked using specific zzso and Western zzso used to identify zzso proteins involved in signal zzso To examine in zzso zzso zzso was administered orally and zzso zzso given zzso Mice were sacrificed three days zzso to determine bacterial load in the zzso We demonstrate that an zzso zzso extract activates the innate immune response, stimulating production of zzso zzso zzso and NO from zzso in zzso Along with evidence of enhanced zzso function, we found that oral zzso reduces bacterial burden during infection by zzso zzso demonstrating its efficacy in zzso zzso zzso a signaling cascade within zzso through both zzso and zzso mechanisms, involving zzso zzso and zzso and ultimately the zzso of zzso
