A practical approach to increasing crop yields is to extend the duration of active zzso zzso is a term that is used to describe zzso and transgenic plants or zzso with the trait of maintaining their leaves for a longer period of time than the zzso or crosses from which they are zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism regulating leaf zzso which may allow us to extend the duration of active photosynthesis in crop zzso This article summarizes recent studies on zzso plants and the insights they provide on the mechanism of leaf zzso Briefly, zzso suppressing zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso signal zzso or those zzso zzso signaling often lead to zzso zzso indicating a complex signaling network regulating leaf zzso zzso regulated zzso factors, including zzso or zzso family members, play key roles in the induction of leaf zzso and thus zzso in the activity of these zzso factors also result in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso steps responsible for zzso breakdown also leads to zzso zzso Some of these zzso die in the middle of the process of zzso breakdown due to the zzso of toxic zzso while others appear to zzso but their zzso activity declines in a manner similar to zzso zzso zzso in certain zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso can lead to a delayed onset of leaf zzso with maintenance of zzso activity longer than zzso plants, indicating that zzso metabolism can also affect the regulatory mechanism of leaf zzso
