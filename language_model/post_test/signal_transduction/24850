Whole cell zzso recordings were obtained from zzso zzso to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso currents evoked by electrical stimulation of areas around the zzso zzso zzso When cells were zzso at zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso currents had zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SE; zzso zzso zzso With twin stimulus zzso (20 zzso used, zzso zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso Bath application of zzso zzso abolished synaptic zzso zzso at zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso currents in all zzso zzso zzso Within 2 zzso after application of (10 zzso zzso current zzso and zzso decreased by zzso 5 and zzso respectively, with little change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not reduce synaptic zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso suppression of synaptic zzso When patch zzso containing zzso zzso zzso were used to record cells, zzso still suppressed current zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso Similarly, zzso diffusion of zzso acid zzso and zzso did not abolish zzso suppression of synaptic zzso zzso Bath zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced current zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso After bath zzso of slices with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection decreased current zzso only by zzso much less than the zzso rate in control zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced little change in current zzso and zzso zzso ratios, representing a partial blockade of zzso effects on synaptic currents by zzso In zzso zzso recorded using zzso containing zzso and zzso with zzso the effects of zzso on synaptic currents were completely zzso zzso injection zzso decreased current zzso by zzso and duration by zzso with a drop in the zzso zzso ratio of zzso Bath zzso of zzso as well as zzso diffusion of zzso zzso or zzso failed to block zzso suppression of evoked synaptic zzso The present results suggest that zzso suppresses zzso synaptic currents in zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso It is possible that zzso first acts at zzso cells (perhaps both zzso and zzso and zzso the production of zzso oxide, which then zzso to nearby zzso and zzso synaptic transmission by a zzso zzso
