Whereas the adult gastrointestinal zzso zzso tremendous zzso through active proliferation in zzso stem cell zzso the responsible growth factors regulating this continuous proliferation have not been zzso The exploration of zzso functions of zzso proteins in adult organisms has been hampered by functional zzso and the necessity for conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To address the contribution of zzso signaling to gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was used to achieve zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of adult mice zzso expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso within 2 days in both small zzso and zzso indicating an extremely broad role for zzso signaling in the maintenance of adult gastrointestinal gene zzso In zzso Ad zzso markedly inhibited proliferation in small zzso and zzso accompanied by progressive architectural zzso with the loss of zzso zzso and zzso structure by 7 zzso Whereas decreased zzso expression at later time points zzso zzso was followed by zzso and zzso zzso which was consistent with a zzso process, substantial mortality zzso from colitis and systemic zzso These results indicate the efficacy of systemic expression of zzso zzso zzso as a general strategy for conditional zzso of zzso signaling in adult organisms and illustrate a striking reliance on a single growth factor zzso for the maintenance of the architecture of the adult small zzso and zzso
