The bacterial zzso network features robust adaptation implemented by negative integral zzso Here, we show that the adaptation module can be characterized by measurement of the response to simple zzso and removal of a zzso The method does not rely on a particular form of the zzso zzso and thus can be used to characterize other integral feedback zzso
