Combination therapy is considered a promising therapeutic zzso in enhancing treatment zzso The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is almost universally zzso in breast cancer, with specific occurrence of zzso zzso thus, it has become an attractive target for cancer zzso However, the use of single targeted zzso against the zzso zzso has demonstrated only modest clinical zzso In this study, zzso zzso gene transfer of zzso zzso combined with treatment with zzso was zzso to evaluate the effects of suppression of breast cancer cell zzso zzso we show that zzso significantly enhanced the zzso of breast cancer cells to zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso values of zzso were significantly decreased to a greater extent in cells zzso with combination zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in significantly reduced cell viability and invasion ability compared to single zzso zzso Using western zzso we found that combination treatment resulted in lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso than single treatment with zzso Furthermore, we showed a significant decrease in nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso by combination zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of breast cancer to zzso is achieved by increased zzso activity, thus resulting in zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
