Transformation of zzso into foam cells is traditionally considered in the context of zzso because zzso zzso is believed to be a consequence of zzso of oxidized low density zzso zzso through scavenger receptors zzso of zzso However, an excessive zzso of zzso is recently shown to trigger zzso mechanisms of cholesterol elimination from zzso Maintaining the zzso zzso in zzso is zzso by regulation of a system of zzso sensors, which is zzso under conditions of inflammation leading to formation of foam cell zzso without involvement of zzso The increase in the inflammatory potential on zzso polarization into the zzso zzso is associated with suppression of zzso and zzso their target zzso induction of expression of genes responsible for fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism controlled by zzso and zzso proteins associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and development of zzso In this review the role of foam cells in development and resolution of acute zzso mechanisms of their formation from zzso infected by some bacterial and virus pathogens causing chronic zzso and the significance of zzso and zzso as therapeutic targets in chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases are also zzso
