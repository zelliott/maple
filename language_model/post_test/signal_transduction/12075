This review addresses the zzso changes seen in motor zzso and the surrounding zzso cells in the process of zzso after nerve zzso In addition, the molecular basis for the zzso changes and the gene expression regulation are also zzso In the zzso zzso changes of zzso and zzso are seen in response to nerve injury, which could be important for zzso zzso In the periphery zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso play crucial roles in proper nerve zzso For those cellular functions and behaviors, a significant number of zzso among those cells is zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling in injured motor zzso is also zzso In the injured motor zzso their fate appears to be determined by a balance of the protection and death zzso To properly control expression of those signals, some zzso zzso factor complexes as well as the zzso regulators are zzso
