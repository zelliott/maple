zzso of G zzso receptors zzso is emerging as an important feature of several cardiovascular zzso G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso plays a key role in the regulation of a variety of these zzso and its cardiac expression levels are altered in pathological situations such as chronic heart zzso However, very little is known about the signals and mechanisms that zzso zzso expression in cardiovascular zzso 

We have studied the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso In an zzso smooth muscle cell line, agents that lead to zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso increased zzso promoter zzso zzso of signaling pathways by zzso zzso zzso or zzso receptors also markedly enhanced the expression of the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso tumor necrosis zzso or zzso led to the opposite effect, decreasing the activity of the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the expression of zzso in vascular cells is tightly controlled at the zzso level by the interplay between several zzso zzso which may trigger zzso of normal zzso levels in some zzso circumstances, thus promoting changes in the efficacy of the zzso signal zzso
