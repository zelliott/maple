zzso M zzso is a member of the zzso (or zzso zzso family, and its potential role in inflammation is supported by a number of activities identified in zzso In this study, we investigate the action of zzso zzso on expression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso and on mouse lung tissue in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein production and zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso could regulate a small induction of zzso in zzso zzso cells, but other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso Cell signaling studies showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso suggesting zzso zzso is not sufficient for zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso could partially reduce zzso zzso production, suggesting partial dependence on zzso protein zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso or zzso also induced zzso release by mouse lung zzso cultures derived from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in lungs of zzso mice using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a vigorous inflammatory response by day 7 after zzso administration, including marked zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso in whole lung were detected at days 4 and zzso These data strongly support a role of zzso in lung inflammatory responses that involve zzso zzso
