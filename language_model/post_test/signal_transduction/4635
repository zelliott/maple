zzso dysfunction is a component of many neurodegenerative zzso zzso of oxygen consumption from intact zzso enables evaluation of zzso zzso under conditions that are more zzso realistic compared to isolated zzso However, zzso analysis of zzso function in cells is complicated by changing energy demands and lack of zzso zzso Here we describe a technique for zzso measuring zzso from intact and zzso cortical zzso on single zzso This technique allows control of zzso to individual electron transport chain complexes following zzso as well as side-by-side comparisons to intact zzso To illustrate the utility of the technique, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso by the drug zzso in intact zzso is relieved by delivery of the complex II zzso zzso but not by complex I zzso via acute zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso a putative cell permeable complex II zzso failed to rescue zzso in intact zzso and was a poor complex II zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of intact and zzso cell zzso should be particularly useful for evaluating indirect zzso toxicity due to drugs or cellular signaling events which cannot be readily studied using isolated zzso
