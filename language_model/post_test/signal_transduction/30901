The zzso protein zzso is the major coat protein involved in the formation of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The prevailing view is that zzso recruitment involves zzso binding to multiple zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso cargo sorting signals, and zzso We now show that binding of cargo signal peptides to zzso zzso a zzso change in its core domain that greatly enhances its interaction with zzso In addition, we provide evidence for cross talk between the zzso and zzso binding sites within the zzso core domain such that binding of a cargo signal to one site zzso binding to the other zzso The stable association of zzso with zzso which is induced by cargo signals, would serve to provide sufficient time for zzso zzso and zzso recruitment while ensuring the packaging of cargo molecules into the forming transport zzso
