Plasma cell membrane zzso or zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit insulin signaling in cultured cells in zzso and in transgenic mice in zzso when zzso Furthermore, both genetic zzso and increased expression of zzso have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in zzso Thus it was proposed that zzso zzso represents a potential strategy for the treatment of type 2 zzso However, it has not been proven that suppression of zzso expression or zzso of its function will actually improve insulin zzso We show in the current study that transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, while zzso of zzso with zzso significantly increases zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing a short hairpin zzso against mouse zzso zzso was zzso to efficiently zzso zzso expression in the zzso of zzso zzso In comparison with zzso mice treated with a control virus, zzso mice treated with the zzso zzso had approximately zzso lower zzso zzso zzso levels, approximately zzso lower ambient fed plasma zzso approximately zzso lower zzso plasma zzso and significantly improved oral zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that suppression of zzso expression improves insulin sensitivity in zzso and in an animal model of diabetes, supporting the proposition that zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 zzso
