zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso This may occur via the adhesive function of zzso and its potential capacity to trigger zzso zzso However, its impact on zzso function remains zzso This study was therefore designed to investigate the relationship between the signaling potential of zzso zzso and its function in zzso zzso 

Human and mouse zzso were freshly isolated from whole zzso zzso zzso was assessed using flow zzso and western zzso analysis, while zzso zzso responses were evaluated through zzso zzso formation and in a zzso model in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with its zzso zzso a zzso soluble form of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso requires an intact zzso but occurs independently of zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso were both enhanced by zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso In addition, zzso mice exhibited zzso abnormalities without an zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that the role of zzso zzso is not solely zzso its binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso that enhances zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso or its zzso zzso could provide a potential therapeutic approach in the management of zzso zzso
