The involvement of central nervous system zzso zzso beta zzso zzso in the zzso of acute cardiac injury is still an unexplored zzso The present study was aimed to investigate whether cardiac injury could induce the zzso of zzso beta in the spinal zzso 

zzso injury model in rats was established by zzso injection of zzso through the zzso Western zzso showed that zzso beta was zzso in the upper zzso spinal zzso following cardiac zzso The zzso zzso beta was distributed in the zzso and zzso horns in the zzso spinal zzso as determined by zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso beta zzso localized in the zzso was elevated in response to cardiac zzso The DNA binding activities of two zzso beta zzso factors, zzso protein zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso were enhanced after cardiac zzso In correlated with the zzso of the spinal zzso zzso the circulating zzso beta level was also increased following cardiac zzso 

Acute cardiac injury could activate the spinal zzso beta zzso which, in turn, may contribute to disease progression in the acute phase of cardiac injury in clinical zzso
