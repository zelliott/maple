Although the importance of protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso signaling is zzso recent studies also suggest that zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso play an equally important zzso For example, both zzso II zzso zzso and insulin are known to mediate protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso These apparently paradoxical effects of zzso II and insulin suggest that both zzso and divergent zzso signaling zzso are zzso downstream of their respective zzso producing diverse cellular zzso In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso insulin resistance by zzso zzso of the insulin zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of the insulin zzso and that this signaling zzso zzso the zzso responses observed in diabetic vascular and zzso tissue during type II zzso
