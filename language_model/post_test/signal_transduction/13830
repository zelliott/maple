The timing of flowering is zzso regulated by complex gene regulatory networks that integrate zzso and environmental zzso Light and temperature are major environmental zzso in flowering time zzso zzso signals include two major zzso ambient temperature signals and cold zzso temperature zzso zzso the effects of cold temperatures on flowering timing are profoundly zzso depending on the duration of cold zzso Whereas long-term exposure to cold temperatures, designated zzso promotes zzso short-term cold exposure delays zzso Genes zzso the zzso zzso and underlying molecular mechanisms have been extensively zzso However, how cold stress signals delay flowering is largely zzso We have recently reported that the HIGH zzso OF zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso module is at least partly responsible for the daily sensing of cold stress signals in flowering time zzso zzso cold stress triggers the degradation of zzso a central zzso of zzso zzso via a zzso zzso that involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to suppression of zzso zzso T zzso gene and delayed zzso It is proposed that CO serves as a molecular knot that zzso zzso and temperature signals into the flowering zzso zzso zzso flowering under short-term temperature zzso
