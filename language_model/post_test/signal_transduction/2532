zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is one of two zzso pumps serving zzso zzso signaling pools in zzso zzso however, unlike the ubiquitous zzso it exhibits a restricted zzso zzso Gene targeting was used to generate a mouse with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were viable, zzso and did not exhibit an overt disease zzso Because zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells, zzso ring preparations were analyzed to determine whether it is involved in the regulation of vascular zzso zzso force relations in response to zzso or zzso as well as relaxation produced by exposure to a zzso oxide zzso were similar in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation of zzso after zzso with zzso was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in wild type, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso imaging of cultured zzso zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso signal is sharply diminished in zzso cells and also indicated that zzso of the zzso zzso stores is severely zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso cell zzso signaling events involved in zzso zzso relaxation of vascular smooth zzso
