Regulatory T zzso cells differentiate from zzso or peripheral T cells in response to host and environmental cues, culminating in induction of the zzso factor zzso box zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso An intermediate amount of zzso stimulation is required to induce zzso expression by engaging T cell zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cell differentiation is associated with attenuated zzso zzso resulting in enhanced nuclear retention of zzso which is indispensable for zzso cell zzso These findings reveal that zzso cell lineage commitment is not only controlled by genetic and zzso zzso but also modulated by zzso programs responding to zzso zzso
