zzso zzso zzso a type III zzso system zzso zzso in its zzso island 1 to mediate its initial interactions with zzso zzso cells, which are characterized by the stimulation of zzso zzso reorganization and a profound zzso of gene zzso These responses result from the stimulation of zzso zzso and downstream signaling pathways by specific zzso proteins delivered by this zzso We show here that zzso an zzso protein of this zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso through its interaction with zzso although it does not interfere with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso is zzso at evolutionary zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso This interplay between zzso proteins delivered by the same zzso highlights the remarkable complexity of these zzso
