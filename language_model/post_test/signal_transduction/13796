zzso play a central role not only in energy production but also in the integration of zzso pathways as well as signals for zzso and zzso It is becoming increasingly apparent that zzso in zzso cells play critical roles in the initiation and propagation of various signaling zzso In particular, zzso zzso and respiratory states and status on zzso genetic instability are communicated to the nucleus as an zzso response through retrograde zzso Each zzso cell contains multiple copies of the zzso zzso zzso A reduction in zzso copy number has been reported in various human pathological conditions such as diabetes, zzso neurodegenerative disorders, aging and zzso Reduction in zzso copy number zzso zzso membrane potential zzso resulting in dysfunctional zzso zzso zzso trigger retrograde signaling and communicate their changing zzso and functional state to the nucleus as an zzso response resulting in an altered nuclear gene expression profile and altered cell physiology and zzso In this review, we provide an overview of the various modes of zzso retrograde signaling focusing particularly on the zzso zzso retrograde zzso We discuss the contribution of the key factors of the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the propagation of signaling and their role in modulating genetic and zzso changes favoring cellular zzso towards zzso
