zzso zzso is one of the major zzso substances produced by zzso zzso a traditional medicinal zzso zzso possesses several biological activities, including both zzso and zzso zzso In the present report, we investigated an effect of zzso on the survival of cells exposed to zzso necrosis factor zzso We found that zzso doses of zzso increased zzso of cells to zzso zzso It was associated with suppression of nuclear zzso zzso a major zzso component involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso had the potential to zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso To identify molecular events downstream of zzso the role of zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso was zzso Selective zzso of zzso as well as treatment with zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso significantly reversed the zzso effects of zzso on zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso at least in part, via induction of the zzso zzso and zzso suppression of zzso
