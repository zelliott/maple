The formation of an aerial zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is determined in part by a small zzso protein called zzso A collection of representative bald zzso zzso which are blocked in aerial zzso formation, are all defective in the production of this protein and regain the capacity to undergo zzso differentiation when zzso is supplied zzso We now report that most of the zzso zzso are rescued for zzso production and aerial zzso formation when grown near certain other zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of this kind indicate that zzso differentiation is governed by a zzso cascade of at least four kinds of zzso zzso At least one such signal is present in zzso zzso It is resistant to boiling and zzso treatment, and it remains effective even when diluted up to zzso in fresh zzso
