zzso have evolved many different ways to evade immune zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso effectively zzso zzso immunity and zzso However, the underlying mechanism for this effect is zzso Here we show that zzso is a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso zzso activity following zzso zzso zzso or zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso activity occurs downstream of zzso degradation and zzso zzso into the zzso Analysis of zzso DNA binding reveals that zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso DNA binding and that this zzso is zzso through the interaction of zzso with zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso activity through directly blocking zzso binding to DNA and that this is the basis for its zzso zzso Our data also indicate a role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso
