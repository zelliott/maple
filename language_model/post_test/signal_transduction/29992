The zzso zzso supports cellular zzso and polar growth, but the underlying mechanisms are not zzso In a screen for zzso zzso defective in zzso organization in the fungus zzso zzso we identified zzso that encodes a zzso calcium zzso zzso resides in the zzso zzso and restores growth of a zzso zzso defective in calcium zzso zzso of zzso resulted in elevated zzso calcium levels and a severe growth and zzso zzso While zzso and zzso V distribution is zzso zzso zzso contain longer and zzso zzso that show increased rescue and reduced catastrophe zzso zzso can be restored by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso in dynamic instability are a major cause of the growth zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso show virtually identical changes in zzso dynamics and zzso zzso zzso was drastically decreased in zzso This indicates a connection between calcium zzso zzso and zzso organization in zzso of zzso zzso
