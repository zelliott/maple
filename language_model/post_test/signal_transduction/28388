Multiple signaling pathways are activated during engagement of the Type I zzso zzso zzso to mediate biological responses, including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In the present study we sought to determine the functional relevance of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso using cells from mouse zzso with targeted disruption of the zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso is essential for Type I zzso zzso regulation via zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, the function of zzso is not required for zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and does not impact on the formation of zzso or zzso nuclear binding zzso In efforts to identify downstream zzso of zzso that may mediate zzso zzso responses, we found that zzso activates the zzso zzso a known regulator of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In other studies, we demonstrate that Type I zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso is defective in the absence of zzso while Type I zzso zzso properties are decreased in cells with targeted disruption of the zzso zzso Altogether, our data establish that the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso of downstream zzso that participate in the induction of zzso gene transcription, to mediate zzso
