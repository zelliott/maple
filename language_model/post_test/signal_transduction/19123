Previous studies indicate that in brain tissue the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and a recent report has indicated that zzso activity could be specifically inhibited by zzso zzso In the present study, zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso in rat brain zzso In addition, brain zzso were employed to assess whether zzso could facilitate the detection of zzso G protein zzso Nevertheless, whereas zzso with zzso readily allowed detection of zzso G protein activity, zzso was zzso In contrast to previous claims, brain zzso activity was also resistant to zzso Thus, in our hands zzso was not able to block the zzso zzso and cannot serve as a lead structure for future development of zzso zzso
