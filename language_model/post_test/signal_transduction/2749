It has been known for more than 20 years that the early zzso of the slime zzso zzso is driven by periodic waves of zzso which instruct the cells to collect at the zzso zzso Although it has been hypothesized that zzso waves are also involved in the organization of zzso zzso wave propagation in the later stages of zzso development has not previously been zzso 

We have developed special optical and zzso techniques that allow zzso waves of zzso activity to be zzso in zzso zzso Using this technology, we have observed signal propagation in the zzso zzso stage of zzso zzso Within zzso these waves were zzso as concentric rings, single armed spirals or zzso zzso The spontaneous appearance of the latter structures was new and zzso The geometry of wave propagation was strain zzso strain zzso predominantly showed concentric ring waves, whereas spiral waves were typical of a zzso of zzso zzso F zzso zzso and of the widely used zzso strain zzso The different geometry of the signals was reflected by distinct zzso patterns and different zzso zzso in zzso zzso organized by spiral waves, moved faster than cells in zzso zzso and spiral waves were always accompanied by zzso cell movement, whereas cells in zzso mounds moved towards the zzso zzso 

The same zzso propagation and zzso control zzso zzso also govern the zzso of the mound zzso zzso behave as a highly excitable system in which a diverse range of zzso zzso create the same biological zzso zzso zzso
