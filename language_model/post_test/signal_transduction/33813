The function of the zzso B4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso remain poorly zzso We demonstrate that acute administration of zzso zzso zzso and produces mechanical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a selective toxin for zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A attenuated zzso but not zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso targeting zzso for zzso the zzso that renders the zzso zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso but not zzso zzso as did zzso a zzso zzso known to degrade zzso Finally, zzso for all five signaling pathways known to be activated by zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso attenuated zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a role of the zzso zzso in pain produced by the zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso protein zzso functions in the expression of this zzso
