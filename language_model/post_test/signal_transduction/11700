Most zzso proteins are zzso by the nuclear zzso and thus have to be imported into zzso from the zzso zzso zzso across and into the zzso zzso is a zzso process facilitated by the coordinated action of at least four specialized zzso systems in the outer and inner zzso of zzso The outer membrane contains one general zzso the TOM complex, whereas three distinct zzso are located in the inner zzso which zzso zzso of different classes of zzso The zzso complex mediates import of zzso zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso with internal targeting signals are inserted into the inner membrane via the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso from the zzso space into the inner zzso This review focuses on the structural organization and function of the import machinery of the model organisms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the molecular basis of a new human zzso disorder is discussed, the zzso zzso This is the first known disease, which is caused by an impaired zzso protein import machinery leading to progressive zzso
