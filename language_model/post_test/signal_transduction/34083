An increased propensity towards cardiac zzso and aggravated heart function is observed in zzso zzso zzso the development of which is associated with the calcium handling system in the zzso It was hypothesized that the abnormal changes in the zzso model may be a consequence of the abnormal expression and function of the zzso channel complex and that these abnormalities may be related to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid B is expected to suppress life-threatening zzso and to restore the zzso of the zzso complex in zzso zzso was produced by zzso the coronary artery for 4 zzso zzso acid B zzso zzso zzso for 4 weeks) was administered to rats zzso h before zzso zzso of cardiac zzso cardiac function, calcium zzso cardiac calcium release channel handling proteins and the zzso system were zzso The aggravated zzso and compromised cardiac function in zzso rats was accompanied by elevated zzso zzso levels in the zzso and a significant zzso of expression of zzso These were closely linked with an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso After a zzso treatment with zzso acid B, all abnormalities were reversed zzso zzso acid B was capable of zzso zzso expression levels and decreasing the propensity towards zzso by attenuating the zzso zzso zzso
