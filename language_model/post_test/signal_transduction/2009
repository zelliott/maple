zzso genes of the zzso zzso family have zzso roles in the zzso of head and zzso Gene replacement experiments show that the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso genes are functionally zzso in that zzso of either gene in zzso zzso of zzso or mouse can restore defects in zzso and brain zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso genes control a comparable subset of downstream target genes in either zzso Here we use quantitative transcript imaging to analyze this zzso of zzso and zzso gene action at a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso representing zzso zzso zzso genes were used to study differential gene expression in flies in which either the zzso zzso gene or the human zzso gene was zzso Two hundred and zzso identified transcripts showed highly significant changes in expression levels in response to zzso zzso and zzso identified transcripts showed highly significant changes in expression levels in response to zzso zzso Among these, 93 showed differential expression changes following zzso of either zzso or zzso and for 90 of these, comparable changes were observed under both experimental zzso We zzso that these transcripts are common downstream targets of the fly zzso gene and the human zzso gene in zzso 

Our experiments indicate that approximately one third of the zzso transcripts also respond to zzso of the human zzso gene in zzso These common zzso downstream genes are likely to represent the molecular basis of the functional zzso of zzso and zzso gene action in zzso
