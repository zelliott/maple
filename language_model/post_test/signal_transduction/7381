A zzso role of zzso signaling has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation and innate zzso This study was undertaken to zzso the contribution of zzso signaling in zzso to the development of zzso 

zzso zzso arthritis was induced in a mouse line in which zzso was zzso deleted in the zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso The arthritis was assessed clinically and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso were activated with zzso and zzso Cell zzso and zzso were analyzed by flow zzso 

Arthritis onset in zzso zzso mice was comparable with that observed in control zzso however, resolution was accelerated during the chronic zzso The attenuated arthritis was associated with reduced zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced expression of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso induced increased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso compared with control zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso expression induced by zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of zzso which regulates zzso zzso was increased in zzso mouse zzso 

Taken together, our findings indicate that impaired zzso signaling results in enhanced expression of zzso zzso and reduced expression of zzso and these effects are associated with accelerated resolution of inflammation during the chronic phase of zzso These observations suggest that strategies to reduce zzso zzso zzso and increase zzso may be beneficial in the treatment of zzso zzso
