Failure to efficiently clear zzso cells is linked to defects in development and the onset of zzso zzso component zzso is required for efficient zzso of zzso cells in mice and zzso however, the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso zzso are not fully zzso In this study, we used primary mouse zzso to identify and characterize a novel molecular mechanism for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with zzso resulted in zzso enhanced zzso indicating a requirement for de zzso protein zzso To investigate the zzso pathway, zzso zzso transcripts were identified by zzso zzso triggered the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso a zzso pair that mediates clearance of zzso zzso zzso native zzso and not the zzso tail or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso is specific to zzso because zzso zzso a related zzso failed to zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso fusion protein inhibited zzso zzso of zzso cells, indicating a requirement for zzso Moreover, zzso zzso failed to respond to zzso with enhanced zzso Our results suggest that zzso elicits a zzso zzso specifically tailored for zzso cell zzso and these data are consistent with the established requirement for zzso in prevention of zzso
