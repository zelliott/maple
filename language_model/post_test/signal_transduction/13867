zzso zzso zzso presents a huge challenge to plants by the combined damaging effects of zzso high zzso and zzso Little is known about the cellular responses to zzso zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso roots exposed to zzso stress for zzso was compared with those of zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso representing over a quarter of the total number of genes in the zzso zzso was altered by zzso stress, and the zzso genes zzso outnumbered the zzso genes zzso The effects of zzso differed from those of zzso and zzso primarily by zzso different categories of zzso Pathways commonly altered by zzso zzso and zzso were enriched in zzso zzso zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso as well as the metabolism of secondary zzso Genes for zzso zzso were specifically zzso by zzso while genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso protein processing in the zzso zzso and by zzso fatty acid zzso and the zzso rhythm were zzso This work provides the first holistic picture of early zzso adaptation to zzso stress, and highlights potential molecular pathways that could be manipulated to improve tolerance in zzso
