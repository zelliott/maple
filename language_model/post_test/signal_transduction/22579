zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are activated by diverse zzso signals and participate in the regulation of an array of cellular zzso In this study, we investigated the roles of zzso in the induction of phase II detoxifying zzso by zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso two potent phase II zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with its zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso and impaired the induction of zzso zzso a phase II detoxifying zzso and zzso response element zzso reporter gene by zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso also attenuated zzso and zzso induction of ARE reporter gene zzso Interestingly, although expression of Ras and its zzso forms showed distinct effects on zzso ARE reporter gene activity, they did not affect the zzso of reporter gene by the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of Ras had little effect on zzso zzso by zzso and zzso implicating a zzso zzso Indeed, both zzso and zzso were able to stimulate zzso zzso activity in zzso as well as in zzso Thus, our results indicate that the induction of zzso phase II detoxifying zzso is zzso by a zzso pathway, which may involve direct zzso of zzso by the zzso
