The purpose was to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso resistance and the mechanism responsible for zzso zzso contributing to zzso sensitivity for a chronic zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso We established cell lines from a patient with zzso at the time of first diagnosis and relapsed phase and designated them as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso The activated signal proteins in cells were tested by Western zzso The zzso was zzso in zzso zzso in comparison with the zzso cell line, but the expression of zzso zzso and protein significantly decreased in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells were sensitive to IM zzso zzso and zzso showed IM resistance zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso was significantly increased in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso The zzso rate reached zzso with zzso cells incubated with zzso which was higher than zzso cells incubated with IM alone zzso zzso of zzso cells incubated with IM was zzso However, zzso with zzso decreased the zzso of zzso cells from zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso blocked the expressions of zzso but did not zzso the zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contributed to IM resistance in zzso line zzso zzso may be a new marker of IM zzso zzso gained more treatment advantages than IM alone by blocking zzso pathways in zzso cell zzso
