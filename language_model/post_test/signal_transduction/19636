The zzso zzso is zzso in many human zzso wherein accumulating evidence indicates that it functions as an zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso expression in human and mouse zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso was implicated in this zzso based on the lack of zzso effect on zzso expression in prostate cancer cells with a deletion in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso confirming the important role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso directly bound the zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso with a genetic deletion of the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso expression was also dependent on zzso zzso zzso blocked both zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter and zzso nuclear zzso Thus, zzso zzso expression is zzso by zzso and zzso at the level of the zzso zzso Several cell death regulators were identified as downstream targets of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso experiments in prostate cancer cells directly showed that zzso plays a critical role in suppressing zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as a novel zzso target gene that functions as a key feedback regulator of zzso zzso
