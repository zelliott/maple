zzso inner ear hair cells in zzso are believed to be incapable of zzso after birth, which zzso treatment of zzso hearing impairment mainly caused by hair cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso are composed of hair cells and supporting cells, both of which originate from common zzso zzso signaling is an zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso of various cell types in zzso stage and even in some of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of hair cell fate from the zzso is inhibited by zzso signaling in embryonic inner zzso However, its function in zzso inner ears is zzso We showed that zzso of zzso zzso by either conditional disruption of the zzso gene or treatment with a zzso zzso could give rise to zzso hair cells in the supporting cell region in zzso of zzso from zzso mouse zzso where hair cells have not been considered to zzso after zzso We also showed that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were associated with zzso hair cell zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling zzso supporting cells from differentiation into hair cells even in zzso days, zzso that zzso of zzso signaling can be used to help zzso hair cells after birth and thus serve for potential treatment of intractable zzso hearing impairment caused by hair cell loss without zzso zzso
