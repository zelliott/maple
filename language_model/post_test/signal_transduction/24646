Recently we described the establishment in culture and the zzso and functional characteristics of a human zzso line zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso subset of zzso zzso cells are absolutely dependent on zzso 2 zzso for their growth and survival in culture and thus provide a model cell line for studies of zzso signal zzso in a zzso zzso In this report, we focus on the regulation of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells were found to contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of growth zzso zzso cells with zzso however, induced increases in the relative activity only of the zzso zzso This zzso increase in zzso zzso activity was zzso both by increased zzso zzso and by increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso during in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso determined that the levels of zzso protein were zzso by zzso indicating that the measured zzso in zzso zzso activity reflected an increase in the specific activity of this zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso activity that displayed rapid and transient zzso zzso increases occurred within 1 minute after zzso zzso peaked at 10 minutes, and declined to baseline levels by 30 zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not inhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
