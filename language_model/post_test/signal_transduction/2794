We have explored the possible involvement of the zzso zzso cycle and protein zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso light signal zzso zzso using nitrate zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes as model zzso We have shown earlier that zzso zzso zzso zzso completely replaces the red light effect in stimulating nitrate zzso activity and transcript levels in zzso In this paper, we present detailed evidence to show that zzso mimics the red light effect and follows similar zzso to enhance zzso zzso transcript zzso in a zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso in a manner similar to red light, indicating that a zzso zzso may be involved in zzso the light effect in both zzso zzso or zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso was also found to mimic the red light effect in enhancing zzso transcript levels and zzso zzso transcript zzso indicating the role of the zzso cycle in generating second zzso for regulating the two zzso These results indicate that zzso light regulation of zzso and zzso gene expression may involve certain common steps in the signal zzso zzso such as the zzso cycle and protein zzso by a zzso zzso
