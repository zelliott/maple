zzso growth factors beta zzso act by means of zzso signaling pathways and may also interact with the zzso protein zzso zzso The hypothesis was tested that zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso closure, by zzso embryonic mouse zzso in the presence of zzso with or without zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured daily, and zzso zzso and bones were zzso and protein analyzed by Western zzso zzso induced narrowing of the zzso after 72 zzso an effect inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso protein expression was zzso by zzso zzso zzso at 72 zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso protein as well as zzso zzso but increased zzso protein zzso In zzso harvested 0, 15, and 30 zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso was zzso after 15 zzso an effect zzso by the simultaneous addition of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso closure after 72 zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso inhibited these effects but increased zzso zzso We zzso that zzso regulates zzso closure directly by means of zzso of zzso and indirectly by zzso zzso a zzso for zzso zzso signaling required for zzso induction of premature zzso zzso
