zzso muscle zzso is a prominent and disabling feature of chronic wasting zzso Prevention or reversal of muscle zzso by administration of skeletal muscle growth zzso agents such as zzso growth factor I zzso could be an important therapeutic strategy in these zzso To zzso the zzso signal zzso responsible for muscle formation zzso during muscle growth and zzso we applied zzso to zzso zzso zzso and evaluated the effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso caused zzso and zzso of zzso activity via signaling through the zzso zzso We assessed whether pharmacological zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso evidenced by increased zzso formation, muscle zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso I zzso promoter zzso during zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso differentiated in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso require zzso zzso and revealing an important negative regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso this study identifies zzso as a potential target for pharmacological stimulation of muscle zzso
