zzso were among the first neurotransmitter receptors identified in zzso cells, but it is not known whether these receptors meditate zzso responses during zzso zzso We show that repetitive nerve activity evoked a rise of zzso calcium in zzso zzso and neighboring zzso zzso of zzso slices of zzso The zzso but not the zzso calcium transient persisted during block of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso calcium response was abolished by zzso acid and zzso however, zzso affected neither the inward current nor the resulting zzso that accompanied the zzso zzso calcium zzso The zzso zzso was attenuated by 38% by the mixture of zzso zzso blockers, which abolished the evoked zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the zzso currents by zzso without affecting the zzso calcium zzso In the presence of zzso the mixture of zzso zzso zzso exerted no effect on the zzso inward current or calcium zzso Furthermore, zzso greatly zzso both the zzso zzso cell inward current and the accompanying zzso calcium zzso The results indicate that release of zzso from zzso fibers activates a zzso zzso zzso that promotes calcium release from zzso zzso zzso calcium rises are known to stimulate a diversity of processes such as zzso release, energy zzso or zzso Thus the zzso mechanism described here is well suited for feedback zzso of zzso function that is independent of zzso
