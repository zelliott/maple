zzso regulation of zzso and behavioral processes is an important functional manifestation of zzso Our laboratory has been examining a number of model systems in order to zzso the mechanisms by which these zzso controlled mainly by hormones and zzso change during zzso zzso in which zzso in gene expressions are critical, are loss of zzso zzso motor control and impaired stimulation of zzso DNA zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso receptors contributes substantially to reduced motor control in the zzso Such zzso loss is due both to the death of some zzso zzso and decreased expression of the zzso gene in the surviving zzso Current efforts are zzso on the mechanisms responsible for zzso death, reduced gene expression and the relationship between the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso gene has now been inserted into attenuated zzso zzso which elicit expression of functional receptors when injected into the brains of living rats and zzso zzso of DNA synthesis by various agents including catecholamines and growth factors is markedly reduced in primary cultures of zzso obtained from aged rats when compared with younger zzso Such impairment is not the consequence of zzso zzso Moreover, since very different signal zzso pathways are employed by G protein linked receptors and those zzso by zzso zzso the zzso would appear to be at a very functional zzso zzso to date indicate that increased expression of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso is not zzso However, decreased stimulation of the zzso zzso pathway, possibly due to elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso may also play a zzso IN addition, cells of aged rats appear to shift to other growth factor responsive zzso In zzso altered gene expression during aging may be responsible for some important zzso in signal zzso and corresponding zzso and behavior zzso
