zzso effects of zzso result from its zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that drives proliferation and zzso that is zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tumors from the zzso breast cancer cell line reduces tumor growth and zzso If zzso can halt tumor growth, its introduction into zzso may be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of zzso zzso To assess the complete impact of zzso on transcription, we have made a full zzso analysis of zzso and zzso gene regulation in zzso cell line with zzso regulated zzso zzso Of the 35 zzso genes and transcripts zzso zzso zzso were altered by zzso zzso zzso withdrawal and subsequent zzso expression inhibited the zzso regulation of zzso genes and, in addition, altered expression of 152 zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were involved in zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso The zzso repressive effect was further confirmed by proliferation zzso where zzso was shown to completely oppose the zzso induced zzso Additional analysis of zzso with a zzso zzso domain revealed that this zzso at least for a quantity of zzso zzso zzso even more strongly than zzso zzso From an examination of the genes regulated by zzso and zzso we suggest that introduction of zzso may be an alternative therapeutic approach to the treatment of certain zzso
