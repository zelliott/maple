The zzso on conversion from the dark state to the signaling state in zzso yellow protein have been determined by zzso zzso exchange and mass zzso Both the wild type and zzso zzso are used in this study, with the zzso providing over zzso conversion to the zzso state under zzso zzso We found zzso in both the wild type and the zzso on zzso consistent with a more flexible structure in the zzso signaling zzso zzso In the case of the wild type, the zzso changes detected are mainly around the zzso zzso With the zzso zzso differences in zzso exchange between the light and dark are more extensive as compared to wild type; not only are the zzso surroundings affected, but significant increases in zzso zzso in the zzso and central zzso are observed as zzso On the basis of the data obtained from this study and previous findings, a sequence of events that leads to the zzso of zzso following zzso zzso is zzso
