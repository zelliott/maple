zzso zzso zzso are zzso to have high affinity for their intended zzso to elicit the desired cellular zzso Here, we asked whether differences in zzso sensitivity between two zzso signaling zzso controlled by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be sufficient to allow for selective targeting of one zzso over the zzso We show the zzso inhibitor zzso elicits a zzso response in cells despite having a zzso greater zzso potency for zzso in zzso We provide evidence that partial zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate zzso zzso but partial zzso of zzso is not sufficient to block zzso cell zzso Identification of highly sensitive zzso may provide a means to achieve selective zzso of zzso signaling pathways complementary to efforts to achieve zzso differences between in zzso zzso zzso
