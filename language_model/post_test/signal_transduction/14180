zzso is a zzso factor required for the maintenance of zzso It also plays an essential role in different types of zzso stem cells, raising the possibility that zzso zzso the common zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is a critical downstream target of zzso growth factor zzso zzso which mediates zzso of zzso stem cells zzso zzso expression of zzso together with zzso or zzso can replace zzso zzso By comparing zzso binding sites of zzso in embryonic stem cells zzso and zzso combined with zzso knockout systems, we found that, despite the common role in safeguarding the stem cell state, zzso regulates distinct sets of genes with unique functions in these two different yet zzso related types of stem zzso Our findings provide insights into the functional versatility of zzso factors during zzso during which they can be zzso zzso in a variable manner within discrete network zzso
