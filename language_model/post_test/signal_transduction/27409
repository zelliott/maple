zzso of the zzso family affect the determination of many cell zzso In the zzso eye, zzso zzso the basic zzso zzso protein zzso which is required for zzso zzso zzso Similar antagonism between zzso and zzso zzso proteins regulates most neural cell determination, however, it is uncertain whether the mechanisms are similar in all zzso Here, we have analyzed the sensitivity of zzso expression to zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso by the expression of activated zzso or of the zzso zzso and by monitoring expression of the zzso gene zzso and of the zzso zzso of split zzso 

The zzso expression pattern zzso from general zzso zzso through transient zzso groups' to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression differ in sensitivity to zzso zzso expression of zzso is not zzso zzso begins at the intermediate group stage, corresponding to the period when zzso gene function is required for its own zzso At the transition to zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated in all intermediate group cells except the zzso cell zzso zzso cells remain sensitive to zzso in columns 0 and 1, but become less sensitive zzso zzso cells do not require zzso activity to keep zzso expression zzso Thus, zzso signaling is coupled to zzso repression for only part of the zzso expression zzso zzso the zzso m delta protein is expressed zzso to zzso at the intermediate group and early zzso zzso but is expressed in other patterns before and zzso 

In eye development, zzso by zzso activity is restricted to specific zzso of zzso gene zzso beginning when zzso zzso and is replaced by zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not expression by other mechanisms, and that a transition from zzso to zzso is necessary for patterning neural cell zzso zzso neural zzso might differ in their zzso zzso but use zzso in a similar zzso
