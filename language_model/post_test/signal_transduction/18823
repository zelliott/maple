Network reconstruction of biological entities is very important for understanding biological processes and the organizational principles of biological zzso This work focuses on zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso data, and a combined literature mining and zzso analysis zzso approach is developed to construct gene networks of a specific biological zzso 

In the zzso approach, a global network is first constructed using the zzso zzso zzso It is then refined using zzso data through a zzso selection zzso An application of zzso to the zzso is zzso Our result shows that the zzso network is more reliable than the zzso network in dealing with multiple levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso program is available upon zzso
