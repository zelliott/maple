The zzso of zzso hairs in zzso provides a useful model for the study of pattern formation in zzso Although the zzso of hair cells in the root and shoot appear quite different, recent studies show that pattern formation in each relies on a common cassette of zzso zzso During development in each organ, neighboring cells compete to express regulators that specify the primary cell fate (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as those that prevent their neighbors from adopting this fate (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso The basic mechanism of lateral zzso with feedback that has been uncovered by recent studies provides a conceptual framework for understanding how patterns of cell fate in general may be specified during plant zzso
