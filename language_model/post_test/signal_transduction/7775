Regulatory volume decrease zzso occurs after zzso cell zzso zzso is caused by zzso of zzso channels and zzso which cause zzso of zzso zzso and zzso leading to cell zzso Recently, we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso expression in zzso zzso A6 cells in an zzso manner and that reduction of zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso the zzso zzso These suggest that zzso would reveal its zzso action on the zzso zzso by reducing zzso However, the reduction of zzso during zzso has not been definitely analyzed due to technical difficulties involved in zzso fluorescent zzso In the present study, we developed a new method for the measurement of zzso change during zzso by using a high-resolution flow zzso with a zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in A6 cells in an zzso medium was zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso shock zzso to zzso zzso a rapid increase of cell volume followed by zzso zzso The zzso caused drastic diminution of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso Under an zzso condition with zzso zzso channel zzso or zzso zzso channel zzso we did not detect the reduction of zzso Based on these zzso we conclude that one of the zzso zzso of zzso is the reduction of zzso and that zzso shows its action via reduction of zzso acting as an zzso signal regulating cellular zzso zzso
