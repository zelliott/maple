We previously mapped a novel zzso dominant deafness zzso zzso by studying a family with zzso progressive, zzso hearing zzso We report here on the identification of a zzso in zzso as the cause of hearing loss in the zzso zzso encodes zzso an zzso of zzso growth factor zzso cell signaling that is zzso expressed in different zzso and has been suggested to inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso We have examined its expression pattern in mouse inner zzso Western zzso and cell zzso results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that zzso is expressed in a complex zzso pattern during inner ear zzso In adult inner ear, the expression of zzso is restricted to the pillar cells of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso sensory zzso where it shows spatial overlap with the zzso zzso In dividing cells, zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso hearing loss may result from a zzso disorganization of the zzso zzso in the pillar cells and zzso zzso of the adult auditory zzso
