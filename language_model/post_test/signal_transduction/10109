To investigate whether zzso zzso promotes head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resistance and whether zzso promotes zzso C zzso zzso signaling to alter zzso sensitivity in zzso 

Cell line zzso 

zzso cell growth with the zzso drug zzso was measured in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and other zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso was measured with zzso zzso using the zzso binding dye zzso 

In the absence of zzso zzso inhibited tumor cell zzso The addition of zzso but not zzso plus zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduced ability of zzso to cause zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso can promote zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso demonstrated that zzso can promote zzso zzso zzso in zzso On the other hand, the presence of zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance in these cell zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso signaling influences zzso sensitivity in zzso cell zzso In particular, zzso promotion of zzso zzso signaling plays a role in zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso signaling zzso may be a promising target to overcome zzso resistance in zzso
