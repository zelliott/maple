zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso family of adapter zzso which contain a zzso zzso zzso domain and potential binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso upon stimulation of various zzso growth factors, and zzso receptors in cell lines and interacts with signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso although its biological roles have not yet been zzso To reveal the functions of zzso in zzso we generated mice lacking zzso by gene zzso zzso zzso died in zzso and displayed zzso defects in the heart, zzso and skin, which were similar to zzso observed in mice lacking signals of the zzso growth zzso factor, zzso growth factor, and zzso growth factor zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were activated at much lower levels in cells from zzso zzso in response to these growth factors or to stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a common player in a broad range of growth factor and zzso signaling pathways linking zzso zzso zzso zzso
