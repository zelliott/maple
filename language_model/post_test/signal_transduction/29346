Previously, we found that a loss of plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure contributes to zzso insulin zzso Interestingly, we also demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso a dietary supplement thought to improve zzso status in zzso individuals, zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso by lowering PM zzso Here, to gain zzso understanding of these separate zzso we tested the prediction that zzso would protect against zzso insulin resistance by improving PM features important in zzso structure and insulin zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso display elevated PM cholesterol with a zzso decrease in PM zzso This zzso imbalance and insulin resistance was corrected by the cholesterol-lowering action of zzso The PM zzso imbalance did not impair insulin zzso nor did zzso amplify insulin signal zzso In contrast, PM analyses zzso cholesterol and zzso interactions influencing zzso zzso Because extensive in zzso study documents an essential role for zzso capacity in zzso zzso zzso we next evaluated intact skeletal muscle from obese, zzso zzso zzso zzso Because insulin resistance in these animals likely involves multiple mechanisms, findings that cholesterol-lowering restored zzso zzso structure and insulin sensitivity to that witnessed in lean control muscle were zzso Also, experiments using zzso to shuttle cholesterol into or out of zzso respectively zzso the zzso zzso and protective effects of zzso on zzso interactions and insulin zzso These data predict a PM cholesterol basis for zzso insulin resistance and zzso highlight the zzso nature of this zzso
