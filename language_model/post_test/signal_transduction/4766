It is well known that the zzso system contributes to left zzso zzso and fibrosis, a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso system signaling alters the zzso zzso by promoting its differentiation into zzso distinct pathological zzso which zzso collagen synthesis and zzso and causes enhanced zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso which is induced during left zzso zzso plays an zzso and zzso role by zzso among others, the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso It is not clear how the zzso and zzso responses are zzso zzso zzso the mouse zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso activity via direct association with zzso causing zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso It was recently reported that the zzso zzso activity of zzso not only targets zzso zzso II but also the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region in zzso suggesting that zzso changes in zzso activity may trigger zzso zzso signaling that can zzso collagen expression and zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of zzso in zzso in induction of left zzso zzso in zzso transgenic mice harboring zzso zzso We observed that introduction of zzso zzso in the transgenic zzso heavy zzso mice causes prominent changes in zzso and zzso responses accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso Together, our findings underscore the critical role of zzso in zzso of the genetic response during zzso and zzso
