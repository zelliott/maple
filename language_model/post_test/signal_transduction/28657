zzso limitation in zzso coli activates about 100 zzso Their expression requires the response regulator zzso (also called nitrogen regulator I or zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso of zzso activates the neighboring central domain and leads to zzso zzso from promoters that require zzso zzso zzso The zzso has five beta strands alternating with five alpha zzso zzso of zzso 54 has been shown to zzso alpha zzso 3 to beta strand 5 (the zzso zzso within the zzso To further study the interactions between the zzso and central zzso we isolated strains with zzso in the zzso that were able to grow on a poor nitrogen source in the absence of zzso by the zzso sensor zzso We identified strains with zzso located in the zzso face and alpha zzso zzso Both types of zzso zzso central domain zzso The alpha zzso 5 zzso differed from those in the zzso zzso They did not cause a large scale zzso change in the zzso which is not necessary for zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso in both alpha zzso 5 and the zzso face diminish the interaction between the zzso and the central zzso Our results suggest that alpha zzso 5 of the zzso in addition to the zzso face, interacts with the central zzso We present a model of zzso signal zzso that proposes different functions for alpha zzso 5 and the zzso zzso
