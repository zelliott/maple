zzso the establishment of the animal body, requires the coordinated zzso of cells and zzso regulated by a very zzso genetic zzso zzso closure of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is one of the best models for such a complex zzso zzso To explore the genetic regulation of zzso closure, we carried out a large-scale zzso zzso screen in combination with in zzso zzso zzso and identified several genes essential for the closure or affecting its zzso One of the novel zzso closure zzso the small zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for detailed zzso We show that zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso dynamics in the leading edge of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso affects zzso closure dynamics by regulating head zzso a zzso process mechanically coupled with zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso is involved in closure of the adult zzso suggesting its general requirement in zzso closure zzso
