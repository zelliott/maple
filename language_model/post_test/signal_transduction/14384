We describe a mouse strain in which B cell development relies either on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso heavy zzso zzso cells expressing zzso chains from the beginning generate a peripheral B cell compartment of normal size with all subsets, but a partial block is seen at the zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso B cell development is zzso in competition with developing B cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso B cells display a long zzso and accumulate in the mature B cell zzso and even though partial zzso of the zzso alpha zzso tail compromises their development, it does not affect their zzso as it does in zzso zzso zzso B cells showed an enhanced zzso response upon B cell zzso zzso which was not due to a lack of zzso by zzso The enhanced zzso response was also observed in mature B cells that had been switched from zzso to zzso expression in zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso chain can exert a unique signaling function that can partially replace that of the zzso zzso zzso in B cell maintenance and may contribute to memory B cell zzso
