The zzso zzso provides a zzso model to study kidney development, in particular to delineate the poorly understood processes of how zzso segment pattern and cell type choice are zzso zzso zzso are divided into distinct zzso regions that include a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are comprised of zzso transporting zzso cells and zzso cells zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso field into zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso signaling later zzso zzso zzso but further understanding of these pathways has remained zzso The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is broadly expressed in zzso zzso and then subsequently marks the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is necessary to form the zzso zzso and to restrict both zzso zzso formation and zzso fate zzso We found that zzso and zzso have opposing roles in patterning discrete zzso and zzso zzso Further, we discovered that zzso is required for zzso formation, and that one mechanism by which zzso promotes zzso fate choice is to inhibit zzso Next, we determined the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso which limits zzso fate choice by lateral zzso zzso of zzso signaling with the zzso inhibitor zzso revealed that zzso and zzso did not have additive effects in blocking zzso formation, suggesting that they function in the same zzso zzso expression of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso domain zzso rescued the expansion of zzso in zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts upstream to induce zzso zzso These findings suggest a model in which zzso and zzso zzso zzso segment zzso while zzso fate is modulated by a complex interplay in which zzso zzso of zzso and zzso promotion of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our studies have revealed several essential and novel mechanisms that control zzso development in the zzso
