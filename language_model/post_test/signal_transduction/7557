It has been reported that the zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression is associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in some solid zzso however, the relationship of zzso with zzso in head and neck zzso is not fully zzso To determine the relationship between zzso and zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso growth factor zzso a zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso by zzso In addition, zzso stimulation induced zzso cell invasion and zzso zzso This increase in invasion and zzso expression was zzso by zzso of zzso Furthermore, to determine the effects of combined zzso and zzso targeting in zzso zzso cells were treated with an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso This combined treatment resulted in greater zzso of zzso cell proliferation and migration compared with the individual agents zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates zzso zzso and that combined targeting of zzso and zzso may be an zzso treatment zzso
