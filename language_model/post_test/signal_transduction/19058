The original idea that each protein follows a particular zzso zzso for its degradation is no longer zzso Instead, different zzso systems can simultaneously contribute to the degradation of a particular zzso or they can alternate in this task zzso for the most part, on the cellular zzso It is thus reasonable to expect that some level of communication exists among different zzso systems to orchestrate these coordinated zzso zzso zzso between two forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been recently zzso zzso respond to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Although zzso cannot completely substitute for the lack of zzso the partial zzso between both pathways allows some level of compensation, enough to maintain protein degradation and preserve cell zzso zzso the zzso among different zzso pathways and with other zzso systems is important to predict the type of zzso mechanisms that could be zzso in response to failure of one of these systems, and to understand the consequences that manipulating one of these pathways for therapeutic purposes could have on the activity of the other zzso
