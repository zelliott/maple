zzso acid zzso is a Ras inhibitor that zzso all active Ras zzso from the zzso We assessed the ability of zzso to reverse the transformed zzso of zzso type 1 zzso tumor cell lines of zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumor zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso zzso losses were zzso and zzso expression levels were determined in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso Ras zzso and its prominent downstream targets, as well as on cell zzso zzso and zzso growth, and tumor growth in mice, were zzso 

The zzso cell lines were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso treatment shortened the relatively long duration of Ras zzso and signaling to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso to that observed in a zzso normally expressing zzso zzso cell zzso These effects of zzso led to lower zzso levels of zzso and its activated zzso Both zzso and zzso growth of zzso cells were dose zzso inhibited by zzso and the zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso cells were found to possess strong zzso stress zzso and this zzso was also corrected by zzso zzso tumor growth in a nude mouse model was inhibited by oral zzso 

zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso levels, resulting in reversal of the transformed zzso and zzso of tumor zzso zzso may therefore be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of zzso
