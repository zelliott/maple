zzso studies and demonstration of viable bacteria in zzso plaques have linked zzso zzso infection to the development of chronic vascular zzso and coronary heart zzso In this study, we characterized zzso zzso effects on human zzso cells and demonstrated enhanced zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso family members zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was dependent on zzso and zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso of zzso cells with specific zzso for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso had almost no effect on zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso While zzso zzso was also able to zzso zzso cells, it did not induce the expression of zzso zzso or zzso These effects were specific for a direct stimulation with viable zzso zzso and independent of zzso release of zzso zzso zzso like zzso factor, zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso zzso triggers an early signal zzso cascade in target cells that could lead to zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso which in turn may result in or promote zzso
