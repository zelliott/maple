zzso of the zzso with alternating current produces sound in the ear zzso These zzso evoked zzso emissions zzso are attributed to zzso of outer hair cells zzso Earlier work suggested zzso were sensitive to the open probability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They were attenuated by zzso zzso and zzso by low frequency sound, consistent with current gaining access to a zzso source via the zzso zzso However, inconsistencies in the zzso as well as physical considerations argued against this simple zzso In this study the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso media was examined along with zzso transfer functions derived from low frequency cochlear zzso zzso zzso Both the level and the zzso of the zzso were reduced by zzso but disproportionately more so than the zzso loss of zzso In addition, the zzso as well as the level of the zzso recovered more rapidly than the zzso Both these results indicated that zzso modified the process of zzso generation independently of its effect on the gross zzso current through the zzso zzso Changes in the derived zzso transfer functions, specifically shifts in the estimated operating bias of the zzso channels, indicated the effects of zzso applied to the zzso surface of zzso were zzso It is suggested that both direct and indirect consequences of a zzso blockade may have zzso zzso was ineffective when applied to zzso zzso
