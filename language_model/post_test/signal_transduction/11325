zzso and inflammatory systems are controlled by multiple zzso including zzso and zzso These zzso exert their biological functions through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One such zzso zzso has been proposed to contribute to the development of zzso arthritis zzso We found that zzso was strongly zzso zzso in zzso tissue of zzso patients, but not those with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso might therefore be beneficial in the treatment of zzso We show here that the zzso for the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is effective in treating experimental arthritis, a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso was injected zzso into the ankle zzso of mice with zzso arthritis or zzso arthritis zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso drastically reduced the severity of arthritis and joint swelling compared with control zzso zzso was more effective than a zzso form of zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, induction of zzso could represent a new approach for effective treatment of zzso
