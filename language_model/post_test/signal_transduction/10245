zzso are members of the transforming growth zzso zzso that exert zzso and zzso effects on various zzso zzso To determine the possible function of zzso in stroke injury, we assessed which components of the zzso zzso zzso were modulated in response to middle cerebral artery zzso zzso Furthermore, because zzso replacement protects against zzso cell death, we explored whether zzso replacement influences zzso gene zzso Female zzso rats underwent permanent zzso and the expression of zzso and their corresponding receptors was determined by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction at 24 h after onset of zzso We observed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso type I zzso A zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso A expressing cells comprised zzso Next, we monitored the time course of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso or zzso rats at 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after zzso via in zzso zzso Starting at 4 h after injury, zzso zzso zzso was zzso in cortical and zzso areas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso increased dramatically with time and were highest at 24 h after the zzso and zzso replacement did not influence this zzso
