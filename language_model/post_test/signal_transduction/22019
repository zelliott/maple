zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso in both human and zzso adult neural zzso cells zzso It has been suggested that the zzso axis potentially enhances the proliferation of zzso However, whether zzso is expressed in the neural stem cells zzso a subset of zzso and zzso zzso and whether zzso signaling is directly required for their proliferation are not zzso In this study, we report that zzso is expressed in a zzso of zzso in the early embryonic zzso zzso In studies of a zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso transgenic mouse line, we further isolated zzso from zzso transgenic zzso and zzso cells demonstrated zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso with these zzso we enriched zzso cells by zzso activated cell sorting zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso alone did not activate the zzso of zzso or increase the proliferation of zzso that are induced by zzso However, we found that blocking zzso zzso with zzso zzso impaired the zzso expansion of zzso zzso through modulating their cell zzso In addition, zzso treatment of pregnant mice reduced the generation of zzso from zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a potential cell surface marker for early embryonic zzso and zzso zzso zzso
