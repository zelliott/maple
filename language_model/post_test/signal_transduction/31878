To initiate the innate immune response, zzso receptors zzso associate with zzso zzso proteins through zzso zzso zzso domain zzso The four principal signaling zzso proteins include zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the fifth protein zzso involved in negative regulation of zzso zzso is usually considered a part of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Other zzso zzso proteins have also been shown to regulate these signaling zzso including zzso and zzso as well as several bacterial and viral zzso zzso proteins that zzso these pathways as zzso zzso zzso pathways and the zzso proteins are associated with a number of diseases, including infection, zzso zzso allergic and zzso diseases and zzso We review our current understanding of the structure and function of zzso proteins and their regulatory zzso their association with disease and their potential as therapeutic targets in human zzso
