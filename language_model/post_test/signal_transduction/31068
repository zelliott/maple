zzso resonance energy transfer zzso is a natural zzso phenomenon that zzso an emerging technique to monitor zzso interactions in living cells in real zzso Here, we present a series of technical advances to enhance the utility of the zzso zzso in zzso A series of zzso cloning zzso was generated to accelerate the expression of proteins zzso with zzso zzso or yellow fluorescent protein under transient zzso conditions and in stable transgenic zzso Working in zzso transformed zzso or zzso we then detected zzso between three pairs of candidate interaction zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction between zzso and the zzso protein zzso and interaction between the light regulatory zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso A zzso version of the zzso zzso gene resulted in improved expression in zzso zzso zzso was active in a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a survey of the zzso light signaling machinery as a model system, we estimated the likelihood that a known zzso interaction can be documented using zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso may serve as a reporter of protein stability in a zzso chase zzso
