zzso of chemical compounds in food sources is based on the zzso of 7 zzso zzso receptors zzso in zzso and in insects such as zzso although the receptors are not zzso between the zzso Different combinations of zzso zzso are involved in the detection of zzso but the activated signaling zzso are largely zzso Because 7 zzso receptors usually couple to zzso we tried to unravel the zzso signaling cascade in taste zzso by screening zzso zzso zzso flies for zzso zzso We found the zzso zzso to be involved in feeding behavior and cell zzso by different transgenic and pharmacological zzso zzso is involved in the detection of zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso and zzso Our studies reveal that zzso plays an important role in the perception of some sweet zzso Because the perception of other sweet stimuli was not affected by zzso in zzso we also found strong indication for the existence of multiple signaling pathways in the insect zzso zzso
