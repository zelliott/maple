We review the cellular and zzso mechanisms responsible for the regulation of blood flow in the zzso and zzso in health and zzso Due to the intrinsic light sensitivity of the zzso and the direct visual accessibility of zzso blood vessels, the eye offers unique opportunities for the zzso investigation of mechanisms of blood flow zzso The ability of the retinal zzso to regulate its blood flow is contrasted with the far more restricted ability of the zzso circulation to regulate its blood flow by virtue of the absence of zzso cells, the markedly reduced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the lack of intermediate filaments in zzso zzso We review the cellular and molecular components of the zzso unit in the zzso and zzso techniques for monitoring retinal and zzso blood flow, responses of the retinal and zzso circulation to light zzso the role of zzso zzso and zzso in regulating blood flow, putative signaling mechanisms zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and changes that occur in the retinal and zzso circulation during diabetic zzso age-related zzso zzso glaucoma, and Alzheimer's zzso We close by discussing issues that remain to be zzso
