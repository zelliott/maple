Action potential firing or zzso of the zzso zzso can induce a transient suppression of zzso synaptic zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso This phenomenon, termed zzso suppression of zzso zzso is initiated zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso concentration zzso and is expressed zzso as a suppression of the zzso zzso It is, therefore, thought that some retrograde signal must exist from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Recent studies on zzso zzso have revealed that zzso cannabinoids zzso play a key role as a retrograde zzso There are, however, conflicting reports that zzso may be a candidate retrograde zzso for zzso zzso that acts on zzso group II zzso zzso receptors zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso mediate retrograde signal for zzso zzso We recorded zzso from zzso cells by stimulating putative basket cell zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso was readily induced in evoked zzso by a zzso pulse zzso We found that zzso was completely zzso by a zzso zzso zzso was totally eliminated by a specific zzso of the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and was deficient in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a group II zzso zzso zzso did not completely zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso had no zzso effect on zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso zzso mediates retrograde signal for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
