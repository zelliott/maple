zzso is an zzso that generates zzso zzso through zzso zzso Nuclear factor zzso zzso like 2 zzso is a zzso factor that zzso zzso genes in response to zzso zzso To investigate the protective effect of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mice with enhanced zzso activity were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Blood and zzso were collected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after zzso Administration of zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice, which were more in zzso mice and less in zzso zzso zzso produced liver injury in zzso mice, as evidenced by increased serum zzso activity and extensive zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced more severe lung injury in zzso than in zzso mice, as evidenced by increased lung weight and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice had attenuated lung zzso and no zzso zzso To further investigate the mechanism of the protective effects of zzso lung and liver zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso decreased zzso in lung and liver in zzso mice, and the decrease was more in zzso mice, and less in zzso zzso After zzso treatment, the zzso of the zzso synthesis zzso zzso was increased in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in preventing zzso liver and lung injury, and this protective effect results from zzso zzso of cellular zzso and expression of zzso synthetic zzso
