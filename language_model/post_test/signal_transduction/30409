The fundamental aim of zzso is to understand how an zzso zzso is determined by its zzso and implicit in this is predicting how changes in DNA sequence alter zzso A single network covering all the genes of an zzso might guide such predictions down to the level of individual cells and zzso To validate this approach, we zzso generated a network covering most zzso zzso genes and tested its zzso zzso zzso within this network predicts essentiality, identifying this relationship as an zzso zzso biological zzso zzso the network makes zzso zzso accurately identify genes for most systematically zzso zzso zzso which span diverse cellular and zzso zzso Using the network, we identify 16 genes whose zzso suppresses defects in the zzso tumor zzso pathway, and we successfully predict that the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso We conclude that an analogous network for human genes might be similarly zzso and thus facilitate identification of disease genes and rational therapeutic zzso
