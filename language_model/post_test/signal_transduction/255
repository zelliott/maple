zzso regions of sodium dependent neurotransmitter zzso regulate their surface density and transporting function by zzso themselves with zzso signaling zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in rat brain zzso leads to zzso of both zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region, zzso removes a short segment of zzso acids involved in binding of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a protein pull-down zzso we found that zzso zzso of zzso results in modification of its interacting zzso in zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso in zzso terminals may influence the scaffolding and surface expression of zzso zzso zzso under normal conditions or imbalance zzso zzso transmission under pathological zzso
