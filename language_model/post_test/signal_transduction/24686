zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso are potent regulators of zzso zzso In zzso zzso rat zzso cells with zzso features, zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso increase zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a variety of cell types, zzso mediates its effects in part via zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other protein zzso such as protein zzso The nuclear mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso proliferation are zzso zzso we have examined the effects of these agents on zzso second zzso generation, and primary response zzso which may link second zzso zzso to subsequent zzso in gene zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso cells treated for 3 h with 2 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso demonstrated that all three agents induced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso zzso cellular proliferation and induced zzso zzso Also, unlike zzso and zzso zzso did not increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by treatment with 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso or by 40 zzso zzso while induction of zzso zzso was zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso Thus, zzso signal zzso differs from that of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, in that zzso does not stimulate the protein zzso second zzso system, but causes zzso of zzso a primary response gene that may play a role in the zzso effect of zzso
