zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso zzso necessary for cancer zzso Animal and human studies have shown that zzso zzso of zzso slows the growth rate of established tumors and occasionally zzso them zzso We observed, zzso that zzso zzso before exposing animals to tumor cells increases tumor growth zzso We hypothesized that zzso is necessary for the zzso effects of zzso zzso T zzso zzso during the early stages of tumor zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with a blocking soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso or zzso zzso group, zzso before tumor zzso zzso size was followed for 6 zzso In zzso zzso zzso and depletion experiments were then performed to investigate the zzso basis of our zzso Lastly, animals were zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso prior to zzso with an zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso gene zzso One week later, flow zzso was zzso to measure the number of zzso zzso zzso T zzso 

zzso of zzso before the injection of tumor cells resulted in significantly larger average tumor volumes on days 11, 17, 22, 26 and 32 post zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was due to the zzso of zzso as it was not present in mice with severe combined zzso zzso or those depleted of zzso T zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in a Winn zzso zzso grew to a much larger size when mixed with zzso T cells from mice zzso with zzso than when mixed with zzso T cells from mice in the control group: 96 zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso In addition, fewer zzso T cells were generated in zzso mice zzso with zzso than in mice from the control group: zzso total zzso T cells zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 

These studies provide the first in zzso evidence that zzso may be necessary for zzso immune responses in certain zzso This finding has important implications for our understanding of zzso immune responses, the role of zzso in the immune system, and the future development of zzso zzso zzso
