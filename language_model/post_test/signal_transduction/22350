The innate immune pathways that contribute to the potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso remain largely zzso Previous studies assessing innate immunity triggered by vaccine zzso have largely focused on in zzso studies involving zzso cells and on early in zzso inflammatory zzso Here, we systematically explore the zzso zzso zzso signaling requirements for the generation of cellular immune responses by intramuscular zzso with common and alternative zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso responses zzso by these zzso zzso were significantly diminished in zzso mice but not in zzso or zzso mice, suggesting the importance of zzso zzso zzso However, the absence of each individual zzso resulted in minimal to no effect on zzso cellular immune zzso Moreover, responses were not diminished in zzso or zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso engage multiple zzso signaling zzso none of which are individually zzso rather, they are integrated to contribute to the potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso of multiple innate immune mechanisms may prove a zzso property of potent vaccines, and this strategy could be harnessed in the development of next-generation vaccine zzso and zzso
