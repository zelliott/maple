zzso zzso gene zzso pathways are generally recognized for their functions in halting gene expression by the degradation of a transcript or by zzso zzso However, another important mode of gene regulation by small zzso is zzso at the level of zzso zzso Over the past decade a great deal of progress on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which small zzso can influence zzso has been made for zzso zzso zzso and plants, while less is known about the functions and consequences of such zzso small zzso pathways in zzso Several recent studies in the zzso zzso zzso have provided zzso insights into small zzso pathways that impact zzso throughout zzso The zzso has been instrumental in uncovering the mechanisms of zzso interference and remains a powerful system for zzso the molecular means by which small zzso pathways impact zzso in zzso This review summarizes our current knowledge of the various zzso small zzso pathways in zzso zzso and provides insights for future zzso
