zzso the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso activates the checkpoint zzso zzso in response to DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso associates with replication protein A zzso which binds zzso DNA zzso formed by zzso zzso In humans and both zzso zzso are initially detected and processed by the zzso zzso zzso protein complex in association with the zzso checkpoint zzso and the zzso zzso processing zzso however, in budding zzso neither zzso zzso activity or zzso are required for zzso signaling at zzso zzso Here, we investigate the relationship between DNA end processing and the zzso checkpoint response in zzso zzso and we report that zzso zzso activity and zzso are critical for efficient zzso zzso Moreover, deleting zzso reveals a zzso signaling zzso that zzso zzso This zzso requires zzso zzso activity, the zzso zzso checkpoint clamp complex, and zzso checkpoint zzso zzso zzso regulates this zzso by controlling zzso residency at zzso A zzso checkpoint zzso acting at zzso zzso provides a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso to the initial detection of zzso and suggests that zzso may activate zzso by both direct and indirect mechanisms in zzso zzso
