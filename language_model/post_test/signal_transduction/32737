To characterize the behavioral consequences of zzso gene deletion on odor processing we assessed the ability of zzso animals to acquire an air vs odor discrimination for five zzso and determined whether zzso animals differed from controls in their threshold sensitivity to the zzso zzso On average, control and zzso animals did not differ in the number of testing sessions needed to achieve criterion performance on each discrimination problem zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso animals were significantly less sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These in zzso behavioral results provide support for the hypothesis that zzso plays a zzso role in the odor zzso zzso zzso
