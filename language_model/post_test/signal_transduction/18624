A critical question in zzso development is how the zzso is zzso In zzso bone zzso protein zzso antagonism emanating from the zzso organizer is zzso zzso of zzso antagonism and the organizer in zzso remain zzso zzso visceral zzso zzso promotes early mouse head development, but its function is zzso Here, we explore the timing and regulation of zzso establishment in the zzso zzso zzso requires tissue interaction through the late streak stage of zzso zzso zzso lack both the organizer and its zzso antagonists, yet about zzso show weak zzso gene zzso A similar percentage shows zzso zzso gene expression zzso The zzso zzso may thus be a source of zzso promoting signals in these zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso while anterior zzso provided maintenance zzso zzso and molecular data suggest that the zzso is a source of active zzso antagonism in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso gene expression and inhibited zzso gene zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso gene zzso an effect that could be antagonized by anterior zzso and promoted expression of some zzso zzso These results lead to a model in which zzso antagonism supplied by zzso zzso promotes zzso establishment and maintenance in the zzso zzso
