The mechanisms by which statins are beneficial are incompletely zzso While the lowering of zzso zzso concentration is associated with zzso of zzso the observed benefit of zzso therapy begins within months after its zzso making zzso an unlikely zzso Although zzso lowering is the main mechanism by which zzso therapy reduces cardiovascular events, evidence suggests that at least some of the beneficial actions of statins may be zzso by their zzso zzso Thus, statins may zzso the function of cardiovascular cells and key zzso zzso including small zzso to ultimately exert their zzso zzso zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso that regulates diverse zzso functions in a variety of different organ zzso Within the cardiovascular system, zzso mediates zzso following zzso injury, zzso response, improvement of zzso function, increased zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Early evidence suggests that the zzso effects of statins may be related to an increase in zzso zzso This review focuses on zzso zzso as the potential mechanism underlying the zzso effects of zzso An improved understanding of this mechanism may be vital for establishing the clinical relevance of statins and their importance in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery zzso Key points Several studies have demonstrated a benefit from lowering serum zzso with statins in patients with and without clinical evidence of zzso These may be zzso by the zzso effects of zzso mechanisms of which are incompletely zzso Early evidence suggests that statins may increase zzso zzso pathways through zzso of the expression of zzso receptors and an increase in plasma levels of zzso to ultimately exert their zzso zzso Future clinical trials and basic science research aimed at the underlying mechanisms of the zzso effects of statins should zzso us to their relative clinical relevance and zzso
