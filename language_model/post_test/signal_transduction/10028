The zzso protein zzso is a zzso product that is zzso in primary breast zzso To determine the functional consequences of zzso zzso we zzso the immortalized human zzso zzso cell line zzso In zzso culture, expression of zzso at levels comparable with those detected in human breast cancer cells accelerated zzso growth factor zzso cell cycle progression and was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced and/or more sustained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso culture of zzso cells resulted in the formation of zzso zzso zzso with hollow zzso Under these conditions, zzso increased cell proliferation during zzso leading to significantly larger zzso an effect dependent on zzso binding to zzso and zzso and enhanced by recruitment of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that, in addition to direct zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso signaling also contributed to zzso enhancement of zzso zzso In addition, zzso overcame the zzso suppression that normally occurs in late stage cultures and zzso independence of the zzso program from zzso zzso Finally, higher levels of zzso expression led to the formation of large zzso structures with defective zzso zzso These findings support a role for zzso in zzso zzso
