PG zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of the immune response and the inflammatory zzso In the present study, we describe a zzso positive feedback for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso cell line zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an effect zzso by zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the involvement of zzso receptors zzso zzso showed that incubation with zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This induction was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the specific binding of this zzso factor to zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso of potential zzso sites in both promoters diminished their zzso zzso In zzso the results of the present study demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso by zzso plays a key role in the expression of zzso and zzso in activated zzso
