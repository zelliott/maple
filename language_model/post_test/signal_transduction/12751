In order to study the regulation of zzso B expression in the zzso zzso B zzso zzso were measured in rat zzso cells zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso B zzso zzso were increased in zzso cells cultured for up to 6 days in zzso The effect of zzso on zzso B zzso zzso was dose dependent over the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to characterize this effect zzso The zzso increase in zzso B zzso zzso zzso fivefold over that in zzso zzso was partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso decreased zzso B zzso zzso Similar changes were observed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso B zzso activity or zzso protein zzso These results demonstrate zzso that zzso B expression in the zzso is regulated in parallel with that of zzso and zzso and zzso that zzso zzso and zzso processes stimulate gene zzso while zzso zzso treatment zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
