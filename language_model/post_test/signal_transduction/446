zzso acids are powerful zzso produced by the liver to aid in the zzso of dietary zzso We recently reported a novel role for zzso in zzso acid zzso The winged zzso zzso factor zzso is required to prevent zzso zzso and liver injury in mice fed a zzso zzso zzso Here, we use functional zzso to study how zzso regulates its targets in a zzso zzso zzso We found that multiple signaling pathways essential for the zzso response to acute liver injury are impaired in zzso of zzso mice, suggesting that the deletion of zzso in the zzso affects the liver on a large zzso We also discovered distinct zzso regulatory zzso controlling zzso targets in a zzso zzso or zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts with different zzso factors to achieve gene expression responses appropriate for each zzso zzso
