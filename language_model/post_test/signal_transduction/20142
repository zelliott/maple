Age is the strongest breast cancer risk factor, with overall breast cancer risk increasing steadily beginning at approximately 30 years of zzso However, while breast cancer risk is lower among younger women, young women's breast cancer may be more zzso zzso several zzso and zzso studies have shown higher prevalence of aggressive, zzso negative breast cancer in younger women, the age-related gene expression that zzso to these tumors is poorly zzso zzso age-related patterns of gene expression in normal breast zzso may provide insights on zzso of distinct breast cancer zzso that arise from these zzso 

To identify age-related changes in normal breast zzso 96 tissue specimens from patients with reduction zzso ages 14 to 70 years, were zzso by gene expression zzso 

zzso associations between gene expression levels and age were identified for 802 zzso zzso increased, 321 decreased with increasing zzso Enriched functions included zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and enriched pathways included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes to publicly available tumor zzso the zzso pathways defined two groups of tumors with distinct zzso 

The hazard rates of zzso tumors mirrored that of high-grade tumors in the zzso zzso and End zzso Program, providing a zzso link between normal aging and age-related tumor zzso 

These data show that studies of normal tissue gene expression can yield important insights about the pathways and zzso pressures that are relevant during tumor zzso and zzso
