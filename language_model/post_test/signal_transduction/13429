Human zzso zzso is an important zzso agent in the genesis of cervical zzso zzso cervical tumors and human zzso cell lines display increased zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso which is associated with increased cell zzso zzso cells are an zzso human zzso zzso cell line that is a model of zzso cervical zzso and displays elevated zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso signal zzso We show that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso reduce zzso level and the magnitude and duration of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These effects are reversed by zzso with an zzso zzso To identify the zzso we examined the effects of zzso treatments on zzso zzso zzso with zzso causes a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The first peak of zzso is present at 20 zzso and the second is present at 36 zzso This zzso subsequently leads to an increase in the zzso D1 level and increased cell zzso zzso treatment with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso both zzso of zzso zzso completely eliminates the zzso D1 zzso and suppresses zzso cell zzso This effect is specific as zzso treatment does not alter the level or activity of other zzso zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso X zzso zzso in contrast, did not regulate these zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity reduces cell proliferation by reducing the magnitude and duration of zzso zzso zzso
