Cell fate determination is a major zzso problem in cell and zzso zzso The discovery of zzso by zzso factors offers a rational system to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with cell fate zzso The idea that zzso of zzso starts with a zzso transition zzso suggests that the process is perhaps a reversal of zzso to zzso transition zzso found frequently during early zzso As such, we believe that investigations into zzso may yield detailed molecular insights into cell fate decisions, not only for the switching between zzso and zzso cells, but also other cell zzso
