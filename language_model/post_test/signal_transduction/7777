We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth zzso zzso rapidly activates the zzso protein zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso signaling zzso leading to the induction of type I collagen synthesis in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Ma zzso zzso zzso Choi zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the functional role of upstream zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso in the zzso signaling zzso Rapid zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso was observed in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso reduced zzso protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso activity by zzso expression of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso type I collagen zzso In contrast, zzso expression of zzso inhibited collagen zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso and zzso play a pivotal role as upstream signal zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling cascade that leads to the induction of type I collagen expression by zzso In addition, our findings also suggest that zzso has a novel function in regulation of the zzso protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso
