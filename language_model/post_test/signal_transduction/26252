zzso with subsequent multiple organ dysfunction is a distinctly systemic inflammatory response to concealed or known infection and is a leading cause of death in intensive care zzso In the initial stage of zzso a phase of immune zzso can be zzso but a marked zzso depletion of zzso and a zzso zzso of immune function after severe trauma and burns might be responsible for the increased zzso of the host to subsequent septic zzso Recent studies indicated that negative regulation of immune function plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of peripheral zzso and regulation of immune zzso therefore, an understanding of the basic pathways might give rise to novel insights into the mechanisms of zzso and immune zzso This review is an attempt to provide a summary of the different pathways of negative regulation that are involved in the zzso of zzso secondary to acute zzso
