The plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso In the majority of cells the main function of zzso is as the only system to zzso calcium from the zzso however, in the excitable cells of the heart it has only a minor role in the bulk removal of calcium compared to the zzso zzso There is increasing evidence to suggest that zzso has an additional role as a potential zzso of a number of signal zzso zzso Of key interest in the heart is the functional interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso 4 of zzso zzso oxide production from zzso is known to be important in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso This article will focus on recent evidence suggesting that zzso has a regulatory role in the zzso oxide signaling zzso in the zzso
