Cell identity is specified in the early zzso zzso by the generation of precursors for two cell zzso the zzso inner cell mass and zzso zzso Here we identify zzso as a key regulator of this zzso We show that the loss of zzso together with zzso 2, leads to differentiation of inner cell mass cells and compromised zzso zzso We show that zzso regulates zzso of zzso and zzso motifs are required for full activity of zzso zzso we also show that zzso function can compensate for the absence of zzso zzso indicating the ability of zzso to bypass the classical zzso zzso for zzso zzso In polarized outside cells, zzso zzso zzso pointing to the importance of cell polarity in regulating zzso to promote zzso We propose that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms regulate zzso zzso to set apart zzso and differentiated lineages in the zzso mouse zzso
