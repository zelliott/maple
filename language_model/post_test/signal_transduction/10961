The zzso zzso originates from the zzso floor of the zzso as a zzso of the zzso cell zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying the early steps of zzso zzso are not zzso Gene targeting experiments have contributed to the identification of several zzso factors, in general playing a role in the zzso survival, and migration of the zzso cell zzso The experiments reported here analyze the expression of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of each of zzso We found that most of these zzso factors are linked in an integrated regulatory network, each of them controlling the presence of other members of the zzso The expression of zzso is regulated in an intriguing fashion as it is strongly dependent on the presence of zzso in zzso precursor cells, while the expression of the same gene in the zzso zzso surrounding the zzso is dependent on Sonic zzso zzso zzso Moreover, by the generation of mouse zzso expressing zzso exclusively in the zzso zzso we provide a better understanding of the role of zzso in these cells in order to acquire the competence to migrate into the underlying zzso In conclusion, we provide the first evidence of gene expression programs, controlled by a hierarchy of zzso factors expressed in the zzso zzso gut domain and directing the progression of zzso zzso
