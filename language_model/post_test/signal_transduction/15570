The zzso zzso expresses two related but distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso 1 and zzso that regulate the vascular response to a key zzso zzso In the present review, we suggest a model for zzso the signals from these zzso zzso zzso by zzso the spatial and zzso segregation of these membrane proteins linked to distinct zzso zzso associated with each zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulates a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is linked to zzso zzso sorting complex required for zzso recognition of activated zzso and sorting in zzso before arrival in zzso for terminal zzso In addition, zzso zzso regulate key events in zzso trafficking between the plasma zzso early and late zzso with distinct roles for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso levels affects not only zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also functional zzso such as zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso displays stable zzso zzso that can be zzso by cell stimuli that elevate zzso zzso zzso zzso One model is that zzso zzso from the zzso network to the plasma membrane via a zzso trafficking zzso This allows rapid and preferential zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso thus blocking further zzso zzso zzso or degradation of zzso allows zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Thus a dual zzso system with a built-in zzso loop is zzso by zzso cells to sense a key zzso in vascular zzso
