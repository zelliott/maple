zzso of zzso into zzso is a major zzso that contributes to the removal of zzso from the portal vein by the liver in the zzso zzso It is regulated in part by the increase in zzso concentration in the portal zzso which activates zzso the first zzso in the pathway, causing an increase in the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso state of downstream zzso by acting zzso with other zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a hierarchy of zzso and zzso mechanisms that are only partially zzso In the zzso state, zzso is in part zzso in the nucleus in an inactive state, zzso to a specific regulatory zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso This reserve pool is rapidly mobilized to the zzso in the zzso state in response to an elevated concentration of zzso The zzso of zzso between the nucleus and zzso is modulated by various zzso and hormonal zzso The elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso has a synergistic effect with zzso in promoting zzso zzso of zzso zzso and inducing zzso zzso of zzso zzso The latter involves both a direct zzso zzso change and depletion of the zzso form of zzso zzso which is a potent zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in both the zzso of zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso are potential contributing factors to the zzso of zzso zzso metabolism in Type 2 zzso
