zzso zzso signaling is critically involved in normal zzso development and the zzso process of zzso stem cells zzso zzso of this zzso has been linked to a large variety of zzso including different zzso of zzso zzso is a major zzso factor of this zzso and plays a pivotal role in zzso differentiation as well as in zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso expression in zzso zzso as well as its expression in human zzso Mice transplanted with bone zzso zzso zzso to express zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso showed a severe zzso of normal zzso differentiation and finally developed B zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso expression of zzso and zzso regulatory zzso Furthermore, single cell experiments and limiting dilution transplantation zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso stem cell with zzso characteristics displaying zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate a thus far unknown role of zzso in the biology of acute zzso pointing to the necessity of balanced zzso expression for an ordered zzso zzso
