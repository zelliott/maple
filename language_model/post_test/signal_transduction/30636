Stress responses in both plants and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso strain, zzso which lacks zzso pumps, requires zzso zzso for zzso In medium containing 100 zzso zzso zzso can withstand zzso stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso but not zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso permits zzso to grow under zzso stress even in zzso zzso All stresses tested generated transient zzso of zzso zzso in wild type zzso zzso whereas zzso alone induced prolonged zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Both the zzso transient and survival of cultures subjected to zzso stress was similar for the zzso zzso and zzso However, whereas zzso maintained low zzso zzso predominantly by pumping it out across the plasma zzso the zzso zzso zzso in internal zzso This zzso requires the presence of an zzso zzso zzso which does not play a significant role in salt tolerance of wild type zzso except at zzso zzso zzso levels of the plasma membrane zzso zzso were strongly induced only in zzso whereas zzso was strongly induced in both zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced the salt tolerance of the zzso zzso and the zzso induction of zzso Thus, the zzso expression of a plant zzso zzso pump results in the rapid depletion of zzso zzso and the zzso of an alternate mechanism for surviving saline zzso
