The terminal differentiation of many developing zzso occurs after they zzso their target cells and is triggered by zzso zzso signals that are zzso by zzso zzso zzso Such retrograde signaling zzso the expression of genes that are often distinctive markers of zzso zzso and zzso However, whether long-term maintenance of zzso zzso requires persistent retrograde signaling remains poorly zzso Previously, we demonstrated that retrograde bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso expression of a zzso marker of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Here, we used a genetic technique that zzso targets zzso expression in zzso to test the role of persistent zzso signaling in the maintenance of zzso zzso We show that expression of dominant zzso of zzso signaling selectively in adult zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso zzso which blocks zzso retrograde zzso zzso eliminated retrograde zzso signaling and dramatically zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso deprivation did not affect zzso zzso survival and that zzso expression fully recovered to control levels after the termination of zzso blockade or zzso zzso Our results show that persistent retrograde zzso signaling is required to induce and to subsequently maintain the expression of a zzso expressed zzso marker in a subset of mature zzso zzso We zzso that retrograde maintenance of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and as a consequence, zzso zzso is likely vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease zzso that disrupt zzso connectivity or zzso zzso
