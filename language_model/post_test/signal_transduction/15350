zzso responses arising from the pancreatic zzso cell appear to have a central role in initiating acute zzso Environmental factors that sensitize the zzso cell to harmful stimuli likely have a critical role in many forms of zzso including that induced by alcohol zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso cell and an zzso of zzso are critical, but poorly zzso early zzso zzso While there is firm evidence relating zzso zzso to zzso the importance of other zzso has been less zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso may be activated by mechanisms that are distinct from other zzso Further, unlike the small zzso it may not catalyze the zzso of other zzso These features could affect strategies aimed at zzso zzso to treat zzso zzso zzso signals are required to activate zzso pathways in the zzso zzso The most important is zzso Recent studies have suggested that calcium release through specific calcium channels in the zzso zzso is the means by which pathological zzso in zzso calcium zzso Although the targets of abnormal calcium signaling are unknown, zzso a zzso zzso may serve such a zzso Finally, recent work suggests that an acute acid load might sensitize the zzso cell to zzso zzso zzso aimed at preventing or reversing the effects of an acid load on the zzso may be important for zzso
