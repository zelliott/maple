Signal regulatory protein zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is predominantly expressed in zzso cells zzso Its zzso region binds zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso while its zzso region interacts with zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to be important for development of contact zzso likely as a result of its positive regulation of the zzso by zzso of zzso T zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso regulates DC functions remains zzso Here we found that the number of zzso cells, which represent migratory zzso such as zzso cells zzso or zzso zzso from the skin, in the peripheral zzso zzso zzso was markedly decreased in mice expressing a zzso form of zzso that lacks the zzso region compared with that of zzso zzso zzso In addition, an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the draining zzso zzso zzso after zzso with zzso was markedly blunted in zzso zzso zzso However, migratory ability, as well as expression of zzso of bone zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso mice were not zzso By contrast, the number of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso mice was markedly decreased compared with that of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression of transforming growth zzso zzso II in zzso of zzso zzso mice was markedly decreased compared with that of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is important for zzso of zzso in the skin, as well as of migratory zzso in the zzso but unlikely for migration of these cells from the skin to draining zzso
