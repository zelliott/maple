zzso acid zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso of zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso a master regulator of zzso cell growth and zzso The mechanism by which PA activates zzso signaling has remained zzso Here, we report that PA selectively stimulates zzso but not zzso zzso activity in cells and in zzso Furthermore, we show that PA competes with the zzso zzso zzso binding protein 38 zzso for zzso binding at a site encompassing the zzso binding zzso This leads to PA zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso and rescuing zzso signaling from zzso in zzso zzso D 1, a zzso zzso that is an established upstream regulator of zzso is found to zzso affect zzso interaction, confirming the role of zzso PA in this zzso Interestingly, removal of zzso alone is insufficient to activate zzso zzso and zzso which require PA even when the zzso level is drastically reduced by zzso In conclusion, we propose a dual mechanism for PA zzso of zzso PA zzso zzso from zzso and zzso stimulates the zzso activity of zzso
