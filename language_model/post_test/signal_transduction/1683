A series of zzso based on two or three hydrogen bonding zzso situated in mutually zzso zzso or zzso relationships about an zzso core have been prepared, and their affinities for simple zzso zzso were zzso Of the zzso hosts the zzso compound and to a lesser extent the zzso host exhibit a cooperative zzso binding zzso The two arms function essentially independently in the zzso zzso The mutually zzso zzso host shows dramatically enhanced cooperative zzso zzso changes within the zzso zzso host result in significantly enhanced zzso zzso sensing compared with the more zzso rigid zzso zzso
