The adult cerebral zzso can adapt to environmental zzso Using zzso deprivation as a zzso we find that rapid zzso plasticity exists even in the mature primary visual zzso However, adult cortical plasticity differs from zzso plasticity in two important zzso First, the effect of adult, but not juvenile zzso deprivation is strongly suppressed by administration of zzso just prior to recording visual evoked zzso suggesting that the effect of adult experience can be zzso zzso Second, the effect of deprivation is less persistent over time in adults than in zzso This zzso with the known decline in zzso function during maturation of the visual zzso To compensate for this decline in zzso function, we expressed persistently active zzso and find that it causes adult plasticity to become zzso These results suggest that in development and adulthood, the regulation of a zzso signaling zzso controls the zzso potential of cortical zzso
