zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso share zzso zzso but poorly defined roles in regulating zzso polarity and, in zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso function is vital, as zzso in the human zzso gene cause retinal zzso Here, we report that zzso restricts zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso Reduction of zzso levels rescued zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that limitation of zzso production is a crucial function of zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the molecular network regulating zzso tissue zzso We further show that reduction of zzso or zzso zzso activity or zzso of zzso oxygen species prevented zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso fulfills a protective role during light exposure by limiting zzso damage resulting from zzso zzso complex zzso zzso our results zzso an important mechanism by which zzso functions in zzso organization and the prevention of retinal zzso
