zzso is a representative zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso for various zzso and zzso immune responses in many plant zzso It has been clarified that the zzso signaling in rice requires a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso which specifically binds zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso for zzso signaling but it is not clear whether the plant also requires a zzso zzso for zzso zzso To clarify the zzso of the zzso zzso in these two model plants, we first characterized zzso zzso in zzso Only one of three zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso binding for zzso zzso similar to rice zzso zzso also represented the major zzso protein in the zzso zzso However, the zzso knockout zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso showed zzso defense responses similar to zzso zzso indicating that zzso is zzso functional as a zzso protein but does not contribute to zzso Studies of the zzso binding properties of the zzso of zzso and the zzso receptors consisting of zzso zzso of these molecules indicated that zzso is sufficient for zzso perception by zzso
