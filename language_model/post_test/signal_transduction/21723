zzso is the zzso component of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that processes several zzso zzso such as the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso in human zzso lead to altered zzso zzso and zzso Alzheimer's zzso zzso also play an essential role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is a highly zzso signaling zzso that functions during the development of zzso organisms, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso signaling is sensitive to zzso in zzso trafficking, although the specific mechanisms are largely zzso To identify genes that regulate zzso zzso function, we have performed two genetic screens in zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso We describe here the cloning and identification of 19 zzso including zzso and several genes with previously zzso involvement in zzso zzso The predicted functions of these newly identified genes are consistent with zzso zzso and zzso trafficking mechanisms in zzso and zzso zzso regulation and suggest a novel role for zzso in the zzso
