The effect of a zzso zzso in zzso and steady zzso on the activity of zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso cells was zzso Three zzso flow profiles (16 zzso including impulse flow zzso stress abruptly applied for 3 zzso ramp flow zzso stress smoothly zzso at flow zzso and step flow zzso stress abruptly applied at flow zzso were zzso Relative to zzso controls, impulse flow zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso respectively at 10 zzso as well as the zzso expression of zzso zzso at 30 zzso and zzso zzso at 90 zzso These high levels of zzso expression were sustained for at least 4 zzso In contrast, ramp flow was unable to significantly induce gene expression and even inhibited the zzso of zzso Step flow, which contains both a sharp zzso zzso in zzso stress and a steady zzso zzso zzso only moderate and transient responses, indicating the distinct role of these fluid zzso stimuli in zzso signal zzso The specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited impulse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus these findings zzso the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso in the signaling zzso induced by the zzso zzso in zzso
