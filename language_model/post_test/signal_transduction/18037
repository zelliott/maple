zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by a number of cellular stimuli such as inflammatory zzso and environmental zzso zzso oxygen species also cause zzso of zzso however, the signaling cascade that leads to zzso zzso remains to be zzso Because recent reports showed that expression of zzso a putative zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso zzso family and zzso would be involved in zzso zzso by zzso oxygen zzso An essential role for both zzso and zzso was zzso First, the specific zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso in a zzso manner but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso in response to zzso was completely inhibited in cells derived from transgenic mice deficient in zzso but not zzso Third, expression of a dominant negative zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and zzso zzso Finally, the importance of zzso was further supported by the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex formation in zzso but not zzso zzso These results demonstrate an essential role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and suggest a new zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso by zzso
