zzso in the gene zzso the zzso G protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in subjects with zzso zzso zzso a syndrome of characteristic zzso defects and, in some patients, resistance to multiple hormones that stimulate zzso zzso zzso type zzso As the first step in generating a model of zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso G zzso zzso was disrupted in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells by zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso levels of G zzso zzso zzso and G zzso protein in targeted zzso cells were approximately 50% of levels in zzso zzso zzso In response to 10 zzso zzso and to various zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced in the G zzso knockout zzso cell lines, relative to zzso zzso cells and to five of six zzso cell lines with randomly integrated targeting zzso These results support the role of G zzso zzso in reducing the ability of hormones to generate zzso in subjects with zzso type zzso The targeted disruption of zzso in mouse zzso cells establishes an in zzso system for further studies of the role of G zzso and zzso coupled signal zzso in differentiation and zzso
