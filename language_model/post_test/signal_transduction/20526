zzso sleep is a complex phenomenon governed by the interplay of neural circuits and signaling zzso The impact of genetic zzso on zzso dynamics provides important insights into this complex zzso Here we review the zzso zzso of over 50 transgenic animal models spanning a variety of signaling zzso This zzso literature includes outcomes spanning motor activity patterns, zzso stage architecture, responses to sleep zzso zzso zzso and other zzso such as food zzso temperature challenge, and infection zzso zzso from these animal experiments hold potential to zzso with the well-known zzso zzso as well as the increasingly available human genetic information, especially in patient populations exhibiting zzso zzso
