zzso to light were recorded from zzso horizontal cells, and zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined as response zzso per zzso per rod for dim flashes covering the zzso receptive field zzso Both sensitivity and spatial zzso were found to increase by one order of magnitude between rods and horizontal cells, and by two orders of magnitude between rods and zzso zzso zzso from two zzso bipolar cells showed a 20 times response increase between rods and zzso At absolute threshold for zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the dim flashes produce zzso responses in the zzso The cumulative gain exhibited at each subsequent synaptic transfer from the rods to the zzso cells serves to boost these small zzso signals to the level required for initiation of action zzso in the zzso zzso The convergence of rod signals through increasing spatial zzso serves to decrease the variation of responses to dim zzso thereby increasing the zzso zzso Thus, at absolute threshold for zzso cells, the convergence typically increases the zzso zzso ratio from zzso in rods to zzso in zzso zzso
