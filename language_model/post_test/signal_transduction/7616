zzso zzso zzso growth of human zzso zzso is one of the major obstacles to successful tumor zzso zzso insights into the molecules and pathways signaling zzso cell invasion thus appear of major relevance for the development of targeted and individualized zzso By zzso expression profiling of zzso human tumor biopsy specimens we identified zzso as one of the main zzso zzso in invading zzso cells in zzso and further investigated its role in zzso zzso zzso We employed zzso mimics and zzso to functionally characterize zzso 3' untranslated region zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor reporter zzso to pinpoint zzso targets and signaling zzso and analyzed zzso expression in a large panel of zzso zzso First, we zzso the zzso role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso was then zzso as a direct zzso zzso zzso expression is of zzso relevance in zzso with reduced zzso being associated with significantly lower overall patient survival in both the zzso of zzso Brain zzso Data zzso and The Cancer Genome zzso Of note, zzso regulated both zzso protein expression levels and zzso signaling zzso zzso Finally, in human zzso zzso zzso appeared to account for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and was zzso related to zzso promoter zzso zzso Taken together, we report on a novel molecular zzso mechanism that via zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributes to the zzso zzso zzso at already early stages of zzso zzso with zzso zzso implications for the final outcome of the zzso
