Female zzso resulting from zzso destruction is an zzso and in many cases inevitable, consequence of zzso We show that zzso mouse zzso exposed to therapeutic levels of the zzso drug, zzso zzso undergo zzso however, zzso zzso do not initiate zzso but enter zzso arrest, when treated with zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso is blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso cell zzso zzso from zzso but not zzso female mice display complete resistance to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso with a specific zzso inhibitor of zzso also abrogates the zzso response to zzso These findings indicate that zzso destruction caused by chemotherapy can be prevented by manipulation of zzso signaling zzso
