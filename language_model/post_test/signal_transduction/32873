The zzso zzso zzso is thought to play a role in the zzso of asthma by stimulating mast zzso We previously showed that the human mast cell line zzso expresses zzso and zzso zzso and that both receptors activate zzso zzso via zzso but that only zzso receptors are also coupled to zzso C via zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso receptors induced production of zzso zzso from zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso promotes zzso synthesis has not been zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways are involved in this zzso zzso of zzso with the stable zzso analog zzso zzso activated zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso induced a zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso activity, whereas 10 zzso of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso in parallel with the zzso of zzso also zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the selective zzso zzso 1 inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso production of zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso can regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso and that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways are essential steps in zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso production in zzso
