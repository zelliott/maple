Although zzso of zzso cell zzso precursors occurs in bone zzso the terminal differentiation of these cells takes place outside bone zzso The zzso regulating this process, remains poorly zzso We demonstrated that this process could be zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso In contrast to zzso zzso in zzso and during induced zzso in zzso prevented DC differentiation by promoting the zzso of their zzso Although both zzso activated zzso in zzso zzso cells, they had an opposite effect on zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso whereas zzso inhibited it via zzso of the expression of the zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression by retaining zzso zzso 1 in the complex with the zzso factor zzso on the zzso zzso Our results suggest that DC zzso during induced zzso can be regulated by the nature of the zzso zzso expressed on adjacent zzso zzso
