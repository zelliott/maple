zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a second zzso by liberating zzso from zzso stores and by promoting influx of zzso zzso We examined whether zzso influx zzso zzso zzso liberation in zzso zzso by zzso monitoring of zzso free zzso together with zzso clamp recording of zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso was induced by zzso injections of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso influx was controlled by applying step changes in membrane potential to alter the driving force for zzso zzso zzso zzso potential steps evoked zzso zzso signals zzso two zzso an initial transient peak followed by a slower zzso The initial transient grew steeply over a narrow zzso 40 zzso zzso range but then increased little with further zzso whereas the second component showed a nearly linear zzso zzso zzso The transient zzso signal continued to rise almost unchanged when zzso influx was interrupted by stepping the potential to more positive values after brief zzso In contrast, zzso levels declined zzso when zzso steps were applied after longer intervals during the second component of the zzso zzso zzso Large zzso transient inward zzso membrane currents were evoked during the rising phase of the initial zzso zzso but little current was associated with the second component of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso currents evoked by zzso were zzso at fixed clamp potential by zzso zzso to the bathing solution, and by flash zzso of zzso zzso loaded into the zzso zzso zzso currents were strongly inhibited by prior release of zzso from zzso zzso stores, and vice zzso zzso with paired zzso zzso and paired zzso of zzso showed that responses to both stimuli recovered with similar time zzso zzso We conclude that the transient zzso signal and associated zzso current evoked by zzso arise because zzso entering the zzso triggers zzso release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso Since membrane currents evoked by liberated zzso were much greater than those evoked by zzso entry per se, a major function of zzso zzso entry may be to zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso
