zzso zzso zzso zzso are expected to be effective for zzso cancer because their mechanism of action differs from that of conventional zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso melanoma, as well as its molecular zzso zzso was highly effective against melanoma compared with other commonly used zzso By comparing the gene expression profiles of melanoma cells and normal zzso we defined a subset of genes specifically zzso in melanoma cells by zzso which included zzso a small zzso protein of the Ras zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein increased in zzso melanoma cells in both a zzso and a zzso zzso A decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso expression in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso and suppression of zzso zzso in zzso melanoma zzso These results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso are zzso via the zzso of zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso was zzso and formed a complex with zzso in melanoma cell lines with a zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased the viability of these cells, suggesting that zzso is also an zzso regulator of zzso zzso signaling in zzso
