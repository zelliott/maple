zzso mechanisms by which alpha zzso receptors zzso zzso regulate zzso calcium zzso include stimulation and zzso of cell surface calcium channels, stimulation of calcium release via zzso zzso to zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso C and release of zzso or stimulation of calcium release via zzso to zzso in an zzso zzso These potential mechanisms were explored in cells that expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso permanently zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Each cell type displayed zzso zzso increases in zzso that were blocked by zzso zzso by zzso zzso and largely unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, calcium release was associated with zzso zzso and was blocked by an inhibitor of zzso C zzso When expressed in zzso cells, a zzso zzso which has the zzso and zzso zzso of the third zzso loop zzso with beta zzso sequence poorly coupled to zzso in zzso zzso zzso and likewise displayed virtually no zzso to increased zzso These results all point toward a zzso versus a zzso zzso zzso triggering release of zzso calcium zzso The possibility that zzso zzso zzso released from zzso zzso is the mechanism of zzso zzso was explored in zzso cells by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso portion of the beta zzso zzso Both beta gamma zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso while not affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso via zzso zzso Thus, zzso couple to calcium release via zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is present in multiple cell types and should be considered a major signal zzso zzso of this zzso
