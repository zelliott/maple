It is known that insect zzso increase zzso and fluid zzso in the Aedes aegypti zzso zzso causing a rapid drop of the zzso resistance and increasing zzso zzso from the zzso towards the zzso zzso The zzso is composed of both principal and zzso zzso The main route for increased zzso influx upon zzso treatment is proposed to be zzso with zzso junctions acquiring increased zzso selectivity and zzso zzso zzso treatment renders the zzso aegypti zzso a zzso zzso and under this model the zzso zzso is zzso to be expressed in principal zzso However, in another zzso the fruit fly zzso zzso the main route for zzso transport is zzso through zzso zzso In both the fruit fly and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso cells, where it regulates zzso zzso zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso similarly, the zzso cells express the zzso zzso This was confirmed through zzso with two specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is detected as a 75 zzso band in western zzso These results indicate that the currently accepted model for zzso transport must be re-evaluated in zzso aegypti and suggest the zzso regulatory signals controlling zzso junctions originate in the zzso zzso
