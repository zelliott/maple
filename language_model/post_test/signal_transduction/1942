In the present study, we examined the role of the recently identified zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso assigned as zzso in zzso zzso zzso is expressed by most zzso zzso zzso and by a minor subset of circulating zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso T zzso We report that zzso which has a broad specificity for zzso class zzso and zzso zzso behaves as a zzso upon T cell zzso zzso zzso enhance the zzso proliferation of freshly isolated zzso peripheral blood zzso and zzso T cell zzso Further, the engagement of zzso receptors on normal zzso T zzso populations lacking zzso zzso and zzso molecules by zzso class I molecules results in an increased zzso cell zzso Further, we found that zzso zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chains upon zzso cell zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso provides zzso signals leading to the expansion of a minor subset of circulating zzso including zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso T zzso lacking zzso zzso
