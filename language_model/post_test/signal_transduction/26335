Since the plant hormone zzso zzso was discovered as a zzso toxin that caused abnormal zzso of rice zzso the zzso function of zzso has mainly been investigated in relation to the regulation of plant zzso However, an indispensable role for zzso in root growth has been zzso by using severely zzso plants, either with a gene zzso in zzso zzso or which have been treated by an inhibitor of zzso zzso The molecular sequence of zzso zzso has also been studied to understand zzso functions in root zzso 

This review addresses research progress on the zzso functions of zzso in root zzso zzso stimulation of zzso growth by zzso is important for the regulation of plant height and root zzso Thus the zzso level of zzso and/or the zzso sensitivity of shoots and roots plays a role in determining the zzso ratio of the plant zzso Since the zzso ratio is an important zzso for agricultural production, control of zzso production and zzso sensitivity may provide a strategy for improving agricultural zzso The sequence of zzso signal zzso has recently been zzso and some component molecules are suggested as candidate in zzso regulatory sites and as points for the artificial manipulation of zzso growth zzso 

This paper zzso zzso the breakthrough zzso experiments that show that root growth is regulated by zzso in a lower concentration range than is required for shoot zzso zzso research on the regulation of zzso zzso pathways that are known predominantly to control shoot zzso and zzso recent research on zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso which have been suggested to participate in zzso growth zzso This provides useful information to suggest a possible strategy for the selective control of shoot and root growth, and to explain how zzso plays a role in zzso and zzso plants with tall or short, and slender or thick zzso zzso
