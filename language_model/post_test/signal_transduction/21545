zzso acid zzso one component of oxidized zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso Early growth response zzso zzso an important zzso factor, regulates expression of an array of genes involved in vascular zzso Whether and how zzso regulates the zzso machinery of zzso gene is unknown and is addressed in this zzso 

We found that zzso markedly zzso zzso zzso and protein in zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso stability and nuclear zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso gene expression is controlled at the zzso zzso zzso gene analyses have shown that the zzso to zzso zzso region of the zzso promoter contains regulatory zzso zzso mobility shift zzso reveal that the zzso activities of both zzso and zzso to the zzso and zzso motifs of the zzso promoter are markedly elevated in response to zzso The increased binding activity depends on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a series of deleted or zzso zzso zzso gene zzso along with dominant negative zzso zzso analysis revealed that the 2 zzso sites and the 2 zzso zzso sites in the zzso promoter are required for zzso zzso zzso gene zzso 

Our data reveal that zzso regulates zzso expression via zzso factors zzso and zzso These results establish a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso Our results imply that elevated zzso levels may, through zzso of zzso which regulates an array of zzso zzso exacerbate zzso zzso
