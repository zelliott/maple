The zzso underlying the zzso zzso and toxic effects of carbon monoxide zzso is linked to its affinity for reduced transition zzso We investigated CO signaling in the zzso where zzso zzso the CO most important zzso carrier is highly concentrated inside red blood cells zzso 

By combining zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we found that CO treatment of whole blood increases the concentration of reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso which is linked to a significant zzso zzso In addition, this process zzso does not activate zzso zzso zzso boosts the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso activity, and zzso decreases oxidized zzso zzso Moreover, zzso concentration was partially decreased in the presence of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our zzso results show for the first time that, besides zzso zzso zzso occurs also at zzso of the zzso providing a new potential zzso source zzso zzso 

This work provides new insights on the signaling and zzso properties of CO in human blood, identifying zzso as a major source of zzso release and the zzso as a zzso mechanism supporting zzso zzso 

zzso zzso increase is a new zzso process linking a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This mechanism may be involved in the zzso responses aimed to counteract stress conditions in zzso zzso
