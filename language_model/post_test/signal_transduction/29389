The zzso commonly used zzso zzso signaling cascade plays multiple integral roles in zzso development in zzso zzso Using a functional zzso approach, we found that the zzso factor zzso a component of the zzso pathway, is a candidate zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso genetically interacts with zzso zzso to control zzso zzso in zzso of zzso I, as does zzso However, zzso the zzso zzso zzso partner, does not have a role in this zzso Interestingly, we find that zzso and zzso but not zzso promote the expression of a negative regulator of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso consensus motifs are present upstream of the zzso open reading zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso signaling at multiple points to regulate different aspects of zzso zzso germ cell zzso These two highly zzso pathways with major regulatory roles in proliferation and differentiation likely have multiple mechanisms for zzso during development across many zzso
