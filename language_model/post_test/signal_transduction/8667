zzso zzso is a common cause for zzso zzso zzso Present study investigated the beneficial role of zzso acid zzso against zzso zzso induced diabetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso injury was associated with increased kidney weight to body weight ratio, zzso area and volume, blood zzso zzso zzso nitrogen and serum zzso This zzso zzso increased the productions of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso nitrogen species zzso enhanced zzso zzso protein zzso and decreased zzso zzso defense in the kidney zzso In addition, zzso activates zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso with a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso the zzso stress responsive signaling zzso we found the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso tissue of the diabetic zzso Furthermore, zzso disturbed the equilibrium between the pro and zzso members of zzso family of proteins as well as reduced zzso membrane potential, elevated the concentration of zzso zzso C and zzso zzso Treatment of AA effectively ameliorated diabetic zzso zzso by reducing zzso as well as zzso stress and zzso the zzso zzso zzso studies also support the experimental zzso zzso suggest that AA might act as a beneficial agent against the zzso zzso developed in zzso zzso
