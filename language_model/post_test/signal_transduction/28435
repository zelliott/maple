zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by T cells is considered crucial for immunity against zzso tuberculosis zzso We evaluated zzso production in tuberculosis in the context of signaling molecules known to regulate zzso zzso Two populations of patients who have active tuberculosis were identified, based on their T cell responses to the zzso High zzso tuberculosis patients displayed significant zzso zzso T cell proliferation and zzso production, whereas low zzso tuberculosis patients displayed weak or no T cell responses to zzso zzso The expression of the signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso on cells from tuberculosis patients was zzso correlated with zzso production in those zzso Moreover, patients with a zzso zzso gene displayed immune responses to zzso tuberculosis similar to those of high zzso tuberculosis zzso In contrast to zzso T cell expression of zzso was directly correlated with responsiveness to zzso tuberculosis zzso Our data suggest that expression of zzso interferes with zzso responses whereas zzso expression contributes to zzso zzso responses in zzso The study further suggests that zzso and zzso might be focal points for therapeutic zzso of T cell zzso responses in zzso
