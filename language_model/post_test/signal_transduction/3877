The zzso organizer of the zzso zzso can be subdivided into two discrete activities, namely trunk organizer and head zzso Several factors zzso from the organizer that are involved in trunk organization are thought to act by zzso zzso zzso With the exception of the zzso factor zzso little is known about zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso leads to the induction of complete secondary zzso including a zzso This induction does not require expression of the zzso marker of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that cells are directly shifting to zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso activity results from the simultaneous repression of zzso and zzso zzso and they suggest a mechanism for zzso induction by the zzso
