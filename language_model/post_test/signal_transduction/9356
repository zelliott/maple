The zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso links the control of zzso translation, cell growth, and metabolism to diverse zzso zzso zzso of zzso can lead to zzso zzso zzso are naturally occurring products that act as potent tumor zzso They activate zzso of protein zzso C zzso and stimulate the zzso zzso signaling zzso They also activate zzso zzso Previous work indicated that zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depends upon zzso and may involve zzso However, the precise zzso through which they activate zzso remains zzso Recent studies have implicated both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso signaling via zzso of zzso (a regulator of zzso and/or the zzso component zzso However, the relative importance of each of these zzso and zzso events for the zzso of zzso signaling is zzso The recent availability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of improved specificity allowed us to address the roles of these protein zzso in controlling zzso in a variety of human and zzso cell zzso In zzso we used specific zzso against zzso and zzso to further test their roles in regulating zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso are zzso for the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso in all cell types zzso Our data also reveal striking diversity in the requirements for zzso in the control of zzso between different cell types, pointing to additional signaling connections between zzso zzso and zzso which do not involve zzso This study provides important information for the design of efficient strategies to combat the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso
