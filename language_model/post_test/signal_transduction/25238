Inner cell mass zzso and zzso cell lineages diverge early in zzso in response to a complex combination of cellular and molecular zzso zzso The resulting differences in zzso requirements, cell positioning and zzso are considered as some of the major causes underlying the differential sensitivity of ICM and zzso cell lines to zzso zzso In most instances, ICM cells appear less resistant to disruption than zzso cells, and past observations suggest that zzso of zzso is probably one of the mechanisms leading to selective ICM depletion at the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this lineage below a certain threshold level may then prevent the ICM core from providing sufficient zzso stem cells during zzso and from sending regulatory signals to the zzso leading to compromised zzso zzso The aim of this review article is to discuss the above observations and to show the value of the impact of zzso on zzso metabolism and development as an exciting model for further zzso
