zzso plays a fundamental role in innate immunity and in several important inflammatory diseases as the zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso itself is activated in different zzso complexes, which assemble in response to a variety of zzso and zzso zzso More recently, zzso a zzso type of programmed cell death, has been identified that is able to support zzso zzso and zzso in triggering an inflammatory zzso Whereas these zzso activities are well zzso this review also highlights zzso pathways and molecules activated by zzso There is evidence that zzso supports cell survival by zzso of zzso induction of membrane repair and regulation of unconventional zzso of certain zzso The zzso effects of processing of other downstream targets, such as proteins involved in zzso or zzso of zzso are less well zzso However, there is increasing evidence that zzso contributes to innate and zzso zzso defense mechanisms, repair and zzso conditions by the regulation of several different and partially opposing zzso
