zzso plays an important role as a multiple functional zzso binding nuclear protein in cell cycle progress, zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso by zzso during zzso However, its precise impact on these essential cellular functions remains zzso The purpose of this study is to further zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso signal zzso regulation of cell growth and cell proliferation in zzso cell zzso 

By using gene targeting method, we isolated a zzso form of zzso in zzso cells and described its effect on cell growth process and signal zzso Southern, zzso and Western zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to investigate the zzso zzso 

A slower growth rate zzso hours growth zzso and longer S phase zzso hours zzso was observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion resulted in increased amounts of dead cells, and expansion of S phase in zzso zzso Upon B cell zzso the zzso level of zzso zzso on zzso was observed to be significantly lower in zzso zzso 

The zzso rich domain of zzso is involved in cell growth control by modulating the function of zzso in S phase or earlier and the functions as an zzso zzso in B cell signal zzso zzso
