Two structurally related forms of zzso calcium release channels that can mediate the release of zzso calcium have been zzso the zzso receptors zzso and the zzso zzso receptors zzso Each channel responds to distinct pathways for zzso The zzso is activated by zzso and the zzso is thought to be activated by calcium or by another second zzso zzso zzso It has been proposed that each type of channel zzso a specialized pool of zzso zzso and it is not understood why some cell types require more than one form of zzso calcium release zzso The present study was designed to examine whether the zzso can substitute for the zzso during zzso zzso zzso expression was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso These zzso with reduced levels of zzso demonstrated a marked delay in the time course of zzso zzso The cloned skeletal muscle zzso was then expressed in zzso zzso zzso that were deficient in zzso zzso studies showed that the properties of the cloned zzso expressed in zzso were comparable to those of the native zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso but expressing zzso were able to undergo zzso maturation with a time course comparable to that seen in zzso zzso when caffeine was used to activate zzso and induce zzso calcium zzso These studies show that zzso can substitute for the zzso as the zzso calcium release channel required for zzso zzso maturation and that zzso calcium release is important for controlling the rate of zzso zzso
