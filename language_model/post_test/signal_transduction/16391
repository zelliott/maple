In cardiovascular disease, the protective zzso zzso is impaired due to a decreased pool of zzso zzso zzso accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso However, no direct method to detect cellular zzso zzso other than its zzso by the new therapeutic class of zzso zzso such as BAY zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso based on the interaction of the optical active prosthetic zzso group and the attached zzso zzso zzso can be used to detect changes in cellular zzso zzso zzso The partly overlap of the zzso spectrum of zzso and zzso allows energy transfer from the zzso to the zzso which reduces the intensity of zzso zzso Loss of the prosthetic group, zzso by zzso stress or by replacement with the zzso zzso BAY zzso prevented the energy transfer resulting in increased zzso zzso loss was zzso by an observed decrease in zzso zzso activity, reduced zzso protein levels, and an increased effect of BAY zzso The use of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso dye that was not zzso by zzso as controls further validated that the increase in zzso was due to the loss of the prosthetic zzso zzso The present approach is based on the cellular expression of an engineered zzso zzso limiting is zzso to zzso expression zzso Nevertheless, it allows to monitor zzso zzso regulation in living cells and future enhancements might be able to extend this approach to in zzso zzso
