The role of zzso as a second zzso in zzso cells has been appreciated for almost 3 zzso The advent of fluorescent zzso indicators has allowed the monitoring of zzso zzso in suspensions of these zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso usually show an initial zzso transient followed by a maintained zzso The former has been shown to be due to zzso release from one or more zzso stores, the latter due to zzso of zzso operated zzso entry zzso More recently it has been recognized that many cells show distinct maintained zzso behavior when examined by single cell optical zzso It is proposed here that these zzso are the consequence of zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso release and zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as zzso pumps are zzso These zzso allow more exact regulation of a zzso controlled second zzso such as zzso
