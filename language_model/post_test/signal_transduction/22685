zzso to the central nervous system leads to cellular changes not only in the affected zzso but also in adjacent zzso zzso This zzso zzso is a consistent feature in almost all forms of brain pathology and appears to reflect an zzso program which plays an important role for the repair of the injured nervous zzso Recent work in mice that are zzso for different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) has begun to shed light on the molecular signals that regulate this cellular zzso Here, the availability of zzso animals with reduced or abolished zzso zzso provides a direct approach to determine the function of the different components of the cellular response leading to repair and zzso following neural zzso
