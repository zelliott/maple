zzso systems enable bacteria to sense changes in their environment and adjust gene expression in zzso Multiple zzso systems could function as a zzso sensor to discriminate environmental zzso A zzso sensor is composed of a set of sensors that are zzso activated to different zzso by many zzso such that their collective activity pattern defines the zzso Using promoter reporters and flow zzso we measured the response of three zzso systems in zzso coli that have been previously reported to respond to many environmental stimuli zzso zzso and zzso A chemical library was screened for the ability to activate the sensors and 13 zzso were identified that produce different patterns of sensor zzso The activities of the three systems are zzso with each other and the zzso of the inducing zzso Five of the seven possible zzso patterns generated by three sensors are zzso This data demonstrate one mechanism by which bacteria are able to use a limited set of sensors to identify a diverse set of compounds and environmental zzso
