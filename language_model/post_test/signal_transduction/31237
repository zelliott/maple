zzso cells play an important role in inflammatory disorders, as they control the recruitment of zzso into inflamed tissue and the formation of new blood zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in the production of zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are therefore considered important candidates for the treatment of inflammatory zzso In the present study, we propose a novel strategy to counteract these processes by delivery of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso into zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was developed by zzso of zzso to human serum zzso zzso using a novel zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso cells was introduced by zzso of zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso The final products contained an average of nine zzso and six zzso groups per zzso The zzso zzso displayed high stability in buffers and culture zzso but released zzso slowly upon competition with zzso zzso like zzso zzso bound to zzso expressing zzso cells zzso zzso zzso vein zzso zzso with low zzso affinity and was subsequently zzso When zzso were treated with zzso to induce inflammatory events, zzso with zzso partially inhibited zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the developed zzso zzso provide a novel means to counteract inflammation disorders such as zzso zzso
