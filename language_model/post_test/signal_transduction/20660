New vessel formation plays a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were found to contribute to zzso diseases and interference with zzso zzso may be a novel target for these zzso zzso zzso was reported to exhibit zzso zzso Basing on these zzso we proposed that zzso may affect zzso function to exert novel zzso zzso In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of zzso on multiple aspects of zzso function and explored the underlying mechanisms zzso 

zzso were cultured from bone zzso derived zzso zzso The potential effects of zzso on zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, zzso in zzso tube formation were zzso The results showed that zzso II (1 zzso enhanced zzso migration, zzso in zzso tube formation but had no effect on cell zzso zzso (75 and 100 zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso and 50 zzso zzso zzso could reverse the decrease of zzso zzso We found for the first time that zzso zzso zzso dose zzso attenuated migration, zzso and in zzso tube formation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso could reverse the zzso of zzso function induced by zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso zzso In addition, the underlying mechanisms were zzso The results revealed that zzso markedly zzso active zzso zzso by zzso II and inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso resulted in a notable zzso of zzso in zzso tube formation, suggesting that zzso suppression played a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggested that zzso attenuated the promotion of zzso function zzso by zzso II and exhibited novel zzso effect via zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be served as a novel therapeutic agent for zzso diseases zzso
