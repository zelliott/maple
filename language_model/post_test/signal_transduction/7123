zzso cardiac zzso cells zzso have been proven suitable for stem cell zzso zzso marker zzso and its zzso the stem cell factor zzso are associated with the functions of proliferation and zzso In our previous study, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso could enhance the expression of zzso However, the mechanism is zzso 

zzso were isolated from adult mouse hearts, and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso cell sorting magnetic zzso The cells were cultured with zzso zzso expression was measured by western zzso and zzso the proliferation and migration of cells were measured by zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso global zzso activity was measured by zzso activity zzso zzso and DNA zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could enhance the expression of zzso which results in the promoting of zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso stimulation inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and global zzso activity, which led to significant zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso and zzso expression and global zzso activity, and by subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso
