Our previous studies have shown that a zzso zzso channel is highly expressed in zzso human zzso zzso cells and is suppressed in the early stages of zzso zzso cell zzso In the present study, we report that zzso of the zzso channel activity by zzso zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso as measured by DNA zzso Cell cycle mapping indicated that zzso cells were arrested in zzso phase after zzso treatment with zzso zzso of zzso cells at the zzso boundary of the cell cycle with zzso revealed that zzso cells past the zzso checkpoint were capable of entering S phase and zzso DNA independently of the channel zzso zzso cell zzso measured by zzso marker protein zzso revealed that the effect of zzso was to cause growth arrest and that it did not cause zzso zzso of zzso protein accompanied zzso of zzso cell proliferation and suggested that suppression of zzso channel activity by zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso cell volume increased 35 zzso zzso after zzso treatment, which could be an early event triggering zzso of zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that a zzso zzso channel may play an important role in the zzso of zzso signals in zzso zzso
