Under the influence of zzso associated with innate zzso natural killer zzso cells rapidly become activated and migrate to sites of zzso Upon contact with infected zzso they zzso release zzso and/or kill cells harboring zzso Multiple zzso and zzso receptors can provide the integrated signals that trigger this zzso zzso zzso Recent work has begun to define the zzso for these receptors in the context of infection by certain well-studied zzso These results, in addition to future work involving other zzso will provide an understanding of the molecules present on zzso cells that mark them as targets of innate zzso
