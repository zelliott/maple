zzso signaling regulates smooth muscle cell zzso and is critical for vascular zzso One zzso target is smooth muscle zzso zzso a differentiated smooth muscle cell zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso zzso and directly zzso zzso zzso Using primary human smooth muscle cells, we show that expression of the zzso active zzso of human zzso zzso or zzso receptors increase zzso zzso zzso also induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1) and zzso in a zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso effects of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and both are strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso This antagonism does not depend on zzso zzso activity and occurs at the zzso zzso Competitive zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso does not disrupt the association of zzso and zzso which form a complex in the presence or absence of zzso However, zzso suppresses zzso binding to the zzso promoter, as measured by zzso zzso and zzso of an zzso promoter reporter spanning sequences zzso zzso expression was regulated similarly following zzso zzso zzso in smooth muscle cells by zzso with zzso cells, and this effect was also sensitive to zzso zzso zzso defined zzso activity may constitute a negative feedback mechanism of zzso zzso Our study presents a novel mechanism by which a balance between zzso signaling and zzso activity determines the expression of smooth muscle differentiation markers including zzso
