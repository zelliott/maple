In seeking an explanation for the complexity of tissue development, biologists are obliged to explain lineage commitment, the events that dictate whether or not a zzso cell will differentiate into one cell type or zzso Such explanations have been sought across a broad spectrum of biological systems, although in no case has a full zzso standing been zzso For zzso attention has been focused on the lineage commitment of a T cell zzso to becoming either a zzso T cell or an zzso T zzso In this review, we compare the signals that zzso may receive from the zzso T cell zzso zzso with zzso from zzso These signals may zzso zzso zzso or cement the zzso lineage decision, in concert with signals from additional zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso events, particularly those zzso by the zzso may in the near future contribute to a molecular definition of lineage zzso
