Resistance to zzso chemotherapy develops in the majority of patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso Platinum compounds form zzso zzso that mediate DNA zzso and induce zzso DNA zzso Because the cellular response to zzso zzso is partly zzso by zzso pathway, we evaluated the presence of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso and correlated these with platinum resistance and clinical zzso zzso zzso revealed nuclear zzso (a surrogate of zzso zzso in over half of zzso patient specimens zzso with more common occurrence in the clear cell zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso revealed that zzso target genes were zzso in tumors with nuclear zzso for zzso zzso analysis also showed zzso of zzso target genes in clear cell zzso compared with other zzso zzso In addition, zzso sequence analysis revealed genetic zzso in zzso of clear cell samples and zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and resistance to zzso in zzso zzso patients with evidence of zzso zzso zzso had fewer complete clinical responses to zzso therapy, were enriched for platinum resistance, and had shorter median overall survival compared with those who did not show evidence of zzso zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso zzso in zzso and they suggest a previously zzso role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso responses in this zzso
