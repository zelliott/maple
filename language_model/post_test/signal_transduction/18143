The cardiac zzso is the most abundant cell type present in the zzso and is mainly responsible for the deposition of zzso zzso zzso Important components of cardiac zzso include structural and adhesive proteins such as collagen and zzso Excess deposition of cardiac zzso zzso has been associated with the zzso mechanical overload of the zzso zzso the role of cardiac zzso in zzso zzso and zzso to mechanical stimuli is of great zzso The development of in zzso strain zzso has allowed scientists to investigate the effects of mechanical stimuli on cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso receptors zzso which couple mechanical stimuli to functional zzso Mechanical stimulation of cardiac zzso has been shown to result in zzso of various signal zzso zzso The application of defined mechanical stimuli to cultured cardiac zzso has been associated with zzso gene zzso growth factor production, release and/or zzso as well as zzso zzso Ultimately, for zzso to develop the overproduction of zzso must overcome any associated increases in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso production may follow direct or indirect pathways through the zzso or zzso action of growth zzso Given the complex nature of the zzso milieu of the working heart, additional research is needed to further our understanding of the roles that mechanical stimuli play in excess deposition of zzso zzso
