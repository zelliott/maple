zzso of the zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso by zzso leads to the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and then to zzso zzso and reorganization into stress fibers in zzso zzso In turn, this triggers zzso cell zzso Yet, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that couple zzso to zzso Here, we found that zzso increased by twofold the activity of the small zzso zzso and that the expression of two different zzso active forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to a marked increase in the formation of stress fibers that was sensitive to zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, the expression of a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and of its direct target zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is upstream of zzso in response to the zzso of zzso by zzso In contrast, we found that neither zzso nor zzso was involved in the zzso zzso reorganization induced by zzso Using a zzso zzso of the major zzso site zzso on zzso we found that the zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of both zzso and zzso in response to zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso on zzso is required to trigger the sequential zzso of zzso and zzso and to drive the zzso zzso zzso in stress fibers in zzso cells exposed to zzso
