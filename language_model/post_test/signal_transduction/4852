zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that causes zzso zzso in many commercially important fish zzso Its ability to adapt to and thrive in diverse environments outside and inside of its hosts zzso us to investigate the roles of the previously identified 33 putative zzso signal zzso systems zzso in zzso zzso In this work, we successfully constructed deletion zzso in each of the response regulator zzso suggesting that none of the zzso are essential for cell viability in zzso zzso The zzso were further examined for roles in zzso formation, zzso resistance, stress response, expression and zzso of proteins involved in either the type III zzso system zzso or type VI zzso system zzso as well as zzso Through these zzso we identified four regulators of zzso development, two regulators of zzso resistance, and four regulators involved in stress zzso We found that two regulators, zzso and zzso are essential for the zzso of zzso zzso and further demonstrated that these two regulators have zzso and independent contributions to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the complete loss of both the zzso and zzso zzso while zzso partially regulated the expression of zzso and zzso genes through zzso and was essential for resistance to zzso zzso This work suggested that these two response regulators are involved in the regulation of the complex zzso network of this zzso and merit as candidate genes for live attenuated vaccine zzso
