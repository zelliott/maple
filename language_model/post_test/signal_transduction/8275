Regulatory proteins play critical roles in controlling the zzso of various cellular processes during the entire life span of an zzso Leaf zzso an integral part of the plant zzso program, is fine-tuned by a complex zzso regulatory network ensuring a successful switch to the terminal life zzso To expand our understanding on how zzso control coordinates leaf zzso we characterized zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso factor that functions as a negative regulator of zzso zzso To gain insight into the interplay of zzso and plant defense signaling zzso we employed a collection of zzso allowing us to specifically define the role of zzso in the salicylic zzso signaling zzso and to further dissect the zzso of signal zzso pathways during the onset of zzso in zzso zzso Our results provide strong evidence that zzso influences plant zzso and defense signaling zzso These studies could form the basis for further unraveling of these two complex zzso regulatory zzso
