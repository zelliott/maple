We evaluated expression of 50 genes zzso zzso involved in zzso cellular growth, and various zzso in zzso zzso tissue when calves were fed conventional milk zzso zzso and starter zzso or enhanced MR and enhanced zzso Male zzso calves were fed zzso control MR zzso crude protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso plus conventional starter zzso zzso dry matter zzso or a zzso MR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso of body zzso plus zzso starter zzso zzso dry matter zzso Groups of calves in control and zzso were harvested after 43 d zzso 5) and 71 d zzso 10) of zzso zzso zzso from 5 calves (3 to 42 d zzso in each group was used for transcript profiling using quantitative reverse zzso zzso No differences were observed for plasma zzso zzso concentration but zzso increased by zzso 10 regardless of zzso zzso mass zzso was greater in calves consuming the zzso diet and corresponded with overall greater serum zzso A marked zzso of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso was observed, zzso with zzso of expression of genes involved in fatty acid zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Higher relative percentage zzso abundance of zzso zzso of total genes zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso underscored its importance for zzso cell energy zzso Higher zzso expression and blood zzso fatty acids at zzso 5 due to zzso were suggestive of more extensive zzso fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso cells during the zzso zzso In contrast, calves fed control consumed more starter during the zzso phase, which likely increased production of volatile fatty acids and accounted for higher expression of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 2 zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein receptors for zzso fatty acids was zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso increased markedly with age and was correlated with the increase in blood zzso zzso zzso of genes involved in cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso was greater for zzso primarily during the zzso period and corresponded with greater serum zzso The greater zzso mass in calves fed zzso zzso underscores the importance of feeding high-quality starter and indicates that zzso of the diet, by providing zzso fuel for zzso zzso cells, is a primary driver of zzso development zzso From a zzso standpoint, the zzso increase in expression of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso more abundant than zzso suggests a key role in controlling biological processes driving zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso may provide the means for nutritional regulation of rumen zzso
