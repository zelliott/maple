We showed previously that transformation by zzso and zzso zzso including zzso results in zzso between surface stimulation by zzso growth factor, zzso and serum and zzso of zzso zzso C zzso this zzso does not involve zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso levels zzso Alonso, zzso zzso Morgan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Santos, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso In this study, we zzso normal and zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso thus directly zzso zzso G zzso and bypassing the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were significantly impaired in transformed cells when compared with those in their normal counterparts, suggesting that the zzso of zzso is the result, at least in part, of functional impairment at the zzso zzso Transformation by zzso zzso has also been reported to result in enhanced zzso response to zzso resulting from increased zzso numbers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso We demonstrate here that transformation by other zzso and zzso zzso also results in increased responsiveness to zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso However, there is no direct correlation between the number of receptors and the enhancement in zzso suggesting that other factors besides zzso number are also involved in the enhanced zzso We propose that a common effect of transformation by zzso and zzso zzso is functional zzso of zzso G proteins and that a similar modification of different kinds of G proteins may account for the zzso zzso of signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso
