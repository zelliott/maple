We studied the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso free calcium zzso in freshly dispersed zzso cells from zzso in the zzso phase of the zzso zzso After the blockade of zzso with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso The rank order of alpha zzso in zzso zzso response to zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts on zzso to increase zzso influx as well as zzso release from zzso zzso zzso the blocker of the zzso pump in the zzso zzso abolished the release but did not affect the zzso zzso toxin zzso inhibited the influx but failed to change the zzso zzso an zzso zzso channel blocker, nearly abolished the zzso The peak increase in zzso caused by zzso was reached within 20 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were also decreased at 20 zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso channel zzso whereas zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso content by applying zzso zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso a zzso C zzso reduced the zzso release by zzso and zzso Our results suggested that 1) zzso of zzso zzso zzso influx through opening zzso zzso channels as well as inducing zzso release from zzso stores, and 2) a zzso G protein couples zzso to zzso zzso leading to a decrease in zzso formation which may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, our results are consistent with the zzso of zzso to a zzso G protein zzso to release zzso from zzso zzso
