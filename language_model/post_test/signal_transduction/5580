zzso recognition alone is insufficient for the zzso of zzso immune responses zzso by conventional zzso Additional signals that indicate the origin of the zzso are also zzso These signals are generally provided by the innate immune system upon recognition of zzso microbial structures by a variety of pattern recognition receptors zzso The zzso receptors zzso are the zzso family of zzso and control the zzso of zzso immune responses to a variety of zzso and zzso However, recent studies have questioned the role of zzso in the induction of zzso responses and, thus, this issue has become zzso In contrast to earlier studies supporting a role for zzso in zzso responses, these studies used zzso zzso rather than native zzso for zzso but did not consider the potential effect of zzso zzso on zzso Here, we show that commonly used zzso zzso unlike native zzso are inherently zzso This zzso is zzso but the T and B cell responses induced are primarily zzso rather than zzso Thus, although zzso have zzso activity, it is distinct from classical zzso which induce immune responses directed at the zzso zzso Our results thus highlight an unappreciated and unique zzso of zzso zzso and provide an experimental explanation for a seeming zzso between published zzso
