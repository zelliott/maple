zzso zzso zzso is now recognized as an important signaling agent in plant growth and defense response to environmental zzso zzso has dual functions in plant cell zzso which is largely dependent on its concentration in the zzso zzso zzso A lethal level of zzso zzso low or zzso causes cell death, whereas a moderate level of zzso benefits plant growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso help control the zzso zzso in the zzso and thus contributing to the mediation of plant growth and defense response upon environmental zzso In this review, we zzso zzso signaling in plants and highlight the correlation between zzso zzso control and programmed cell zzso
