zzso growth factor zzso otherwise known as scatter factor zzso is a recently identified zzso which exerts a wide spectrum of biological functions on a variety of cell zzso Its zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso Over the past few years, the structure, function and signal zzso pathways of zzso and its zzso have become zzso The zzso is now known to play important roles in the regulation of both normal zzso processes as well as pathological zzso This review zzso recent progress involving zzso and its zzso and discusses their role in cell biology, organ zzso cancer and other zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso growth factor originally identified as a potent zzso agent for rat zzso zzso studies have shown that it is zzso for a wide range of zzso cells and not limited to zzso Its zzso as a zzso zzso promoted its independent discovery and naming of scatter factor zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso acid sequences have revealed that the two molecules are the zzso A number of zzso agents are known to stimulate cellular zzso however, it is the function of zzso as a potent zzso zzso and zzso agent on the diverse variety of cell types that makes the discovery of zzso factor one of the most interesting stories in terms of identification of novel zzso
