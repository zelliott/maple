zzso hormone zzso exerts an anabolic action on bone but the mechanisms are incompletely zzso We showed previously that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso signaling zzso via the transforming growth factor zzso signaling zzso zzso to zzso zzso differentiation and zzso Here, we examined which actions of zzso are zzso in stimulating the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For this, the zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso zzso in which the site normally zzso by zzso is zzso from zzso to zzso was zzso zzso induced total zzso and reduced zzso zzso levels at 1, 6, and 24 h in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso induction of total zzso and reduction of zzso zzso levels at 6 and 24 zzso but not at 1 zzso indicating that the early effects occur independently of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cell clones in which zzso was zzso expressed demonstrated elevated zzso levels, although alkaline zzso zzso activity and zzso were zzso In contrast, zzso cell clones in which zzso zzso was zzso expressed exhibited increased zzso activity and zzso that were decreased by the zzso zzso zzso although the zzso levels induced in these cells were not zzso In conclusion, the present study indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso levels via zzso independently of, and zzso on, zzso in the early and later induction zzso zzso
