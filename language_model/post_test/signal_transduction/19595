The zzso complex is the key regulator of zzso zzso signaling and shows remarkable selectivity of zzso zzso In retinal zzso zzso is bound to the membrane anchor zzso and the complex regulates visual zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso is instead associated with a zzso zzso zzso and regulates reward zzso Switching this selective zzso composition of the complex in rod zzso allowed us to study the molecular underpinning of signaling specificity in diverse zzso zzso We have found that both membrane zzso zzso play a zzso role in regulating protein levels of zzso and enhancing the ability of zzso complexes to stimulate zzso activity of G zzso However, notable differences exist in the zzso targeting of alternatively configured zzso Unlike zzso which relies on passive targeting mechanisms for the delivery to the outer segments of the zzso zzso is excluded from this location and is instead specifically targeted to the plasma zzso zzso complexes could be zzso to the outer zzso where they are capable of regulating the zzso cascade by the active targeting signals derived from zzso These findings illustrate the diversity of the zzso signaling regulation by zzso complexes achieved by differential recruitment of the membrane zzso
