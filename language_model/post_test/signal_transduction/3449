The zzso process in bone yields numerous zzso and zzso that mediate zzso between zzso and zzso and also serve to attract and support zzso tumor zzso The zzso tumor cells disturb the equilibrium in bone that zzso as skeletal zzso The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso mediates an interaction between tumor cells and zzso and influences zzso differentiation in response to tumor zzso We have determined that breast tumor cells have an activated zzso zzso characterized by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso Breast cancer cells interact with zzso and cause an enhanced differentiation of zzso to zzso that express increased levels of the zzso factors, zzso and zzso There is sustained expression of zzso factors, zzso and zzso even after the zzso differentiation zzso and zzso sets zzso Moreover, tumor cells that are deficient in zzso signaling are compromised in their ability to induce zzso differentiation and consequently are inefficient in causing zzso The stimulation of zzso differentiation sets the stage for zzso differentiation and overall promotes zzso Thus, in the process of developing newer therapeutic strategies against breast cancer zzso to bone it would worthwhile to keep in mind the role of the zzso zzso in zzso differentiation in an otherwise zzso zzso zzso
