zzso stress related genes modify the effects of ambient air pollution or tobacco smoking on lung function zzso The impact of interactions might be substantial, but previous studies mostly focused on main effects of single zzso 

We studied the interaction of both zzso with a broad set of zzso related candidate genes and pathways on lung function decline and contrasted interactions between zzso 

For zzso single zzso zzso zzso change in forced zzso volume in one second zzso zzso over forced vital capacity zzso and mean forced zzso flow between 25 and zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso on zzso exposure to particulate matter zzso zzso in diameter zzso or zzso smoked zzso additive zzso effects zzso and interaction terms between zzso and zzso in zzso adults with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 152 genes and 14 pathways were calculated by the zzso rank zzso product zzso method, and compared between zzso zzso effect sizes were contrasted for the strongest zzso of zzso significant genes zzso zzso was attempted for zzso with zzso in zzso zzso participants without zzso 

On the zzso zzso in gene zzso accelerated zzso decline by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso attenuated zzso decline by zzso zzso zzso over 11 years, while interacting with zzso Genes and pathways zzso interacting with zzso and zzso exposure differed zzso Gene zzso presented a significant interaction with zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso interactions were zzso zzso for the strongest zzso in zzso and zzso were not zzso 

zzso with a zzso response to increasing zzso stress, different genes and pathways potentially mediate zzso and tobacco smoke effects on lung function zzso Ignoring environmental zzso would miss these patterns, but achieving sufficient sample size and zzso across study samples is zzso
