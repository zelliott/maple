zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso and zzso for vascular smooth muscle cells zzso whose biological activity is zzso via its high affinity interaction with specific cell surface zzso The molecular mechanisms governing the expression of zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso protein and zzso regulation in zzso is under the positive regulatory influence of the zinc finger nuclear zzso zzso zzso mobility shift, competition, and zzso analysis revealed the existence of an zzso zzso zzso element located in the zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso of this sequence zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transcription, zzso and protein expression were zzso in zzso exposed to zzso growth zzso zzso This zzso was rescued by the blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso was zzso upon zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso but not zzso manner, the growth factor enhancing zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso acids zzso by zzso blocked zzso repression of zzso zzso These findings, taken together, demonstrate that zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso via the zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso switches zzso from an zzso to a zzso of zzso transcription, a finding previously zzso in any zzso zzso
