zzso alpha is the nuclear import zzso that recognizes classical zzso and zzso nuclear zzso signals zzso The structure of mouse zzso alpha has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure shows a large zzso domain containing zzso repeats, and a less structured zzso zzso zzso domain containing an internal zzso bound to the zzso zzso The structure explains the regulatory switch between the zzso zzso form, and the zzso zzso form for zzso binding of the nuclear import zzso predicted by the current models of nuclear zzso zzso beta conceivably converts the low- to zzso form by binding to a site overlapping the zzso zzso The structure also has implications for understanding zzso recognition, and the structures of zzso and zzso zzso
