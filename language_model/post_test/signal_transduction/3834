zzso a zzso zzso factor, is expressed in specific zzso zzso in the zzso part of the neural tube which are among the first spinal zzso zzso to appear in zzso In the mature spinal cord, the zzso cells form a numerous population of scattered zzso in the intermediate spinal zzso zzso of the zzso in chick zzso extends the domain of zzso expression into the zzso neural tube, while zzso zzso of zzso tissue suppress zzso zzso The zzso effects on zzso expression are reproduced in zzso by the zzso of a local source of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression in the zzso spinal zzso by the zzso and zzso contrasts with the known zzso effects of these zzso signals on the approximately simultaneous development of the spinal motor zzso In cultured zzso of neural plate from the region of the zzso spinal cord, zzso zzso develop in the absence of surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may represent a zzso zzso zzso for early spinal zzso zzso Together these results advance the understanding of the mechanism of the generation of zzso diversity in the developing zzso zzso
