zzso fracture in rats evokes zzso zzso and bone changes resembling complex regional pain syndrome zzso zzso P zzso signaling contributes to the zzso warmth, increased vascular zzso and zzso observed in this model, suggesting that zzso inflammatory responses could be enhanced after zzso Four weeks after zzso fracture we measured SP and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels in the zzso nerve and zzso zzso skin zzso responses and SP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neutral zzso zzso protein levels were also zzso Gene expression levels of these zzso zzso and zzso were examined in the zzso and zzso zzso and intravenous zzso zzso responses were increased zzso but not zzso to the zzso zzso increased SP and zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels in the zzso nerve and in serum, but had no effect on zzso evoked SP and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in the zzso zzso skin zzso and zzso cells after injury, but zzso and zzso expression were zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso skin zzso zzso These results demonstrate that spontaneous and intravenous zzso zzso responses are enhanced in the zzso zzso after fracture and that fracture chronically increases the expression of zzso and zzso zzso receptors in the injured zzso We zzso that SP zzso of these zzso zzso receptors results in skin warmth, protein zzso zzso and zzso proliferation in the injured zzso
