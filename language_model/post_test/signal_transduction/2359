zzso converting zzso zzso family zzso zzso are subdivided into three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is followed by zzso of zzso zzso which is thought to be essential for execution of the cell zzso It was recently reported that two zzso members of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are activated during zzso zzso Here, we have shown that zzso but not zzso zzso is activated by zzso as an zzso for zzso zzso and that zzso is a major zzso for zzso in zzso zzso Then, to dissect various cellular responses induced by zzso we used several zzso zzso for ICE family zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso While zzso which inhibited almost all the zzso cellular responses blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso for zzso zzso which inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation did not block the zzso of zzso and zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso did not block the zzso zzso changes zzso shrinkage and surface zzso induction of zzso zzso or the cell death (as assessed by the dye exclusion zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways does not require zzso zzso and that zzso zzso although essential for zzso nuclear events (such as zzso zzso and DNA zzso are not required for other zzso events in the zzso or the cell death zzso Thus, the zzso signaling zzso zzso into zzso separate zzso each of which may be responsible for part of the zzso cellular zzso
