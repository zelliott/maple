zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso agent used to treat acute zzso zzso and recently solid tumors including zzso zzso However, a mechanism to explain its zzso activity in zzso zzso is zzso Here, we investigated the role of protein zzso C zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of proliferation in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso cells were incubated with different zzso of zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze cell cycle distribution, zzso to measure zzso activity, and Western zzso analysis to detect zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso manner, caused an increase of percentage of cells in the zzso phase and a decrease in the S and zzso zzso and zzso the expression of activated zzso and reduced zzso zzso These effects were zzso by zzso but enhanced by zzso 

zzso is involved in the zzso activity of zzso for zzso zzso cancer cells, suggesting that targeting the zzso zzso may represent a potential approach to enhance the efficacy of zzso to treat zzso zzso
