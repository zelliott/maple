Studies in the developing spinal zzso have established that zzso zzso from the zzso and floor plate influence pattern formation along the zzso axis of the neural zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso zzso from the roof plate, act on the more zzso located zzso plates to induce position dependent gene expression and cell fate zzso The zzso activity of zzso is zzso by Sonic zzso zzso which is zzso from the floor plate and underlying zzso zzso are also expressed in the roof plate of the zzso zzso yet it is unclear at present if they also provide patterning information to the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso tested the hypothesis that zzso signaling is required for fate zzso of the zzso zzso plate by manipulating zzso zzso signaling in the early chick zzso through zzso expression of zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso which render the zzso zzso active or dominant negative, zzso In contrast to published data on the embryonic spinal cord, neither zzso nor zzso of zzso signaling in stage 16 zzso altered expression of markers of the zzso zzso plates including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, simultaneous zzso of zzso signaling and zzso of zzso signaling was not sufficient to induce zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso whereas the importance of zzso signaling for zzso differentiation in the spinal zzso is well established, it appears to play a less prominent role in the zzso zzso of the developing zzso during the same zzso zzso
