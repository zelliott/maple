In experimental animal models, long-term in zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso both zzso dysfunction and tolerance to zzso However, it is still controversial whether nitrate tolerance in humans is associated with both zzso dysfunction and impaired vascular response to zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso bypass surgery were zzso to receive 48 hours of continuous zzso infusion zzso zzso or no nitrate therapy zzso zzso zzso of surgically removed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso not required for the bypass procedure were used to examine zzso the vascular responsiveness to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of the NO target, the soluble zzso zzso zzso the expression of the soluble zzso zzso zzso target, the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso the zzso activity as assessed by the zzso state of its vascular zzso the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso treatment caused a marked degree of nitrate tolerance in all 3 vessel types studied and a significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were not modified by zzso treatment, a marked decrease of zzso a surrogate zzso for zzso zzso activity, was zzso 

We conclude that long-term zzso treatment zzso zzso dysfunction and impaired vascular zzso signaling in humans, which can be monitored by measuring zzso zzso
