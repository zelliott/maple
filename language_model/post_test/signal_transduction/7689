Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is a member of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso partially block zzso signaling and tumor growth in zzso breast cancer zzso We investigated whether blockade of all zzso zzso and zzso pairs by combined treatment with several zzso could more effectively inhibit tumor growth in such zzso 

Mice carrying zzso tumors of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso supplementation or zzso withdrawal, alone or combined with zzso One to three zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso could also be added zzso zzso or zzso 8 mice per zzso zzso volumes, zzso zzso and tumor cell proliferation and zzso were zzso zzso were analyzed with the zzso test or zzso rank sum test and survival analysis zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Median time to tumor progression was 21 days for mice receiving zzso and 28 days for mice receiving zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso P zzso zzso hazard ratio zzso of progression in mice receiving zzso and zzso versus mice receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso increased this time to 49 days zzso zzso 21 zzso P zzso zzso zzso of progression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso tumors disappeared completely and did not progress (for zzso or zzso 189 zzso after combination treatment with zzso zzso and zzso plus tamoxifen (19 of 20 zzso or plus zzso withdrawal zzso of 15 zzso Both combination treatments induced zzso and blocked zzso signaling and proliferation in tumor cells better than any single agent or dual zzso All zzso tumors treated with zzso zzso and zzso disappeared zzso regardless of zzso therapy, and no tumor progression was observed for 232 zzso 

Combined treatment with zzso zzso and zzso to block signals from all zzso zzso and zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso statistically significantly better than single agents and dual zzso
