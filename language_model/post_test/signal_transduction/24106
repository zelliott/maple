zzso signaling plays an important role in signal zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso of the protein zzso C zzso family has been described and designated as zzso zzso has two putative zzso binding C1 zzso suggesting that it may participate in a novel zzso signaling zzso Here we show that both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso to the plasma membrane and activated by the zzso mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso is dependent on zzso of two zzso zzso loop zzso zzso We also find that zzso is an important zzso target of the zzso zzso zzso because zzso is found to be abundantly expressed in chicken and human zzso lines and, in addition, exhibits robust zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso indicate that it requires intact zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not the classical zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is an important component of signaling pathways downstream from novel zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso
