zzso determination is important in modeling and simulating biological pathways including signaling zzso zzso are determined according to biological facts obtained from biological experiments and scientific zzso However, such reliable data describing detailed reactions are not reported in most zzso This prompted us to develop a general methodology of determining the parameters of a model in the case of that no information of the underlying biological facts is zzso In this study, we use the zzso net approach for modeling signaling zzso and propose a method to determine firing delay times of transitions for zzso net models of signaling pathways by introducing zzso decision zzso zzso net technology provides a powerful approach to modeling and simulating various concurrent systems, and recently have been widely accepted as a description method for biological zzso Our method enables to determine the range of firing delay time which realizes smooth token flows in the zzso net model of a signaling zzso The availability of this method has been confirmed by the results of an application to the zzso induced signaling zzso
