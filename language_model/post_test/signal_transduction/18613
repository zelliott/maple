zzso zzso zzso 2A zzso is a critical regulator of numerous cellular signaling processes and a potential target for zzso zzso that zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso cellular form of zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of a structural A, a variable B, and a zzso C zzso We studied the modification of two zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso with two different zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells with these zzso resulted in zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso as observed by Western zzso zzso Although both zzso labeled all three zzso zzso only zzso inhibited the zzso activity of both zzso zzso patterns in the A and B zzso were identical for the two zzso but zzso zzso four zzso zzso in the C zzso that were not labeled by zzso zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso enabled generation of a comparative model structure for the C zzso of zzso The model structure provided additional insight into contributions of specific zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that site selectivity of protein zzso should be a critical zzso of the ability of zzso to affect cellular signaling zzso
