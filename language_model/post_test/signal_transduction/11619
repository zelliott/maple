Tail bud formation in zzso depends on interaction between a zzso domain zzso zzso expressing zzso fringe and zzso and a zzso domain zzso wall) expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of an activated form of zzso zzso zzso by means of an animal cap graft into the zzso neural plate, results in the formation of an zzso zzso structure containing a neural tube and zzso However, zzso are never formed in these zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling is activated in the zzso wall of the tail bud and is involved in the formation of tail zzso from this zzso zzso into the zzso neural plate, in which zzso signaling is zzso will form zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso tails, the zzso tails contain well-organized zzso as well as neural tube and zzso with the graft contributing to both zzso and neural zzso Through a variety of zzso experiments, we show that the most likely model involves a requirement for zzso signaling upstream of zzso zzso resulting in formation of the secondary neural tube, as well as a zzso zzso leading to the formation of tail zzso from the zzso zzso
