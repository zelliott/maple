Much concern has arisen regarding critical adverse effects of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso on cardiac zzso Although zzso cardiac zzso zzso has been attributed to an increase in plasma volume or a change in cardiac zzso zzso zzso roles have not been zzso To test the hypothesis that volume expansion directly mediates zzso zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet with zzso and cardiac and zzso consequences were zzso zzso treatment induced volume expansion and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, but not in mice defective for zzso binding zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso mice attenuated zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and left zzso zzso Similar changes were observed in mice treated with zzso The zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso attenuated zzso effects on volume expansion and zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso and zzso metabolism genes in the heart was altered by zzso but these changes were not attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso improvements were not affected by zzso zzso We conclude that releasing plasma volume reduces adverse effects of zzso volume expansion and cardiac events without compromising zzso actions in zzso switch in the heart and zzso insulin zzso
