The zzso zzso is a high molecular weight zzso zzso It consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso growth zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso zzso including zzso cancer, suggesting a possible role in the zzso of these zzso In this study, we investigated the functional role of zzso in the human zzso cancer cell line zzso The zzso zzso was zzso expressed by stable zzso and its expression was examined by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso The in zzso studies demonstrated an enhanced zzso of zzso zzso cells compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was associated with apparent changes in zzso zzso leading to the formation of zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso An enhanced protein expression and zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was also seen, although no significant change was observed in zzso transcript levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an interaction of zzso with zzso Further, the zzso zzso cells exhibited an increase in the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso downstream zzso of zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso plays a role in zzso cancer cell zzso in part, by altering zzso arrangement and zzso zzso downstream zzso in these zzso
