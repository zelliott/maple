We have recently reported that zzso zzso is involved in the generation of free zzso in exhaustive zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso prevents zzso The aim of the present work was to zzso the role of zzso zzso oxygen species in the cell zzso pathways involved in the adaptation to exercise in zzso We have found that exercise causes an increase in the activity of plasma zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso in peripheral blood zzso after marathon zzso This zzso is dependent on free radical formation in zzso treatment with zzso completely prevents zzso In animal models, we previously showed that zzso zzso induced by exhaustive physical exercise leads to an increase in the expression of zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso zzso We report evidence in man that zzso oxygen species act as signals in exercise as decreasing their formation prevents zzso of important zzso pathways which can cause useful adaptations in zzso
