zzso regulates various zzso and zzso processes throughout the life cycle of zzso Among the members of the zzso family, zzso A zzso exclusively mediates the zzso light high zzso response zzso which is zzso by continuous zzso zzso In zzso nuclear zzso of zzso which precedes zzso responses, is proposed to be required for the zzso In contrast to zzso red light zzso rapid degradation of zzso to suppress zzso long-term zzso responses of zzso In the present study, we compared biological activities between zzso derivatives to which either a nuclear zzso zzso or export zzso signal sequence was zzso Those derivatives were expressed under the control of the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation revealed that the zzso fluorescent protein zzso without a signal sequence is localized exclusively in the zzso in zzso Rapid nuclear entry was observed after exposure to both red and zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso were rapidly zzso under continuous red zzso Furthermore, a zzso inhibitor delayed degradation equally under these two zzso zzso similar mechanisms for zzso degradation may exist in the zzso and zzso As expected from previous reports, zzso but not zzso zzso different aspects of zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and rapid induction of gene zzso confirming that zzso nuclear zzso is required for zzso In addition, a detailed time course analysis of zzso and zzso responses revealed that they were almost zzso raising the question of the zzso relevance of zzso zzso retention in zzso
