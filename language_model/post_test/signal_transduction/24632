The zzso influences of zzso zzso on the functional responsiveness of human peripheral blood zzso have been zzso These studies focused on zzso of the levels of zzso free calcium and of zzso zzso as well as on their ability to mount an zzso zzso Short incubation times zzso 1 zzso with low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to enhance the above zzso of zzso responsiveness to zzso factors such as zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso and zzso zzso of calcium zzso and zzso production was also zzso The effects of the zzso zzso were zzso and were antagonized by a novel protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso but were not affected by the zzso burst inhibitor zzso zzso of the cells with zzso zzso zzso altered in a zzso manner the zzso zzso pattern zzso by zzso In addition, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso of calcium induced by zzso These data demonstrate the zzso of the effects of the zzso of protein zzso C, their potential to zzso positively the early events of the zzso zzso sequence and the complexity of the functional zzso among the various cellular zzso pathways available to human zzso and other zzso zzso
