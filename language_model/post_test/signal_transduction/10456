zzso syndrome zzso is a rare form of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by a distinct zzso pattern mainly involving blood and zzso zzso and their receptors play a critical role in cellular recruitment and zzso to zzso and in the zzso process of several tumors including zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that SS cells express a functionally active zzso and that its zzso zzso is abundantly produced in the skin, which represents the main destination of SS cell zzso zzso is normally zzso by zzso zzso by the zzso IV zzso The lack of zzso from the cell surface is a hallmark of circulating SS zzso We also show that the zzso zzso is maintained also in zzso zzso T zzso and that zzso individuals exhibit a reduced activity of plasma soluble zzso Finally, we observe that the addition of soluble zzso reduces the migratory response of SS cells to zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso zzso activity in zzso a zzso zzso cell line, enhances the zzso migration of these zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso axis could play an important role in skin zzso of SS through the regulatory activity of zzso
