The gut and zzso zzso of insects are the primary sites of active zzso and water transport for controlling zzso and urine zzso zzso and zzso These processes depend on zzso zzso channels and zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso of zzso databases enables us to identify the putative molecular players for these zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family, zzso and zzso have been reported as zzso zzso but are only part of the zzso Here we report zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family, which are zzso zzso zzso One zzso and two zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso show zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso expression zzso Since these zzso are the only zzso zzso proteins whose transport is similar to zzso zzso we submit that zzso zzso are functional and even molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso another set of zzso processes controlled by zzso signaling in zzso All of these zzso are highly expressed in the gut and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins appear suited for central roles in zzso zzso and zzso metabolism including generating the high pH conditions measured in the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we present and discuss zzso genetic models that integrate these zzso
