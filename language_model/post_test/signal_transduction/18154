zzso of zzso and zzso is crucial for ensuring proper zzso segregation and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso define a signaling zzso that regulates zzso and zzso Here we describe the characterization of a novel protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to one zzso pole body zzso in zzso zzso zzso is maintained during zzso ring zzso and zzso synthesis and disappears prior to cell zzso Additionally, we found that zzso is in a complex with zzso zzso analysis places zzso downstream of zzso but upstream of zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso during zzso is unaffected by zzso the zzso zzso in fact, loss of zzso activity promotes zzso association with the zzso possibly providing a mechanism that couples zzso with zzso zzso
