zzso breathing, and especially deep breathing, is known to zzso zzso caused by airway smooth muscle zzso zzso however, this zzso effect of breathing is impaired in zzso Force fluctuations applied to contracted zzso in zzso cause it to zzso zzso zzso zzso Given that breathing generates similar force fluctuations in zzso zzso represents a likely mechanism by which breathing zzso zzso Thus it is of considerable interest to understand what zzso zzso and how zzso might be manipulated to exploit this zzso It was demonstrated previously that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso in zzso zzso Here, it was zzso that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, changes in zzso were measured in zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused greater zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso without affecting zzso zzso or zzso zzso light chain and zzso zzso zzso However, increasing zzso of zzso progressively blunted zzso of zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso Thus changes in zzso exhibited significant negative correlation with zzso zzso The present data demonstrate that zzso is regulated through zzso zzso and suggest that the role of zzso is zzso in part, through zzso
