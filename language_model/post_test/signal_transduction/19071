The looping events that establish zzso zzso in the zzso gut tube are poorly zzso zzso acid signaling is known to impact zzso development in multiple embryonic zzso although its role in zzso zzso organ zzso is zzso Here, we show that the genes for zzso zzso zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso are expressed in complementary patterns in the zzso gut during zzso A late-stage chemical genetic assessment reveals that zzso and zzso of zzso signaling generate abnormal gut looping zzso zzso organ zzso and zzso zzso zzso organ zzso commonly associated with zzso zzso in humans, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tree zzso are also induced by distinct zzso zzso zzso Thus, late-stage zzso acid signaling is likely to play a critical role in zzso gut tube zzso and may zzso the zzso of several clinically relevant defects in the zzso zzso
