The human zzso zzso zzso couples to zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso was examined using the superior cervical zzso zzso expression zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tail zzso acids zzso slowed the zzso and reduced the magnitude of zzso channel zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso tail zzso acids zzso abolished zzso channel zzso demonstrating the critical role of the zzso zzso acids zzso of the zzso tail in G protein zzso zzso of the zzso truncated receptors on the cell surface was examined using an zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso truncated receptors were expressed on the cell surface and were no different from wild type zzso zzso zzso This study establishes that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tail domain zzso acids zzso is critical for zzso protein zzso and that the zzso zzso tail domain zzso acids zzso profoundly zzso both the magnitude and zzso of signal zzso Thus, the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso has a wider role in G protein zzso than was previously zzso
