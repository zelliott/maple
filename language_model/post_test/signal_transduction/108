The zzso zzso zzso controls tissue growth in zzso and zzso by regulating cell proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso includes the Fat zzso a zzso zzso which acts upstream of several other components that form a zzso cascade that culminates in the regulation of gene expression through the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our previous work in zzso indicated that zzso zzso and Expanded zzso are members of the zzso zzso and act upstream of the zzso zzso In contrast to this model, it was suggested that zzso and zzso primarily regulate membrane dynamics and zzso trafficking, thereby affecting zzso zzso activity only zzso Here, we examined the effects of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso on the size of the zzso membrane and on zzso polarity zzso We found that zzso double zzso zzso disc cells have significantly increased levels of zzso membrane zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were shared with zzso in other zzso zzso components and required zzso indicating that zzso and zzso signal through the zzso zzso Interestingly, however, whereas zzso was required for the zzso of other zzso proteins and for the expansion of the zzso domain observed in zzso zzso zzso its elimination did not significantly reverse the overgrowth zzso of warts zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling regulates cell polarity complexes in addition to and independently of its growth control function in zzso disc zzso
