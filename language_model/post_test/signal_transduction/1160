zzso zzso is a key zzso necessary for zzso zzso in the brain, but excessive zzso of this zzso can be zzso to neural cells as a consequence of excessive consumption of zzso and zzso The stomach also expresses high levels of zzso zzso and this study aimed to investigate a possible zzso role of zzso zzso in zzso gastric zzso zzso 

zzso rat gastric zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso and a specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was used to assess the action of zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso induced zzso cell zzso Increased expression of zzso and zzso decreased expression of zzso zzso C release from the zzso into the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso and zzso were identified in the cells treated with zzso although there was no apparent change in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso with various zzso of zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells, and prevented the induction of zzso and the reduction in zzso zzso levels in a zzso zzso 

Our results suggested that the energy exhaustion which resulted from an overload of zzso to zzso zzso may have initiated the zzso signaling in gastric zzso zzso
