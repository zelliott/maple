zzso and zzso are two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are similarly involved in various zzso zzso including the regulation of the critical zzso to S phase transition of the cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso we sought to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between these two important tumor zzso zzso 

We have shown here that the zzso protein positively controls the expression of zzso in both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso through negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by quantitative zzso indicated that zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, while zzso zzso increased the expression level of the zzso zzso the concurrent zzso of zzso and zzso using specific zzso zzso restored the normal expression of the zzso Moreover, we used zzso reporter fused to the zzso zzso element zzso to demonstrate that zzso regulation of the zzso zzso is zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in zzso breast zzso zzso cells significantly increased the level of zzso with no effect on cell zzso In addition, we have shown direct correlation between zzso and zzso levels in various cancer cell zzso 

These findings show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso in an zzso manner, and further confirm the presence of a direct link between the 2 important zzso zzso zzso and zzso
