zzso sites of zzso have been observed in various cell types, but whether they occur randomly or are linked to cellular cues is zzso Here, we zzso the sites of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso in cells whose zzso geometry was defined by zzso zzso zzso density maps revealed that zzso was enriched in adhesive sites during zzso whereas zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso cellular zzso This spatial separation was not due to zzso of corresponding receptors but was regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted from the enrichment of zzso and zzso protein 2 at adhesive zzso zzso in zzso zzso was strongly dependent on the zzso zzso and led to asymmetry in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso dynamics abolished asymmetry in zzso zzso and decreased zzso downstream zzso suggesting that cellular zzso cues influence signal zzso We propose that restriction of zzso at distinct sites allows cells to sense their environment in an zzso zzso
