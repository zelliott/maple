The zzso regulatory system zzso is essential for induction of the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso sensor zzso consisting of a zzso domain flanked by two zzso zzso a zzso domain and the zzso zzso or zzso zzso A fusion protein zzso composed of the zzso protein and the zzso zzso domain zzso acids zzso showed zzso zzso activity and transferred the zzso group of zzso to its zzso response regulator zzso The zzso activity of zzso was abolished by an zzso exchange, and zzso of zzso was inhibited by a zzso exchange, indicating that zzso and zzso represent the zzso sites of zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso formed a stable complex with zzso To zzso the sensory properties of zzso the zzso domain zzso acids zzso was zzso as a zzso zzso protein with a zzso attached zzso tag zzso zzso zzso bound zzso but none of the other zzso and zzso tested, with high affinity zzso approximately 5 zzso at pH 7) in a zzso zzso As shown by zzso zzso zzso the binding reaction was driven by the zzso change zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso change was opposed zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso The pH dependency of the binding reaction indicated that the zzso form zzso is the zzso species recognized by zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the zzso constant increased significantly, suggesting that the zzso complex is not bound by zzso This work defines the zzso domain of zzso as a highly specific zzso zzso and zzso the binding characteristics of zzso
