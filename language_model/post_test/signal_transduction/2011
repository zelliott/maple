zzso zzso A and zzso are effective treatments for zzso zzso A and zzso block T cell zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and preventing zzso from the zzso to the nucleus of the zzso factor nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso of T cell zzso is thought to account for their therapeutic action in zzso We investigated whether zzso cells in human skin express zzso and zzso and whether zzso A and zzso block zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The expression patterns of the principal components of zzso signaling zzso in normal human skin and psoriasis were determined by zzso We assessed zzso zzso in cultured zzso by measuring the degree of nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and assessed if zzso A and zzso blocked nuclear zzso of these zzso A variety of cell types in normal and zzso skin expressed zzso and zzso but expression was particularly prominent in zzso The principal zzso A and zzso binding proteins zzso A and zzso were also expressed by zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso was predominantly nuclear in normal zzso zzso zzso Increased nuclear zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso within zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso compared to normal skin zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), suggesting increased zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso that induce zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso plus zzso zzso and raised zzso zzso induced nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso that was inhibited by zzso with zzso A or zzso In contrast in human zzso zzso zzso plus zzso or zzso did not significantly alter the proportion of zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence that zzso is functionally active in human zzso inducing nuclear zzso of zzso and also indicate that regulation of zzso nuclear zzso in skin is cell type zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso may account, in part, for the therapeutic effect of zzso A and zzso in skin diseases such as zzso
