The zzso zzso zzso is a useful model system for examining the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso To investigate underlying regulation mechanisms, a flux analysis of the zzso zzso was zzso A zzso model was derived based on well known zzso of the zzso The model was integrated in the Software zzso which uses a global zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso concentration patterns were determined by gas zzso in zzso and zzso batch zzso when the zzso metabolism was suppressed due to the absence of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso were observed in a zzso which was shifted from zzso to zzso growth conditions causing the zzso pools in the cell to be zzso From zzso flux patterns, possible limitations in the zzso could be localized and the zzso of zzso was identified as an integral part of regulation in zzso zzso
