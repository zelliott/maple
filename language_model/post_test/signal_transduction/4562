Lung injury, whether induced by infection or zzso zzso zzso a series of complex zzso zzso If zzso these responses may lead to zzso lung diseases and loss of zzso Thus, resolution of lung injury must be tightly zzso The key regulatory proteins required for tightly controlling the resolution of lung injury have yet to be zzso Here we show that loss of zzso zzso led to the development of lung zzso in mice after infection with zzso zzso zzso inhibited transforming growth zzso and prevented lung zzso by decreasing the stability of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso decreases zzso stability by zzso zzso zzso Together, our results unveil a role for zzso in tightly regulating the resolution of lung injury and preventing zzso by zzso zzso These studies may help develop new therapeutic strategies for preventing lung zzso
