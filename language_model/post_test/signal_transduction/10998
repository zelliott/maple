Despite the clear functional importance of zzso zzso the signaling pathways zzso through zzso have remained zzso zzso was identified early as a candidate for zzso zzso but conflicting data during the past decade has left the role of zzso zzso In this report, we have resolved this zzso We show that zzso of the zzso interaction site in the zzso tail of zzso site zzso the ability of zzso to recruit protein zzso zzso to the central zzso zzso cluster zzso region of the zzso zzso promote zzso nuclear zzso and enhance zzso gene zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso interaction site had no effect on the ability of zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that two distinct pathways mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that may function through the zzso zzso to enhance zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso
