zzso zzso zzso is a small heat shock protein expressed predominantly in the heart and skeletal muscle, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of cardiac cell survival and in promoting cell growth through the zzso of complementary signaling zzso An zzso of zzso was detected in various forms of heart disease, both in animal models and in patients, including acute and chronic zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was reproduced in a zzso transgenic model, which led to significant progress in understanding the role and mechanism of action of the zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso a zzso that is equivalent to zzso zzso it promotes cardiac zzso while maintaining zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate most of the signaling pathways involved in cardiac cell growth and survival, including the zzso pathway, the zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso oxide zzso of delayed zzso and the zzso zzso of cell zzso As a result, the survival response triggered by zzso in the heart includes zzso zzso zzso growth, and zzso zzso In addition to zzso signaling zzso zzso promotes the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This review discusses the biological function of zzso its molecular mechanisms of action, and its potential therapeutic zzso In particular, we discuss how zzso conditioning of the heart by zzso might be beneficial for patients with zzso heart disease who would be at risk of further irreversible cardiac zzso
