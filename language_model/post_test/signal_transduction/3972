The zzso of human T cells via zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso typically requires that one zzso is specific for an zzso within the zzso zzso domain of zzso and the other for a partially hidden zzso We have examined the zzso response of human T cells and human zzso zzso transgenic zzso T cells to two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and have partially mapped the zzso of these and other zzso zzso zzso zzso by way of recognition of zzso zzso proteins possessing either the zzso or the membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso To understand the molecular basis of proliferation in zzso transgenic zzso T cells, the interactions of zzso with signaling proteins in zzso T cells were zzso The transgenic zzso zzso was found to interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso chains of the zzso signaling complex and to zzso zzso zzso zzso These molecular associations resemble the situation in human T cells and suggest that human zzso couples to the same signal zzso pathways in humans and transgenic zzso
