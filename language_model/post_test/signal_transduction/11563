A zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of pepper zzso zzso zzso leaves infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene which has zzso domain and hinge region shares a high level of identity with zzso sequences from tomato, potato and zzso The zzso gene was zzso regulated in pepper plants, and zzso induced during the compatible and incompatible interactions of pepper with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was rapidly induced in the incompatible interactions upon pathogen zzso zzso of the zzso gene was highly zzso in the leaves of matured pepper plants by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso results showed that zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso area of vascular zzso in zzso zzso leaf zzso The zzso zzso gene was also strongly induced and accumulated in pepper leaves by zzso zzso zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso may act as signal molecules in the signal zzso pathways of the zzso gene induction during the pepper zzso or zzso plant zzso
