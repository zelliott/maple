Prior work demonstrates that zzso activity regulates sensitivity of cells to zzso arrest induced by zzso target of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso To investigate this, a novel zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to identify genes whose zzso zzso efficiency was zzso affected following zzso zzso The analysis also allowed the assessment of zzso transcript zzso We identified two zzso zzso D1 and zzso which exhibited differential expression in an zzso zzso High levels of activated zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso whereas low levels resulted in zzso of zzso To zzso express these proteins we exploited the finding that the zzso zzso was efficiently translated in the face of zzso zzso irrespective of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso region was fused to the zzso D1 and zzso coding regions and these zzso were expressed in zzso In zzso cells, expression of zzso D1 or zzso was not decreased by zzso Most importantly, this completely converted sensitive cells to a zzso resistant to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso differential expression patterns of these two genes was also observed in a mouse zzso model following in zzso treatment with zzso These results identify two critical downstream molecular targets whose expression is regulated by zzso activity and whose zzso is required for zzso zzso
