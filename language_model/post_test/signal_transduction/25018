Two relatively well zzso zzso zzso pathways are those involving zzso and zzso that are known to be activated in zzso by various factors known to increase following stroke, such as zzso zzso and zzso The present study was designed to investigate the zzso and cellular distribution of zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso following focal cerebral zzso using zzso zzso Up to 24 h following transient zzso (90 zzso and 6 h following permanent zzso zzso zzso was markedly increased within the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was markedly increased in cells with zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected in some zzso within zzso regions up to 24 h following transient zzso zzso zzso was confined to zzso in zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells present in the zzso white matter zzso to the zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso was zzso to cells with the zzso appearance of zzso This study demonstrates zzso indicative of zzso of both the zzso and zzso pathways following transient and permanent zzso However, each zzso shows a distinct cellular and spatial distribution within zzso zzso Together these data indicate that zzso offered by agents directed towards the zzso zzso may act directly through protection of zzso and zzso while those directed towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways may be indirectly via zzso of zzso and other zzso involved in the brains response to zzso
