zzso A10 zzso a key zzso factor, plays a critical role in zzso zzso by regulating the expression of downstream target zzso such as zzso zzso but little is understood about the mechanisms of the zzso modification of zzso during zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of zzso zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

The association of zzso with zzso was detected by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso Western zzso quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso techniques were used to determine the effect of zzso on zzso protein stability and the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso association on zzso zzso was evaluated using a zzso zzso attachment zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso of women with zzso and fertile controls was measured by Western zzso zzso 

zzso was identified as an zzso protein and inhibited zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso or knocking down zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso not only zzso zzso zzso protein expression but also diminished zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found zzso high zzso expression in the zzso zzso of women with a diagnosis of zzso compared with the fertile controls zzso zzso zzso 

These observations demonstrate that 1) zzso associates with and is zzso by zzso at zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and 2) zzso association zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso
