zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso generates the zzso zzso a major constituent of the senile plaques observed in Alzheimer's zzso The zzso by zzso also results in the zzso release of a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This processing resembles regulated zzso zzso of zzso proteins such as zzso where the released zzso fragments enter the nucleus and zzso gene zzso Here, we examined whether the analogous zzso fragments of zzso also exert effects in the zzso We find that zzso expressed zzso is present both in the zzso and in the zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso causes disappearance of zzso a protein that interacts with the zzso zzso domain, from the nucleus and zzso its zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso prevents zzso degradation and retains its nuclear zzso By contrast, zzso a minor product of zzso is only marginally effective in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Thus, our studies provide the evidence that, as predicted by the regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to function in the zzso
