zzso zzso an active ingredient commonly found in zzso zzso was previously demonstrated to be a zzso that exerted zzso activity without direct interaction with zzso receptors zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine the molecular mechanism by which zzso exerted zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso effects of zzso on zzso expression as well as zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso were zzso through the zzso zzso To evaluate the relative involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso the actions of zzso zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells were zzso with the zzso reporter construct and either zzso or zzso zzso The results showed that zzso could activate zzso activity via the zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso only occur at high concentration zzso Furthermore, the results showed that zzso zzso could rapidly induce zzso of the zzso domain of zzso at zzso 118 zzso within the first 5 zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso activates zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso activates zzso via zzso of zzso domain in the absence of zzso zzso This study is the first to provide evidence that zzso zzso exerts zzso actions via zzso zzso of zzso zzso
