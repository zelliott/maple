zzso outer hair cells undergo zzso changes in shape when zzso zzso This response, known as zzso zzso is a central component of the cochlear amplifier, the mechanism responsible for the high sensitivity of zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso as regulated by zzso of zzso zzso has a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso activity of this zzso increases both zzso zzso and total length of guinea pig zzso In contrast, a decrease in zzso zzso reduces both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acid indicate that the effects of these agents on zzso zzso are associated with regulation of zzso zzso via different signaling zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso confirmed that all observed changes in zzso zzso response were independent of the performance of the motor protein zzso Altogether, these results strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso has a major role in the regulation of zzso zzso and identify zzso zzso as a key process for modulating cochlear zzso
