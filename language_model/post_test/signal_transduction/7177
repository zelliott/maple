zzso zzso requires zzso information to specify the identity of zzso to be replaced as well as zzso zzso capable of zzso into new cell zzso We found that wounding elicits rapid expression of a gene zzso a zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso expression is specific to the zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso and is zzso zzso is subsequently expressed within a zzso zzso of zzso at wounds involving head zzso Ultimately, zzso is zzso with multiple anterior markers at the anterior zzso zzso of zzso with zzso interference zzso results in the failure to specify zzso expressing anterior markers zzso and zzso and in anterior pole formation zzso zzso animals fail to zzso a new zzso and to properly pattern the anterior zzso consistent with a role for the anterior pole in organizing pattern of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that wound signaling activates a zzso zzso factor at the zzso and, if the head is zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso at the prior zzso for anterior pole zzso
