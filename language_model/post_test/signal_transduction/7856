We have earlier found that freshwater pond snails zzso zzso and zzso zzso when reared under conditions of zzso release chemical signals that zzso suppress zzso development of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso these signals are not strictly zzso and affect also zzso of a closely related species, which occupies a similar environmental zzso zzso besides the development of zzso the signals also affect the release of main motor programs, such as zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso action of the signals is zzso they zzso the development and release of motor programs at the early zzso stages zzso to zzso and accelerate them at later stages zzso zzso to zzso A possible zzso significance of the described phenomena is zzso
