Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso toxin zzso and then treated with or without zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso by zzso zzso only after additional treatment with zzso Although the addition of zzso zzso synthesis zzso and zzso zzso dependent protein zzso zzso did not completely counteract the negative regulation, the zzso of zzso was a primary factor for negative regulation by treatment with zzso and zzso In contrast with the zzso response, the zzso of membrane zzso zzso activity and the zzso competition curve were not influenced by treatment with zzso or zzso suggesting that a zzso factor was involved in this negative zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso was also attenuated by treatment with zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was not observed when zzso was expressed in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that this negative regulation is not dependent on the zzso type but is instead a phenomenon common to zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso zzso which is a member of the regulator of zzso zzso zzso group of zzso was considerably increased by zzso with zzso These results indicate a novel regulatory pathway, zzso a zzso factor induced by the zzso of cellular zzso levels zzso regulates zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
