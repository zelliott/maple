zzso zzso zzso is a major characteristic of zzso zzso sclerosis zzso which is a serious complication in long-term zzso dialysis zzso zzso We reported previously that zzso stimulates collagen gene expression in cultured zzso and is attenuated by zzso zzso The zzso family and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways have been shown to participate in zzso zzso However, how zzso zzso the zzso zzso downstream to zzso remains zzso in zzso In this study, we explored these zzso pathways in zzso and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso effects of zzso on zzso collagen gene expression in zzso 

zzso was cultured from human zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The expression of collagen zzso zzso was determined by northern zzso while the zzso proteins and the zzso zzso activity were determined by western zzso 

zzso collagen zzso zzso expression of zzso was inhibited by zzso The zzso zzso and zzso pathways were activated in response to zzso However, zzso displayed no zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso The addition of zzso and zzso which blocked the zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, suppressed the zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso At a concentration zzso zzso zzso that inhibited the collagen gene zzso zzso suppressed the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso of zzso under the same zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso collagen gene expression in zzso through modulating the zzso and zzso zzso Our study of zzso may provide the therapeutic basis for clinical applications in the prevention of zzso
