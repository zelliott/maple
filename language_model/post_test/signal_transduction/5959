zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a G zzso zzso that binds natural and synthetic peptides as well as zzso zzso and mediates important biological zzso To facilitate its pharmacological zzso we screened a compound library and identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in peripheral blood zzso with a potency of approximately zzso of that of the zzso zzso zzso In studies using zzso rat zzso leukemia zzso cell lines expressing either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso release from zzso but not zzso zzso Likewise, zzso selectively stimulates calcium zzso in zzso cells, a response that was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso also stimulates zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 and zzso zzso of an zzso fused to green fluorescent zzso In zzso zzso both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited lower efficacy and potency than zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, respectively, compared with the zzso value for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not induce zzso zzso generation at up to 100 zzso Based on these results, we conclude that zzso is a novel zzso zzso that binds to zzso and selectively stimulates zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso based on which further structural modifications may be made to improve its efficacy and potency for zzso
