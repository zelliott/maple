zzso is a zzso compound extracted from the zzso of zzso zzso This study investigated the zzso effect and the mechanism of action of zzso on human zzso cells, zzso and the mode of cell zzso An zzso zzso using zzso blue zzso revealed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of the zzso cells with a 50% zzso of cell growth zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was due to zzso induced in the zzso cells and not zzso which was confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells showed typical zzso zzso such as DNA zzso cell shrinkage and zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso cells was associated with the zzso of tumor zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso but not zzso The levels of zzso protein expression decreased zzso after treatment with zzso and remained lower than controls throughout the experiment, resulting in a shift in the zzso to zzso ratio thus zzso zzso The processing of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso was also found to be zzso but not zzso zzso exerts zzso effects on zzso cells by inducing zzso via the zzso zzso
