The role of zzso on regulation of the zzso activity in the human zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso cells zzso with increasing zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These effects were also obtained by zzso zzso and zzso provoked a rise in zzso calcium concentration zzso zzso for at least 4 zzso The inhibitor of zzso C, zzso blocked the zzso of zzso provoked by zzso The expression of zzso for zzso and zzso receptors was demonstrated by zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso activity by zzso was blocked by zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells through the zzso zzso via calcium zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
