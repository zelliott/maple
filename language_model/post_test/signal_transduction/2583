The zzso protein in the zzso zzso cascade zzso the nitrogen zzso as sensed by zzso both to the zzso zzso system and to zzso to regulate the activity of zzso zzso Here we describe the amplification of a zzso DNA zzso from zzso coli which contains the sequence of a zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of this DNA zzso is zzso identical to zzso coli zzso It contains the zzso zzso zzso which is known to be the site of zzso in zzso zzso coli is the first zzso in which two different zzso proteins have been zzso
