zzso tube closure is a fundamental embryonic event whose molecular regulation is poorly zzso As mouse zzso zzso along the spinal zzso there is a shift from zzso neural plate zzso to zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is not essential for spinal closure since, in its absence, the neural tube can close by a zzso mechanism involving zzso bending, even at upper spinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by mutually zzso signals from the zzso and surface zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and simultaneously zzso zzso zzso Sonic zzso is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit zzso bending, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce zzso bending, which seems likely to be regulated by another zzso zzso zzso of surface zzso cells to the neural plate is required for zzso bending, which ensures neural tube closure in the absence of sonic zzso zzso
