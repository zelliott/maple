zzso clear cell zzso zzso is well known to be highly resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in only CCC of zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the role of zzso in zzso zzso 

To evaluate the function of zzso in zzso CCC cells, we generated an zzso cancer cell line, zzso cells zzso zzso with plasmids encompassing zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso and compared cell growth and the zzso ability to control zzso cells zzso zzso 

We showed that zzso cells significantly increased cell growth and the zzso potential compared with zzso cells in zzso serum containing medium with 100 zzso zzso Furthermore, these effects were significantly attenuated by zzso with 1 zzso zzso (an inhibitor of zzso 

We have demonstrated for the first time the presence of elevated levels of zzso protein associated with cell growth zzso in CCC zzso Our data suggest that zzso has the potential to become a novel therapeutic target for zzso CCC zzso
