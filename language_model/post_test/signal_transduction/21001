zzso zzso mice manifest zzso absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso patches and disturbed zzso zzso zzso The zzso white pulp areas show loss of discrete T and B zzso zones, of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and of zzso centers zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso mice show similar absence of zzso clusters and zzso but retain segregation of T and B cell zzso Rarely are zzso zzso found in zzso zzso These zzso zzso show segregation of T and B cell zones similar to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in zzso mice manifest zzso disturbed organization of T and B zzso Both zzso and zzso mice lacked zzso clusters in zzso and zzso Interestingly, although both zzso and zzso mice that had been zzso with sheep red blood cells failed to form zzso in the zzso they both developed zzso clusters of peanut zzso zzso cells in their zzso Furthermore, when lethally zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso mice that had received zzso cells from zzso mice were zzso with sheep red blood cells, they failed to generate zzso clusters in the zzso zzso but showed robust zzso clusters in the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the signals that regulate the development of distinct T and B cell zones as well as the signals that regulate B cell zzso to produce clusters of zzso cells differ between the zzso and zzso
