zzso muscle insulin resistance may be aggravated by zzso zzso of fatty zzso zzso that inhibit insulin zzso We tested the hypothesis that enhanced fatty acid zzso in zzso should protect against fatty zzso insulin resistance by limiting zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) zzso or zzso zzso Two to zzso zzso of zzso I, the zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso increased zzso of the zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso and increased insulin stimulation of zzso incorporation into zzso by zzso while enhancing zzso zzso of zzso zzso of control cells with zzso zzso zzso for 18 h caused zzso of zzso zzso and zzso (but not zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso incorporation into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso zzso In the context of zzso I zzso zzso zzso produced a relative decrease in zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but did not inhibit zzso of protein zzso zzso Due to the enhancement of zzso zzso metabolism induced by zzso I zzso itself, net zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly greater than in zzso control cells (71 and zzso greater, zzso However, zzso I zzso failed to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We propose that accelerated zzso in muscle cells exerts an zzso effect independently of changes in zzso zzso zzso
