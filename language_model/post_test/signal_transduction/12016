To investigate the function of zzso zzso in gastric cancer and explore the target genes of zzso 

A quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis was performed to evaluate zzso expression in gastric cancer cell zzso After zzso gastric cancer cells with zzso and zzso zzso zzso blue and zzso zzso were used to measure the respective proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso plasmids were constructed, and a zzso reporter zzso was used to identify the zzso binding site on zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in multiple gastric cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in gastric cancer cells produced a profound zzso zzso zzso zzso into gastric cancer cells resulted in a greater growth zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso cell line) and a higher zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso cell line) than zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso expression was zzso suppressed by zzso but not by zzso The activity of a zzso reporter construct that contained the zzso region zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not by zzso A zzso in the zzso binding site completely zzso the regulatory effect on zzso activity, which suggests that there is a direct zzso binding site in the zzso of zzso 

Both zzso and zzso function as zzso in gastric zzso However, zzso alone directly targets zzso and it exhibits a stronger tumor zzso effect than zzso
