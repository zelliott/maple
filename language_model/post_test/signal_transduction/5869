zzso a zzso zzso for zzso acid, is implicated in various zzso cellular zzso including cell migration, tumor cell zzso and zzso Recent studies demonstrated that zzso expressed in cancer cells can be zzso zzso at the zzso by membrane type zzso zzso zzso to form soluble zzso and that zzso zzso plays a critical role in cancer cell zzso Here, we show that transforming growth zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in cell zzso zzso migration and pathological zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was blocked by the specific zzso regulated zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, treatment with zzso an inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso likely play a role in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso of zzso and zzso in the cell membrane and in an increased level of soluble zzso Using an electric zzso zzso sensing zzso system, we demonstrated that zzso treatment promotes zzso cell migration, involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso Thus, this study contributes to our understanding of molecular mechanisms that play a critical role in tumor cell invasion and zzso
