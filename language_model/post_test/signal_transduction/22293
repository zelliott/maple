It is intriguing that some zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are capable of inducing zzso cell death in a selected group of zzso As earlier reports from our laboratory have ruled out the original notion that zzso necrosis in mouse zzso zzso cells was zzso cell death, the main objective of this study was thus to determine the underlying mechanism of this form of cell zzso In this study, we provided clear evidence that zzso zzso in zzso cells and such cell death is dependent on zzso production of tumor necrosis zzso zzso at the zzso zzso More importantly, we identified that zzso zzso zzso but not nuclear factor zzso is the zzso factor controlling zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is able to activate zzso through zzso of two upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found that protein zzso C is the important upstream signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso production of zzso and cell zzso Data from this study reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso an important form of programmed zzso cell death with increasing understanding of its biological significance in health and zzso
