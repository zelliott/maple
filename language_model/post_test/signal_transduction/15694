zzso zzso zzso administered to zzso rats during the first week of life zzso a neurodegenerative process, which is represented by several zzso zzso of surviving zzso in the brain, where zzso zzso by zzso is essential for zzso threshold zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and expression of zzso and protein for two main zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured at zzso day 60, after zzso zzso treatment in two critical cerebral regions, cerebral zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso for zzso were significantly diminished in both cerebral zzso In the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso treatment also decreased the zzso for zzso and protein for zzso without significant changes in its corresponding protein and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and protein for zzso were increased, whilst zzso protein was elevated without significant changes in its zzso Clearly these results confirm the zzso cells loss after zzso zzso treatment in both cerebral zzso As most of the zzso markers measured were reduced in the cerebral cortex, this region seems to be more sensitive than zzso where interesting zzso changes over zzso and zzso proteins were zzso However, it is possible that others zzso systems are also zzso the zzso cells loss in the cerebral cortex, and that zzso in two main forms of zzso in the zzso are not sufficient to maintain the neural zzso threshold for this zzso
