The zzso zzso zzso quality control zzso destroys zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso Most zzso of this zzso degradation zzso zzso are zzso targeted for destruction through recognition of poorly understood structural hallmarks of zzso However, the normal zzso zzso membrane protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso We have proposed that zzso zzso occurs by a regulated transition to an zzso quality control zzso zzso with this, we had previously shown that zzso is strongly stabilized by chemical zzso such as zzso which stabilize zzso zzso To understand the features of zzso that permit regulated zzso we have thoroughly characterized the effects of chemical zzso on zzso These agents caused a zzso immediate, direct change in zzso degradation consistent with an effect on zzso zzso We devised an in zzso limited zzso zzso of zzso in its native zzso In zzso chemical zzso caused a dramatic, rapid change in zzso structure to a less accessible zzso As in the living cell, the in zzso action of chemical zzso was highly specific for zzso and completely zzso To evaluate the zzso relevance of this model behavior, we used the limited zzso zzso to examine the effects of changing in zzso degradation signals on zzso zzso We found that changes similar to those observed with chemical zzso were brought about by zzso of natural degradation zzso Thus, zzso can undergo zzso zzso structural changes that are relevant to the zzso control of zzso zzso These findings support the idea that zzso regulation is brought about by regulated zzso of folding zzso Considering the ubiquitous nature of quality control pathways in biology, it may be that this strategy of regulation is zzso
