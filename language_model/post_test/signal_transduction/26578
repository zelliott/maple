zzso of excess lipids is associated with heart zzso The effects of transgenic expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso is zzso We explored whether mice expressing zzso via the zzso heavy chain zzso promoter develop heart dysfunction with aging or after crossing with mice over expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso transgenic mice had increased heart zzso but no evidence of heart dysfunction, even up to age 12 zzso The zzso zzso improved heart dysfunction and survival of zzso transgenic zzso Both zzso and zzso levels in the heart were reduced by this zzso as were the levels of several zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso There were fewer large zzso droplets in zzso mice compared with zzso but total zzso content was not zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not toxic to the heart but reduces levels of toxic lipids and improves zzso zzso Moreover, the beneficial effects of zzso illustrate the zzso of several zzso zzso pathways and the difficulty of assigning benefit to an isolated change in one potentially toxic zzso zzso
