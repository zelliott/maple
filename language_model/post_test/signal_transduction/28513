To investigate zzso responses of barley zzso zzso zzso to the barley powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were inserted into open zzso of barley leaves zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso race A6 zzso Resistance zzso responses of barley zzso zzso zzso parent line) and the zzso resistant zzso zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso were continuously monitored from 20 zzso to 4 days after zzso The main events were zzso as short-term responses around 2 h after zzso zzso intermediate responses around 8 and 12 zzso and long-term responses starting between 21 and 24 zzso zzso responses were rapid transient decreases of zzso zzso and zzso activities that lasted minutes zzso zzso were similar for all zzso tested, and thus, these short-term responses were attributed as zzso first encounters of zzso surface material with the host plasma zzso This is supported by the observation that a zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded similar zzso zzso Intermediate responses are trains of zzso zzso spikes that, being different in susceptible zzso and zzso zzso (or zzso were interpreted as accompanying specific events of zzso zzso zzso events were massive slow and long-lasting zzso up to two pH units above zzso Since these latter changes were only observed with zzso hypersensitive reaction zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso or, to a smaller extent, with susceptible zzso both lacking significant rates of HR, they were rated as cell death zzso It is concluded that zzso pH changes are important indicators of zzso interactions that correlate with both the different stages of zzso development and the different types of host defense zzso
