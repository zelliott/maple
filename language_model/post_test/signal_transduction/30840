Prospective zzso and zzso formation are coordinated by zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso and zzso development require different levels of zzso zzso However, little is known about the extent to which specific regions within these two parts of the brain differ in their requirement for zzso signaling during zzso Here, we have explored the effects of zzso zzso signaling within the embryonic mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1) by zzso zzso zzso from an early zzso We show that such zzso zzso moderately reduces zzso zzso and that this reduction causes cell death in the anterior zzso the region furthest from the source of zzso zzso Interestingly, the remaining zzso cells develop into anterior zzso indicating that a low level of zzso signaling is sufficient to promote only anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso also affects development of the zzso the part of the zzso that spans the zzso We found that, whereas zzso of zzso alone caused loss of the anterior zzso reducing zzso signaling further, by decreasing zzso gene dose, resulted in loss of the entire zzso Our data suggest that cell death is not responsible for zzso loss, but rather that it fails to develop because reducing zzso signaling zzso the balance between zzso and roof plate development in zzso zzso We suggest a molecular explanation for this phenomenon by providing evidence that zzso signaling functions to inhibit the zzso signaling that promotes roof plate zzso
