zzso channel zzso zzso are widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular zzso Recent studies have shown that several zzso exerted distinct zzso effect in zzso dysfunction zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of action of zzso one of the widely used zzso on rat cardiac dysfunction during zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso of the rats with zzso (10 or 30 zzso zzso delayed the fall of mean zzso blood pressure caused by zzso zzso also significantly inhibited the zzso of plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of the action of zzso zzso rat zzso were used as a zzso zzso zzso decreased the release of zzso and zzso protein zzso and suppressed the degradation and zzso of inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso Further studies revealed that zzso markedly activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso downstream of the zzso signal zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso and zzso attenuated the depression of zzso and zzso expression by zzso in zzso zzso These findings may explain some zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso of zzso and zzso expression by zzso is, at least in part, dependent on zzso signaling zzso
