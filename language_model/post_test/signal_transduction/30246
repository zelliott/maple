zzso stress zzso attributable to pressure overload, leads to cardiac zzso and may ultimately cause heart zzso Yet, it is still unclear how mechanical stress is sensed and zzso on the molecular zzso To systematically zzso the underlying signal zzso zzso we analyzed the gene expression profile of stretched zzso on a zzso scale in comparison with other zzso of zzso such as pharmacological zzso Neonatal rat zzso zzso were either stretched zzso or zzso with zzso zzso both resulting in a similar degree of zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso genes zzso zzso and 21 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed by real-time zzso chain zzso Genes of the zzso gene zzso such as zzso were induced by both stretch zzso and zzso zzso We also verified zzso of known zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, several genes were found to be zzso induced by stretch, such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso both confirmed on protein zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso II significantly induced both zzso zzso the zzso zzso blocker zzso markedly blunted zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso induction of these zzso In conclusion, we report a comprehensive gene expression profile of zzso subjected to zzso stress in comparison with zzso induced zzso Our data imply that a zzso gene program exists, which is zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso
