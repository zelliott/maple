Specialized zzso structures known as zzso spines are the primary sites of zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso Previous studies have shown that spines rapidly zzso their zzso zzso to modify their shape and this has been associated with changes in synaptic zzso However, the receptors and signaling zzso that restructure the zzso network in spines are only beginning to be zzso We reported previously that the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates spine zzso However, the signaling pathways downstream of zzso that induce spine zzso on zzso zzso binding remain poorly zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso stimulation of zzso leads to the recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and in zzso zzso This interaction occurs through an zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso and requires the zzso zzso zzso In the brain, zzso is found in multiple compartments of zzso and is readily found in zzso density zzso zzso with this, zzso activity is required for the maintenance of spine zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso the association of the zzso zzso factor zzso with the plasma zzso Because zzso has been implicated previously in the structural plasticity of zzso this signaling may enable zzso to zzso zzso filaments and restructure spines at sites of zzso zzso
