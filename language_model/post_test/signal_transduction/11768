Previously, we described a model culture system for comparing responsiveness of poorly differentiated and zzso human colon zzso cells to zzso growth zzso While zzso growth zzso zzso an zzso of zzso as well as a zzso response in the zzso cells, the poorly differentiated cells were insensitive to zzso growth zzso We now show, by zzso incorporation experiments and zzso analysis, that transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso zzso the zzso responses to the growth factors zzso growth factor + insulin + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as to nutrients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The poorly differentiated cells did not respond to zzso Moreover, zzso (10 zzso completely zzso the growth zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso responsive, zzso colon zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso cells, at a time after zzso had been zzso zzso in response to growth zzso factors, resulted in a loss of responsiveness to zzso zzso of zzso to these cells at increasing time periods after zzso stimulation also resulted in a loss of the zzso repression of zzso The results suggest an important role for zzso in the mechanism of action of zzso in zzso human colon zzso zzso
