Since its discovery in 2000, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as a class of zzso that controls the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the central nervous system zzso However, recent studies suggest that zzso are not only enhancers to zzso but also zzso to other zzso including insulin zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso Moreover, they regulate zzso factors such as signal zzso and zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso Indeed, zzso proteins participate in multiple cellular processes including control of cell survival, brain development, memory formation, gene transcription, and zzso In this review, we have summarized the functions of zzso proteins in zzso and discussed their potential implications in various neurological zzso
