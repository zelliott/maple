A protein of approximately zzso was identified as a candidate zzso zzso in rumen zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Potential 7 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso transcripts and, from them, zzso proteins were also zzso The regulation of these zzso transport pathways by zzso zzso changes was the main focus of this zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in control zzso zzso low zzso zzso and high (5 zzso medium was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abundance and activity were investigated by Western zzso analysis, flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were employed to differentiate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso in low- or zzso zzso However, compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such cells showed reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso or elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rates that correlated with a decreased zzso and increased zzso expression of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both characterized by an increased zzso influx zzso In zzso zzso the latter resulted mainly from a strong zzso of the zzso transport zzso The data thus clearly demonstrate the intrinsic regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso
