zzso zzso in insect plasma have been implicated in two types of immune zzso that is, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We have identified more than 20 zzso zzso in zzso of the tobacco zzso zzso zzso but functions are known for only a few of zzso We report here functions of two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 and 8 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are each composed of an zzso clip domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is an apparent zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso is most similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which activate the Toll zzso zzso and zzso are expressed zzso in fat body and zzso and zzso into zzso where they are activated by zzso zzso in response to zzso To investigate zzso and biological activity of zzso and zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in which the zzso zzso was replaced with zzso and/or the zzso site was changed to permit zzso by bovine factor zzso zzso was found to activate zzso zzso zzso in zzso and induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso was also determined to activate zzso Active zzso or zzso injected into larvae induced expression of zzso peptides and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso becomes activated in response to microbial infection and zzso in two immune zzso zzso of zzso which leads to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which stimulates a zzso zzso
