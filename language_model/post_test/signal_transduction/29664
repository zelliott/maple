zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, these molecules are involved in signaling events, regulating such processes as cell zzso zzso and zzso Members of the zzso zzso called either classical or type I zzso contain a highly zzso sequence at their zzso binding site consisting of the three zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that peptides containing the zzso motif inhibit zzso events such as cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report here that a zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso cell zzso resulting in a progressive zzso cell zzso This effect depends on cell density, as it is only observed when dense cultures are treated with the zzso zzso junction zzso zzso and zzso are zzso affected by the zzso treatment, as judged by double zzso labeling followed by zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are largely retained during the first few hours after addition of the zzso It was also observed that following treatment, zzso filaments partially lose their plasma membrane zzso at zzso and zzso towards the cell zzso Interestingly, addition of basic zzso growth factor to zzso zzso zzso cell cultures, completely blocks zzso and the zzso zzso reduce the zzso of the zzso zzso target protein zzso suggesting that the zzso exerts its effect by zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso We propose that zzso signaling is essential for maintaining viability of zzso zzso cells, and that its zzso by zzso drives these cells to zzso
