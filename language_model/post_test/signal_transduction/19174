Bone zzso proteins zzso are key regulators of cell fate decisions during zzso and tissue zzso zzso signal through a coordinated assembly of two types of zzso zzso zzso receptors to induce zzso plus zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso opened new avenues to study specific zzso zzso and to delineate this effect from zzso and zzso zzso Here we present comprehensive and quantitative analyses on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment zzso We demonstrate for the first time, that both compounds affect not only the zzso but also the zzso zzso pathways induced by either zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso and zzso In addition zzso effects on all branches of zzso zzso zzso are zzso From this we conclude that the zzso of zzso receptors by zzso and more efficiently by zzso affects all known zzso induced zzso zzso
