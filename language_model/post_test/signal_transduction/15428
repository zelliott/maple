zzso are the principal zzso cells responsible for tissue zzso collagen deposition, and the restrictive nature of lung zzso associated with pulmonary zzso We previously reported that zzso activates zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso a zzso zzso in normal lung zzso resembling the zzso of zzso lung zzso We undertook this study to investigate whether a selective direct zzso zzso zzso interferes with signal zzso in human lung zzso induced by zzso and zzso via zzso 

Lung zzso proliferation was analyzed using the zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso and organization of zzso muscle zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity of lung zzso was measured by a collagen gel contraction zzso zzso tissue growth factor zzso and type I collagen expression was analyzed on Western zzso 

zzso at zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso expression and organization, and the production of collagen and zzso in normal lung zzso Moreover, when treated with zzso (1 zzso zzso lung zzso produced zzso less zzso zzso less zzso and zzso less type I collagen compared with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso important zzso events in lung zzso and warrants study as a potential zzso drug for the treatment of zzso lung diseases such as zzso lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary zzso
