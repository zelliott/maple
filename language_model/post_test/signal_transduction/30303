Although zzso acid zzso is an effective treatment for acute zzso leukemia and several solid tumors, its use is limited by resistance due to increased zzso The most studied mechanism for zzso resistance is the zzso metabolism regulated by the zzso acid zzso zzso However, treatment of cancer is usually not done with a single zzso agent, but with a variety of combined chemotherapy regimens, including several zzso drugs, and other zzso administered supportive zzso zzso X zzso zzso an orphan nuclear zzso that functions as a zzso zzso factor, serves as an important zzso sensor regulating metabolism and zzso Many prescription drugs are zzso zzso which can activate zzso target zzso including phase I zzso phase II zzso and zzso zzso The present study was designed to examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso Due to the marked species differences in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transgenic mouse models were zzso In addition to zzso zzso several clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso and zzso all increased zzso metabolism both in zzso and in zzso which was zzso and zzso of zzso was the major zzso Furthermore, induction of the zzso zzso and zzso genes was also zzso This study suggested that zzso of zzso zzso can increase zzso metabolism through zzso of the zzso pathway, which might be a mechanism for some form of zzso zzso Other zzso target zzso might also be zzso
