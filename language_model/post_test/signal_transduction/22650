Higher plants as zzso organisms react very flexible to environmental changes and stresses and use zzso like zzso zzso and nitrate not only as nutrients but also as signals as part of their life zzso The role of zzso as signal molecules has attracted considerable interest during recent zzso Data reviewed here for developing plant seeds suggest a trigger function of especially zzso also in development in that zzso regulatory control can override zzso regulation, zzso the zzso zzso only continues normally if a certain zzso state is sensed at a given time point in a given cell or zzso Several experimental strategies have provided mainly zzso evidence that certain sugar levels and/or the resulting changes in zzso values are necessary within defined zzso or cells to maintain a distinct stage of differentiation or to proceed with the zzso zzso In young zzso seeds, but certainly also in other zzso a high zzso (probably mainly zzso level seems to maintain the capacity of cells to divide whereas - later in seed development - a certain zzso level is necessary to induce zzso cell zzso A major zzso of zzso zzso levels in young zzso seeds is an zzso zzso zzso expressed in the inner cell layers of the seed zzso The zzso zzso the incoming zzso zzso into zzso and zzso During development the tissue zzso the zzso is zzso in a very specific spatial and zzso pattern as part of the zzso zzso and is thus creating steep zzso zzso within the zzso These zzso can be measured at nearly cellular resolution and were found to be correlated positively with cell division rate and zzso with cell differentiation and storage zzso A zzso and a zzso zzso accumulating only in the zzso cell layer of the zzso seem to be essential in creating and maintaining these zzso To gain further insights into the role of zzso especially zzso as triggers of zzso processes we zzso have to identify zzso molecules already zzso in zzso and to describe and understand the signal zzso networks zzso
