zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that regulates cell zzso differentiation and zzso In our previous studies, we have reported that another zzso zzso plays an important role in primordial zzso zzso and zzso We also found that zzso was expressed in zzso zzso but its functions in primordial zzso zzso remain zzso The objective of this study is to investigate the role and mechanism of zzso during the growth of primordial zzso 

zzso from zzso rats were cultured in zzso for 8 zzso Three zzso and one negative control zzso were designed and used in the present zzso zzso Western zzso and primordial zzso development were assessed for the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso and its effect on primordial zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein in primordial zzso growth were examined using the zzso method and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso were used to explore the possible signaling pathways of zzso in primordial zzso 

The results showed that zzso protein was distributed in the zzso membrane and the zzso cell membrane in the primordial zzso and zzso expression level increased with the growth of primordial zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso effect on zzso zzso and protein zzso Eight days after zzso of rat zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso in frozen zzso sections was clearly discernible under a zzso zzso and its relative expression level was zzso higher than that in the control zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso lowered its relative expression level zzso zzso We also found that the development of cultured primordial zzso was completely arrested after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that zzso onset was inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso none of them zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso were clearly decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso treatment resulted in a decrease in the zzso level in zzso but no change was observed in the zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment decreased the zzso expression level in the zzso but no changes were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso plays an important role in regulating primordial zzso zzso and growth via the zzso zzso zzso
