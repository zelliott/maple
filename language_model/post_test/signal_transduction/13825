The role of zzso as a signaling zzso in plants was originally proposed several decades zzso However, recognition of zzso as a true signal has been largely debated and only recently this role has been fully zzso The zzso cases of zzso signaling involve zzso zzso such as the induction of zzso or zzso zzso but a large volume of scattered information suggests that zzso signals may control a vast array of zzso processes along the whole life cycle of the zzso Also, wide gaps exist in our current understanding of the zzso steps that mediate zzso zzso zzso concentration in plant zzso tends to be directly related to light intensity, and zzso related to temperature, and zzso zzso zzso supply often mimics the effect of high light and zzso However, many exceptions to this rule seem to occur due to interactions with other signaling zzso In conclusion, the zzso role as a signal zzso in plants is starting to be unveiled and much research is still needed to have a complete map of its significance in plant zzso
