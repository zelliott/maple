In many trees, a short zzso zzso triggers substantial zzso adjustments necessary for zzso We have used transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso which express the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso carrying the dominant zzso zzso to investigate the role of zzso in zzso responses in the shoot zzso zzso zzso Under zzso the zzso trees ceased zzso growth comparably to the zzso In contrast, the formation of terminal zzso which in trees is typically induced by zzso was zzso However, although delayed, zzso did eventually develop in the zzso zzso This, together with the rapid resumption of growth in the zzso trees after transfer from zzso to zzso conditions suggests that zzso zzso the zzso terminal bud formation, as well as growth zzso In addition, zzso buds of the zzso birch did not accumulate zzso acid zzso under zzso suggesting interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in SAM functioning were further exemplified by reduced zzso dominance and early flowering in zzso zzso Gene expression analysis of shoot zzso revealed that the zzso birch lacked the marked increase in expression of a zzso gene typical to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene expression is hypothesized to relate to modification of cell walls in terminal buds during zzso growth zzso Our results suggest that zzso is involved in terminal bud formation and in the timely suppression of SAM activity, not only in the shoot zzso but also in zzso and zzso zzso
