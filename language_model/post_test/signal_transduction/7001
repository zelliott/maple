Experimental evidence points to the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of several zzso diseases including zzso zzso arthritis and zzso zzso Although a principal zzso of T helper type 17 cells, zzso is produced by many other cell types including zzso T cells and zzso T cells, and is found at high levels associated with mast cells and zzso at sites of skin and joint disease in zzso zzso zzso expression of numerous zzso genes in target cells such as zzso and zzso leading to increased production of zzso zzso zzso peptides and other zzso that contribute to clinical disease zzso zzso zzso must be considered within the context of the local zzso because it acts zzso or zzso with other zzso zzso including zzso necrosis zzso Several direct zzso zzso have shown promising activity in proof of concept and phase 2 clinical studies, thereby providing confirmation of experimental data supporting zzso in disease zzso although levels of response are not predicted by zzso zzso zzso zzso produced rapid zzso of the psoriasis gene signature and high clinical response rates in patients with zzso plaque zzso consistent with an important role for zzso in psoriasis zzso Clinical response rates with zzso zzso in zzso arthritis and zzso arthritis, however, were improved to a lesser degree compared with zzso suggesting that zzso is either important in a subset of patients or plays a relatively minor role in inflammatory joint zzso zzso phase 3 clinical trials should provide further information on the role of zzso in these zzso
