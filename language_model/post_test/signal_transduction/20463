Since the discovery that zzso membrane zzso represents a critical step in the regulation of intrinsic zzso zzso have been viewed as zzso zzso controlling cell death as well as several aspects of cell zzso zzso constitute the most prominent source of zzso and are implicated in multiple anabolic and zzso zzso In addition, zzso coordinate zzso stress responses, such as zzso and control zzso cell death zzso such as regulated zzso Thus, zzso seem to regulate a zzso of cellular functions, spanning from zzso metabolism to stress responses and zzso The involvement of zzso in both vital and lethal processes is crucial for both embryonic and zzso development, as well as for the maintenance of adult tissue zzso In line with this notion, primary zzso defects or zzso in the signaling pathways that zzso on or zzso from zzso zzso a large number of human diseases, including premature aging, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and zzso Here, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms that enable zzso to sustain cell survival, coordinate stress responses, and mediate cell death, linking these zzso zzso cardiovascular health and zzso
