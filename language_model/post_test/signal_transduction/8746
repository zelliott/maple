zzso zzso consists of two distinct zzso zzso and zzso with indistinguishable biological activities that signal through the zzso type I zzso zzso A naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso without initiating signal zzso and prevents zzso zzso competitively zzso zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that the balance between zzso zzso and zzso plays an essential role in a variety of cardiovascular zzso zzso may play a role in zzso disease by promoting the formation of zzso zzso enhancing vascular zzso and triggering plaque zzso Following zzso zzso zzso critically regulates the inflammatory response and is involved in the development of adverse zzso by enhancing expression of zzso zzso zzso signaling may also be an essential zzso in the zzso of heart failure by suppressing cardiac zzso promoting zzso zzso and inducing zzso zzso The present review summarizes current available data showing the significant role of zzso signaling in heart disease and raising the possibility that zzso zzso (such as zzso a zzso zzso human zzso may be clinically useful agents in patients with certain cardiovascular zzso
