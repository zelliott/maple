Type 1 diabetes results from T zzso destruction of zzso beta zzso Although elimination of B zzso has proven successful at preventing disease, zzso of B cell function as a means to prevent type 1 diabetes has not been zzso The development, fate, and function of B zzso depend upon zzso zzso which is zzso in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso When introduced into zzso mice, zzso zzso only modestly reduces B cell numbers, but dramatically protects against zzso In zzso zzso zzso mirrors changes in B cell zzso seen in other zzso but also improves B zzso zzso as indicated by failure to generate insulin zzso Introduction of an zzso zzso H chain zzso restores diabetes in zzso zzso mice, indicating that zzso B cells are functionally capable of promoting zzso diabetes if they have a critical zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso effect of zzso zzso may reflect a lack of zzso zzso in the B cell zzso Thus, signaling via zzso can be modulated to improve B cell zzso and prevent T zzso zzso zzso
