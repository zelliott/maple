zzso in zzso energy metabolism are thought to be involved in most neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso disease zzso zzso administration of zzso acid zzso a suicide inhibitor of zzso zzso causes prolonged energy zzso and replicates most of the zzso features of zzso including preferential zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed one of the mechanisms that could account for this selective zzso zzso zzso In chronically zzso rats, the time course of motor behavioral zzso and zzso abnormalities was zzso Progressive zzso of motor performance occurred after 3 zzso By zzso analysis and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we found a selective zzso in the zzso occurring first in its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed from brain sections of these rats, using zzso detection of its zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred progressively and selectively in the DL of the zzso and was followed by zzso zzso and expression in the same zzso zzso To zzso the role of the zzso module in zzso zzso zzso we then used primary zzso zzso in culture, in which we zzso zzso death by application of zzso We found strong nuclear zzso of activated zzso that was rapidly followed by zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso of a dominant negative version of zzso lacking its zzso domain and zzso sites for activated zzso completely abolished zzso zzso zzso We thus conclude that a genetic program controlled by the zzso module is an important molecular event in zzso zzso zzso
