The zzso zzso zzso regulates gene expression programs controlling differentiation and cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but the structural components allowing this zzso are not zzso A point zzso analysis allowed mapping two nuclear zzso signals and a zzso interaction motif zzso that also occurs in zzso and zzso The SIM binds all three major zzso of zzso zzso while only zzso is capable of zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso of the SIM prevented zzso binding and precluded zzso of zzso in nuclear zzso thus causing zzso of zzso to the entire zzso zzso zzso of the SIM prohibited recruitment of zzso to zzso nuclear bodies and disrupted zzso with other proteins such as the zzso protein zzso in nuclear zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso in intact cells was largely dependent on a functional SIM in zzso highlighting the relevance of zzso interactions as a molecular glue that serves to enhance zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso with an inactive SIM showed changed activities, thus revealing that zzso binding of zzso to the zzso is important for the regulation of its zzso
