To identify specific zzso for components of zzso A zzso signaling in zzso we established a light program consisting of multiple treatments with alternating red and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with multiple red light zzso can reduce the amount of zzso which in turn decreases the zzso responses zzso zzso by the subsequent treatments with zzso zzso Our zzso were able to avoid this red zzso reduction of the zzso Here, we describe zzso a new zzso zzso with increased sensitivity to zzso zzso The zzso zzso maps to the top of zzso zzso The zzso showed no change in zzso in darkness or under continuous white light, but they exhibited an increased sensitivity to red light and an increased persistence of zzso during prolonged dark zzso after multiple short zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso accumulated normal amounts of zzso and showed no zzso in the degradation or de zzso synthesis of zzso The expression of the zzso zzso requires the presence of zzso Our data provide evidence that zzso is a zzso acting component in the zzso zzso zzso
