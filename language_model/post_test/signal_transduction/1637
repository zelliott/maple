Both the recognition of zzso complex by the zzso zzso and engagement of zzso molecules are necessary for efficient zzso zzso zzso has been widely recognized as the major zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plays a central role in immune responses against zzso zzso diseases, and graft zzso In this review, we will zzso evidence that zzso is also prominent in the regulation of immune responses and the maintenance of peripheral zzso Indeed, zzso engagement increases the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the differentiation of zzso cells that have a protective function in zzso and has an obligatory role in the zzso of regulatory T zzso zzso zzso interactions induce a balance of zzso and regulatory signals that have opposite outcomes on immune zzso This new perspective on zzso function suggests that caution should be taken in the development of zzso targeting zzso zzso
