zzso acute regulatory protein zzso synthesis and zzso are zzso by zzso of divergent signaling pathways in the adrenal zzso The two major zzso regulators of zzso synthesis in the adrenal zzso zzso are zzso II zzso and zzso zzso which both mediate an increase in zzso calcium levels, although by distinct zzso Previously, we demonstrated that increased zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment is paralleled by an increase in zzso protein in the zzso human zzso cell zzso We now show that zzso steady state zzso zzso levels are increased by zzso and zzso but not by zzso or zzso treatment of zzso zzso Northern analysis detected two major transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso cells, with the most prominent effect of zzso treatment on induction of the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso promoter activity in transient zzso of zzso cells with a zzso reporter gene driven by zzso zzso of the human promoter was increased only by zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter indicates that both the zzso and zzso elements are within 150 bases of the zzso start zzso zzso of a zzso zzso element localized at zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso activity in these transient zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso gene by a zzso zzso mechanism may represent a common zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso action in stimulating steroid production in the adrenal zzso and zzso
