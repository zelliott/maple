Members of the zzso zzso family mediate changes in the zzso zzso and are also implicated in zzso zzso including zzso Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis of these proteins during zzso has never been performed in any zzso 

Using the zzso model to identify the role of zzso zzso on zzso we show that transcripts for all zzso zzso are detected in muscle cells of the zzso We find that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso division cycle zzso zzso the polarity of muscle cells, whereas that of other zzso zzso induced cell positioning zzso Moreover, dominant negative version of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso impaired the formation of mature zzso 

Taken together, our results show that several zzso zzso pathways are required to control the spatial zzso of muscle cells in the zzso and to coordinate zzso zzso This stresses the importance of zzso the entire zzso family when studying a new biological zzso
