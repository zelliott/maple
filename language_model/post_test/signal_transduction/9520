zzso a family of zzso found in zzso vegetables, have zzso effects against several types of tumor zzso Multiple myeloma is a fatal disease characterized by zzso proliferation of plasma cells in the bone zzso The growing body of zzso information on the zzso activity of zzso led us to investigate their zzso zzso 

We evaluated the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso on a panel of human myeloma cell lines as well as primary myeloma tumor zzso Cell zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and cell proliferation were then analyzed in zzso and in a zzso mouse model in zzso The molecular zzso of zzso treatment in multiple myeloma cells were evaluated by multiplex analyses using zzso zzso and western zzso 

We observed that zzso and zzso zzso have activity against myeloma cell lines and patients' myeloma cells both in zzso and in zzso using a myeloma zzso mouse zzso zzso induced zzso death of myeloma zzso depletion of zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso of diverse components of signaling zzso revealed changes in zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso as well as changes in the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso suppressed proliferation of myeloma cells alone and when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced the in zzso zzso activity of several conventional and novel therapies used in multiple zzso 

Our study shows that zzso have potent zzso activities and may enhance the activity of other zzso myeloma zzso These results indicate that zzso may have therapeutic potential in multiple myeloma and provide the zzso framework for future clinical studies of zzso in multiple zzso
