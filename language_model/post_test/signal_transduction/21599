The zzso gene zzso zzso identified by zzso interference in zzso cultured cells, encodes a type 1 membrane protein shown here to bind and to mediate response to the active zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso produce defects characteristic of zzso signaling loss in zzso and zzso discs, and zzso analysis places zzso action at or upstream of the zzso acting zzso zzso zzso zzso The first of two zzso zzso type III zzso zzso of the zzso protein mediates a specific interaction with zzso protein in zzso but the second zzso domain is additionally required for in zzso signaling activity and for zzso binding of zzso protein to cells zzso zzso Other members of the zzso family, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso also interact with zzso zzso via a specific zzso domain, thus identifying an zzso zzso family of membrane proteins that function in zzso signal zzso
