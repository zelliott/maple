Although the zzso potential of human zzso adult zzso cells zzso has been well zzso few published studies have investigated the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso differentiation of mouse zzso We report here that significant zzso as determined by gene expression and zzso analysis, is induced only when mouse zzso are cultured in the presence of zzso acid with or without zzso human bone zzso protein zzso zzso Furthermore, a dynamic expression profile for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed, with dramatic zzso during zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso acid enhanced levels of zzso protein during the first 7 days of zzso differentiation and that zzso suppression of zzso dramatically impaired the ability of zzso to form bone in zzso In contrast, absence of zzso did not significantly diminish zzso zzso Our data therefore demonstrate that the zzso commitment of zzso mouse zzso requires zzso acid, which enhances expression of the critical zzso zzso
