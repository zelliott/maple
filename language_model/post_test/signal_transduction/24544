Earlier studies in our laboratory suggested a role for zzso products of zzso acid, such as zzso acid and zzso acid, in supporting zzso events in zzso zzso zzso Because zzso are also products of the same zzso zzso we tested their actions on signal zzso events related to DNA zzso zzso A4 and B4 (10 zzso significantly enhanced zzso incorporation into zzso cells in the absence of fetal bovine serum without affecting cell differentiation or cell zzso zzso B4 increased the duration of time that cells spent in the S phase of the cell cycle, and also significantly enhanced protein zzso C activity in zzso whereas zzso expression was unaffected by either of the zzso zzso The novel, zzso actions of zzso A and B on zzso zzso cells documented in this study represent a unique spectrum of effects of zzso on signal zzso events as compared with other zzso
