zzso tumor cells express a zzso zzso zzso similar to embryonic stem zzso However, the absence of major regulatory checkpoints in these tumor cells allows zzso zzso of embryonic signaling zzso which seems to contribute to their plastic zzso Emerging evidence showing the molecular zzso between two major stem cell signaling pathways zzso and zzso suggests a promising therapeutic strategy that could target aggressive tumor cells on the basis of their unique zzso and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso signaling pathways during tumor zzso
