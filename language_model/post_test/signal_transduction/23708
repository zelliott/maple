The fatty zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the nuclear zzso zzso zzso for by zzso thereby enhancing the zzso activity of the zzso This zzso zzso is critical for induction of proliferation of breast zzso cells by activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso is highly zzso in human breast zzso and we provide genetic evidence of the zzso significance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso where it zzso the ability of zzso to enhance cell zzso migration, and zzso To determine whether zzso is essential for zzso zzso tumor growth, we zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso which spontaneously develop zzso zzso zzso zzso relieved zzso of zzso downstream zzso signals, decreased expression of zzso target genes that drive cell zzso and suppressed zzso tumor zzso Our findings establish that zzso is critical for zzso tumor development, zzso the development of zzso zzso as novel zzso zzso
