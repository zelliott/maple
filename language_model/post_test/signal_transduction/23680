The activity of zzso zzso zzso appears to control a vascular smooth muscle relaxing mechanism regulated through zzso zzso zzso Since our recent studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form of protein zzso G zzso contributes to the relaxation of isolated zzso bovine pulmonary arteries zzso to zzso and responses to zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso promoted relaxation by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under zzso to minimize zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small zzso zzso zzso inhibited relaxation of zzso to zzso and attenuated the increase in zzso zzso zzso to zzso did not appear to be altered by depletion of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited force generation under zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso of zzso with zzso inhibited the effects of zzso and enhanced similar responses to zzso zzso depletion by zzso inhibited zzso zzso to zzso but it did not alter zzso zzso under zzso or the stimulation of zzso by zzso Thus regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso appears to control zzso zzso in zzso through its influence on zzso zzso regulation by the zzso dependence of zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso may contribute to vascular responses to zzso that are associated with changes in zzso zzso
