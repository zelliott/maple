zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso composed of a zzso zzso 3 zzso domain, a zzso domain zzso and a zzso binding domain zzso The zzso domain of zzso associates with focal zzso zzso zzso but its role in cellular function has not fully been zzso To address this issue, we established and analyzed primary zzso derived from mice expressing a truncated zzso lacking zzso 2, which encodes the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso In comparison to zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells showed reduced zzso which could be due to impaired zzso of zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso and also impaired zzso of zzso zzso 2 to focal zzso on zzso In addition, to analyze downstream signaling pathways regulated by zzso zzso 2, we performed zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that a zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which may be regulated by zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso complex formation, recruitment of zzso to focal zzso and regulation of cell zzso gene expression in primary zzso
