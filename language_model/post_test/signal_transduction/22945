zzso is an orphan zzso of unknown function that is expressed on the surface of zzso T helper cell type 2 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In zzso blockade of zzso signaling with an zzso zzso fusion protein suppresses both differentiation to and zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In a nascent zzso response, zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso To determine if these effects were zzso by a direct effect on zzso cells, we next used a zzso adoptive transfer model of zzso and zzso lung zzso immune zzso Administration of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and the induction of an zzso inflammatory response, but failed to modify zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate an important role of zzso in zzso inflammatory responses and suggest that zzso may prove to be a novel target for the selective suppression of zzso immune zzso
