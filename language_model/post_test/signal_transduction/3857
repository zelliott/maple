zzso cells of zzso zzso display zzso calcium zzso which are generated at the plasma membrane and travel as a wave through the zzso into the zzso An zzso involves discrete increases in zzso zzso zzso followed by a relatively smooth return to the zzso zzso zzso The aim of our investigation was to determine what role these steps play in shaping the zzso signal in zzso cells, by conducting a high resolution zzso analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso To this end zzso loaded cells were zzso by zzso laser scanning zzso using the line scanning method to achieve 6 zzso time zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the steps were zzso in 3 different zzso areas, to see if there are spatial differences in zzso zzso zzso The results showed that each calcium zzso is built up by zzso steps that were generated very quickly and had approximately the same zzso Following each zzso step, there was a slow removal of calcium before the next step zzso the overall level of zzso Since the zzso steps were most pronounced directly beneath the plasma zzso they appear to be generated in this zzso The speed of the zzso wave near the membrane exceeded 40 zzso indicating an active mechanism for wave zzso In deeper regions of the cell, the wave speed was much slower (about 8 zzso and the size of each step was smaller, indicating that regulation occurs within a zzso range of zzso Inside the nucleus, however, the calcium wave accelerated again zzso zzso Treatment with zzso evoked a high zzso zzso transient and increased the number of zzso steps to 5 or zzso Each step had approximately the same size as the steps of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, which increased the frequency of the zzso had no effect on the number or the size of the zzso steps, but it reduced the time needed for each step to reach its maximum zzso We suggest a possible zzso zzso function for the zzso steps, zzso a cell generates more steps to achieve a high zzso zzso or zzso the speed of the steps to increase the frequency of zzso Both phenomena may play a crucial role in the zzso of information zzso from an zzso input to the zzso zzso
