zzso zzso plant defensive proteins first encounter the zzso cell wall that can harbor specific components that facilitate or prevent access to the plasma zzso However, signal zzso pathways controlling cell wall composition in zzso zzso are largely zzso We report here that the deposition of cell wall constituents that block the action of zzso zzso an zzso plant defense zzso against zzso zzso requires the activity of a zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso that locks zzso in a zzso inactive form, zzso zzso zzso zzso A dominant interfering zzso in zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso A deletion zzso in zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso also increases zzso zzso zzso zzso strains bearing these zzso also have increased tolerance to zzso reduced cell wall zzso and increased zzso content in the cell zzso
