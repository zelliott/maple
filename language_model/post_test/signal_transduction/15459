The zzso zzso signaling zzso is inappropriately activated in certain human zzso including zzso an aggressive brain zzso zzso a drug that zzso zzso signaling by targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso has produced promising zzso responses in early clinical studies of zzso driven by zzso in this zzso To evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a zzso patient who had relapsed after an initial response to zzso we determined the zzso status of zzso signaling genes in the tumor after disease zzso We identified an zzso acid substitution at a zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso that had no effect on zzso signaling but disrupted the ability of zzso to bind zzso and suppress this zzso A zzso altering the same zzso acid also arose in a zzso mouse model of zzso These findings show that acquired zzso in a zzso zzso with features of a G zzso zzso can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human zzso
