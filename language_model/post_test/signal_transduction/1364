zzso class I zzso play a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses by presenting zzso peptides to zzso T zzso and by regulating zzso activities of natural killer zzso zzso originating in zzso zzso are often characterized by a profound immune escape zzso This zzso is frequently associated with zzso in zzso class zzso zzso processing and presentation that enable zzso to escape immune zzso However, it now becomes clear that zzso class I molecules do not only provide a zzso framework for the presentation of zzso peptides but, rather, possess broader biological functions due to their ability to regulate zzso communication and zzso zzso signal zzso In the present review we made an attempt to zzso the significance of an altered zzso class I zzso for zzso progression in view of the current state of knowledge concerning the aforementioned zzso functions performed by these membrane zzso
