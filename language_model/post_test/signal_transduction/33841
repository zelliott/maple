During organ formation and zzso a proper balance between promoting and restricting growth is critical to achieve stereotypical zzso zzso bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop involving zzso growth factor zzso zzso sonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso termination of these signals is essential to restrict limb bud zzso The current model predicts a sequence of signal termination consistent with that in chick limb zzso Our finding that the sequence in mouse limb buds is different led us to explore alternative zzso Here we show, by zzso compound mouse zzso defective in genes zzso the positive loop, genetic evidence that zzso zzso can repress zzso zzso revealing a novel zzso zzso zzso This repression occurs both in mouse and chick limb zzso and is dependent on high zzso zzso These data support a mechanism where the positive zzso loop drives outgrowth and an increase in zzso zzso which triggers the zzso zzso zzso The zzso loop then operates to terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or chick limb zzso Our study unveils the concept of a zzso and zzso circuit that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso zzso
