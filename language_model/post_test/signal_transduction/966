zzso II zzso acting through zzso type 1 zzso zzso exerts powerful effects on central zzso networks regulating cardiovascular zzso and fluid zzso however, the mechanisms of zzso signaling in functionally defined central zzso zzso have not been fully zzso In vascular cells, zzso oxygen species zzso generated by the zzso zzso zzso play a major role in zzso zzso Thus, we sought to determine whether zzso zzso is present in central zzso zzso and, if so, whether zzso zzso zzso are involved in the effects of zzso on these zzso The present studies focused on the intermediate zzso nucleus of the solitary tract zzso because this region receives zzso zzso via the zzso nerve and is an important site of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso and zzso profiles containing zzso zzso The zzso zzso received zzso from large zzso terminals resembling zzso zzso In parallel experiments using patch clamp of zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled via the zzso we found that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso an effect zzso by zzso receptors and abolished by the zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso assembly inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso but not its scrambled version, also blocked the zzso The results provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso are involved in the effects of zzso on zzso influx in zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso and support the notion that zzso are important signaling molecules in central zzso zzso
