zzso of zzso zzso on human zzso has been shown to induce DC zzso and these zzso are more potent than classical zzso in stimulating T cell responses in zzso To allow an in zzso evaluation of the potency of zzso in zzso models we aimed at generating zzso zzso 

When zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso responded just as human zzso with an increased zzso zzso changes, proliferation and an increase in viable cell zzso But zzso zzso signaling did not induce expression of inflammatory zzso and zzso molecules in zzso zzso and these cells had no T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differentiate to inflammatory zzso upon zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, while zzso zzso signaling zzso maturation of human immature classical zzso it failed to do so with zzso immature classical zzso 

These data demonstrate that both human and zzso zzso become activated by zzso zzso signaling but only human and not zzso zzso differentiate to inflammatory zzso
