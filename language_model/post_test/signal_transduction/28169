We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso is greatly able to induce zzso signaling in cells that are positive for zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a cell zzso of zzso We investigated in this study whether inflammatory zzso can regulate zzso of human zzso zzso cells induced by zzso Of the zzso tested, tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso significantly enhanced the zzso cell zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses showed that zzso enhanced the expression of zzso in the cells at both the zzso and protein levels but did not do so for zzso zzso zzso also enhanced the binding of zzso to the zzso We also observed by measuring the zzso zzso potential and the generation of zzso zzso that the zzso enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly enhanced zzso cell zzso although the enhancing activity was lower than that of zzso These zzso effects of both zzso were also observed for human zzso zzso The ability of zzso to increase cell zzso to zzso could be inhibited by zzso of the cells with a zzso zzso against zzso zzso 1 but not by zzso of the cells with a zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results of an zzso of zzso 3 zzso activity zzso showed that zzso zzso 3 zzso was completely neutralized by zzso zzso treatment, although significant zzso was also observed with zzso zzso Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that zzso acts as a potent zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
