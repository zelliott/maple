zzso signal promotes zzso differentiation through a zzso zzso of responsible genes for zzso formation and zzso Recent works revealed that zzso signal plays a role to repress zzso of zzso factors for zzso Some zzso zzso actively inhibit expressions of zzso genes in the precursors through canceling the functions of zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso formation and pathological bone zzso The mouse models lacking those zzso zzso exhibited accelerated zzso differentiation and bone zzso Although the zzso factors are important for maintaining bone zzso they have to be removed for zzso formation in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified as a new target of zzso signal and strongly attenuated expressions of various zzso factors including zzso The zzso zzso knockout mice exhibited zzso of zzso formation and loss of bone zzso Thus, zzso signal regulates zzso differentiation by inducing zzso zzso such as zzso as well as zzso zzso such as zzso former is essential for expressions of zzso zzso while the latter is required for terminating zzso of zzso zzso
