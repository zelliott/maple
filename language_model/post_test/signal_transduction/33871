We have previously shown that zzso factor supplementation zzso of University of Wisconsin zzso solution reduced early zzso changes in vascular zzso zzso Here, we examine the effect of zzso on cell signaling pathways related to cell growth, zzso and zzso after cold zzso zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on the zzso of signaling molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso and of zzso zzso relative to changes seen in unmodified zzso solution, were determined by Western zzso in cells stored under cold zzso zzso zzso cultures of canine kidney zzso zzso cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were used in this zzso There was a significant decrease, relative to zzso solution, after 1 zzso zzso in zzso 1 and 2 activity in zzso For zzso zzso a significant decrease after 5 zzso zzso was seen in zzso zzso while significant reductions relative to zzso solution were seen in zzso after both 1 and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also decreased by zzso and 50% in zzso relative to zzso solution, after 1 and 5 zzso zzso zzso at each time zzso zzso zzso not only limits zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso activity induced by cold zzso injury and subsequent zzso but also substantially restricted increases in zzso zzso
