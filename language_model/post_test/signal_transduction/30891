The nucleus zzso zzso zzso is the primary zzso center for zzso zzso has been shown to play an important zzso role in blood pressure control in the zzso Our previous results demonstrated that zzso decreases blood pressure, heart rate, and zzso sympathetic nerve activity and zzso zzso responses in the zzso We also demonstrated that a zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor may block the cardiovascular effects of zzso in the zzso which suggests interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso However, the signaling mechanisms of zzso that induce zzso oxide release in the zzso remain zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible signal pathways involved in the cardiovascular regulation of zzso in the zzso 

zzso was zzso into the zzso of zzso male zzso zzso Blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly after zzso The cardiovascular effects of zzso were attenuated by prior administration of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (6 zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the cardiovascular effects of zzso Western zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso induced zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso diminished the zzso zzso zzso evoked by zzso 

These results represent a novel finding that zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 is involved in cardiovascular regulation in the zzso They also indicate that the cardiovascular zzso effects of zzso in the zzso are accomplished by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and then zzso zzso
