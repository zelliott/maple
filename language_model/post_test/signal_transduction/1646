zzso This study characterizes the mouse zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso clones with high zzso zzso medium zzso zzso or low zzso expression zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso binding with zzso Competition binding studies showed no significant differences in affinity of zzso zzso for either zzso zzso Several functional responses of each zzso were measured, namely zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso partial zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso caused zzso increases in zzso in cells expressing either zzso zzso zzso caused zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cells expressing either zzso zzso zzso treatment increased maximum zzso and zzso zzso responses to zzso in cells expressing the zzso but not in cells expressing the zzso at all levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso with zzso values and maximum responses that were not significantly different in cells expressing either zzso zzso zzso zzso was insensitive to zzso or zzso zzso zzso but was inhibited by zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso toxin failed to increase zzso levels although both treatments markedly increased zzso zzso zzso in both zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso cells, the zzso can couple to both zzso and zzso to stimulate and inhibit zzso zzso production respectively, while the zzso couples solely to zzso to increase zzso zzso zzso However, the increase in zzso zzso following zzso zzso is not dependent upon zzso of the receptors to zzso or the generation of zzso zzso
