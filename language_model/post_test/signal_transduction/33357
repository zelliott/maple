zzso zzso clamp and single-channel recording methods were used to characterize zzso and single-channel zzso currents and the effects of zzso II zzso in cultured rat adrenal zzso zzso Two basic patterns of zzso zzso relationships were zzso type 1 exhibited a rapidly zzso zzso zzso outward current and type 2 exhibited an zzso zzso outward current attributed to zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso Most cells exhibited the type 1 pattern and experiments focused on this cell zzso zzso and zzso patches were dominated by a single zzso channel class which exhibited an outward zzso of 12 zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 145 zzso zzso a mean open time of 2 zzso and a zzso zzso low open probability that increased with zzso Channel open probability was zzso inhibited by bath stimulation with zzso At the zzso level, type 1 cell zzso zzso currents appeared comprised of two zzso a zzso zzso current controlling the resting membrane potential zzso zzso which appeared zzso by the 12 zzso zzso channel and a rapidly zzso zzso zzso current activated above zzso zzso The presence of the second zzso zzso channel class was suggested by the effects of zzso the blocking effects of zzso and zzso and the properties of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso The zzso selectivity of the zzso current was demonstrated by the dependence of current reversal zzso on the zzso equilibrium potential and by the effects of zzso channel blockers, zzso and zzso zzso (10 pm to 1 zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso currents and this effect was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso
