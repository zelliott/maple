We identified and functionally characterized genes zzso three zzso proteins and one zzso protein in the zzso zzso wheat pathogen zzso zzso which we designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analyses showed that zzso and zzso are most related to the zzso zzso and zzso families, respectively, whereas zzso is not related to either of these zzso On potato zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso broth zzso zzso zzso produced significantly longer spores than those of the wild type zzso and these developed into unique fluffy zzso in the latter zzso indicating that this gene zzso controls zzso zzso zzso showed more pronounced zzso growth accompanied with hampered zzso and zzso a zzso zzso into zzso zzso tubes emerging from spores of zzso zzso were zzso on water zzso and showed a zzso type of growth on zzso that was due to hampered zzso numerous cell zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso indicating that both genes positively regulate the zzso pathway, which was confirmed because the zzso zzso was restored by adding zzso to these zzso zzso The zzso levels in zzso zzso and the zzso were not significantly different, suggesting that this gene might be zzso for zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are strongly reduced in zzso We concluded that the zzso G proteins zzso by zzso and zzso regulate the zzso zzso that is required for development and zzso in zzso zzso
