zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso 1 zzso activate a protein zzso zzso zzso which zzso beta zzso in zzso We have now identified its main zzso site on beta zzso zzso zzso approximately 28 zzso zzso and a minor zzso site, zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso The sequence motif that determined the zzso of zzso by the zzso was studied with synthetic peptides bearing deletions or zzso of the neighboring zzso This allowed synthesis of improved zzso zzso approximately 6 zzso zzso and showed that efficient zzso of zzso was favored by the presence of large zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to the position of the zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso at position zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso were also zzso by zzso zzso showing it to have dual zzso It is unable to zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and is therefore not directly involved in their zzso Its zzso characteristics indicate that zzso zzso is a novel dual specificity zzso perhaps related to the mixed lineage zzso It zzso with a zzso of about 95 zzso which could zzso either to the zzso zzso or to an associated zzso
