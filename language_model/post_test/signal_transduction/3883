The exposure of zzso zzso zzso cells from immature rat zzso to zzso growth zzso zzso induced a time and zzso increase of zzso and zzso zzso in newly zzso zzso zzso This increased content of PG was the result of an enhancement of PG synthesis rather than a decreased rate of zzso IGF-1 had no effect on the molecular weight of zzso PG nor on the nature and distribution of the zzso zzso zzso both in medium and in cell zzso The stimulation of PG synthesis by IGF-1 appeared to be due, at least zzso to an increase of zzso zzso IGF-1 effect was zzso by the classical zzso zzso zzso process, since IGF-1 action on PG synthesis was abolished by zzso and zzso A9, two well known zzso zzso zzso The increase of PG synthesis was accompanied with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso chains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso since the zzso ratio was reduced by about zzso in presence of zzso Although the mechanism of zzso acid synthesis was completely different from those of other zzso IGF-1 also dramatically enhanced its production by zzso zzso
