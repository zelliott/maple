zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the species zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso attenuated vascular zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rings were zzso of zzso mounted in organ baths, and subjected to contraction or zzso zzso of zzso zzso light chains zzso ), zzso zzso targeting zzso 1 zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso protein for zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso of zzso zzso were examined by zzso We also measured the amount of zzso zzso zzso as a marker for zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso in response to sodium zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso levels of zzso , zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

These results demonstrated that zzso attenuated vascular contraction through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
