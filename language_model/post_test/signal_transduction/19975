The zzso factor and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso in hypoxic conditions of the middle ear due to dysfunction of the zzso tube is still unknown, but it is considered as one zzso mechanism in zzso zzso This study was designed to investigate the possible involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso media with zzso induced by dysfunction of the zzso zzso We adopted a soft zzso approach to zzso the orifice of the zzso tube to establish zzso media in a rat zzso zzso evoked zzso response and zzso were used as hearing function tests, zzso factors were examined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The expression of zzso proteins was detected by Western zzso and zzso The model of zzso media with zzso was successfully induced by zzso the orifice of the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso factors in zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso showed that the expression of zzso proteins in zzso ears was zzso zzso vascular proliferation and an increase in zzso may be one zzso mechanism of zzso media due to dysfunction of the zzso zzso
