Current zzso regimens fail to avert chronic rejection zzso of transplanted zzso however, selective targeting of zzso regulators decreases zzso zzso and abrogates zzso in rat model zzso Administration of zzso class I major zzso complex molecules or selective targeting of the zzso pathway, which controls zzso zzso activity, using zzso (a selective zzso zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as judged from the zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of affected vessels zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso target of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso 

A zzso class I major zzso complex zzso that eliminates zzso was delivered into zzso recipients of zzso hearts at the time of transplantation with zzso zzso (10 zzso on days zzso zzso included zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso on days zzso heart zzso zzso 

Western zzso and zzso showed that rat heart zzso with abolished zzso exhibited zzso of the zzso zzso components such as zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso elements zzso and zzso The zzso regulator zzso and its downstream target zzso were also zzso 

zzso of zzso in rat model system involves zzso of two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulating cellular proliferation and a zzso zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso Selective targeting of zzso zzso zzso pathways shows potential for zzso zzso zzso
