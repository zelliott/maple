The zzso controls cell fate decisions through the binding of an array of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso and to several other zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the putative tumor zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We find that all three zzso zzso bind selectively to the zzso protein zzso zzso a member of the Group II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occur in a zzso complex in zzso that associates with zzso Ras after serum zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso either through zzso or zzso zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso of zzso active zzso promotes zzso in a variety of cell zzso zzso is a much less potent zzso zzso however, a zzso zzso loop zzso zzso that binds zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso exhibits zzso efficacy approaching that of zzso The zzso action of both zzso and zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso segment or by the zzso segment that binds zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso partner of the zzso zzso family, and the zzso complex is a novel Ras zzso unit that mediates the zzso effect of zzso
