zzso of cells to zzso often involves changes in gene zzso Since the concentration of salt in the zzso fluid surrounding zzso inner zzso cells varies with operation of the zzso concentrating mechanism and generally is very high, the zzso mechanisms of these cells are of special zzso Renal zzso cells compensate for zzso by accumulating variable amounts of compatible organic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this review we consider how these zzso help relieve the stress of zzso and the nature of zzso and zzso responsible for their variable zzso We emphasize recent developments concerning the molecular basis for zzso regulation of these zzso including identification and characterization of zzso response zzso Although zzso stresses are much smaller in other parts of the body than in the zzso zzso similar mechanisms operate zzso yielding important zzso and zzso zzso
