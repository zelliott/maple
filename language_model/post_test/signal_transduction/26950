The zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso on zzso transport was investigated in zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso and zzso decrease in the initial rate of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso This selective zzso effect on zzso transport was largely zzso and was not associated with a rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso The reduction in zzso zzso was also independent of changes in zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso appeared to involve neither zzso zzso G zzso nor zzso protein zzso C zzso However, the probable role of a zzso protein zzso in signal zzso was supported by the considerable zzso of zzso effect by zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso transport reduction was blunted by zzso and abolished by zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso selectively zzso the activity of the zzso zzso transport system present in the zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso This action appears to be exerted via an unprecedented zzso zzso that might involve a zzso protein zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso
