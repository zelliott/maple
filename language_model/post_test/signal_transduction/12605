The inability to coordinate the signaling pathways that lead to proper zzso responses characterizes the zzso of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's zzso The Crohn's disease zzso zzso zzso helps coordinate zzso responses upon zzso exposure to bacteria, and this signal coordination by zzso is accomplished, in part, through zzso zzso chains that create binding surfaces for the scaffolding of signaling zzso 

In this work, we show that the zzso signaling partner, zzso is directly zzso by zzso an zzso zzso zzso that when lost genetically causes widespread inflammatory disease at zzso zzso We show that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in response to infection with zzso zzso We also show that zzso can bind zzso zzso and that whereas zzso zzso zzso activity is required for optimal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso This effect can be seen independently at the zzso level by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso helps regulate zzso signal zzso pathways and, as such, may be involved in the zzso of zzso inflammatory zzso
