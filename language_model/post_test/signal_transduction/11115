zzso zzso signals through zzso receptors zzso in the course of zzso resulting in the release of inflammatory zzso In cell lines and zzso models, parts of the signaling pathways involved have been zzso with zzso zzso and zzso playing an important role in the induction of zzso By focusing on primary human cells, we have shown that there are fundamental signaling differences between human and zzso zzso and between cells of zzso and zzso zzso In primary human cells, there are no available zzso so we employed the use of dominant zzso to investigate the signaling zzso We show that in primary human zzso zzso zzso and zzso alternative pathways activate zzso and induce the expression of inflammatory zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso are essential zzso for zzso zzso
