A zzso study in the Netherlands has recently demonstrated that a zzso of the human insulin zzso zzso zzso to zzso is associated with zzso and an increased prevalence of zzso diabetes zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to assess whether this zzso leads to a functional zzso of the insulin zzso We prepared the zzso zzso by in zzso zzso This zzso was zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells either alone or together with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso to zzso induced zzso was not different from zzso Human insulin zzso with a zzso deletion zzso which is known to impair zzso interaction was used as zzso While the zzso zzso a reduced zzso zzso zzso showed even a slightly increased ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso of control, p zzso zzso zzso zzso was only zzso by zzso and zzso but not by zzso Again a tendency to higher zzso of zzso was seen with zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso of control, zzso When zzso activity was measured in zzso zzso similar activity was found for zzso and zzso whereas zzso stimulation was reduced with zzso In zzso the data suggest that zzso does not impair the first steps of the insulin zzso zzso It is therefore unlikely that this zzso may cause cellular insulin zzso The close vicinity of this zzso to insulin zzso zzso which are involved in zzso and zzso binding may, however, alter the interaction of the insulin zzso with these zzso This could explain the slightly increased insulin effect on zzso zzso of these zzso zzso These characteristics of zzso might have a zzso function of impaired signal zzso further downstream of the zzso chain in this specific zzso of zzso zzso
