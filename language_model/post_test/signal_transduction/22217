zzso zzso C zzso zzso is a transforming zzso and plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes including zzso invasion and zzso Recently, we described a function of zzso as a scaffold protein linking zzso to the zzso zzso Here, in the head and neck zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso may be associated with the zzso This is linked with the consecutive zzso of the recruitment of zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and of the zzso effect of zzso on cell zzso These effects are independent of the zzso as well as the scaffold activity of zzso but are a function of the cellular expression level of zzso In contrast to zzso cells where the zzso zzso was selectively affected, in three other zzso cell lines investigated zzso of zzso resulted in association with zzso and, zzso in either partial zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso or complete zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the main zzso zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that in particular zzso cells highly expressed zzso may act as negative zzso zzso of zzso zzso This novel function of zzso provides also the first indication that the zzso may be a target for zzso zzso by accessory zzso
