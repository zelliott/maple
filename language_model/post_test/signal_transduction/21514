The development of zzso from zzso zzso cells is primarily controlled by the growth factor colony stimulating zzso zzso and its zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso exerts its biological effects on cells via a range of signaling proteins including zzso and zzso Here we have investigated the potential involvement of the zzso adapter protein zzso in signaling by the zzso zzso in mouse bone zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso expression of the zzso gene in bone zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso and zzso binding experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso could bind to zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso involved multiple zzso of zzso zzso also bound zzso with the interaction being zzso at least in part, by the unique zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso in bone zzso zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso zzso and/or expression level of a approximately 80 zzso protein without affecting zzso global zzso zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso stimulation induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of specific protein zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso could potentially be involved in signaling by the zzso zzso
