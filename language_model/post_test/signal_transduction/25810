zzso zzso potential zzso channels of multiple zzso are expressed in the heart, although their functions are only now beginning to emerge, especially for the zzso zzso that appears to regulate the cardiac zzso zzso Although zzso channels zzso many different zzso they are most often ascribed a specific biological function because of zzso influx, either for zzso signaling or to zzso internal zzso stores in the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso However, adult cardiac zzso arguably do not require zzso zzso entry to regulate zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso channels expressed in the heart most likely coordinate signaling within local zzso or through direct interaction with zzso regulatory zzso Here, we review the emerging evidence that zzso channels, especially zzso are critical regulators of zzso signaling in the heart to control pathological zzso in coordination with signaling through zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso
