The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso in zzso on multiple zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A activity in zzso resulted in a transient increase in the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was accompanied by a stimulation in zzso zzso zzso In zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso consistent with one zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso derived from the zzso zzso in zzso by protein zzso A was common to one of the major zzso derived from the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A activity was zzso and zzso and dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with protein zzso A resulted in a stimulation zzso in zzso zzso activity whereas alkaline zzso treatment of zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of the protein zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso activity involved an increase in the apparent zzso values with respect to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the results reported here were consistent with the conclusion that zzso zzso was regulated by protein zzso A zzso
