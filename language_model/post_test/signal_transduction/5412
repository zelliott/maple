Recent structural information for complexes of zzso zzso zzso bound to their zzso has significantly expanded our understanding of the zzso zzso and zzso recognition mechanisms used by our three principal shared zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso The zzso family receptors intricately coordinate three structurally unique zzso sites on their zzso bundle zzso zzso to assemble zzso signaling zzso These organizing principles serve as zzso zzso for the entire zzso family of zzso Novel structures of zzso and zzso complexes show us new twists, such as the use of a zzso zzso alpha receptors for zzso and zzso in assembling zzso zzso signaling complexes and an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso signaling complex with zzso Unlike zzso which appears to recognize vastly different zzso surfaces in chemically unique fashions for each zzso the zzso zzso appear to seek out some semblance of a zzso shape recognition code in order to engage zzso in related zzso We discuss the structural similarities and differences between these three shared zzso zzso as well as the implications for zzso zzso
