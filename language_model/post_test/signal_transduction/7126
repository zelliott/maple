zzso zzso is the major locus for zzso causing familial Alzheimer's disease zzso and is also zzso in Pick disease of brain, familial acne zzso and zzso zzso It is a critical zzso of zzso zzso and many other zzso pathways and protein zzso events including production of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso A4 zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that interference with zzso of transcripts of the zzso zzso of zzso creates dominant negative effects on zzso zzso Here, we extend this work to show that various zzso of human zzso (or zzso zzso protein have starkly differential effects on zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso (a zzso of human zzso Different zzso can suppress or stimulate zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and vice zzso The zzso zzso possibly causing Pick disease causes production of zzso transcripts zzso the open reading frame after zzso 5 zzso We show that the truncated protein potentially translated from these transcripts avidly incorporates into very stable zzso higher molecular weight complexes and suppresses zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso In contrast, the truncated protein potentially produced by the zzso acne zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso but, unexpectedly, enhances zzso zzso Our results suggest novel hypotheses for the pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases and illustrate the importance of investigating the function of dominant zzso at zzso relevant expression levels and in the normally zzso state in which they cause human disease rather than in isolation from healthy zzso
