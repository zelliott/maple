Previous studies suggest that zzso possesses zzso properties, however, the mechanisms by which zzso affects immune function remain zzso particularly in the zzso In this study, we hypothesized that zzso directly affects zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso prior to incubation with various stimuli and zzso gene expression and signal zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in zzso expression and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso This effect was paralleled by zzso of zzso zzso expression and a reduction in recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells also resulted in reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso The observed effects in this study occurred independently of known surface zzso zzso This study identifies zzso as a potent negative regulator of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso
