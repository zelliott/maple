zzso abnormalities frequently occur in zzso A key role as zzso site choice regulator is played by the members of the zzso zzso family of zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso is involved in zzso zzso of human lung zzso cell zzso In this study, by using zzso we demonstrate that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso and zzso of lung zzso zzso as well as in zzso and zzso of zzso cell lung zzso zzso respectively, compared to normal lung zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso zzso with high level of zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and SCC zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso mostly accumulates under a zzso form in lung zzso zzso we further show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso as well as in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso scores are correlated in zzso zzso zzso zzso Using lung zzso cell lines, we demonstrate that zzso zzso leads to a more invasive zzso evidenced by zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso increased growth capacity in soft zzso acquisition of zzso markers such as E zzso loss, zzso and zzso gain, and increased resistance to zzso Finally, we provide evidence that high levels of zzso and zzso proteins are associated with extensive stage zzso in zzso Taken together, these results indicate that a global deregulation of zzso zzso regulators occurs during lung zzso and does not predict same outcome in both zzso Small Cell Lung Carcinoma zzso zzso likely contributing to a more aggressive zzso in zzso
