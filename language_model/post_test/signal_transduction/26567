zzso stem cells zzso possess high zzso potential and the capacity for zzso with retention of zzso to differentiate into zzso zzso Several signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in the fate determination process of zzso but the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of neural cell zzso remain largely zzso Our previous study showed that human natural killer zzso zzso expressed specifically by mouse zzso zzso the zzso pathway, raising the possibility of regulatory roles of zzso zzso in the specific signaling pathways involved in zzso fate zzso To address this issue, we performed comparative zzso profiling of zzso before and after differentiation in a comprehensive and quantitative zzso We found that Lewis zzso zzso were specifically displayed on zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso were predominantly expressed on differentiated zzso Furthermore, by knocking down a zzso 9 with short interfering zzso we demonstrated that the Lewis zzso zzso were actively involved in the proliferation of zzso via zzso of the expression level of zzso which is an zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Our findings suggest that Lewis X zzso which have so far been characterized as zzso zzso actually operate as zzso of the zzso signaling zzso for the maintenance of zzso zzso during brain zzso
