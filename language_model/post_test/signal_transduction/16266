Human zzso zzso cellular signal zzso pathways to activate viral or cellular zzso factors involved in the control of viral gene expression and DNA zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso cells show increased zzso to human zzso when compared to their parental zzso zzso Both the progeny viral yield and the protein levels were elevated in the human zzso zzso cells requiring active viral gene zzso as shown by the infection with zzso human zzso zzso of Ras or of key molecules of the Ras pathway, effectively suppressed viral infection in the zzso zzso On a cellular level, the human zzso zzso cells formed larger cellular zzso which were significantly higher in number, compared to the zzso cells and zzso recruited human zzso zzso thereby zzso human zzso infection for the increased transformation of these zzso Furthermore, proliferation zzso revealed a higher rate for the human zzso zzso cells compared to zzso cells, whereas human zzso infection had no considerable effect on the proliferation of the zzso zzso Higher zzso to zzso was also detected in the human zzso zzso cells, which in combination with the higher progeny virus reveals a mode by which human zzso achieves efficient spread of infection in the cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that human zzso employs the zzso Ras signaling zzso to ensue viral expression and ultimately successful zzso zzso cells with an activated Ras signaling zzso are therefore particularly susceptible to human zzso zzso
