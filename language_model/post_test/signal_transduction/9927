Plants live in fixed locations and survive adversity by zzso growth responses to diverse environmental zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso integrate responses to independent hormonal and environmental signals of adverse zzso The growth restraint zzso by zzso proteins is beneficial and promotes zzso We propose that zzso permit flexible and appropriate zzso of plant growth in response to changes in natural zzso
