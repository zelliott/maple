zzso of zzso signaling zzso tumor proliferation in several zzso We have shown that various signal zzso pathways promote zzso in zzso tumors, which exhibit zzso high levels of active, zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso of the zzso zzso would suppress zzso tumor cell growth and neuroendocrine zzso marker zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were treated in zzso with zzso a zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was measured by zzso for 6 zzso The effect of zzso or zzso zzso treatment was assessed by Western zzso We examined the levels of zzso zzso total zzso zzso and the zzso markers human zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso reduced tumor cell proliferation zzso in a zzso zzso Growth also decreased in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso of active, zzso zzso and the zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso were diminished with both zzso and zzso zzso treatments zzso to the degree of zzso zzso Total zzso zzso and zzso levels were unaffected by these zzso 

These data indicate that zzso signaling performs a critical role in human zzso tumor cell survival and zzso hormone zzso Furthermore, the development of novel zzso targeting zzso or components of the zzso zzso may enhance the management of zzso zzso
