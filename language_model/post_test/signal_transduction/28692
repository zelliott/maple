While zzso receptors have been known to represent zzso zzso factors as part of the nuclear zzso family, a putative zzso form of zzso receptors has been zzso Since zzso zzso beta zzso is reportedly abundant in the zzso and other regions of the central nervous system, zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso was zzso zzso was predominantly found in zzso zzso and synaptic membrane zzso particularly this last zzso zzso investigation using the zzso zzso zzso cell line indicated that zzso is predominantly localized in cell zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso on synaptic zzso and may represent an important regulator of zzso signal zzso from membrane to zzso in zzso zzso
