The zzso coli zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso an zzso complex involved in the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of this zzso is under complex zzso regulation in response to growth conditions, such as zzso and carbon zzso Typically, the expression of zzso is known to be subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism underlying the zzso repression has been well zzso involving both the zzso zzso system and the zzso global zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying the zzso repression is not yet clear, because the involvement of the general zzso regulators such as zzso and zzso has been zzso In this study, we conducted a series of genetic analyses to identify the regulator zzso involved in the zzso repression of zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso protein (the zzso gene zzso a component of the major zzso zzso acts as a crucial zzso in zzso zzso These results support the view that the zzso protein functions not only as a zzso zzso but also as a zzso signal zzso that zzso the zzso repression of the zzso zzso
