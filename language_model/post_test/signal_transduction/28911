zzso zzso and inflammation are key zzso in zzso exemplified by the requirement of zzso foam cell zzso for zzso zzso zzso Although the nuclear zzso zzso has been implicated in both systemic zzso metabolism and zzso zzso its role as a therapeutic target in vascular disease is zzso We show here that orally active zzso zzso significantly reduce zzso in zzso zzso zzso and gene expression studies reveal that zzso zzso zzso progression through its zzso effect and zzso activity within the vessel wall, where it suppresses zzso signaling by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso also zzso the expression of regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso which are implicated in blocking the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso repress zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory responses zzso by zzso zzso These results reveal that zzso zzso multiple zzso pathways and suggest zzso drugs as candidate zzso for zzso
