zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10) is a member of the protein zzso zzso family that is structurally adapted to facilitate the metabolism of zzso zzso second zzso especially zzso P zzso Cellular zzso activity is restrained by the retention of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso by as yet undefined zzso zzso an zzso switch which targets zzso specifically to the plasma zzso where it binds through multiple positively charged zzso in both the C2 and zzso zzso and is susceptible to feedback regulation through zzso zzso zzso also forms zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions which appear to be necessary for metabolism of localized pools of zzso P zzso involved in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel gene product which exists in multiply spliced zzso zzso has zzso P zzso zzso activity and is localized to the zzso zzso via two zzso spanning regions, where it may metabolize zzso P zzso that appears to be unaffected by expressed zzso zzso can be acutely regulated by zzso stress and by zzso produced zzso oxygen zzso This mechanism provides a novel means to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be important in circumstances where zzso P zzso and zzso are produced zzso
