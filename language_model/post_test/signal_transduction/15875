zzso zzso such as zzso zzso remain difficult to treat given the diverse array of genes responsible for their zzso Rather than concentrate on specific zzso our focus is on identifying therapeutic avenues for the treatment of retinal disease that target general survival mechanisms or zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso commonly used in hormonal zzso Here, we report a novel zzso role for zzso in diseased mouse zzso in zzso zzso with zzso protects zzso cells from undergoing zzso in two distinct models of retinal zzso the light damage model and the zzso zzso zzso rescue was assessed by analysis of cell number, structural integrity and zzso zzso in cell survival of up to zzso were achieved in both disease models, indicating that zzso had been halted or at least zzso A speculative mechanism of action for zzso involves zzso of survival pathways in the zzso Indeed, zzso increases the expression of basic zzso growth factor which is known to both promote cell survival and inhibit zzso In zzso our results demonstrate significant protection of zzso cells which may be attributed to zzso zzso zzso of zzso survival pathways within the zzso
