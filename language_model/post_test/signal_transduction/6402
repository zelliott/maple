The type III zzso system zzso of zzso zzso is induced by contact with zzso cells and by growth in zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso that is necessary for expression of the zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso possesses both zzso zzso and response regulator zzso common to zzso zzso zzso as well as a large predicted zzso domain and seven zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso in production and zzso of the type III zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are absent in the zzso strain under zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is required for zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and apparatus in response to calcium limitation or to host cell zzso The zzso zzso the zzso regulator zzso does not respond to calcium zzso but the zzso zzso rate of this zzso was lower in zzso than in the zzso parent, zzso The zzso in zzso zzso production and zzso of zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso or zzso two zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso was markedly less virulent than zzso in a zzso model of acute pneumonia, demonstrating that zzso is required in zzso We propose that zzso is a sensor protein at the start of a zzso cascade that zzso expression of the zzso in response to environmental zzso
