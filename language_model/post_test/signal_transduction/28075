The function of zzso zzso depends on signals within the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with soluble factors such as zzso to regulate zzso gene zzso The mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of downstream signals are not fully zzso Because zzso organize the zzso we zzso the contribution of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso stimulation of milk protein gene zzso We show that the zzso zzso events initiated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the associated zzso zzso do not depend on an intact zzso zzso However, zzso networks and zzso are both necessary for continued zzso cell zzso because zzso integrity is required to zzso the signals between zzso zzso and zzso a zzso factor necessary for milk protein gene zzso The two different zzso scaffolds regulate zzso zzso through separate mechanisms that are specific to cellular differentiation but do not affect the general profile of protein zzso
