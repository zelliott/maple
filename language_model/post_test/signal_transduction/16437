zzso zzso promotes zzso immunity through its actions on immune zzso We hypothesized that elevated percentages of zzso zzso cells zzso and increased zzso zzso in peripheral blood would be associated with impaired response to zzso in patients with gastrointestinal zzso zzso This study evaluated relationships between plasma zzso zzso circulating zzso subsets, and zzso signal zzso in 40 patients with zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso were significantly higher in patients versus normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also elevated in patients versus normal donors zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso were zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso T cells, while zzso with in zzso generated zzso led to reduced zzso responsiveness in both zzso and the zzso subset of T cells from normal zzso zzso multivariable Cox zzso hazards models revealed that an increased percentage of the zzso zzso subset was associated with reduced overall survival zzso zzso zzso while an increased percentage of the zzso subset was associated with greater overall survival zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence for a unique relationship between specific zzso zzso subsets, and zzso responsiveness in patients with zzso zzso
