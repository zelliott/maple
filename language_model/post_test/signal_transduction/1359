We have previously shown that hormone therapy zzso with zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso In the current study, we sought to determine if the effect of zzso on whole body insulin sensitivity is associated with zzso in insulin signaling proteins in skeletal zzso zzso zzso monkeys were treated for 2 years with either no hormones zzso zzso 10), zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso + zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso At the end of the study, zzso of zzso zzso muscle were flash frozen in the zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso + zzso monkeys had significantly less zzso zzso 4 zzso expression zzso P zzso zzso but there was no significant treatment effect on expression of insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a tendency for decreased insulin zzso zzso zzso with zzso + zzso treatment zzso P zzso zzso These deficiencies in skeletal muscle insulin signaling likely contribute to the zzso changes in whole body insulin sensitivity associated with zzso + zzso zzso
