The zzso zzso is a large zzso zzso complex, regulating growth and development in zzso by selective removal of short-lived regulatory zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso zzso and the zzso factor gene zzso zzso act together in maintaining zzso and floral zzso zzso and zzso zzso The characterization of a newly identified zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso which carries a zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and rev have minor defects in zzso structure and zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso rev demonstrated strong zzso zzso Compared with the rev single zzso an increased percentage of zzso rev plants exhibited abnormal zzso shoot zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso rev first gave rise to a few zzso flowers, and then flowers with reduced numbers of all types of floral zzso In late zzso development, instead of flowers, the zzso rev IM produced numerous zzso structures, which contained cells seen only in the floral zzso and then zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that expression of the zzso and zzso genes was severely zzso or absent in the late appearing zzso rev zzso but the genes were strongly expressed in zzso cells of zzso zzso Double zzso plants combining rev with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resembled zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso might act as a whole in regulating IM and zzso zzso
