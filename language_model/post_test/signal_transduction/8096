In 2004, two groups reported zzso zzso in the gene for the zzso growth factor zzso zzso in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso which were highly correlated with the clinical response to the zzso drug, zzso Since then, a tremendous amount of knowledge has zzso and sheds light on significant zzso properties as well as the clinical relevance of this zzso which could be zzso to other zzso The zzso zzso are distributed throughout the zzso domain, but a deletion in zzso 19 and the point zzso zzso in zzso 21 account for approximately zzso which zzso a greater response to zzso treatment, compared with other types of zzso zzso These zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain are seldom acquired in zzso of the other zzso and the zzso zzso involve a subset of lung zzso which are zzso characterized by female sex, zzso zzso zzso and East Asian zzso In Japan, the zzso zzso are detected in approximately zzso of overall zzso and approximately zzso of surgically zzso zzso The zzso features of zzso harboring the zzso were reported to be frequent in those with zzso features, but it is suggested that the cellular lineage of the putative original cells of the zzso zzso the subset more zzso In the present study the current knowledge of zzso zzso is zzso insights from which raise many further questions, and thus suggest new directions for future zzso
