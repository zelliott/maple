zzso arising zzso regulatory T cells zzso have an essential role in maintenance of immune zzso and peripheral zzso Previously, we reported that conventional zzso and zzso T cells undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with a combination of immobilized zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso expand robustly under the same conditions, suggesting that there is a differential survival mechanism against zzso between conventional T cells and zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso signaling is required for zzso to survive zzso zzso when an active form of zzso zzso is present, conventional T cells become resistant to zzso and undergo robust expansion instead of zzso with reduction of the zzso protein zzso and zzso A substantial fraction of zzso T cells expressed zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the presence of zzso along with zzso led to the generation of zzso cells from conventional T zzso Together, the data demonstrate a novel role for zzso in the zzso of regulatory T cells and zzso T cell differentiation and zzso
