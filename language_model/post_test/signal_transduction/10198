Experimental zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso mouse model of zzso zzso zzso of zzso type 1 and zzso receptors that share the common downstream zzso zzso zzso is required for disease zzso The specific role of zzso in zzso however, is not zzso 

In contrast to control zzso zzso mice were protected from zzso after zzso with zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso and complete zzso zzso Disease resistance of zzso mice resulted from impaired expansion of zzso zzso T cells after zzso zzso defects of zzso zzso T cells were zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso primary zzso presenting zzso cells zzso were defective in their capacity to prime zzso T zzso This zzso mainly resulted from the inability of zzso zzso to release tumor necrosis zzso The critical role of zzso signaling in zzso in the peripheral zzso compartments was finally proven by repetitive injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso that fully restored zzso expansion and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso induction depends on zzso signaling in zzso presenting cells in the peripheral zzso We conclude that zzso might become a target for prevention of zzso zzso and zzso
