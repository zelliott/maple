An imbalance between proliferation and zzso is an important zzso factor for disorders involving abnormal cell zzso The role and mechanism of how G zzso receptors are linked to zzso are poorly zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso that binds to G zzso receptors with zzso and zzso activities, suppressed zzso of human zzso smooth muscle cells induced by zzso treatment or serum zzso zzso withdrawal or zzso zzso zzso treatment for 48 h resulted in DNA zzso a characteristic of zzso The addition of zzso attenuated DNA zzso The attenuating effect of zzso on DNA fragmentation was not affected by zzso zzso I, zzso zzso or zzso However, zzso an inhibitor for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso the effect of serum withdrawal on inducing zzso and blocked the zzso effect of zzso The zzso activity in these cells decreased rapidly after zzso treatment or serum withdrawal, but was maintained at a zzso higher level in the presence of zzso for at least 4 zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is activated by zzso and blocking this zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso
