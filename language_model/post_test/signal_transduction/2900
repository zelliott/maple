zzso zzso and zzso play a role in the zzso of zzso In the brain a functional zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Such a zzso may be zzso indirectly through zzso networks or directly by zzso zzso A direct link of the zzso zzso formation to zzso function, zzso to zzso zzso has not been fully demonstrated zzso Here we confirm the formation of zzso zzso using quantitative zzso based zzso zzso Additionally, zzso formed complexes with zzso and zzso but not zzso indicating that complex formation is not specific to the zzso zzso We studied the functional consequences of the zzso zzso addressing cellular signaling zzso zzso of receptors in zzso cells had no relevant effects on signaling zzso by the individual receptors when zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso induced signaling through zzso but not zzso and thus did not lead to zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso binding competition of zzso zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso zzso Taken together, the formation of zzso zzso does not necessarily translate into second zzso zzso These results do not put into question the well-documented functional zzso of the two receptors in the brain, but do challenge the biological relevance of the zzso zzso
