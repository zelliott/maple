During the first zzso of human pregnancy, zzso zzso within the tips of the zzso zzso to form cell columns that anchor the zzso to the zzso This migration zzso with a widespread change in the zzso zzso repertoire of these zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are best known as potent triggers of zzso hormone zzso The zzso signaling system is also highly expressed in the human zzso where it was demonstrated to inhibit zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion in zzso Here we show that zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, zzso increased zzso of human zzso to zzso zzso a major component of the human zzso This increased zzso was both rapid and zzso suggesting that it likely occurred through the zzso of zzso secondary zzso such as zzso and zzso which underwent rapid and transient zzso zzso in zzso We then showed that zzso of both zzso and zzso attenuated the zzso increase in zzso zzso suggesting that these molecules are key positive regulators of zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso to zzso collagen via zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment increased mouse zzso zzso to collagen I, suggesting that zzso signaling is a key regulator of zzso function during zzso as well as early zzso
