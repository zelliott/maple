Defining key differences between zzso and zzso binding to hormone receptors is important and will aid rational drug zzso zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso is absolutely zzso in all zzso cloned to zzso We establish that zzso is critical for high affinity binding of zzso (full and zzso but is not required for zzso binding zzso or zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited markedly decreased OT affinity zzso and disrupted second zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso were incapable of supporting zzso zzso zzso binding or zzso zzso modeling revealed that zzso projects into the zzso central binding zzso and provides zzso contacts not zzso by zzso This study explains why zzso is absolutely zzso at zzso in all receptors binding OT and related zzso and provides molecular insight into key differences between zzso and zzso binding zzso
