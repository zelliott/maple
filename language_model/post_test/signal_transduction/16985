zzso information is modulated by a large number of zzso signaling agents that change over the course of recovery from zzso This plasticity makes understanding regulatory mechanisms involved in descending zzso of pain zzso and clinically zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso project to many areas that zzso zzso zzso These areas are enriched in its zzso the zzso hormone 2 zzso zzso We previously found that zzso affects several acute zzso responses, leading us to now investigate its potential role in chronic zzso Following nerve injury, both zzso and zzso knockout mice developed less tactile and zzso hypersensitivity than controls and returned to baseline sensory thresholds zzso zzso of zzso inflammatory injury were similarly decreased in knockout zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors increased the tactile and zzso sensitivity of apparently recovered knockout mice, returning it to levels of zzso zzso Mice with locus zzso zzso area injection of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso zzso apparent recovery from zzso injury similar to the knockout zzso zzso of zzso area zzso zzso led to local zzso loss, and barley zzso was transferred from local zzso zzso to zzso zzso that surround the zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling zzso sensory thresholds via effects on zzso transmission to zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso normal role may be to inhibit release of zzso amounts of zzso during chronic zzso The zzso may help maintain central zzso which could serve to enhance guarding zzso
