The Turkish zzso of zzso zzso displays exceptional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso compared to zzso zzso B zzso for zzso zzso In the present study, we compare the molecular basis for the difference in B tolerance between the two species by constructing high zzso suppression zzso zzso libraries to identify the zzso zzso A total of 219 and 113 unique zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were identified and functionally classified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, 63 zzso were zzso in zzso zzso in response to high zzso The majority of the high B zzso genes belong to four zzso zzso protein zzso cellular organization, and zzso We zzso that the superior B tolerance exhibited by zzso zzso may be due to its ability to restrict the zzso of B in plant zzso through the zzso expression of zzso zzso comparable to the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, our results are consistent with the view that other molecular mechanisms involved in zzso such as detoxification, zzso and signaling zzso are needed to tolerate zzso zzso 

The molecular basis of zzso tolerance of two plant species zzso zzso and zzso zzso that differ greatly in their zzso tolerance was studied in this zzso
