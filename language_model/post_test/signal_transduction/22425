zzso of zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso and decreases behavioral zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is a well established route to producing changes in gene zzso We hypothesized that chronic suppression of zzso activity would have significant effects on gene expression in the zzso A comparison of the expression profile of zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso mice after chronic zzso zzso revealed altered expression of 19 overlapping genes with few significant changes outside the zzso or after administration of a zzso inhibitor to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso of zzso zzso genes that included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting long-term suppression of the zzso zzso is consistent with altered zzso zzso and potential utility as a antipsychotic zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 4, zzso and zzso zzso suggests zzso of molecular zzso capable of zzso We used zzso delivery of zzso response element zzso reporter zzso into the zzso and live animal imaging of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso activity to further demonstrate zzso zzso results in zzso zzso zzso with potential zzso zzso we also demonstrate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 1 and zzso in zzso after zzso zzso The observed changes in signaling and gene expression are predicted to provide zzso effects in models of zzso zzso
