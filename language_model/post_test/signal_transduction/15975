In early zzso development, zzso induction is a crucial event regulated by several factors including the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso While the requirement of zzso in zzso zzso formation has been reported, the fate of the tissue modulated by these signals is not fully zzso Here, we examined the fate of zzso when zzso zzso was added and zzso signaling was inhibited in animal cap zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted to zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso signaling in the zzso marginal zone, in zzso cap zzso or in the presence of the zzso signaling component zzso converted zzso zzso to zzso zzso The expression and promoter activities of a zzso responsive zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were investigated while zzso signaling was zzso zzso expression increased, while zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso signaling abolished zzso zzso formation induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of zzso zzso in early zzso zzso is regulated by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
