The zzso and zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously zzso zzso we report the differential zzso of protein zzso C zzso proteins by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso at 40 or zzso did not affect the cell zzso but zzso at zzso produced zzso changes similar to those after treatment with zzso in zzso zzso The coexistence of the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso changes induced by either zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso Since zzso is known to induce expression of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in response to zzso and zzso treatments in zzso zzso cells was zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso promoter activity was significantly suppressed by zzso but not by zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins on the cell surface, while the presence of zzso inhibited its zzso Western zzso demonstrated that the expressions of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso were activated by zzso but were suppressed by zzso In addition, zzso at zzso was activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso In conclusion, the differential regulation of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso may influence zzso changes and regulation of zzso in zzso zzso
