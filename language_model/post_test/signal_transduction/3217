The zzso function of brown zzso tissue zzso is increased by zzso zzso released from sympathetic nerve zzso but the roles of zzso released along with zzso are poorly zzso Here, we examined effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso in isolated brown zzso that express zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso did not influence the zzso and zzso rates of oxygen consumption and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso also failed to induce zzso zzso zzso in the brown zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso in cultured zzso vascular cells from the BAT that express zzso zzso zzso In the latter treatment with zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso mainly acts on zzso vascular cells in BAT and plays roles in the regulation of their gene zzso through zzso and zzso zzso while zzso does not affect the zzso function of brown zzso
