zzso act as important zzso barriers and as structural components of zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso During division, the orientation of the zzso zzso in zzso cells is such that both daughter cells remain within the same plane, and the simple structure of the zzso zzso is thus zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso receptors that connect the zzso zzso to the cell's zzso zzso zzso are required for maintaining the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso egg chambers containing zzso zzso zzso cells develop zzso zzso at both zzso This zzso is due neither to abnormal cell proliferation nor to defects in the zzso polarity of the zzso zzso Instead, zzso function is required for the correct orientation of the zzso apparatus both in zzso cells and in their immediately adjacent zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso rather than zzso is sufficient for maintaining the integrity of the zzso zzso The above data show that zzso are necessary for preserving the simple organization of a specialized zzso and link zzso signaling to the correct orientation of the zzso zzso in this zzso cell zzso
