Apart from zzso of the radiation technology, future new strategies in radiation zzso will focus on the biological zzso leading to improved adaptation of the tumor therapy on each tumor zzso In this regard, different areas of biological research may be zzso zzso development of new zzso agents, improvement of the tolerance of normal tissue and the zzso of zzso 

For the development of new strategies the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of radiation induced cell death is zzso In the present article a novel biological strategy for zzso of zzso is zzso 

zzso pathways mediate zzso in response to death zzso stimulation and zzso radiation although an overlapping set of molecules is zzso TRAIL zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso is a zzso membrane protein belonging to the zzso family, which zzso zzso zzso cell death in a wide variety of tumor cells but not in normal zzso Based on the assumption of distinct zzso zzso combination of TRAIL and zzso radiation seems ideal to increase the therapeutic zzso Our study presents the zzso own data, data of other groups as well as the current status of the latest findings regarding the function and zzso role of the TRAIL death zzso 

zzso resistance towards zzso radiation is not associated with a general zzso zzso Death zzso for example TRAIL trigger zzso even in cells not undergoing zzso in response to zzso A combination of both zzso zzso additive or synergistic effects in regard to zzso induction and zzso of zzso tumor zzso Thus, the combination of TRAIL with radiation zzso that novel treatment strategies may be developed on the basis of molecular or cell biological zzso
