zzso is a zzso zzso involved in several different cellular functions, including the control of cell size and the regulation of survival and zzso Many studies have demonstrated that zzso also plays a critical role in the zzso of the zzso In these cells, zzso is activated by upstream molecules such as zzso zzso zzso growth zzso or insulin zzso through zzso zzso whereas its zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso targets of zzso in the zzso include zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso Major effects of zzso zzso in the zzso are increase in cell size, prevention of zzso and regulation of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso is distinct from that activated by zzso In fact, zzso of zzso does not lead to zzso zzso Our group has zzso moreover, that zzso exerts a positive effect on both zzso and zzso In fact, mice zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in the heart showed improved cardiac zzso Thus, zzso increases both cell size through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso through the functional regulation of critical zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso
