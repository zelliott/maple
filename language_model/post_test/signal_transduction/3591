The zzso like zzso zzso is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of zzso and plays an essential role in liver zzso We recently showed that in zzso primary mouse zzso zzso stimulation triggers zzso via the so-called type I zzso signaling zzso Central to this zzso is the direct zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as compared to the type II zzso which first requires zzso Bid zzso to trigger zzso zzso c release for zzso zzso zzso modeling can be used to understand complex signaling systems such as zzso and feedback or zzso zzso A previously published model predicted a positive feedback loop between active zzso and zzso in both type I and type II zzso signaling in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Here we zzso tested this hypothesis in our zzso type I zzso signaling zzso by using zzso and zzso primary zzso and two recently zzso selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso and quantitative western zzso confirmed that fully zzso active zzso zzso feeds back on zzso by zzso its partially processed zzso form into the fully processed zzso zzso Our data do not discriminate if zzso positively or zzso influences zzso zzso or is responsible for zzso aspects of zzso zzso However, we found that zzso also feeds back on Bid and degrades its own inhibitor zzso both events that may enhance zzso activity and zzso Thus, zzso selective zzso zzso are useful tools to understand complex signaling zzso in zzso
