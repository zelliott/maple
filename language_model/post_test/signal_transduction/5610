The zzso switch zzso in zzso mice is corrected by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso that does not bind tumor necrosis factor zzso factors zzso 2 and zzso To define the individual roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of B cells, we introduced zzso zzso zzso that selectively lack the ability to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso into B cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, zzso zzso response to zzso doses of the T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso center formation, zzso zzso zzso switching and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were partially diminished in zzso and zzso mice and virtually absent in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso can each independently mediate class switch zzso zzso driven by zzso but both are required for optimal zzso zzso zzso
