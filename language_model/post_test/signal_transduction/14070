The innate immune response to viruses is initiated when specialized cellular sensors recognize viral danger zzso Here we show that truncated forms of viral zzso that accumulate in infected cells zzso trigger the sustained zzso of the zzso factors zzso and zzso and the production type I zzso through a mechanism independent of zzso zzso We demonstrate that these defective viral zzso zzso are generated naturally during respiratory infections in zzso even in mice lacking the type I zzso zzso and their appearance zzso with the production of zzso during infections with zzso virus zzso or influenza zzso zzso the hallmark zzso zzso zzso is only expressed in lung zzso cells containing zzso while cells within the lung that contain standard viral zzso alone do not express this zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso generated during viral replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host immune response to zzso
