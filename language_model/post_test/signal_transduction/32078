zzso zzso plays a critical role in regulating tumor progression by zzso factors that mediate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso can promote tumor growth through zzso zzso however, restraint of zzso zzso progression by the zzso also has been zzso The mechanisms that zzso this paradox remain zzso Here, we report that the zzso potential of breast cancer cells is determined by an interaction between the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso The presence of an active zzso signal blocks the zzso of zzso into nucleus, leading to zzso of zzso and zzso D1 via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso expression in the breast cancer cells zzso with increased survival in patients with breast cancer, and low zzso expression in the zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso Together, our findings explain how a specific tumor zzso can restrain a given type of cancer cell from progression and show that both zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso affect breast cancer zzso
