zzso division of zzso cells generates both zzso and zzso progeny and is fundamental to development and zzso How this process is regulated in the zzso brain remains incompletely zzso Here, we use zzso imaging to track zzso zzso zzso behavior in the developing zzso zzso We find that zzso division invariably generates a zzso zzso daughter and an zzso zzso zzso Gene expression and genetic mosaic analysis further show that the zzso daughter is the source of zzso zzso that is essential to maintain higher zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso establishment of this zzso and directional zzso signaling requires the intrinsic polarity regulator zzso defective zzso zzso which zzso the fate zzso Mind bomb zzso to the zzso daughter, thereby restricting the zzso potential to the zzso zzso These findings reveal with zzso resolution how zzso and differentiation become precisely zzso within zzso dividing neural zzso zzso
