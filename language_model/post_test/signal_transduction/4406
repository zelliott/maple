The molecular mechanisms underlying formation of zzso zzso constitute one of the central problems in vascular biology and zzso zzso binding to its zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 3 zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in formation of zzso zzso by providing molecular bridges spanning zzso and by contributing to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso alpha zzso beta 3 requires zzso signaling zzso by zzso signal zzso activated in response to external signals generated at the site of vascular zzso This tightly regulated zzso alpha zzso beta 3 interaction constitutes a fundamental zzso mechanism of response to vascular injuries such as accidental and surgical wounds, zzso of zzso plaques in coronary and cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso in septic zzso After mapping the zzso site on the gamma chain responsible for recognition of zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 3 and the development of synthetic zzso zzso we solved the zzso structure of the zzso segment of the human zzso gamma chain using our new technology of carrier zzso zzso Fundamental knowledge concerning a molecular zzso model of zzso alpha zzso beta 3 interaction, coupled to the mechanism of its zzso and zzso regulation, will lead to development of a new generation of zzso zzso zzso
