We have undertaken a genetic analysis of new strong zzso of knot zzso The original zzso zzso causes an zzso of wing patterning similar to that associated with zzso of fused zzso an apparent fusion of veins 3 and 4 in the zzso However, unlike fu, strong zzso zzso do not affect embryonic zzso and indicate that zzso is not a component of a general zzso zzso zzso Instead we find that zzso has a specific role in those cells of the wing zzso disc that are subject to zzso zzso Our results suggest a model for patterning the zzso portion of the zzso wing, zzso the separation of veins 3 and 4 is maintained by zzso zzso in the intervening region in response to zzso across the adjacent zzso compartment zzso
