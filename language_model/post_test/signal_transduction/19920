The zzso function in zzso tolerance has been zzso but its mechanisms remain zzso Our previous study has showed that zzso zzso receptors zzso contribute to the induction of tolerance to zzso analgesia in zzso This study further explored the potential downstream mechanisms of zzso underlying zzso zzso The results revealed that the blockade of zzso zzso by zzso zzso or targeting small interfering zzso zzso reduced tolerance to zzso analgesia in the pain behavioral test and spinal zzso recordings zzso and zzso recording of the spinal zzso slice zzso zzso zzso treatment induced an increase in the expression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the spinal zzso horn, respectively, which was blocked by a zzso zzso or targeting zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced an increased release of zzso from the spinal zzso Further, both zzso acid zzso zzso a degrading zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso The present study demonstrated a spinal mechanism underlying zzso zzso in which chronic zzso triggered multiple dialogues between zzso and zzso cells in the spinal zzso via a cascade involving a zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso 

The present study shows that zzso interaction via a cascade zzso in the spinal zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso This article may represent potential new therapeutic targets for preventing zzso zzso tolerance in clinical management of chronic zzso
