zzso cells are known to interact extensively with zzso elements in the brain, influencing their zzso zzso associated with zzso integrate zzso zzso and release zzso that zzso synaptic zzso zzso cells participate in formation and rebuilding of zzso and play a prominent role in protection and repair of nervous tissue after zzso For zzso cells to take an active part in plastic zzso under zzso conditions and pathological zzso extensive specific zzso both within single cells and between cells, is zzso In recent years, intensive research has led to our first insight into this zzso We know there are active connections between zzso in the form of networks promoting zzso and zzso zzso we also know there is intense signaling between zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an array of molecules acting as signaling zzso The cells must be functionally integrated to facilitate the enormous dynamics of and capacity for reconstruction within the nervous zzso In this paper, we zzso some basic data on zzso zzso signaling to provide insight into synaptic zzso and reconstruction in physiology and protection and repair after zzso
