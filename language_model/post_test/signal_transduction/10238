zzso zzso cells zzso zzso throughout the molecular layer of the zzso and express zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso stimulation of parallel zzso leads to the generation of inward currents in the zzso due to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to the withdrawal of zzso processes and synaptic dysfunction, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso support of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso currents zzso exhibit zzso zzso specifically, long-term depression during repetitive stimulation of parallel zzso at low zzso zzso zzso -- conditions in which zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso remain zzso Both the rate of onset and the magnitude of zzso depression increased with stimulation zzso Depression was zzso following brief periods of zzso but became increasingly persistent as the duration of repetitive stimulation zzso All zzso currents -- zzso zzso zzso zzso and a recently discovered slow zzso zzso current -- were zzso zzso zzso release probability by doubling external zzso concentration did not affect the time course of depression, suggesting that neither decreased release probability nor fatigue of release sites contribute to zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused a dramatic enhancement of the rate of depression, implicating zzso in the underlying zzso The strength of zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso is therefore zzso zzso independently of adjacent zzso by the frequency of parallel zzso zzso
