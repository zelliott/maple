zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso such as hydrogen zzso zzso is an zzso stress response, which induced various defense mechanisms or programmed cell death zzso As one of the major types of zzso zzso has been observed in response to several zzso drugs and demonstrated to be responsible for cell zzso To date, however, the exact mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso is still poorly zzso Thus, the purposes of this study were to zzso how zzso exerts its zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso cells and to uncover the molecular mechanism that might be zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells are zzso through the zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to changes in zzso zzso with loss of zzso membrane potential and disruption of zzso dynamics at a zzso level of zzso and zzso zzso of cellular zzso partially inhibited zzso through both the zzso 1 and the zzso pathways and led to recovery of zzso zzso When zzso was prevented at an early stage by zzso zzso significantly zzso Our data provide the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso through interference with the zzso 1 and zzso signaling pathways and is regulated by the zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso
