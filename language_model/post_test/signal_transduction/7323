zzso produced from the membrane surface of zzso promote zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Thus, they are deeply associated with the onset of zzso zzso Despite our understanding of their roles in zzso or pathological responses, we know little about the mechanism by which zzso are produced from zzso Based on our previous studies using rat zzso or mast cells during zzso we proposed that membrane zzso induced by zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso facilitate or inhibit the formation of zzso Since the plasma zzso in zzso share many common zzso features with those in zzso or mast cells during zzso the same zzso or zzso mechanism of zzso formation would exist in zzso zzso we zzso here that zzso zzso would also change the membrane zzso in zzso and that such changes would facilitate or inhibit the zzso formation from zzso Our hypothesis is unique because it sheds light for the first time on the zzso mechanism by which zzso are produced in zzso It is also important because the idea could have novel therapeutic implications for zzso disorders that are triggered by increases in the zzso zzso
