zzso zzso regulatory systems consisting of a sensor zzso and a response regulator are the major means by which bacteria sense and respond to different zzso The role of essential response regulator, zzso in zzso tuberculosis proliferation is zzso We showed that zzso the zzso levels of zzso prevented zzso tuberculosis from zzso in zzso mice lungs and zzso but did not affect its growth in zzso zzso trafficking analysis revealed that a vast majority of zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso associated membrane protein zzso positive zzso indicating that zzso growth zzso is, in part, due to an impaired ability to block zzso zzso A zzso strain producing elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso in zzso but was attenuated in zzso zzso real-time zzso analyses revealed that expression of zzso an essential replication zzso was sharply zzso during zzso growth in the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso provided direct evidence that zzso regulator binds to zzso promoter in zzso indicating that zzso promoter is a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulator and its zzso zzso zzso neither inhibited growth nor sharply increased the expression levels of zzso in zzso We propose that proliferation of zzso tuberculosis in zzso zzso in part, on the optimal ratio of zzso to zzso zzso response zzso
