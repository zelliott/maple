zzso plays key roles in cell growth, zzso and survival by generating the second zzso zzso zzso zzso activates numerous zzso in part by recruiting them from the zzso to the plasma zzso We find that in immature B zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling suppresses zzso expression and promotes zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling abrogate this positive zzso Furthermore, immature primary B cells from mice lacking the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso suppress poorly zzso zzso undergo an exaggerated zzso editing response, and, as in zzso cells, fail to progress into the zzso phase of cell zzso Moreover, immature B cells carrying an innocuous zzso have sustained zzso of zzso levels and zzso of the downstream zzso zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of these, zzso appears to play the most significant role in zzso zzso zzso It therefore appears that when the zzso of an immature B cell is zzso zzso levels are reduced, zzso zzso is diminished, and zzso editing is promoted by sustained zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide evidence that zzso signaling is an important cue required for zzso development of B cells carrying a useful zzso
