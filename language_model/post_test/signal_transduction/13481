The zzso that controls sex in zzso has been well zzso The elements of this genetic hierarchy act zzso in zzso zzso We have previously shown that the sex of germ cells is determined by a different mechanism and that zzso and autonomously acting elements interact to control the choice between zzso and zzso A target for both types of signals is the zzso zzso which monitors zzso gene expression in germ zzso Here we report that zzso reflects the expression of zzso zzso a member of the snail gene family, which are zzso factors with zzso finger zzso Genes of this family partially zzso control a number of processes involving cell fate zzso The regulation of gene expression in germ cells by zzso zzso enhancers is already seen in zzso zzso autonomous and zzso zzso factors that participate in zzso sex determination are already present at this early zzso zzso is expressed in the male zzso both in zzso cells and in zzso stem zzso We show that zzso expression in the male zzso is not required for proper sex determination and zzso as functional zzso is differentiated by zzso germ cells in wild type zzso However, zzso zzso expression is required for the maintenance of male zzso stem zzso
