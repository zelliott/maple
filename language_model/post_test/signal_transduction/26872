The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of zzso zzso zzso G zzso 12 zzso an zzso zzso in the development of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice were crossed with zzso mice to generate double knockout zzso The double knockout mice and the control zzso zzso mice were fed a high-fat diet for 20 zzso Assessment of the zzso zzso in the control and double knockout mice demonstrated that zzso zzso caused a diminished zzso area, an increased zzso content at the plaque site, and decreased zzso zzso of the zzso zzso chain reaction studies revealed that white blood cells do not express significant levels of zzso Bone zzso transplantation experiments confirmed that zzso expressed on zzso is a key factor responsible for zzso but do not exclude a role of smooth muscle cell zzso zzso fluid from activated zzso but not zzso zzso was capable of causing zzso zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso factor 4 zzso and zzso zzso Further work demonstrated that zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso A pathway, critically regulates the release of zzso factor 4, and thereby affects zzso recruitment and zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso at least in part by zzso inflammatory cell recruitment via regulation of zzso zzso zzso
