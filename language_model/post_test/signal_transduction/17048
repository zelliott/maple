Cell culture of zzso neural stem cells zzso is a useful tool that contributes to our understanding of human brain development and allows for the development of therapies for intractable human brain zzso Human zzso zzso cultures, however, are not commonly used, mainly because of difficulty with consistently maintaining the cells in a healthy zzso In this study, we show that zzso cultures, unlike zzso of zzso origins, are extremely sensitive to insulin, an indispensable culture supplement, and that the previously reported difficulty in zzso zzso is likely because of a lack of understanding of this zzso Like other neural cell cultures, insulin is required for zzso growth, as withdrawal of insulin supplementation results in massive cell death and delayed cell zzso However, severe zzso cell death was also detected in insulin zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Thus, healthy zzso cultures were only produced in a narrow range of relatively low insulin zzso zzso cell death zzso not only in all human zzso tested, regardless of origin, but also in differentiated human zzso The underlying cell death mechanism at high insulin zzso was similar to insulin resistance, where cells became less responsive to insulin, resulting in a reduction in the zzso of the zzso zzso critical to cell survival zzso
