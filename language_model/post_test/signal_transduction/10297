zzso receptors constitute a complex zzso system at most of the zzso zzso in the zzso Of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are ubiquitous in the central nervous system, and a considerable amount of data indicates that this class of receptors is present at both sides of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are able to regulate both transmission of information and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso interacting with zzso zzso zzso are being identified and functional studies have provided evidence of the existence of a dual zzso zzso It has become clear that these receptors have a role in synaptic plasticity and that they might also have a fundamental role in zzso through the strategic control of network zzso However, the role of zzso receptors in other brain zzso remains zzso
