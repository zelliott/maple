Although the zzso effect of zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso on zzso signal and insulin zzso is well established, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully zzso We recently discovered that zzso influx alone can activate conventional protein zzso C zzso as well as novel zzso in zzso zzso zzso Building on this earlier finding, here we examined whether zzso zzso signaling can activate zzso and zzso at a zzso concentration of zzso (3 zzso in zzso zzso We first showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso Next, we assessed the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in a zzso manner, and the zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso either a broad zzso zzso zzso I, or a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a conventional zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso was almost completely inhibited by zzso a putative inhibitor of zzso zzso These observations were verified in two different ways by demonstrating 1) zzso zzso of the zzso C1 domain of zzso and 2) zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso reduced zzso insulin zzso in both zzso cells and rat zzso Thus, zzso can activate zzso and zzso and these zzso zzso may contribute considerably to insulin zzso at a zzso concentration of zzso
