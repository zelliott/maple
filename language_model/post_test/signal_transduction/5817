Factor X (FX) is a zzso playing a crucial role in the blood zzso zzso and triggering zzso zzso in a variety of cells via zzso receptors zzso By exploiting naturally occurring zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso we investigated the relationship between the zzso activity and the signal zzso capacity of zzso 

zzso FX zzso zzso were expressed in Human zzso zzso cells and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized for zzso zzso and zzso generation zzso zzso zzso was assessed through evaluation of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso or not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation activity in a plasma system was also decreased either upon zzso by Russell's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso The zzso zzso displayed little or no zzso activity, and did not induce any appreciable signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso with a 50% reduced zzso zzso At the highest concentration zzso zzso zzso progressed with a time course similar to that of zzso zzso zzso showed defective and incomplete zzso resulting in strongly reduced zzso activity and zzso Taken together our data are consistent with a close correlation between zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso
