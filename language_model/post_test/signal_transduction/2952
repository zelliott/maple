Diabetes is associated with impairment of zzso such as reduction of zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies demonstrate that disruption of zzso zzso signaling zzso contributes to the zzso impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a critical role in the regulation of insulin signal by zzso of zzso zzso zzso In present study, we examined the role of protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso impairment of zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso expression was significantly increased in diabetic zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso bond to zzso zzso and stimulation with zzso led to zzso zzso from zzso in mouse heart zzso zzso cell zzso Exposure of zzso to high zzso zzso 30 zzso increased zzso association accompanied by a significant reduction of zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso also blunted zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data zzso a critical role of zzso in zzso vascular zzso and that zzso of zzso signaling by targeting zzso should be considered as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso impairment of zzso
