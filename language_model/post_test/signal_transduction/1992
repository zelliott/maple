zzso and zzso serve classically as zzso factors, and zzso also mediates zzso responses to zzso such as the zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso capacities of zzso zzso are poorly zzso We evaluated zzso zzso by zzso in cultured zzso cells that express zzso zzso to determine whether the zzso zzso has zzso action and to reveal the zzso locale of that zzso A zzso of zzso was localized to the zzso cell plasma zzso zzso of zzso enhanced rapid zzso stimulation by zzso and the response to zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso was zzso and shown to occur independent of zzso in zzso cells, and zzso protein in zzso was directed to the plasma zzso zzso also blunted zzso zzso of zzso in isolated zzso cell plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso protein was detected and zzso attenuated zzso stimulation of zzso in isolated zzso cell zzso and functional zzso zzso was zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso These findings in the zzso signaling paradigm indicate that zzso zzso has zzso action in zzso
