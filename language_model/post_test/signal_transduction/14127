We hypothesized that both zzso and zzso affect the growth of zzso skeletal muscle cells, with fatty acids acting as zzso in zzso action and that both zzso influence the gene expression of their zzso zzso the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on cell number zzso and DNA synthesis rate with and without zzso acid zzso on cell death, and on key zzso signaling molecules of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso expression of genes zzso for the zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso as affected by zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso and zzso (20 zzso increased DNA synthesis rate, measured as zzso incorporation zzso zzso zzso reduced cell viability in terms of zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso or lowered DNA content after 24 h zzso zzso zzso In zzso cultures, zzso acid supplementation increased DNA synthesis rate and reduced cell number in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a transient zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso after 15 zzso followed by decreases after 60 and 180 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso at 180 zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso the abundance of zzso zzso and, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso may adversely affect the growth of zzso zzso which is related to zzso zzso signaling and associated with changes in zzso zzso gene zzso
