To determine whether inherited variations in immune function zzso zzso zzso genes or pathways affect zzso risk, we analyzed data from recent zzso association studies in conjunction with zzso immune function genes and zzso Gene and zzso analyses were conducted on two independent data sets using zzso zzso in 911 genes on 17 immune pathways from 525 zzso cases and zzso controls from the University of California, San Francisco zzso and a subset of zzso zzso in zzso genes from 531 cases and zzso controls from MD Anderson zzso To further assess consistency of zzso associations, we also compared data from the UK zzso cases and zzso zzso and the Mayo Clinic zzso cases and 111 zzso Although three correlated zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were consistently associated with zzso in all four data sets zzso P values zzso 1 zzso zzso to 4 zzso zzso independent replication is required as zzso significance was not zzso In zzso zzso eight immune function genes were significantly zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene had the smallest zzso values in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso The zzso zzso is found on the surface of regulatory T cells potentially contributing to zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso In zzso correlation zzso zzso signaling and zzso pathways showed similar associations with zzso risk in both zzso and zzso data zzso Our findings represent the first systematic description of immune genes and pathways that characterize zzso zzso
