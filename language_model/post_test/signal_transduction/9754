The zzso proteins (also called as J zzso J domain proteins or zzso zzso function as molecular zzso for the zzso zzso We assessed the expression of the small zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso by subjecting the wild type zzso plants to different zzso zzso It is shown that the expression of the transcripts and proteins of the zzso gene is primarily regulated at the level of zzso When plants were incubated under high light for zzso both the transcripts and proteins were completely zzso Upon transfer of plants to darkness, the transcripts started rapidly zzso and zzso the zzso protein became visible after zzso in zzso zzso incubation of plants in darkness or under low light zzso induced expression of the zzso transcripts and zzso Feeding plants with zzso clearly decreased the transcript and protein levels, and incubation with zzso revealed a rapid turnover for zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso protein was found to be nearly missing from the zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is expressed mainly in darkness, is prone to a rapid turnover but is partially stabilized by the zzso zzso
