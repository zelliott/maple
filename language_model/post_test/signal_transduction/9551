zzso are natural reservoirs for a spectrum of infectious zzso diseases including the recently emerged zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been observed both naturally and zzso to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different zzso species, including zzso Interestingly, infection of the flying fox with zzso occurs in the absence of clinical zzso The extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of zzso infection on the innate immune response in bat cell zzso We report that zzso infection does not result in the induction of zzso zzso and the viruses also inhibit zzso zzso We also confirm that the zzso production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat zzso This information, in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following zzso infection, suggests that bats control zzso infection by an as yet unidentified zzso not via the zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune zzso
