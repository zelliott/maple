A new zzso of testosterone zzso action in zzso cells was recently identified that may be required to support zzso production zzso and zzso Specifically, T acts via the zzso zzso zzso to rapidly activate the zzso cascade and the zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso In further characterizing the signaling zzso that zzso T actions, we now find that a population of zzso is localized to the plasma membrane and that zzso associates with zzso zzso after T zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is activated by T and that zzso zzso activity is required for stimulation of the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we determine that zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso downstream of zzso contributes to the zzso of the zzso cascade and zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso of T action in the zzso may provide new targets for the control of male zzso
