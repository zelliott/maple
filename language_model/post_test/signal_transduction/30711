The mechanism zzso stem zzso key property, the ability to either divide into two replicate cells or a replicate and a differentiated daughter, still is not zzso We tested a hypothesis that stem cell zzso zzso is spontaneously created by the zzso of processes within each daughter and the resulting zzso zzso via the exchange of molecules between them during zzso zzso We developed a zzso model that accounts for dynamic processes accompanying division, including signaling initiation and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of this model shows that it could explain how stem cells make the decision to divide zzso or zzso under different zzso zzso The analysis also reveals that a stem cell can be induced zzso to transition to an alternative state that does not have the zzso to have the option to divide zzso or zzso With this model, we initiated a search of large databases of zzso regulatory network zzso zzso interaction, and cell signaling zzso We found 12 zzso zzso that could support human stem cell zzso zzso A prime example of the discoveries made possible by this zzso two groups of the genes in the genetic model are revealed to be strongly zzso in a database of zzso zzso
