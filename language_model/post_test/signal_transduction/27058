zzso proteins have been demonstrated to interact with elements which mediate zzso signal zzso This laboratory has shown that zzso forms complexes with certain G proteins and transfers zzso to them, and such zzso transfer zzso well with the zzso of zzso zzso A previous study showed that zzso protein complex formation occurred at regions of zzso which were likely to be involved in binding to other zzso zzso during the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso This study represents an attempt to investigate the regions of zzso which orchestrate the transfer of zzso from zzso to G zzso It is demonstrated that two zzso zzso with zzso in similar regions of alpha zzso or beta zzso zzso blocked (by zzso the ability of zzso zzso (with zzso zzso to promote a stable zzso of zzso zzso Under the same conditions, a zzso zzso zzso caused only a slight reduction in zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso altered the zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso in the absence of zzso Under conditions where zzso inhibited synaptic membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso analog zzso zzso bound transferred that zzso to G alpha zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso blocked this zzso zzso Similarly, zzso transferred zzso to zzso G proteins in solution and zzso and zzso blocked this process as zzso Despite their ability to block the zzso of zzso by zzso neither zzso altered the ability of zzso to bind to native zzso alpha affixed to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
