zzso C zzso signal zzso processes in rat zzso are subject to zzso by protein zzso zzso and protein zzso including protein zzso A zzso and protein zzso zzso Ethanol zzso stimulates zzso activity in liver cells in the absence of hormones, and zzso zzso zzso the subsequent stimulation of zzso by hormonal zzso There is evidence that protein zzso activities are involved in these actions of zzso We investigated the effects of zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a cell zzso zzso analog that activates zzso on zzso zzso zzso In addition, we studied the combined effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso was inhibited by treatment with zzso and was zzso by zzso zzso treatment prevented the effect of zzso zzso with zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased the enhancing effect of zzso on the responses to zzso The zzso to enhancement by zzso plotted as a function of the initial rate of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was similar to the pattern observed in zzso zzso These data suggest that interactions of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso occurred at the level of zzso and indicate that zzso may act as an zzso agent of zzso
