The innate immune system responds within minutes of infection to produce type I zzso and zzso zzso zzso induce the synthesis of cell proteins with zzso activity, and also shape the zzso immune response by zzso T zzso Despite the discovery of zzso over 50 years ago, only recently have we begun to understand how cells sense the presence of a virus zzso Two families of pattern recognition receptors have been shown to distinguish unique molecules present in zzso such as bacterial and zzso cell wall zzso viral zzso and DNA, and zzso The first family includes the zzso zzso receptors zzso Studies of the signaling pathways that lead from pattern recognition to zzso induction have revealed extensive and overlapping zzso that involve zzso interactions and zzso and culminate in zzso of zzso proteins that control the zzso of genes zzso zzso and other zzso A second family of pattern recognition receptors has recently been identified, which comprises the zzso sensors of viral zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso In this review we zzso the discovery of these zzso sensors, how they recognize zzso zzso the signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso and viral zzso that have evolved to antagonize the functions of these zzso We also consider the function of these zzso sensors in zzso development and zzso and zzso
