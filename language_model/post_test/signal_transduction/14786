To investigate the upstream signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

The airway zzso cells of the line zzso were cultured and divided into 6 groups: control group, cultured in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, incubated with zzso alone, transforming growth factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso + zzso group, incubated with zzso and TAP zzso 1, zzso zzso + zzso group, zzso with zzso a zzso oxygen species zzso scavenger, and then incubated with NE; zzso group, incubated with zzso and zzso + zzso group, incubated with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso level was analyzed by zzso zzso protein and soluble zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein production was zzso by Western zzso 

The zzso zzso expression and protein expression of the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso The protein expression of soluble zzso and the protein expression of zzso protein of the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly higher than those of the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso The expression rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso and zzso of the zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all significantly lower than those of the zzso group (all P zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso of the zzso + zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all significantly lower than those of the zzso group (all P zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso expression and zzso protein expression of the zzso + zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both not significantly different from those of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso
