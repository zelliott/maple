To study the role of zzso channels and membrane potential in zzso responses of the rat liver, zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso were used or external zzso was replaced with zzso an zzso zzso zzso release, zzso zzso portal pressure, and zzso flux were measured in the isolated zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused zzso changes in each zzso a fast transient followed by sustained elevated zzso zzso of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso prior to zzso inhibited each zzso with the greatest zzso occurring during the second zzso A similar pattern was seen with 2 zzso zzso This contrasts with the full zzso of all responses following exposure to the zzso zzso zzso of each inhibitor at the peak of the sustained phase inhibited all zzso zzso release of zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso and was inhibited by zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of zzso release and zzso flux were not affected by the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso release from zzso suspensions decreased by about 50% in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso The results are discussed in terms of a potential role for zzso channels in zzso signal zzso in the zzso
