The major risk factor for developing systemic lupus zzso zzso is being zzso The present study zzso gene profiles of activated T cells from females with zzso and healthy controls to identify signaling pathways uniquely regulated by zzso that could contribute to zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso genes zzso zzso were measured by real time zzso chain zzso zzso uniquely zzso six pathways in zzso T cells that control T cell function including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso target gene expression revealed significant differences zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso T cell samples while zzso expression was zzso and correlated moderately zzso zzso with disease zzso The results indicate that zzso alters signaling pathways in activated zzso T cells that control T cell zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso could influence zzso gene regulation in T cell signaling and contribute to zzso onset and disease zzso
