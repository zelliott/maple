In order to survive under and adapt to different conditions zzso coli has evolved elaborate systems that are able to sense and respond to environmental zzso Very often, different stresses act on a zzso simultaneously and a variety of stresses have similar effects on cellular molecules and zzso zzso the various stress response systems have to interact zzso zzso with each zzso A complex network of global regulatory systems with a multitude of molecular components ensures a coordinated and effective zzso Such regulatory components include DNA, zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso binding zzso alternative zzso factors and zzso systems, as well as small molecular weight zzso as for example zzso These regulatory systems govern the expression of a plethora of further zzso that aim at maintaining stability of the cellular equilibrium under the various zzso Using five of the most important stress response systems, we will discuss the roles and mechanisms of such regulatory and zzso molecules in more zzso The heat shock response, controlled by the zzso factor zzso and the envelope stress response, controlled by the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso system, both result in an increased expression of zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso The cold shock response zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso factors, ensuring accurate translation at low zzso The general stress response depends on the zzso factor zzso which controls the expression of more than 50 genes zzso resistance to many different zzso The zzso stringent response reduces the cellular protein synthesis capacity and controls further global responses upon nutritional zzso A lot has been learned in recent years about the mechanisms of action of single zzso However, the main challenge for the future is to achieve an understanding of the interactions of these components under different zzso zzso
