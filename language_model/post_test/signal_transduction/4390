Recent advances in our understanding of axis formation and patterning in zzso relate the zzso mode of this aspiring genetic model zzso to higher zzso The effect of zzso zzso and zzso treatment, as well as detailed early lineage zzso have shed some light on zzso axis zzso However, the molecular mechanism of axis formation, as well as the identity of a fish zzso center, are still open zzso A zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso as well as the mouse zzso gene product have been demonstrated to induce zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso The zzso organizer is defined by the expression zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is involved in maintaining zzso expression in zzso zzso of the zzso Large zzso screens provide the basis for a genetic analysis of axis zzso
