The zzso differentiation of T helper 17 zzso cells and induced regulatory T zzso cells plays a critical role in both the zzso and resolution of diverse human inflammatory zzso Although initial studies suggested a stable commitment to either the zzso or the zzso zzso recent results reveal remarkable plasticity and zzso reflected in the capacity of differentiated zzso cells to be zzso among zzso and zzso lineages and the intriguing phenomenon that a group of zzso precursor zzso T cells can be programmed into zzso diverse populations by the same differentiation zzso transforming growth factor zzso To reconcile these zzso we have built a mathematical model of zzso differentiation that exhibits four different stable steady states, governed by zzso zzso with certain degrees of broken zzso According to the model, a group of precursor cells with some small zzso zzso can differentiate into zzso distinct zzso of cells, which exhibit distinct levels of the master zzso regulators for the two T cell zzso A zzso control system with these properties is flexible enough to be steered down alternative pathways by polarizing signals, such as zzso and zzso acid and it may be used by the immune system to generate functionally distinct zzso cells in desired zzso in response to a range of differentiation zzso Additionally, the model suggests a quantitative explanation for the zzso with high expression levels of both master zzso This zzso zzso to a zzso zzso state, appearing at a late stage of zzso rather than a zzso precursor state observed under some other zzso Our simulations reconcile most published experimental observations and predict novel differentiation states as well as transitions among different zzso that have not yet been observed zzso
