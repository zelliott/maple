zzso of zzso growth factor 8 zzso is increased in several forms of hormonal zzso It was previously shown to regulate expression of zzso 1 zzso an inhibitor of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Here, we studied the zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso repression in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors or of zzso and zzso with specific zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso restored zzso zzso expression in the presence of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso treatment also decreased zzso expression and the effect was dependent on active zzso In conclusion, zzso suppresses zzso expression through two independent zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso may be an important mechanism involved in induction of an zzso zzso and growth of zzso breast zzso
