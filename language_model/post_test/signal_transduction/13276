In zzso zzso A zzso is the primary zzso zzso various plant responses to zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso signaling involves a zzso action of downstream zzso which controls overlapping yet distinctive sets of zzso zzso zzso is a prominent zzso signaling intermediate sharing structural similarity to zzso a previously identified zzso signaling zzso The zzso and zzso zzso display similar yet distinctive defects in zzso zzso however, zzso of either zzso or zzso suppresses the zzso zzso of both zzso Moreover, zzso of partial fragments of zzso can cause a zzso interference zzso on zzso signaling that is stronger than those of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso Further, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are capable of zzso and zzso Our data indicate that zzso together with zzso defines a key module in a signaling network underlying zzso zzso light zzso
