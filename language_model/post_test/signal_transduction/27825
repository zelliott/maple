The zzso signaling zzso was found to be zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human pancreatic cancer cells and a pancreatic cancer tissue sample as judged by the retarded zzso mobility of the two major zzso downstream targets, zzso and zzso Treatment of cells with zzso a selective zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity and induced zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited DNA synthesis as well as zzso and zzso proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso inhibited zzso D1 expression in pancreatic cancer zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso may provide a novel therapeutic approach for pancreatic zzso
