zzso cells isolated from bone zzso zzso often referred to as zzso stem cells, are currently under investigation for a variety of therapeutic zzso However, limited data are available regarding receptors that can influence their zzso to and positioning within the bone zzso In the present study, we found that second passage zzso express a unique set of zzso zzso three zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso cultured in zzso medium zzso several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso receptors were functional by several zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso triggers zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and focal zzso zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso selectively activates signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso activates zzso In cell zzso zzso all of the zzso tested stimulate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso for example, zzso passages, indicate loss of surface expression of all zzso receptors and lack of zzso response to zzso The loss in zzso zzso expression is accompanied by a decrease in expression of zzso molecules zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso 1) and zzso while expression of zzso and zzso is zzso The change in zzso zzso is associated with slowing of cell growth and increased spontaneous zzso These findings suggest that several zzso axes may operate in zzso biology and may be important parameters in the validation of cultured zzso intended for cell zzso
