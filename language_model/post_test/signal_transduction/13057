zzso zzso an essential factor for zzso and zzso works as a survival factor for zzso lineage zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanism in zzso We show here that zzso supports the survival of zzso leukemia cell line zzso and normal zzso zzso via the induction of zzso an zzso member of the zzso zzso We further analyzed the signal zzso pathways required for zzso zzso gene zzso A reporter zzso with various lengths of zzso gene promoter revealed that both zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso sites are zzso for zzso promoter zzso zzso with these results, zzso induced the binding of zzso and zzso of nuclear factor zzso B, zzso and zzso to the zzso gene zzso zzso a specific inhibitor for zzso and zzso a specific inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso reduced the protein level of zzso in zzso cells, accompanied by an increase in the ratio of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso enhanced the zzso DNA binding activity of zzso without affecting the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso clearly inhibited the nuclear export of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, our results suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways regulate the zzso survival of zzso cells via zzso gene zzso In addition, our data suggest possible zzso between these two signaling zzso
