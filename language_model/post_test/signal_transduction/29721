zzso growth zzso protein zzso has been shown to zzso inhibit cell proliferation in various cell zzso However, the specific mechanisms involved in the zzso action of zzso have yet to be zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso in an zzso growth factor zzso manner through the zzso of zzso involved in a death zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso using an zzso expression system inhibited DNA synthesis in an zzso zzso zzso fashion and resulted in the subsequent induction of zzso and an increase in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when cells were zzso with zzso an zzso zzso unable to bind zzso corroborating the zzso action of zzso Additional zzso activity studies and zzso analyses using specific zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso revealed that the zzso effect of zzso results mainly from its induction of zzso (in particular, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso activity and release of zzso c into the zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso is not zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso expression leads to the induction of zzso through the zzso of zzso involved in a death zzso zzso and that zzso functions as a negative regulator of breast cancer cell growth, independent of the zzso zzso zzso
