zzso zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous second zzso that regulates cell zzso traits in zzso zzso of this regulatory network include zzso and zzso zzso proteins that determine the cellular zzso of zzso by zzso its synthesis and degradation, zzso Crystal structure analyses in combination with functional studies have revealed the zzso mechanisms and regulatory principles zzso zzso zzso is recognized by zzso zzso receptors that can undergo large-scale domain zzso on zzso zzso Here, we review recent data on the structure and functional properties of the protein families that are involved in zzso zzso and discuss the zzso zzso
