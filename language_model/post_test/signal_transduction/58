Cell cycle re-entry of zzso T zzso regulated by zzso is required for zzso zzso expansion and generation of productive T cell zzso Recently, we determined that induction of zzso T cell tolerance results in impaired zzso activity leading to enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and blockade of cell cycle zzso Here we report that zzso zzso of zzso with zzso blocked expansion of zzso T cells in zzso and in zzso and protected from lethal acute zzso In addition to zzso zzso T cell responses, zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso B pathway, which is involved in the inflammatory process leading to the development of zzso The combined zzso and zzso properties of zzso make it an attractive treatment zzso toward control of zzso
