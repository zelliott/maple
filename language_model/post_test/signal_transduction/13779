Patients with zzso cancer zzso with zzso zzso zzso are often treated with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the presence of a specific molecular target, most patients still do not derive benefit from this biological zzso Our study explores the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and of zzso zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tumor biopsy samples from 226 zzso patients with zzso were studied for zzso expression of insulin growth factor binding protein 2 zzso insulin growth factor zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

Of the 226 patients zzso for exploratory analysis, 222 had complete data from follow-up zzso The zzso analysis revealed the following significant adverse zzso factors for risk of zzso high zzso zzso levels zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso high zzso zzso levels zzso zzso P zzso zzso and high zzso zzso levels zzso zzso P zzso zzso Low zzso tumor expression was significantly associated with objective response to zzso zzso In zzso analysis of a broad zzso panel, factors with independent zzso value included zzso zzso levels zzso zzso P zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso P zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

High zzso zzso expression in zzso was associated with a worse outcome in patients treated with zzso zzso Prospective validation in treated and control patients is required to dissect the zzso from zzso role in advanced zzso
