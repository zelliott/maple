Natural killer zzso cells and zzso cells play critical early roles in host zzso Here we show that zzso an zzso protein belonging to the zzso family, functions zzso in zzso cells but positively in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was enhanced in zzso cells, whereas zzso or zzso zzso zzso production was reduced in zzso cells from zzso zzso These opposite effects of zzso paralleled the exclusive expression of the zzso family zzso zzso in zzso cells between the 2 cell zzso We further demonstrated that interaction of zzso with zzso zzso by the zzso zzso region of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso was required for the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso This functional zzso of signaling molecules demonstrates a new mechanism by which zzso proteins can act as molecular switches to control diverse responses in different cell zzso
