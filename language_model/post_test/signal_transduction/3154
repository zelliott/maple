zzso are an important component of the zzso zzso in zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso control zzso remain zzso We show that zzso zzso signaling in zzso results in zzso niche expansion associated with selective expansion of the zzso zzso Increased red blood cell production occurred in an zzso manner with increased EPO expression in bone and suppressed EPO expression in the zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso reduced EPO expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso protected mice from zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso of zzso zzso in zzso elevated EPO expression in bone and increased zzso These data reveal an unexpected role for zzso in the production of EPO and zzso of zzso Furthermore, these studies demonstrate a molecular role for zzso zzso signaling that can be targeted to elevate both zzso and zzso zzso in the local zzso zzso
