Signaling pathways that respond to DNA damage are essential for the maintenance of zzso stability and are linked to many diseases, including zzso Here, a zzso zzso screen was employed to identify additional genes involved in zzso stabilization by monitoring zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an early mark of DNA zzso We identified hundreds of genes whose zzso led to elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso and revealed links to cellular complexes and to genes with zzso zzso We demonstrate a widespread role for zzso factors in preventing DNA damage, which in some cases is caused by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we connect increased zzso levels to the neurological disorder zzso zzso syndrome, and we find a role for several CMT proteins in the zzso zzso These data indicate that preservation of zzso stability is zzso by a larger network of biological processes than previously zzso
