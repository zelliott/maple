We used a zzso transplanted working heart model to probe the collaborative role of bone zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso in attenuating tissue zzso in recipient and transplanted zzso zzso from male transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into zzso female zzso One month later, zzso heart transplantation was zzso The left anterior descending coronary artery zzso of the recipient heart was zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso with a zzso gene zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso in the zzso zzso region of both recipient and transplanted zzso zzso and transplanted hearts zzso zzso 10 zzso were harvested 21 days later for zzso The survival of transplanted hearts was assessed daily by zzso in additional animals zzso zzso zzso Five days after zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the circulation were significantly higher in the zzso zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso newly formed vessels, and zzso cells significantly increased in transplanted hearts of the zzso group at 21 days after the injection of zzso zzso zzso whereas fewer zzso zzso were zzso The survival of transplanted hearts was also markedly increased in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso released from the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso to acutely zzso recipient and progressively zzso transplanted zzso zzso recruitment resulted in the zzso of new zzso and blood vessels and extended survival of the transplanted zzso
