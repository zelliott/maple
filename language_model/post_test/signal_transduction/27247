The zzso cell zzso is a key checkpoint regulator in developing B zzso Early events that are controlled by the zzso cell zzso include positive selection for cells express membrane zzso heavy chains and negative selection against cells expressing truncated zzso that lack a complete variable region zzso zzso Positive selection is known to be zzso by membrane zzso heavy chains through zzso zzso zzso whereas the mechanism for zzso against D zzso has not been zzso We have examined the role of the zzso zzso beta signal zzso in zzso against D zzso using mice that lack zzso zzso We found that D zzso expression is not selected against in developing B cells in zzso beta zzso zzso Thus, the molecular mechanism for zzso against D zzso in zzso cells resembles positive selection in that it requires interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
