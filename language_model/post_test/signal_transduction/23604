zzso gene expression in kidney zzso cells is thought to be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 signaling is activated in zzso of patients with zzso and drives the zzso and proliferation of zzso in zzso We confirm here that deletion of zzso zzso is sufficient to mitigate the zzso as well as zzso findings of zzso 

To demonstrate the functional role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso we compared the development of zzso in zzso zzso mice with and without deletion of zzso in the zzso 

zzso mice with zzso zzso deletion developed significantly less weight loss, zzso and zzso function impairment compared to zzso mice without zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso deletion also had significantly less zzso collapse, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso target gene zzso and zzso changes of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also significantly reduced compared to zzso mice without zzso zzso 

Development of zzso as well as zzso injuries in the zzso zzso model is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso could be a potential zzso therapy for the treatment of zzso
