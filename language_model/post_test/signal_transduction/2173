zzso and zzso zzso are vital components of a number of common zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso regulates multiple processes in zzso cells, including zzso organization, zzso trafficking, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in events downstream of the receptors for insulin and other growth zzso Here we demonstrate by zzso and affinity zzso that zzso associates with zzso zzso 2 zzso in the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso thereby significantly enhancing zzso zzso activity in zzso and in intact zzso Furthermore, zzso a zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in intact zzso These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for modulating zzso zzso and provide a direct link between components of two fundamental signaling zzso
