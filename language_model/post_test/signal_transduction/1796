A series of zzso viruses with either zzso zzso or various deletions of the early zzso promoter of human zzso were used to determine the roles of regulatory elements and the effects of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was regulated by upstream zzso sites and by basic promoter elements that respond to the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso affected expression equally with either zzso or zzso early zzso promoters in the viral zzso indicating that the effects of the zzso are not exclusive for a single zzso zzso The minimal responsive element is the zzso zzso early viral zzso
