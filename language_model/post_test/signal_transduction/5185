zzso factors produced by tumors or zzso cells represent a major obstacle to zzso tumor zzso and zzso We studied zzso changes in expression of the zzso a key zzso for the zzso of zzso signals through the zzso zzso and zzso receptors on natural killer zzso cells, in patients with early zzso 1 and 2) breast zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso proliferation and zzso expression in zzso zzso were measured in breast tumors, their draining zzso zzso and in zzso and zzso blood samples of cancer patients and healthy controls by zzso flow zzso We found that zzso zzso expression in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients zzso zzso 29) was zzso compared with healthy controls zzso zzso 10) zzso zzso zzso which was most pronounced in stage 2 zzso zzso 15, p zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso loss was most distinct in the tumor and decreased with increasing distance zzso zzso zzso After surgical tumor zzso peripheral blood zzso levels zzso to those observed in healthy zzso zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso correlated with zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and with the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Breast cancer patients had lower numbers of circulating early memory zzso zzso than healthy donors zzso zzso zzso zzso with lower zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and functional zzso in zzso can be detected even in early stage breast cancer zzso The observed zzso appears to be systemic and tumor dependent, as it is strongest in the zzso zzso with tumor stage and zzso after zzso
