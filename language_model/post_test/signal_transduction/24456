zzso zzso pathways regulate zzso cell fates in zzso zzso development and zzso zzso by the requirement for sonic zzso zzso zzso in lung development, we investigated a role for this zzso in zzso and zzso of airway zzso Here we demonstrate extensive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso within the airway zzso during repair of acute airway zzso This mode of zzso zzso is characterized by the zzso and reception of the zzso signal within the zzso zzso and immediately precedes neuroendocrine zzso We reveal a similar pattern of zzso zzso in airway development during normal differentiation of pulmonary neuroendocrine precursor cells, and in a subset of zzso lung cancer zzso a highly aggressive and frequently lethal human zzso with primitive neuroendocrine zzso These zzso maintain their zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that some types of zzso might zzso a critical, zzso event in airway zzso zzso This requirement for zzso zzso zzso identifies a common lethal zzso that may respond to pharmacological blockade of the zzso zzso zzso
