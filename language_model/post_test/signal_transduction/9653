zzso are zzso prior to cell division, which is proposed to regulate proper cell cycle zzso The signaling pathways that regulate zzso zzso are not zzso Recent zzso and genetic data demonstrate that protein zzso plays important roles in zzso zzso Here, we analyzed the zzso in the zzso fraction of zzso undergoing zzso as well as zzso from steady state cells of zzso The zzso were enriched by a combination of zzso and titanium dioxide zzso with a strategy of sequential zzso from zzso zzso and analyzed by tandem mass zzso A total of 224 zzso derived from zzso spectral counts of zzso were zzso Among the identified zzso are zzso zzso proteins such as outer zzso arm, zzso transport proteins as well as signaling molecules including protein zzso zzso G zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso were only detected in zzso zzso whereas 29 were solely in zzso of steady growing cells, indicating dramatic changes of protein zzso during zzso zzso Our data indicates that protein zzso is a key event in zzso zzso and zzso the way for further study of zzso assembly and zzso controlled by protein zzso
