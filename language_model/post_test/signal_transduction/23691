zzso is one of the most prevalent chronic lung diseases, affecting 235 million individuals around the world, with its related morbidity and mortality increasing steadily over the last 20 zzso Exposure to the environmental zzso house dust zzso zzso results in airway inflammation with a variable degree of airway zzso Although there has been much experimental work in the past using zzso challenge models to understand zzso details in allergic inflammation and airway zzso zzso there has been no study on zzso of lung or airways zzso through zzso mechanisms in response to an acute zzso zzso Male mice, 6 weeks of age, were zzso zzso extracts or saline at Days 1, 14, and zzso Exposure of mice to zzso extracts caused significant airway inflammation and increased zzso These zzso mice also exhibited a change in global DNA zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso Next, by employing zzso restriction zzso we identified a set of zzso showing zzso zzso status, associated with the zzso zzso These candidate genes are known to be involved in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso and zzso and fatty acid metabolism zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the mice exposed to zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso exposure zzso a series of zzso zzso genes that are potentially important for the development of allergic zzso
