Small zzso zzso regulate diverse zzso including stress responses, zzso and metabolism in zzso zzso At the center of this large zzso regulatory network is the zzso zzso zzso mediates the binding of zzso to their target zzso without zzso most zzso cannot efficiently regulate target zzso zzso Here, we show in zzso that zzso can be a limiting factor for zzso activity and that it can be easily zzso causing disruption of the zzso zzso zzso of the available zzso can occur when zzso and target zzso are transcribed at high levels without their partners, resulting in the zzso of zzso into zzso and target zzso zzso This can be avoided by zzso the zzso of zzso with their target zzso so that they are turned on and off together to maximize duplex formation and minimize zzso zzso zzso the limited availability of zzso results in a highly zzso zzso network, wherein the activity of each zzso depends on the activity of the other zzso and target zzso in the zzso
