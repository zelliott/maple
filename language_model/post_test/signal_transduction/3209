zzso is produced from fatty tissue and has been reported to be involved with zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been demonstrated to play a zzso role against cerebral zzso In this study, we explored the zzso serial expression changes of zzso in zzso fluid zzso after zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso on cerebral zzso The zzso of zzso were measured serially until day 14 in zzso of 8 patients with zzso The zzso samples obtained from 6 patients suffering from an zzso aneurysm were used as zzso zzso samples were collected from 6 healthy adult zzso zzso cerebral arteries were incubated with zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso was then zzso The zzso zzso in serum and control zzso were zzso and zzso zzso After zzso the concentration of zzso in the zzso significantly increased on the first zzso day and gradually decreased zzso zzso significantly zzso both the zzso and zzso of the cerebral zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is significantly increased in the zzso after zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role against cerebral zzso via the zzso signaling zzso
