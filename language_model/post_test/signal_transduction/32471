This study examined the potential role of zzso and the contribution of protein zzso C zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in the left zzso coronary artery zzso of a dog model of zzso heart failure zzso In the zzso of the rapid zzso zzso dog model of zzso elevated plasma zzso levels were associated with a decrease in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso turnover zzso zzso zzso To assess whether elevated plasma zzso levels may have contributed to the diminished zzso responsiveness in the heart failure dogs, zzso generation of zzso zzso was measured following a one hour zzso of normal coronary artery rings with zzso zzso zzso As compared to zzso rings, zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease of zzso (10 zzso production of zzso zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in this process, normal coronary rings zzso for a period of one hour with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso resulted in a similar zzso zzso of zzso production of zzso zzso In the presence of the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso induced decreases in zzso zzso zzso turnover were zzso zzso even zzso zzso zzso induced zzso turnover despite zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso turnover can occur and is at least one of the possible mechanisms contributing to the zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso model of heart failure in the zzso
