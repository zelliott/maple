The zzso of zzso to other cellular proteins regulates a broad range of zzso cell zzso The high efficiency and exquisite selectivity of zzso reactions reflect the properties of zzso known as zzso zzso or zzso An zzso recognizes its zzso based on the presence of a specific zzso zzso and zzso the formation of an zzso bond between a zzso (or zzso zzso zzso and the C zzso of zzso Although a great deal is known about the molecular basis of zzso zzso much less is known about molecular mechanisms of zzso by zzso Recent findings reveal that all known zzso zzso one of just two zzso zzso zzso domain or a zzso zzso crystal structures have provided the first detailed views of an active site of each zzso The new findings shed light on many aspects of zzso structure, function, and zzso but also emphasize that key features of zzso zzso remain to be zzso
