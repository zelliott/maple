zzso zzso knockout of the insulin zzso results in zzso due to impaired insulin zzso suggesting that this cell is an important target of insulin zzso The present studies were undertaken in zzso insulin zzso knockout zzso mice to define the mechanisms underlying the zzso in insulin zzso On the basis of responses to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso mice were either diabetic zzso or normally zzso tolerant zzso Total insulin content was profoundly reduced in zzso of zzso mice compared with zzso Both groups also exhibited reduced zzso mass and zzso zzso However, insulin zzso and protein were similar in zzso of diabetic and zzso zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso in response to insulin zzso from the isolated zzso zzso was markedly reduced in the diabetic zzso and to a lesser degree in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso animals also exhibited defects in zzso and zzso insulin release that were milder than in the diabetic zzso Gene expression analysis of zzso revealed a modest reduction of zzso and zzso gene expression in both the zzso and diabetic zzso Taken together, these data indicate that loss of functional receptors for insulin in zzso leads primarily to profound defects in zzso zzso zzso In addition, altered zzso sensing may also contribute to defective insulin zzso in zzso animals that develop zzso
