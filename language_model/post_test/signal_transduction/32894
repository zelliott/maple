Biological signaling pathways interact with one another to form complex zzso zzso arises from the large number of zzso many with zzso that have partially overlapping zzso from the connections among zzso and from the spatial relationship between zzso The origins of the complex behavior of signaling networks and zzso approaches to deal with the emergent complexity are discussed zzso
