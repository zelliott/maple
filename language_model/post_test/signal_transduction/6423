Over the past decade, the focus of research into the zzso of bipolar disorder has shifted from an interest in the zzso zzso to an emphasis on second zzso systems within zzso Emerging evidence implicates protein zzso C zzso zzso signaling cascade in the zzso and treatment of bipolar zzso This review explores the possible involvement of zzso in bipolar disorder zzso results from laboratory and clinical zzso zzso patients were demonstrated to have altered zzso levels, activity or distribution in zzso and in the zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso produced a striking reduction in protein zzso C zzso human cells and in zzso zzso zzso in animals resulted in altered zzso behavior and in a small study, tamoxifen (a zzso zzso had marked zzso zzso The results of studies at the zzso zzso animal and clinical levels all suggest that regulation of zzso signaling pathways may play a major part in the zzso and treatment of bipolar zzso zzso this zzso may be a promising candidate for the development of new, more specific drugs for the zzso
