zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a Food and Drug Administration zzso growth factor, acting as a zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso for skin wound zzso The two closely related zzso adapter zzso zzso and zzso connect zzso signaling to the zzso zzso and cell zzso The mechanism has not been fully zzso In this study, we investigated, side by side, the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso or zzso mice, and primary human zzso cells with zzso interference zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso all failed to migrate in response to zzso zzso of the middle zzso domain of zzso or zzso alone in human zzso also blocked zzso cell zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso was required for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, or zzso by zzso Although zzso zzso the membrane zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso appeared to mediate zzso signaling for zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso zzso signaling to induce stress zzso Thus, this study has zzso the independent roles and mechanisms of action of zzso and zzso in zzso migration, which is critical for wound zzso
