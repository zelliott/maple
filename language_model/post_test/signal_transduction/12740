The role of zzso zzso signaling as a zzso zzso is well zzso Several recent studies have implicated a role for this zzso in multiple zzso In this study we report that expression of zzso and zzso zzso increase progressively with the progression of melanoma from primary zzso cancer to zzso melanoma in clinically derived zzso We have further determined that zzso is a direct zzso target of zzso We have observed that zzso expression is zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and inhibited in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso impacts zzso expression and compromises the ability of cancer cells to zzso zzso and invade in zzso and interferes with their ability to grow as zzso and spontaneously zzso in nude zzso These altered attributes could be rescued by zzso zzso in the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is a critical downstream zzso of active zzso zzso Our observations lead us to conclude that the zzso zzso of zzso promotes zzso behavior of cancer zzso
