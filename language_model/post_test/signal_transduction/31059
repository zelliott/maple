To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of muscle growth and zzso zzso we analyzed the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso A zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso on the muscle mass as well as on the zzso levels of zzso heavy chains zzso I, zzso zzso zzso using a real-time zzso with specific zzso in rat zzso In comparison with control, the CB treatment significantly decreased the zzso I zzso level zzso zzso zzso but increased the zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso and the zzso treatment significantly decreased the zzso I zzso level zzso zzso zzso in association with the significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso The zzso treatment significantly decreased the levels of zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but increased the zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso in association with a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso The zzso muscle mass was significantly zzso zzso zzso increased by either the CB or the CB + zzso treatment, but decreased with the zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that in rat zzso muscle, CB has an anabolic action accompanying zzso zzso I zzso zzso sequence transition independently of zzso zzso and zzso is involved in the type I fiber gene expression and the muscle mass maintenance of type zzso zzso
