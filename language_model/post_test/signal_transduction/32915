Human natural killer zzso cells express several killer cell zzso zzso receptors zzso that inhibit their zzso upon recognition of human zzso zzso zzso zzso class I molecules on target zzso Additional members of the zzso family, including some that deliver zzso signals, have unknown zzso specificity and zzso One such zzso zzso zzso is structurally divergent from other zzso in the zzso of its two zzso zzso zzso and of its zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso soluble zzso binds to cells expressing zzso but not to cells expressing other zzso class I zzso Unlike other zzso class zzso zzso which are zzso distributed on zzso cells, zzso is expressed at the surface of all zzso zzso Furthermore, functional transfer of zzso into the cell line zzso resulted in zzso of zzso of target cells that express zzso but not target cells that express other class I molecules including zzso zzso given that zzso expression is restricted to fetal zzso cells, zzso may provide important signals to maternal zzso zzso cells that interact with zzso cells at the zzso interface during zzso
