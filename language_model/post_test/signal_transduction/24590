The signal zzso systems of the zzso Y zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso human zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso calcium zzso concentration zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which were zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both signal zzso zzso but its effect on zzso was about zzso more potent than that on zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso binding in zzso cells and hardly inhibited the zzso increase in zzso zzso toxin also inhibited the zzso zzso increase zzso more effectively than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso receptors in zzso cells couple to two signal zzso systems that have different sensitivities to zzso zzso and zzso toxin zzso
