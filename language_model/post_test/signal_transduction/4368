zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family are zzso regulated by zzso in the zzso tail of the zzso A different protein zzso zzso zzso is largely responsible for this zzso The zzso tail of zzso engages with the zzso domain in a zzso that is associated with low zzso activity and which involves stabilization by the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso is lethal unless zzso is zzso Using this zzso we present evidence that zzso regulation by zzso zzso does not require the zzso signal or the unique domain at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso show that neither are necessary in zzso or in zzso for efficient regulation of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso a site of zzso common to most protein zzso zzso abolished the ability of zzso to arrest growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same effect on a shorter form of zzso consisting of the zzso domain only, indicating that the zzso affects a property intrinsic to the zzso zzso The residual activity of full-length zzso zzso at zzso is efficiently zzso by zzso action, suggesting that regulation by zzso zzso does not act by preventing zzso at zzso
