Despite the fact that tissue engineered heart valves zzso hold great promise for heart valve disease treatment, one of the challenges is to find suitable seeding zzso Bone zzso derived zzso stem cells zzso were considered to be one of the best seed cell zzso In this study we propose a novel approach to promote stem cell differentiation into the seed cells of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso induced zzso zzso were created from a zzso niche in which healthy human donor derived zzso were zzso with cardiac zzso zzso cell zzso Then zzso were zzso with either a mock zzso zzso ) as controls or with a zzso that zzso zzso zzso factor 14 zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to analyze the involved signaling zzso The results demonstrate that the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso as compared with zzso , and zzso and also had higher zzso of zzso and stress fiber zzso in zzso Additionally, increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins including collagen I, collagen III, and zzso were observed in zzso in comparison with zzso zzso These data observed in zzso were in accordance with zzso zzso from normal heart zzso In addition, the zzso signaling zzso was activated in zzso which allowed higher zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso levels, zzso it was attenuated by zzso zzso zzso These new findings of the effect of zzso on zzso cell differentiation may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for heart valve disease zzso
