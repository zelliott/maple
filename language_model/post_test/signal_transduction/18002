Following cell surface zzso zzso the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso proteins activates the zzso zzso zzso Here we examined the expression and zzso of zzso protein alpha zzso in the adult mouse brain by in zzso zzso and zzso Of the four members of the zzso protein alpha zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed predominantly in the zzso The highest zzso level of zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells, while that of zzso was noted in zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso common to zzso and zzso strongly zzso the zzso molecular layer and zzso zzso zzso In these regions, zzso zzso zzso the zzso face of zzso cell membrane of PCs and zzso zzso zzso were distributed along the zzso cell membrane of zzso zzso and zzso but were almost excluded from the zzso zzso By double zzso zzso was extensively zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso spines of PCs and with zzso in those of zzso zzso zzso Together with concentrated zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso on PC and zzso cell zzso zzso et zzso 1993, zzso 11, zzso zzso et zzso 1996, zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso the present zzso findings suggest that zzso stimulation of the group I zzso zzso receptors is zzso by zzso and/or zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
