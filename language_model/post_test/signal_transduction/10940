The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso containing a single zzso zzso have revealed detailed information regarding zzso binding and zzso zzso Here we extend these studies to investigate the influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso from native zzso zzso zzso is not significantly zzso on binding to myosin, although an apparent signal is detected as a consequence of a light scatter zzso zzso has a minor effect on the response of zzso located at the entrance to the zzso pocket, and reduces the forward rate zzso for the zzso associated with binding of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso The zzso detected by zzso clearly precedes the zzso of zzso in the case of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso end of the relay zzso is very sensitive to the switch 2 and/or lever arm zzso zzso the observed zzso zzso intensity can be used to estimate the equilibrium constant between the zzso and zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso this equilibrium by no more than zzso in the presence of zzso zzso These data have implications for the mechanism of product release and suggest that zzso activates another process in the zzso such as switch 1 movement and zzso release, rather than influencing the switch 2 equilibrium and lever arm position zzso
