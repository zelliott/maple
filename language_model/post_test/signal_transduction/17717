The zzso zzso gene products form complexes via zzso interactions and maintain the zzso repression of genes involved in zzso cell cycle, and zzso Previously, we have shown that mouse zzso a zzso zzso has tumor zzso zzso activity and zzso regulates zzso Here, we show in zzso by pull-down zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso forms zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is regulated by protein zzso C zzso and protein zzso such that zzso zzso is able to zzso These results suggest that the zzso and/or equilibrium of zzso of the class II zzso complex containing zzso might be regulated by changes in zzso status via the zzso signaling zzso
