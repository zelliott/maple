Clinical studies have shown that decreased tamoxifen effectiveness zzso with elevated levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in biopsy samples of breast zzso To investigate the mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance and zzso we engineered the zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cell line to express zzso to clinically relevant levels in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso implanted zzso that were initially tamoxifen responsive and zzso resulted in zzso tumor growth and zzso to the zzso Lung zzso were also observed in a zzso manner following tail vein injection of tumor zzso At both primary and zzso sites, zzso tumors exhibited extensive zzso zzso content, a clinical feature called zzso zzso zzso colonies were surrounded by densely packed zzso cells before zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the initiation of zzso Because expression of zzso receptors zzso and zzso was zzso in these tumor cells, the observed zzso effects on reduction of tamoxifen efficacy and zzso colonization are most likely zzso by zzso signaling that enhances zzso cell interactions and increases the level of zzso This study reveals new roles for zzso in breast cancer progression and suggests that combination of zzso and zzso zzso may prolong tamoxifen sensitivity and prevent zzso in patients with zzso zzso
