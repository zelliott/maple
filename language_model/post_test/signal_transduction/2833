zzso are required for polarized growth and zzso in zzso zzso To accomplish this, zzso cables and patches are redistributed during the cell cycle to direct zzso components to appropriate sites for cell zzso A major component of zzso cables is zzso I, zzso by zzso that determines or zzso these zzso zzso of zzso is not lethal but results in the loss of zzso cables and zzso a partial zzso in polarized zzso Using a synthetic lethal screen, we have identified seven zzso residing in six genes whose products are required in the absence of zzso Each zzso exhibited a zzso zzso suggesting a functional link to the zzso zzso zzso cloning of one zzso revealed that it lies in zzso which encodes a zzso protein for the zzso zzso zzso zzso also show synthetic zzso with zzso and zzso in certain other zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso in several zzso zzso These data therefore provide a genetic link between the GAP zzso by zzso and the functional organization of zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and have abnormal zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso product may also be involved directly or indirectly in regulating zzso zzso
