The zzso zzso is a highly organized complex formed at the junction between zzso T cells and zzso as a prelude to cell zzso Although its exact role in modulating T cell signaling is unknown, it is commonly believed that the zzso zzso is the site of zzso between the T cell and zzso (or zzso We have examined the zzso formed by zzso and memory zzso cells during zzso zzso interactions with zzso We show that the mature zzso zzso forms more quickly during memory T cell zzso We further show that the composition of the zzso found in zzso or memory cell zzso with zzso is distinct with the zzso zzso zzso being a more integral component of the mature zzso formed by memory zzso Finally, we show that signaling zzso including zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso in resting memory cells but not in zzso zzso Thus, enhanced memory cell responses may be due to intrinsic properties of signaling zzso zzso
