zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso regulates zzso zzso and is a molecular target for zzso zzso We report here the identification of a steroid zzso zzso zzso as an unexpected zzso zzso thereby uncovering a novel signaling route for this steroid zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso the expression of key zzso target genes and promotes zzso zzso but with a lower zzso zzso zzso and functional studies of zzso interactions reveal the molecular basis for a unique binding mode for zzso in the zzso zzso pocket with distinctive properties and zzso providing the molecular mechanisms for the discrimination of zzso from zzso zzso zzso Our findings together indicate that steroid compounds may represent an alternative approach for designing zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of insulin zzso
