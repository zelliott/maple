zzso A zzso a neurotransmitter distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system, strictly controls vital responses, such as airway contraction, by zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso However, the function of zzso signaling on involvement in immune responses is zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling activates zzso cell zzso type 1 immune zzso zzso stimulation significantly induced zzso zzso and remarkably enhanced surface protein expression levels of bone zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso production level was significantly elevated after zzso stimulation in zzso and in zzso We found that zzso treatment induced type 1 zzso zzso expressions in zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso the expression level of surface zzso class II and promoted zzso zzso production by zzso T cells after zzso zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso by an zzso significantly suppressed zzso production by both zzso T and zzso T cells zzso with the zzso zzso Finally, we confirmed that stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly induced both zzso zzso and surface protein expression of human zzso zzso as well as enhanced human zzso zzso which encodes zzso and zzso zzso Thus, these findings indicate that zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso T cell responses via zzso of DC function, suggesting that the zzso cascade would be a promising target in chronic inflammation caused by excessive type zzso zzso
