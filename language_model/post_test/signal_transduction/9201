zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to increase plasma zzso zzso zzso level for controlling zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso analog have been approved for zzso zzso In addition to the zzso effect, zzso signaling was reported to zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso was shown to improve survival rate after zzso zzso in mice, but the precise mechanism remains zzso We aimed to compare the cardiovascular responses of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso rats and investigate the underlying zzso zzso were subjected to zzso of coronary artery zzso followed by zzso for zzso zzso function was characterized by analyzing zzso zzso As compared to zzso rats, after zzso zzso rats had better cardiac performance in association with less zzso size and cardiac injury markers zzso zzso and zzso which could be attenuated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso could diminish the increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso as well as the higher expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso could not completely abrogate the less zzso size in zzso rats as compared with that in zzso rats, implicating the involvement of zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study demonstrated that the benefit of cardiac protective action against zzso injury was demonstrated in zzso rats, which is zzso through both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
