Signal zzso zzso by the B cell zzso zzso involves the zzso of multiple protein zzso zzso that are members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether members of the zzso family possess common physical and/or zzso properties that enable them to zzso signal zzso via the B cell zzso zzso we expressed the protein zzso zzso zzso in the B zzso cell line zzso zzso m zzso Based on zzso analysis and zzso zzso this zzso zzso family zzso was observed to physically associate with the B cell zzso zzso Additional experiments demonstrated that B cell zzso zzso zzso results in increased zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Several parameters of B cell zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso factor zzso were zzso in cells that expressed zzso when compared with control zzso To determine whether zzso of zzso zzso signaling by zzso was dependent on its zzso activity, a zzso form of zzso was expressed in zzso zzso m zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso exhibited an enhanced responsiveness to stimulation through the B cell zzso zzso that was comparable with zzso expressing zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was observed to associate with the zzso zzso Lyn in an zzso zzso These findings indicate that members of the zzso family may zzso zzso zzso signaling via a zzso zzso that involves amplification of zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
