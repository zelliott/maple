This unit focuses on the use of total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso and image analysis methods to study the dynamics of signal zzso zzso by class I zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The first four protocols cover zzso imaging experiments, image acquisition zzso and basic image processing and zzso These methods are generally zzso to zzso zzso zzso The remaining protocols outline more advanced image analysis methods, which were developed in our laboratory for the purpose of characterizing the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso These methods may be extended to analyze other cellular processes monitored using fluorescent zzso
