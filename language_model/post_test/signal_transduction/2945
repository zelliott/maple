Despite their genetic diversity, different zzso manifest common features at the protein zzso zzso They share a core group of zzso pathways that zzso upon a few regulatory hubs linking the cellular signaling network with the basic zzso zzso Available evidence indicates that one such hub is the zzso zzso zzso translation initiation apparatus, whose integrity is required for zzso control of growth, proliferation and zzso However, when zzso by upstream zzso zzso zzso selectively stimulates the translation of a group of zzso required for cancer genesis and zzso Here, we describe a model that links the zzso function of zzso to its ability to zzso zzso tumor surveillance programs and propose a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer based upon targeting zzso zzso with zzso zzso
