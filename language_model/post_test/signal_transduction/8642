zzso zzso type 1 zzso is a zzso disorder caused by an unstable zzso zzso zzso segment in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso It is commonly accepted that zzso zzso toxicity is the main contributor to zzso zzso however, not much is known about the significance of the zzso zzso To appreciate its normal and possible zzso role, we analyzed the patterns of zzso zzso zzso expression in mouse zzso Long zzso zzso dominated in heart, zzso and skeletal muscle, whereas short zzso zzso were highly expressed in zzso and zzso Both zzso types were present in diverse brain zzso zzso protein was also zzso in cultured zzso zzso cortical zzso and related cell lines of neural or muscle origin, but not in zzso zzso This work identifies zzso as a zzso with pronounced expression in diverse muscle and neural zzso that are affected in zzso
