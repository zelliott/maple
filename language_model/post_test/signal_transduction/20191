The zzso zzso zzso zzso controls multiple aspects of zzso zzso and has been implicated in zzso development and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can antagonize zzso gene repression, but the mechanisms responsible for this effect are not fully zzso Based on genetic and imaging studies in the early zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso signaling can increase the rate of zzso degradation by changing its zzso zzso We propose that zzso is zzso predominantly in the zzso and show that zzso reduces the stability of zzso by controlling the rates of its zzso zzso This model accounts for the zzso observed zzso dynamics of zzso in the early zzso and might explain zzso control of zzso in other zzso zzso
