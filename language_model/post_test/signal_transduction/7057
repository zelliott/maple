zzso proteins play a major role during zzso of zzso bacteria by organizing zzso of the zzso cell zzso However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not well zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be associated to zzso complexes containing zzso zzso factors and zzso cell wall assembly zzso We have now found that an early zzso step of cell wall synthesis is also associated to zzso We show that the previously zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is required for synthesis of zzso zzso an essential constituent of the zzso zzso and that it physically interacts with zzso zzso inclined laminated optical sheet zzso revealed that zzso forms zzso distributed zzso that exhibit fast motion in the zzso and are not detected in cells lacking zzso We propose a model in which soluble zzso organizes zzso steps of zzso synthesis in the zzso to feed the zzso cell wall zzso zzso
