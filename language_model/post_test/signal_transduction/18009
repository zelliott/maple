The zzso is an excellent system in which to study neural cell fate decision zzso It is an organized laminated structure with a limited array of cell zzso During the last 5 years, experiments that zzso normal gene expression have highlighted some molecular mechanisms involved in cellular fate choice in the zzso By controlling when a zzso is allowed to zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in the generation of zzso diversity in the zzso zzso When cells are released from the zzso zzso by the zzso pathway, basic zzso zzso zzso factors act as intrinsic factors that bias zzso towards particular zzso In this review, we present an overview of the data leading to these conclusions on the role of the zzso zzso and the zzso proteins on cell fate decisions during zzso zzso
