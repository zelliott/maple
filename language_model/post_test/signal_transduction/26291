The ability of zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso proteins to act as zzso dictates that their influence be strictly zzso Here, we report that zzso contributed fat zzso zzso a zzso of zzso is essential for proper interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that patterns the embryonic zzso zzso The data suggest that the loss of zzso reduces the activity of Medea (a zzso of zzso below the minimum necessary for adequate zzso signaling and that this is likely due to excessive zzso on a specific zzso This study supports the hypothesis that the control of cellular responsiveness to zzso signals at the level of zzso zzso is a zzso mechanism required for proper zzso of a zzso zzso
