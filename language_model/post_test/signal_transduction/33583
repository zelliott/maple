The zzso important zzso zzso zzso is activated in zzso zzso and zzso administered Sonic zzso zzso supports tissue repair after cardiac zzso zzso it is currently assumed that the zzso increase in zzso during zzso serves a beneficial role in limiting cardiac tissue zzso To prove or zzso this hypothesis, we treated mice with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to block the zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso The experimental induction of zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso and hallmark features of zzso damage, such as left zzso zzso and reduced cardiac zzso zzso zzso treatment ameliorated left zzso zzso and cardiac zzso As the beneficial effect of zzso zzso was suggested to depend on reduced zzso increased zzso and reduced fibrosis, we subsequently assessed the effect of zzso on these zzso zzso was similar in zzso and zzso animals, but increased zzso and reduced zzso were observed in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso seems to exert a dualistic action in cardiac zzso in which high zzso levels are able to foster tissue repair and zzso zzso seems to be zzso
