zzso zzso is widely used as an zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso on zzso differentiation and function using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso a soluble form of zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso bone zzso zzso of zzso into the subcutaneous tissue zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice suppressed the enhanced zzso in the zzso In zzso of mouse zzso and bone zzso cells, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affected neither the zzso expression of zzso and zzso nor the growth of mouse zzso in zzso On the other hand, zzso inhibited the zzso formation of zzso in cultures of mouse bone zzso zzso zzso and of human peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso concealed zzso bone zzso in mouse zzso organ cultures and inhibited the zzso activity of mouse zzso cultured on zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso calcium zzso and expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the zzso nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso in mature zzso Both zzso and zzso expressed zzso of a zzso calcium channel, zzso a target of zzso zzso the expression of zzso by short hairpin zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso differentiation and function through suppression of zzso zzso The topical application of zzso may be a therapeutic treatment to prevent bone loss induced by local inflammation such as zzso
