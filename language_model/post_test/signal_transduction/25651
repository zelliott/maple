zzso sensing is a crucial feature of the nervous system, enabling organisms to avoid physical danger and choose optimal environments for zzso zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso type 8) belongs to a select group of zzso channels which are gated by changes in temperature, are expressed in sensory nerves and/or skin cells and may be involved in temperature zzso This channel is activated by a moderate decrease in temperature, with a threshold of approximately 25 zzso in zzso expression systems, and by a variety of natural and synthetic compounds, including zzso While the zzso role of zzso as a zzso of gentle cooling is widely accepted, its involvement in acute noxious cold sensing in healthy zzso is still under zzso Although accumulating evidence indicates that zzso is involved in zzso cold zzso in some animal models of nerve injury peripheral and central zzso of zzso is followed by zzso A variety of inflammatory zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the channel and shifting its zzso threshold to colder temperatures, most likely zzso the zzso action of zzso While important progress has been made in unraveling the zzso features of zzso including the revelation of its zzso zzso the precise mechanism involved in temperature sensing by this channel is still not completely zzso This article will review the current status of knowledge regarding the zzso zzso of zzso its zzso by inflammatory zzso the signaling pathways involved in this regulation, and the zzso properties of the zzso
