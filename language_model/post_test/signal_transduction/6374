The high affinity zzso zzso zzso usually exists as a zzso composed of zzso zzso The zzso of beta and gamma zzso contains consensus sequence termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with signaling proteins that contain the zzso zzso domain, forming a main amplifying and signaling route for zzso Unlike the zzso the functional role of zzso of beta zzso in the signaling of zzso is not clear because it lacks the zzso zzso To study the roles of zzso of beta zzso the zzso library of zzso cells was screened by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the beta zzso was found to interact with zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso Since both zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso cells and they possess identical cellular functions, the functional meaning of the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso of beta zzso was studied by comparing the regulatory pathways that control the zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso Our study shows that zzso and zzso zzso were required exclusively for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Also the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was more sensitive to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results therefore suggest that zzso is involved in dynamic regulation of protein zzso C activity and zzso zzso levels in response to cellular zzso In contrast, zzso through continuous interaction with the zzso of beta zzso zzso with zzso in the same signaling domain, and maintains the zzso cellular zzso zzso
