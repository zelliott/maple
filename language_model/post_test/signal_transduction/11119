We have recently reported that bone zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso production by zzso zzso cells zzso Here, we have investigated the underlying mechanisms of this effect in zzso as well as in zzso zzso We have confirmed that treatment with zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and totally abolished zzso zzso This zzso action was associated with a decrease in the expression of zzso zzso zzso acute regulatory protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and protein zzso However, zzso did not alter zzso zzso production by zzso In contrast, zzso decreased by half the zzso zzso production and strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso effect of zzso was exerted both upstream and downstream of zzso zzso We next examined the downstream effect, focusing on zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso through the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso induced zzso and zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso activity but inhibited the zzso activity of zzso on the zzso zzso responsive zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso mechanism occurred on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that zzso is a key target in the zzso mechanism exerted by zzso on zzso synthesis by zzso zzso in zzso Because zzso plays an essential role in the differentiation of zzso our findings could have new implications in understanding the role of zzso family members in the control of zzso zzso
