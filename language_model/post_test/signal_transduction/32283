Recent reports indicate that the adult zzso heart is capable of zzso but zzso zzso zzso While the lineage origin of the newly formed zzso is not entirely zzso mounting evidence suggest that the zzso and zzso may represent an important source of cardiac stem or zzso zzso Stem cell niches are characterized by low oxygen tension, where stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso to meet their energy zzso However, it is unclear if the heart harbors similar hypoxic regions, or whether these regions house metabolically distinct cardiac zzso zzso Here we identify the zzso and zzso as the cardiac hypoxic niche based on zzso zzso density zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso We further demonstrate that this hypoxic zzso houses a metabolically distinct population of zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso regulates the zzso zzso and zzso properties of these zzso These findings highlight important anatomical and functional properties of the zzso and zzso zzso and the potential role of zzso signaling in regulation of cardiac zzso
