The zzso zzso zzso domain protein zzso a dominant negative regulator of zzso zzso factors zzso is potentially implicated in negative regulation of zzso in such zzso as the avascular cornea of the zzso We have previously shown zzso zzso expression is zzso in hypoxic zzso which at least in part involves zzso alternative zzso of the transcripts from the zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that a zzso zzso mechanism also plays a role in zzso of zzso gene zzso Isolation and analyses of the promoter region zzso to the first zzso of zzso gene revealed a functional zzso response element at position zzso to zzso whereas the sequence upstream of the zzso first zzso scarcely responded to hypoxic zzso A transient zzso experiment demonstrated that zzso mediates zzso promoter zzso via the functional zzso response element under hypoxic conditions and that a zzso active form of zzso is sufficient for induction of the promoter in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso showed binding of the zzso complex to the element in a zzso zzso Taken together, zzso directly zzso zzso gene expression through a mechanism distinct from zzso zzso providing a further level of negative feedback gene regulation in zzso responses to zzso zzso
