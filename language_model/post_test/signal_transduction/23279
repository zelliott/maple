The zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is required for the survival, proliferation and differentiation of various cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause Noonan syndrome, whereas zzso zzso zzso cause childhood zzso disease and contribute to some solid zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso in zzso were found in zzso a rare inherited disorder featuring multiple zzso zzso joint destruction and zzso zzso The detailed zzso of this disorder has remained zzso Here we use a conditional knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transgenic mice to delete zzso specifically in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso K zzso cells, previously thought to be zzso zzso mice had mild zzso zzso however, zzso mice developed features very similar to zzso zzso tracing revealed a novel population of zzso cells in the zzso groove of zzso that display markers and functional properties consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso arise from these cells and show decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased Indian zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso also known as zzso expression and excessive zzso zzso zzso had decreased zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor treatment of zzso cells increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor treatment ameliorated zzso features in zzso zzso Thus, in contrast to its zzso role in zzso and zzso cells, zzso is a zzso zzso in cartilage, acting through a zzso zzso in a novel zzso cell population to prevent excessive zzso zzso
