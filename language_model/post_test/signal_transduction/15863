zzso a known zzso factor and the first identified microbial surface component recognizing adhesive zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso associated with host cell adherence and zzso The zzso zzso system of zzso zzso a zzso signal zzso system, has also been repeatedly linked to zzso in zzso zzso due in part to the zzso induction of an zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we discovered that disruption of the zzso zzso significantly increased the levels of Ace on the cell surface in the latter zzso of zzso Furthermore, we observed that, in addition to zzso zzso other strains identified as deficient in zzso activity also demonstrated a similar zzso Additional experiments demonstrated the zzso zzso of Ace from the surface of zzso zzso confirming that zzso specifically reduces Ace cell surface zzso In addition, disruption of the zzso system or zzso expression significantly improved the ability of zzso zzso to adhere to zzso which is consistent with higher levels of Ace on the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the display of Ace is zzso by zzso sensing through the action of zzso providing insight into the complicated world of zzso pathogen zzso and zzso
