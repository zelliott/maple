The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso responses and is also expressed by damaged zzso zzso in the kidney where it is known as kidney injury zzso zzso We sought to define the role of zzso zzso in experimental zzso zzso induced by sheep zzso zzso basement membrane zzso acting as a planted foreign zzso zzso is expressed by zzso activated zzso cells in this model, and we studied the effects of an zzso zzso zzso zzso on immune responses and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injury, and zzso zzso were attenuated following treatment with zzso zzso but zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso proliferation and zzso decreased in the immune system along with a selective reduction in zzso and zzso cellular responses both in the immune system and within the zzso The urinary zzso and zzso expression of zzso was reduced by zzso zzso reflecting diminished zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were not apparent in the early phase of zzso injury, when the immune response to sheep zzso was zzso Thus, zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso zzso immune responses and its zzso reduces zzso injury while limiting inflammation in zzso zzso
