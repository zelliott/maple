We have used the synthetic zzso inhibitor zzso C in order to study the role of the zzso system in human zzso zzso zzso disruption prior to zzso with zzso zzso resulted in a drastic reduction of zzso zzso Similarly, using zzso or zzso as zzso a substantial decrease in proliferation was zzso Although zzso zzso analysis performed on the zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso decrease in zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso response to zzso added zzso was zzso This occurred provided the triggering agent was excluded or added in zzso zzso These results indicate that intact zzso are necessary for zzso proliferation and zzso production, but not for zzso zzso
