zzso are the source of various zzso zzso but the membrane molecules involved in their zzso have not been clearly zzso Here we show that peripheral blood zzso from zzso patients could express membrane zzso but not zzso The T cell zzso zzso zzso is also detected on the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso In contrast to T cells requiring two signals for effective zzso zzso zzso alone was sufficient for optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were biologically active, as zzso from zzso cells were able to induce zzso proliferation and major zzso complex class II expression on the colon zzso cell line Colo zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes, which could induce the release of zzso very significantly inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the release of type 1 zzso and zzso versus type 2 zzso by zzso is not only differential but also dependent on zzso zzso They confirm that through zzso of zzso zzso zzso could function as an zzso cell involved in the release of both type 1 and type 2 zzso
