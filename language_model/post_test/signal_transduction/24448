The complement system has been shown to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the contribution of complement factor zzso to zzso injury, in particular in the zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we investigated the impact of blocking the zzso zzso on the inflammatory response and on the zzso function in a zzso model of zzso zzso First, we analyzed zzso expression in zzso of healthy zzso zzso we found expression on zzso as well as on zzso zzso zzso After zzso injury, zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso increased significantly and zzso were heavily infiltrated by zzso zzso the zzso zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso and reduced zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, application of the zzso significantly reduced loss of zzso zzso This improvement of function was independent of the presence of zzso because zzso depletion by zzso zzso did not affect the protective effect of zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking of the zzso zzso had no influence on zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso is zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso injury by zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso which include the regulation of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso
