The zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates many zzso processes both in zzso and in zzso However, little is known about this zzso in the zzso zzso In this paper, we focus on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso which are the key members of the zzso signaling zzso Their zzso structures show their zzso with zzso in zzso In zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso zzso and zzso have similar expression patterns in zzso They are expressed in the neural plate at early zzso stage, and then zzso in zzso neural zzso During development, their transcripts appear and persist in the zzso the wall of the head zzso the zzso of the zzso and the zzso The data show that the expression patterns of these three genes are overlapping with zzso and zzso during the embryonic development in zzso Moreover, injection of zzso zzso zzso into zzso eggs can expand the expression zzso of zzso and zzso the target genes of the zzso signaling pathway, which is similar to the injection of zzso Sonic zzso a zzso and Sonic zzso b zzso Our results suggest that zzso may possess a zzso and functional zzso signaling zzso similar to that of zzso
