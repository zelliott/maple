The inflammation observed in the dental pulp of teeth with deep zzso zzso is characterized by a significant increase in blood vessel zzso It is known that zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso bacteria zzso expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in dental pulp zzso The hypothesis underlying this study was that zzso zzso zzso expression in dental pulp cells through zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso pulp cells zzso were exposed to zzso from zzso zzso and the role of zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso expression was zzso These studies demonstrated that zzso signaling through the zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso expression in pulp zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling did not prevent zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso signaling pathways triggered by zzso bacteria may reveal novel therapeutic targets for the clinical management of zzso
