The zzso mechanisms underlying pancreatic zzso mass zzso zzso are complex and not fully zzso Here we examined the factors contributing to the increased zzso following a mild zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso was maintained through 96 zzso We used zzso and zzso methods to investigate enhanced zzso growth and survival in zzso zzso zzso was elevated zzso over zzso control rats by 48 h and increased modestly zzso zzso increases in zzso proliferation were not observed at any time point through 4 zzso Instead, enhanced numbers of zzso cell clusters and small zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso to zzso zzso mostly scattered among the zzso were observed in the zzso rats by 48 h despite no difference in the numbers of medium to large zzso We previously showed that increased zzso growth in zzso models of insulin resistance and pancreatic zzso involves increased activated zzso a key zzso signaling zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso in normal rats also leads to increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as in zzso and zzso cells in the common duct zzso and zzso zzso This correlated with strong zzso expression in these same zzso These results suggest that mechanisms other than proliferation zzso the rapid zzso growth response following a mild zzso in the normal rat and involve zzso enhanced zzso survival potential and zzso from zzso zzso
