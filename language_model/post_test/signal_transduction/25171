Growth factors are molecules that participate in the control of cell zzso They require specific receptors on the target cell and zzso signaling pathways to transmit the stimulus to the zzso Growth factors can stimulate or inhibit cell zzso Most of the factors implicated in lung cancer growth are thought to act through positive feedback zzso in which factors zzso by the cancer cells bind to receptors on their own zzso zzso or those of neighboring cells zzso zzso zzso expression of growth factors, their zzso or components of their signaling pathways can result in the unrestrained growth of zzso In this review, we described outlines of the growth factors, their zzso signal zzso zzso as well as their clinical zzso
