In this study, we identified a new mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso Treating zzso cells with 20 zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso signal regulated zzso zzso activity within 15 zzso and this subsequently induced zzso cell cycle regulator and localized in the zzso zzso modification and zzso zzso also occurred after zzso treatment, and zzso zzso gene expression was zzso zzso The induction and nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso were blocked by zzso zzso which suggested a role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso incorporation and no zzso incorporation was observed in most zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the proliferation of zzso cells at least partly by a mechanism involving the zzso of zzso
