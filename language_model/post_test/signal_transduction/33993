zzso zzso has been implicated as an innate zzso zzso particularly during conditions of limited oxygen availability such as zzso Because zzso zzso generation is primarily produced via zzso from its precursor zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso we examined the contribution of zzso zzso production in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso and zzso profiling of zzso tissue that revealed a prominent induction of zzso zzso we next determined the role of zzso in protection against zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, pharmacological zzso or targeted gene deletion of zzso significantly enhanced not only local zzso injury, but also secondary organ injury, following zzso as measured by zzso and lung zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To confirm the role of zzso in zzso zzso production, we measured zzso tissue levels and found that they were increased with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso mice had lower zzso levels at baseline and no increase with zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso mice or treatment of zzso mice with soluble zzso was associated with significantly lower levels of zzso These data reveal a previously zzso role of zzso in attenuating zzso zzso zzso
