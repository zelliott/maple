zzso zzso zzso play important role in regulating pancreatic beta cell growth, survival and zzso through the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso zzso used widely to establish the role of zzso The goal of this study was to examine the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on insulin zzso and underlying zzso 

zzso recording, zzso zzso imaging and zzso were used to measure outward zzso zzso action zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso from rat pancreatic beta zzso 

zzso (10 zzso zzso insulin zzso to zzso times of control in the presence of zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso did not show significant effect on insulin zzso zzso prolonged zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, leading to an increase in zzso zzso It appeared that these effects induced by zzso did not result from zzso zzso since zzso zzso did not show such zzso Furthermore, zzso of the downstream zzso of zzso signaling by zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect zzso channels and insulin zzso 

The putative zzso inhibitor zzso enhances zzso and insulin zzso via zzso of zzso channels rather than zzso antagonism in beta cells, suggesting that the zzso effects is needed to be considered for the right interpretation of the experimental results using this agent in the analyses of the role of zzso in cell zzso
