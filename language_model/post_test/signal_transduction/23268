The zzso tumor zzso gene zzso product has been implicated in zzso control of gene expression zzso to its ability to physically bind to many zzso zzso However, the biological and clinical significance of this activity was not well zzso To address this, we performed genetic and zzso analyses in an zzso mouse zzso C cell tumor zzso Here we report that the genetic interaction of zzso and zzso regulates zzso protein stability and hence controls the DNA zzso status in the promoters of at least the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso allows activated zzso to physically bind to zzso forming a complex with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and consequently zzso zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso in coordination with aberration in the DNA damage response zzso zzso stability, leading to an abnormal DNA zzso pattern and zzso zzso
