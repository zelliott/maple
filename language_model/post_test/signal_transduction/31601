We have investigated the effects of prolonged exposure (24 zzso to the zzso acid zzso on gene and protein expression using zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso cells was performed using zzso zzso zzso Culture for 24 h with 10 zzso zzso compared with 1 zzso resulted in substantial changes in gene expression with 148 genes zzso more than zzso and 18 zzso more than zzso including many genes involved in cellular zzso zzso gene regulation, and the zzso zzso zzso functional experiments confirmed that zzso increased the activity of the zzso regulated zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso Additionally, we demonstrated that zzso zzso was released into the zzso medium at high zzso As zzso is a regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, we investigated the action of zzso on zzso insulin zzso and demonstrated suppressed insulin zzso These observations indicate important long-term effects of zzso in regulating zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso
