zzso contributes to the progression of a variety of zzso by zzso zzso zzso programs that promote cell survival, zzso and tumor zzso Although the importance of zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso is well known, their role in the regulation of zzso stem cells is zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso promotes the zzso capacity of zzso human zzso cancer stem cells zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in a hypoxic environment also led to the expansion of cells bearing zzso zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso The enhanced zzso activity of the zzso zzso in zzso was preceded by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso expansion, suggesting that these signaling zzso may zzso the hypoxic zzso Finally, zzso zzso at zzso robustly retained the zzso zzso whereas zzso cultured at zzso did zzso These results suggest that response to zzso by zzso involves the zzso of zzso to enhance the zzso activity of zzso cells and to inhibit the induction of zzso zzso This study illustrates the importance of the tumor zzso in determining cellular zzso
