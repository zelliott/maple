zzso zzso is the pivotal pathological event of acute traumatic neural injury as well as many chronic neurodegenerative zzso It is an active cellular program and yet zzso distinct from cell zzso Much effort is devoted toward understanding the nature of zzso zzso and promoting zzso zzso However, the fundamental mechanisms of self-destruction of damaged zzso remain zzso and there are still few treatments for traumatic brain injury zzso or spinal zzso injury zzso zzso zzso model organisms such as zzso zzso the fruit fly, have proven exceptionally successful in modeling human neurodegenerative zzso More recently, this success has been extended into the field of acute zzso injury and zzso In this review, we discuss recent findings, focusing on how these models hold promise for accelerating zzso insight into zzso injury and identifying potential therapeutic targets for zzso and zzso
