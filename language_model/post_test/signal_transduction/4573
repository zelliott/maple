While the zzso hormone zzso effect of raising zzso zzso levels has been shown to rely on zzso and zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso zzso channels by zzso are still partially zzso We have zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on such regulation in native and zzso expression cell zzso In native rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas in zzso cells permanently expressing zzso and zzso neither of the zzso zzso affected the zzso shift in V zzso Use of specific zzso to knock zzso expression down abolished the zzso effect on zzso cell zzso but not on zzso from zzso zzso Indeed, zzso or long insulin zzso also blocked zzso regulation of zzso currents in zzso but not in zzso zzso To determine whether these differences could be related to the amount of zzso in the cell, we studied the zzso concentration dependence of the zzso and zzso responses in zzso cells zzso the zzso The data indicated that independent of the zzso number additional cellular zzso contribute differently to couple the zzso to zzso channel zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that regulation of zzso currents by zzso and its zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso cell systems through common and different zzso and hence that the cell type influences the zzso pathways involved in the zzso zzso
