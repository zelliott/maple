zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso which serves as a scaffold for various signaling molecules in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are plasma membrane zzso that concentrate various signaling zzso zzso are specialized zzso zzso that are organized by the zzso zzso zzso and have been shown to be associated with zzso zzso II stimulation promotes a rapid movement of zzso receptors to zzso however, their functional role in zzso II signaling has not been zzso Here we show that cholesterol depletion by zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and subsequent zzso of protein zzso B zzso induced by zzso zzso Similar zzso effects were obtained with other zzso agents, zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in response to zzso are not affected by cholesterol zzso The early zzso zzso upstream signaling events responsible for zzso of the zzso such as the zzso zzso increase and zzso zzso also remain zzso The zzso initially binds zzso but these two proteins rapidly zzso following zzso II stimulation during the time when zzso zzso is zzso The activated zzso is localized in focal zzso together with zzso zzso These findings suggest that 1) a scaffolding role of zzso is essential for zzso zzso by zzso II and 2) zzso zzso as well as focal zzso are important zzso compartments required for the spatial and zzso organization of zzso II signaling in zzso
