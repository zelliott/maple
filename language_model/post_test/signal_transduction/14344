A significant challenge in many areas of tissue engineering is a readily available source of zzso One approach to address this challenge is to direct the differentiation of zzso stem or zzso cells or the zzso of an already differentiated cell type to the desired cell zzso A variety of methods have been explored for directing cell zzso including the zzso expression of zzso factors that are known to influence cell differentiation during zzso One such zzso factor, zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso cell development in zzso zzso expression of zzso in various cell types has previously been shown to promote differentiation toward zzso cell zzso but the overall efficiency of this differentiation and the specific zzso cell type produced vary widely between zzso The present work evaluates the hypotheses that cellular response is determined by zzso differentiation status of the starting cell, zzso zzso expression of other zzso factors, and zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to express zzso in primary adult pancreatic zzso zzso cells zzso embryonic and adult stem cells zzso and zzso and transformed mouse pancreatic zzso zzso cells in zzso Changes in zzso were assessed using quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso gene zzso and zzso When zzso was zzso expressed in mouse and rat zzso downstream zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormones (most notably, zzso and zzso were highly zzso in a zzso zzso In comparison to zzso and mouse embryonic stem cells zzso zzso displayed higher expression of most zzso markers after zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso expression and zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed between cell types, suggesting a mechanism by which precursors might zzso generate different zzso cell zzso
