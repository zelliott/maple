The effect of zzso zzso on zzso expression was studied in two human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso with a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of a reporter gene construct containing zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso promoter demonstrated that zzso induced zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso These effects were inhibited at the promoter and protein levels by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter indicates that two zzso sequence elements zzso located at positions zzso and zzso are important for the induction of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that the zzso at the zzso site zzso inhibited the zzso promoter activity, with a reduction of about approximately zzso and zzso at the zzso site zzso eliminated about zzso of the zzso promoter zzso A zzso dominant negative zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso on the zzso promoter zzso zzso induced a rapid zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso which is involved in the binding to the zzso site in the zzso promoter by zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso expression is zzso through the binding of zzso to zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in enhanced zzso and calcium zzso zzso acid release suggesting that at least in part zzso zzso expression may serve a zzso zzso
