A diverse repertoire of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso receptors zzso enables cells to sense their zzso zzso zzso requires the zzso of zzso receptors zzso the largest family of zzso however, whether zzso functionally interact with other families of zzso is zzso We show that the interaction of zzso with the type 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso which is found in zzso sensory zzso zzso modulated OR responses to zzso zzso In human embryonic zzso cells, zzso and the zzso physically zzso and the zzso increased the potency and efficacy of zzso responses of several zzso Selective zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso and, when the zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso cells, OR zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of OR signaling zzso with that of zzso transporting protein zzso zzso an accessory factor required for the efficient membrane targeting of zzso However, the zzso did not enhance the abundance of zzso at the cell surface, suggesting that the zzso acted through a distinct mechanism independent of zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the absence of its zzso The zzso between zzso and the zzso suggests that the functional zzso of zzso and the zzso is required for robust OR zzso
