zzso sense microbial infections, and control zzso of immune zzso zzso cells, zzso and B zzso express zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso The impact of zzso B cells on T zzso inflammation is zzso In this study, we have used mice carrying B zzso deficiencies in zzso or in distinct zzso to examine the impact of zzso B cells on a T zzso zzso disease, experimental zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso in B cells suppresses inflammatory T cell responses (both zzso and zzso and stimulates recovery from zzso Only certain zzso are required on B cells for resolution of zzso and these are zzso for disease zzso indicating that a category of zzso zzso zzso triggers a zzso function in B cells and thereby limits zzso zzso The zzso zzso controlling the regulatory function of B cells are provided by components of zzso tuberculosis present in the zzso Thus, zzso signaling in B cells zzso zzso signaling in other cells, which drives differentiation of zzso cells and is required for induction of zzso Altogether, our data indicate that B cells link recognition of microbial products via zzso to suppression of a T zzso zzso zzso
