zzso of zzso zzso activates zzso C with production of zzso zzso and zzso in part by formation of zzso II zzso zzso However, the response of this zzso to physical stimuli in the adult heart is poorly zzso Thus, in zzso zzso guinea pig hearts, we characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso using elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure, 25 zzso zzso of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of stretched hearts with the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso To examine zzso zzso expression and zzso under these conditions, zzso extracts were examined by zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso to the particulate zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso but not an inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso to the particulate fraction and produced a decrease in zzso zzso zzso Mechanical stretch also zzso zzso zzso to the particulate zzso however, this was attenuated but not abolished by zzso We conclude that in the adult heart, zzso zzso produced zzso zzso of zzso C, which resulted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in part by stimulation of the local zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not prevented by zzso zzso zzso indicating that this zzso zzso can be activated in response to mechanical deformation by an zzso zzso mechanism in the adult zzso
