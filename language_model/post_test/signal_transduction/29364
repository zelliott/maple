Signaling is part of a complex system of communication that zzso basic cellular functions and coordinates cellular zzso Transfer of zzso and signaling molecules and their interactions with appropriate zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso interactions and functional cellular response represent a complex system of interwoven phenomena of zzso zzso zzso changes, chemical zzso and/or genetic zzso The well-being of the cell thus depends on a harmonic orchestration of all these events and the existence of control mechanisms that assure the normal behavior of the various parameters involved and their orderly zzso The ability of cells to sustain life by zzso and responding correctly to their zzso is the basis for development, tissue repair, and zzso as well as normal tissue zzso Natural zzso or zzso interference in the signaling pathways and/or zzso and zzso transport and information transfer, are responsible for the generation, zzso and control of zzso The present overview aims to highlight some major topics of the highly complex cellular information transfer processes and their control zzso Our goal is to contribute to the understanding of the normal and zzso phenomena associated with cardiac functions so that more efficient therapeutic zzso can be zzso Our objective in this volume is to identify and enhance the study of some basic passive and active physical and chemical transport phenomena, zzso signaling zzso and their biological zzso
