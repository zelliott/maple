We have previously reported that zzso acid zzso zzso is a potent zzso for the zzso zzso cell line, zzso This zzso effect is dependent upon zzso of a zzso zzso cascade that results in zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Because of suggestive evidence that zzso also activated zzso in these cells, we zzso zzso zzso with an expression construct of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso family zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso activity zzso confirmed that in empty zzso cells zzso zzso 14, zzso increased zzso zzso activity, while in clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was almost completely blocked zzso zzso Of interest, zzso growth factor zzso and fetal bovine serum zzso also increased zzso activity in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, further confirming the ability of zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso zzso cells failed to increase zzso incorporation in response to zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso significantly increased zzso incorporation in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that in zzso cells, zzso failed to activate zzso and zzso however, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was not different from that seen in zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was blocked by zzso with 1 zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that 14, zzso exerts its zzso effects predominantly through a zzso zzso pathway, which is the most upstream signaling step determined to date in the zzso zzso zzso cascade in zzso zzso zzso
