The functional zzso of three zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in the zzso zzso cell line was zzso zzso cells were grown on zzso filter zzso which allow for the independent exposure of the zzso or zzso side of a zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso selectively applied to the zzso side induced a significant zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso whereas zzso exposure did zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso blocked the stimulation of zzso zzso production in zzso cells, provided support for an zzso zzso zzso When zzso (30 zzso was selectively applied to the zzso side, zzso zzso levels were not significantly decreased zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, zzso (30 zzso presented to the zzso side produced a significant decrease zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A high dose zzso zzso of zzso zzso a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso levels when presented to either the zzso or the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso applied to the zzso side zzso significantly higher zzso levels zzso zzso zzso than the same dose applied zzso zzso cells grown on permeable supports exhibit a polarity of functional responses following zzso by zzso These data support a zzso separation of the multiple zzso signaling systems in a zzso zzso cell zzso
