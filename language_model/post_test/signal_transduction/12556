During zzso recognition by T cells, signaling molecules on the T cell engage zzso on the zzso cell and organize into zzso distinctive zzso These are collectively known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships between large-scale spatial organization and signal zzso have previously been zzso Although it is known that zzso transport during IS formation is driven by zzso zzso the mechanisms by which different proteins become zzso sorted remain zzso These sorting processes contribute a facet of signal zzso thus their zzso is important for ultimately understanding signal zzso through the T cell zzso Here we investigate protein cluster size as a sorting mechanism using the hybrid live T zzso membrane zzso The zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso either by direct zzso zzso or by zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso on the supported zzso In a mature zzso native zzso generally zzso into a peripheral ring surrounding a central T cell zzso zzso Higher degrees of zzso zzso induced by either method, result in progressively more central zzso with the most clustered species fully relocated to the central zzso These results demonstrate that cluster size directly influences protein spatial positioning in the T cell zzso We discuss a sorting zzso based on zzso zzso to the zzso zzso that is consistent with these observations and is, in principle, zzso to all cell surface proteins in the zzso
