Cancer stem cell zzso hypothesis provides us with a new approach to the understanding of zzso zzso and prevention zzso In recent years, the origin and biological characteristics of zzso were widely studied in solid zzso it is astonishing to find out the delicate zzso between zzso and committed zzso evolved from embryonic stem cells zzso during organ zzso In this review, we propose that some key molecular signal pathways during lung development are crucial for abnormal zzso and differentiation of lung cancer stem cell as well as try to elaborate the lung zzso from the point view of zzso
