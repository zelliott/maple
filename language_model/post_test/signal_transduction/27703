zzso culture surfaces were designed using zzso of zzso zzso and acrylic zzso These surfaces contained functional zzso and zzso groups, which allowed zzso to be grafted by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso type IV, and zzso zzso were investigated, as zzso zzso for their ability to stimulate cell attachment, zzso and function by signaling only from the zzso side of cultured zzso Surface analysis of zzso porous zzso showed zzso binding of zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso Multiple attachment to zzso and/or zzso groups served as zzso points that made the zzso zzso permanently adherent to the culture zzso zzso zzso techniques gave positive identification of grafted zzso zzso of zzso improved cell proliferation versus that on zzso controls, or controls grafted only with zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell attachment on zzso zzso Analysis of zzso resistance, fluid zzso and polarized zzso zzso activity indicated that simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso produced better polarized cell function than zzso controls, or controls grafted with only one type of zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not interfere with cells ability to zzso from zzso responsive surfaces upon temperature zzso
