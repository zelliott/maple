We explored the effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a seizure model of zzso Adult male Fischer 344 rats received continuous zzso infusion of EPO dissolved in saline containing zzso of rat serum zzso zzso zzso saline containing zzso of rat serum zzso or combined EPO and zzso Y zzso zzso zzso Animals were zzso evaluated for seizure development over zzso after zzso acid injection followed by zzso zzso zzso rate, seizure severity, zzso cell death and abnormal cell proliferation in the zzso of zzso zzso rats were significantly zzso compared to control zzso zzso zzso in zzso animals worsened zzso and zzso zzso cell death, while zzso zzso zzso zzso the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso EPO might zzso seizure severity and protect the zzso zzso in zzso rats, via novel zzso pathways involving blockade of zzso cell formation coupled with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso
