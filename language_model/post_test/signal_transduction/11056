zzso II zzso zzso is a powerful zzso of adverse cardiac zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso remain to be zzso We zzso that zzso II alters transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso specifically that of zzso and thereby zzso cardiac zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso were conducted using zzso from adult Sprague zzso rats to determine the expression of zzso receptors including zzso and the role of zzso II type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso The functional role of zzso in modulating zzso II effects on zzso zzso zzso and type I collagen expression was also zzso zzso gene and protein expression were consistently identified in zzso zzso zzso II increased the expression of zzso zzso and protein in a concentration and zzso manner, with no effect on zzso receptors I and II zzso This effect was zzso zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in zzso protein expression and increase in type I collagen protein expression were both blocked by a specific zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is zzso in zzso by zzso II via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into zzso zzso cardiac zzso
