In two earlier papers, means were provided to decide the capacity of complex chemical reaction networks, taken with zzso zzso to admit multiple zzso in the context of the zzso homogeneous continuous flow stirred tank reactor zzso In such a reactor, all species are deemed to be in the zzso a fact which has an important bearing on the nature of the governing zzso In contrast, one can imagine zzso models of the cell in which certain large molecules zzso zzso remain zzso within the cell, whereas smaller ones zzso zzso are free to diffuse through the cell zzso Although such models bear a strong physical resemblance to the classical zzso picture, there are substantive differences in the corresponding zzso Without a presumption of zzso zzso this research is intended to indicate a general way in which results about uniqueness of zzso in the classical zzso context extend to zzso species zzso
