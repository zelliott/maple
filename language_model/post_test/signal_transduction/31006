In zzso ventilation is peripherally controlled by the carotid body zzso which receives zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso located along the zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso give rise to the zzso zzso zzso via a zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso believed to be responsible for CB zzso zzso via NO zzso Although NO is elevated during natural CB stimulation by zzso the underlying mechanisms are zzso We hypothesized that zzso released by rat CB zzso zzso 1 zzso and/or red blood cells during zzso may directly activate zzso zzso and contribute to zzso zzso Using combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques, we detected the expression of multiple zzso receptors in zzso zzso These receptors involve at least four different zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using a novel zzso preparation of CB type I cell clusters and zzso zzso we tested the role of zzso signaling on CB zzso In zzso fast application of zzso or its synthetic analog zzso zzso caused type I cell zzso that was prevented in the presence of the NO scavenger zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso released during hypoxic stress from CB zzso zzso red blood zzso will cause zzso zzso zzso zzso by multiple zzso zzso zzso of this zzso will lead to calcium influx and zzso zzso of CB zzso via NO synthesis and zzso zzso
