Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since protein zzso C zzso is known to play an important role in the regulation of zzso growth and zzso the objective of this study was to determine the role of the zzso signaling zzso as a zzso of strain zzso of the zzso zzso In particular, we tested the following specific zzso zzso zzso strain stimulates zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso strain activates zzso in an zzso manner, and zzso zzso mediates the strain activated zzso and zzso response in cultured human zzso To test these zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso strain zzso average zzso followed by measurement of zzso activity, zzso zzso distribution by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso and examination of the effect of zzso zzso zzso C and zzso on strain induced zzso and zzso zzso We observed stimulation of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso of zzso from the zzso to the membrane fraction in zzso subjected to acute zzso zzso zzso strain also caused zzso of zzso alpha and zzso but not zzso zzso from the zzso to the membrane fraction as demonstrated by both Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso beta was not detected in these zzso zzso zzso zzso C (10 zzso and zzso (5 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not block the effects of strain on cellular zzso or zzso We conclude that these data support our hypothesis that zzso strain stimulates zzso activity and zzso in an zzso manner in cultured human zzso Moreover, our studies with zzso zzso support the hypothesis that zzso changes in the zzso zzso may be selectively modulated by zzso
