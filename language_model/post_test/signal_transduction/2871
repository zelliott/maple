Although the signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and release of zzso zzso zzso is an important mechanism for regulation of zzso calcium zzso the effect of cerebral zzso on this calcium signaling zzso is not well zzso Because activity of this zzso is dependent on availability of zzso this study is aimed at examining the zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso in a rat stroke zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso in rats was induced by temporary zzso of the right middle cerebral artery and both common carotid zzso zzso of zzso were determined by use of the zzso binding zzso zzso turnover in rat zzso was assessed with an in zzso protocol involving zzso injection of zzso zzso and systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso 

zzso induced an increase in zzso turnover in the right middle cerebral artery cortex, but zzso led to a decline in this signaling zzso However, zzso levels decreased during zzso and these levels were not restored if zzso insults were longer than 30 zzso zzso levels decreased to zzso of control during zzso and recovered to zzso of control during the initial 4 hours of zzso these changes were followed by a second phase of zzso 

zzso show an important relationship between zzso depletion of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso However, the zzso between zzso and zzso during zzso after severe zzso suggests that metabolism of zzso is more zzso regulated than zzso
