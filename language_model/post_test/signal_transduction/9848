The zzso containing zzso factor zzso is a key regulator of embryonic development and has been implicated to have a role in breast and pancreatic zzso 

Using a selection of two- and three-dimensional in zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso the clinical and functional relevance of zzso in zzso melanoma was zzso A zzso zzso system was applied to study the relevance of zzso in zzso For zzso construction, zzso material from 218 melanoma patients was zzso 

zzso expression of zzso resulted in the induction of zzso and reduced the invasive capacity of melanoma cells in three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso was shown to affect several zzso pathways associated with cell invasion and zzso zzso of zzso induction of zzso and zzso of both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso expression was found to correlate significantly with increased recurrence-free survival zzso Nuclear expression of zzso did not result in significant survival zzso suggesting that the beneficial effect of zzso may be independent of its DNA binding zzso 

zzso may be an important regulator of melanoma cell invasion and zzso zzso expression of the protein was identified as zzso for good prognosis in zzso melanoma zzso
