The zzso zinc finger zzso factor zzso gene encodes a family of proteins generated through alternative zzso involved in the regulation of cancer development and zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso gene results in the production of at least four alternatively spliced zzso two of which are extensively discussed in this zzso The full length form of the zzso gene is a tumor zzso gene that is frequently zzso by loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or decreased expression in human zzso While the exact mechanisms underlying zzso tumor zzso roles are not completely known, a number of highly relevant, overlapping pathways have been zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso manner, reduction of zzso zzso complexes via interaction with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activities, decreased zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso factor 6 zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene that is specifically zzso in a number of human zzso Increased zzso expression is associated with poor prognosis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso has been shown to be biologically active, zzso the tumor zzso function of zzso and promoting tumor growth and dissemination in both zzso and prostate cancer zzso In addition, a common zzso zzso in the zzso gene associated with increased prostate cancer risk in a large zzso study of zzso men results in increased expression of zzso Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that targeted reduction of zzso results in the induction of spontaneous zzso in cell culture, zzso with zzso agents like zzso and results in significant tumor zzso in zzso zzso these data make the zzso gene family a compelling therapeutic target for both the treatment of localized as well as zzso zzso
