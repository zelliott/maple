zzso signals from the zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways are well established to zzso translation zzso Less is known regarding the molecular basis of protein synthesis regulated by other zzso such as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso that becomes zzso at several zzso zzso upon zzso zzso but the exact molecular mechanisms regulating its zzso and the function of zzso zzso is poorly zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by serum, growth factors, tumor promoting zzso zzso and zzso Ras is required for zzso zzso downstream of the zzso signaling zzso We demonstrate that while zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso at all sites, zzso exclusively zzso zzso at zzso in zzso and in zzso using an zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso reveals that zzso of these sites promotes its recruitment to the zzso cap complex, suggesting that zzso signaling regulates assembly of the translation zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso provides an zzso zzso linking the zzso signaling cascade to the zzso zzso
