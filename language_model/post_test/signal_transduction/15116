DNA zzso like zzso zzso or human zzso zzso have adopted various strategies to interfere with zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso A promoter zzso zzso was crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced specific binding activity at this zzso which was identified as upstream zzso zzso In conclusion, these results unravel a novel mechanism of how the zzso zzso zzso zzso a cellular inhibitor of zzso zzso
