zzso lupus zzso is an zzso disease of unknown zzso Lupus pathology is thought to reflect zzso damage due to a failure of B zzso zzso Since excessive B zzso factor belonging to the zzso family zzso expression zzso with human and zzso zzso and zzso signals B cell survival through zzso it is believed that excessive zzso signaling can zzso B cell tolerance and facilitate lupus zzso Here we report the unexpected finding that zzso zzso mice develop a zzso zzso These mice carry the B cell maturation zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso causes premature B cell death and profound B cell zzso Despite having zzso fewer zzso B cells than normal mice, zzso mice had an zzso increased frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and increased amounts of circulating zzso and zzso to zzso by 9 months of zzso By age 11 months, most zzso mice displayed zzso pathology characteristic of zzso including zzso as well as periodic zzso deposits and zzso zzso bed zzso zzso we genetically linked this zzso to zzso since zzso zzso mice carrying a zzso zzso developed none of these zzso Our data provide the first evidence linking altered zzso signaling to the development of B zzso zzso
