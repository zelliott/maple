The adherence of zzso cells to zzso zzso is believed to be a necessary step in their migration to sites of zzso It has been proposed that this process occurs when cell surface molecules on zzso cells bind to complementary sites on zzso zzso The expression of these zzso cell zzso molecules appears to be modulated by zzso a broad class of protein zzso which play important roles in immune and inflammatory zzso It has been found by ourselves and others that exposure of zzso to some zzso zzso the zzso of inflammatory cells as well as zzso cells in in zzso zzso We used a zzso model consisting of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso and found that zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the number of zzso cells that attach in a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the change in binding was due to an increase in the expression of zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso agents zzso and zzso inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso We also studied the possible mechanisms of zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso We examined the involvement of protein zzso in the zzso zzso Although we found that zzso of zzso could inhibit the zzso effect, our studies suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is not completely responsible for signaling since zzso did not cause zzso of zzso to the cell membrane and its effect could not be completely zzso by zzso We also studied the effect of zzso on the binding of zzso cells to zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso led to the zzso of both zzso and zzso enhanced binding of zzso zzso zzso of zzso do not abolish zzso action, and zzso and zzso zzso elicit an opposite zzso However, zzso zzso of both zzso binding and zzso zzso binding to zzso is completely abolished in the presence of the protein zzso inhibitor zzso acid suggesting that zzso elicits its effect by stimulating protein zzso zzso
