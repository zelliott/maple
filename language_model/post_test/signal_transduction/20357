zzso signaling is essential to the regulation of cell zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso is implicated in human zzso diseases, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso has not been fully zzso In the present study, we show zzso signaling to be highly activated in a rat model of liver zzso induced by carbon zzso zzso as indicated by increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso by a zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated liver zzso and decreased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in association with the enhanced expression of zzso The study in zzso revealed that zzso treatment could suppress the zzso process of rat zzso zzso cell line zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment was found not to affect zzso proliferation in zzso In contrast, zzso can inhibit zzso zzso to some zzso Our study provides the first evidence that zzso signaling is implicated in zzso zzso and zzso treatment has a protective effect on zzso and ameliorates liver zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of zzso signaling might present a novel therapeutic approach for zzso zzso
