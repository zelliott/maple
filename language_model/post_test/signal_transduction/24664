zzso zzso zzso are zzso restricted zzso zzso and consist of eight zzso including zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of these compounds for zzso zzso receptors zzso were studied by examining their effects on the signal zzso of representative zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the individual cloned zzso zzso Two extended zzso of zzso zzso and zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The rank order of zzso of these compounds was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were effective in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was a potent zzso for zzso with an zzso value of 3 zzso zzso M, which was more than an order of potency greater than that of zzso zzso zzso evoked an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso production characteristic of zzso with a potency comparable to zzso zzso In contrast to the above compounds, the other zzso zzso showed no appreciable effects on the signal zzso involved in the three zzso zzso zzso This investigation demonstrates not only the importance of a particular zzso structure of zzso in the interaction with the zzso but also a clear zzso zzso specificity for the zzso interaction, and indicates that the zzso zzso would serve as useful zzso for investigation of functions of the zzso zzso
