The purpose of the experiments described in these studies was to determine the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso B and T cells are known to share many of the same zzso pathways for cell zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and human T cells and produces an increase in zzso zzso in resting zzso The results of the present studies demonstrate that zzso increases zzso in resting B cells and zzso B cell zzso produced by zzso zzso as measured by zzso of free zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response of B cells to zzso zzso was suppressed only when cells were zzso to zzso In contrast, zzso pathways of zzso zzso were insensitive to zzso by zzso even when cells were zzso The induction of Class II zzso zzso zzso zzso on B cells by zzso was also found to be insensitive to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso suppresses only zzso pathways of B cell zzso and indicate that altered zzso zzso may be responsible for zzso induced by this zzso
