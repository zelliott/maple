zzso zzso is an zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso with preferential zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso from zzso by zzso activity, and the effect of zzso on zzso synthesis was therefore zzso First, it was confirmed that zzso does not directly inhibit zzso zzso Second, the specific decline of serum zzso and zzso levels in zzso female rats by zzso in comparison with zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso zzso at doses zzso significantly suppressed serum zzso testosterone, zzso and zzso levels, and increased zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso at a dose of zzso suppressed serum zzso zzso to a similar degree as zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso pathway, serum zzso zzso and zzso levels did not change significantly following administration of zzso of zzso Third, the effect of multiple oral administration of zzso on serum zzso levels in regularly cycling female zzso monkeys was zzso zzso at zzso zzso twice daily zzso continued to suppress the zzso surge prior to the start of zzso phase for zzso the average duration of three zzso zzso zzso cycles, while serum zzso was maintained at levels almost equal to those in the zzso phase although a certain portion of this increased level of zzso could be of zzso This zzso effect on zzso surge was thought to be zzso since serum zzso levels started to rise immediately after the zzso of zzso zzso surge was not zzso by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso can suppress serum zzso zzso in zzso female rats and monkeys through selective zzso of zzso activity, suggesting that zzso might be effective for zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso
