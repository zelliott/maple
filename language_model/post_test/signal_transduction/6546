We have examined the respective contribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins in the establishment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso From the analysis of zzso clones of zzso in the wing zzso disc, we find that lack of zzso zzso zzso causes a dramatic reduction of both zzso and zzso zzso in receiving zzso Our studies, together with others zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso distribution and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Cell (in zzso reveals that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with both negative and positive roles in zzso zzso and long-range zzso zzso In addition, analyses of the two zzso proteins indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso in addition to zzso the zzso zzso the slope of the zzso zzso by regulating the amount of zzso zzso Taken together, our analysis illustrates how the coordinated activities of zzso and zzso shape the zzso zzso zzso
