Exposure to naturally occurring hydrocarbon oils is associated with the development of chronic inflammation and a wide spectrum of pathological findings in humans and animal zzso The mechanism underlying the unremitting inflammatory response to zzso remains largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso is a hydrocarbon that zzso elicits chronic zzso characterized by persistent zzso of zzso and zzso In this study, we reveal the essential role of zzso in sustaining the chronic recruitment of zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling promote the migration of zzso to the zzso cavity in a zzso zzso This mechanism is at least partially dependent on the production of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, although chronic zzso of inflammatory zzso is dependent on a different zzso requiring zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso the zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are shared in regulating the recruitment of both zzso and zzso Taken together, our findings uncover an zzso mechanism of zzso recruitment in zzso zzso and illustrate the interactions of innate immune pathways in chronic zzso
