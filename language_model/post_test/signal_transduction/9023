The zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso in equilibrium between at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Its zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso the calcium zzso Using a zzso zzso we have previously discovered an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that has the unique ability to discriminate among the two signaling zzso zzso is not affected while zzso signaling is significantly zzso A series of compounds have been prepared and studied in order to better understand the structural zzso of this zzso functional switch of a zzso Most of them display the same zzso profile, with smooth zzso One compound however exhibits significantly improved zzso properties of zzso induced signaling when compared to the original zzso
