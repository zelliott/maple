zzso is essential for efficient zzso immune zzso zzso has two zzso zzso required for binding of tumor necrosis factor zzso factors zzso The zzso site is within the membrane zzso zzso zzso region, while a zzso motif in the membrane zzso zzso zzso region needs to engage zzso To dissect zzso signals necessary for B cell zzso we generated transgenic mice expressing zzso and zzso human zzso zzso molecules in a mouse zzso zzso zzso The B zzso expression of zzso in zzso mice resulted in zzso zzso responses including zzso center zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules that carry either a point zzso of the zzso site or a deletion of the zzso region rescued zzso B cell differentiation but not zzso zzso A zzso zzso that comprises of only the zzso site in the zzso region also rescued low but significant zzso of zzso zzso without zzso zzso These results demonstrated that two distinct signals either from the zzso or from the zzso region induced the zzso B cell differentiation and zzso class zzso however, zzso formation required zzso We conclude that combinations of these two signals determine which of the zzso or the zzso zzso differentiation zzso B cells zzso
