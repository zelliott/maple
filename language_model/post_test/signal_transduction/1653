In zzso development, most zzso factors behave as zzso zzso divergent cell fates according to their zzso We ask how cells interpret zzso concentration as it changes during the establishment of a zzso Using zzso zzso cells of zzso exposed to zzso for only 10 minutes, we have followed the zzso of zzso zzso the principal zzso zzso from a zzso pool to the nucleus in real zzso We show that a changing concentration of zzso zzso is rapidly and continuously zzso to provide a corresponding nuclear concentration of zzso even though gene response may be delayed for several zzso Nuclear zzso concentration changes up as the zzso concentration of zzso zzso We conclude that cells interpret a changing zzso concentration by maintaining a continuous flow of activated zzso from a large zzso pool to the nucleus where it is zzso The volume of this flow determines the steady state concentration of zzso in the nucleus and this is used by cells to interpret zzso zzso zzso
