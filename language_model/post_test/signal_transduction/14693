The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling mediates zzso cell survival by many complex and redundant zzso This study compared the effects of zzso zzso on viability and zzso of two zzso cell lines, using three different methods for the impairment of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a decrease of cell survival and induced zzso in a manner depending on the approach used for the zzso zzso To find an explanation, we analyzed the effects of these treatments on three major zzso pathways evoked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso While in zzso cells zzso treatment decreased both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells the zzso zzso was only slightly affected and the zzso zzso drastically zzso Neither zzso nor zzso had any effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cell line, zzso treatment induced zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso coupled with the zzso of zzso In addition, the zzso proved to be the most potent zzso of zzso suggesting that more than one zzso zzso in zzso signaling should be inhibited to effectively induce zzso in lung cancer zzso
