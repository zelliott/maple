Male zzso knockout mice zzso an zzso zzso present with zzso zzso zzso that is zzso upon zzso zzso This study aims to zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso male zzso mice were treated with vehicle, zzso or zzso zzso via zzso injection, daily for 6 zzso Male zzso mice treated with zzso zzso had normal liver zzso and zzso contents compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fat pad weights were zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso treatment did not result in the similar reversal of these zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso transcript expression of fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso A zzso 1 zzso zzso in de zzso zzso zzso were significantly elevated compared with zzso zzso but only zzso expression was lowered to zzso level after zzso zzso zzso There were no significant changes in the transcript levels of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso for transfer of zzso zzso into the zzso for zzso and zzso regulatory zzso factor zzso (the upstream regulator of de zzso zzso zzso We also confirmed by zzso that only zzso is expressed in the mouse zzso There were no changes in zzso zzso zzso transcript level across all treatment zzso Our data suggest that zzso act via zzso to regulate zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Since the liver, zzso tissue and zzso nucleus express mainly zzso zzso could regulate zzso functions via peripheral and central zzso
