We previously reported that zzso gene expression in the zzso cell line zzso is zzso by zzso and that zzso acts zzso with zzso or protein zzso C on the zzso of the upstream zzso zzso Using the zzso inhibitor zzso D, we now show that zzso zzso expression requires de zzso zzso zzso synthesis and that zzso does not influence zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was inhibited by protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso which respectively, inhibit protein zzso A- and zzso signaling zzso Using specific zzso zzso zzso and antagonists, we show that zzso zzso zzso expression through engagement of zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso concentration as well as zzso calcium concentration via zzso and zzso zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter zzso a weak induction of the zzso reporter gene by zzso and zzso whereas zzso in zzso with zzso strongly activated the zzso zzso of a zzso responsive element at zzso partially abolished the response of the zzso zzso promoter to zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso
