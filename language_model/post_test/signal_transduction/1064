A long term objective of our research effort is to define factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of signal propagation by zzso zzso zzso zzso play a central role in cellular communication zzso the cell response to numerous hormones and zzso A major zzso of zzso specificity for zzso zzso is the cell specific expression of the zzso of the primary zzso entities, zzso G and zzso zzso Another major site for regulating zzso specificity lies at the zzso or zzso interface where these interactions are influenced by cell architecture, the zzso of zzso components and accessory proteins that may segregate the zzso to zzso of the cell, regulate the efficiency and/or specificity of signal transfer and/or influence the zzso state of zzso independent of a classical zzso coupled zzso One strategy to address these issues in our laboratory involves the identification of cellular proteins that regulate the transfer of signal from zzso to G or directly influence the zzso state of G independent of a classical zzso coupled zzso We identified three zzso zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso of zzso zzso that activated zzso zzso zzso pathways in the absence of a typical zzso zzso 2 and 3 interact with different zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso selectively activate different zzso provide unexpected mechanisms for regulation of the zzso zzso cycle and have opened up a new area of research related to the cellular role of zzso as signal zzso
