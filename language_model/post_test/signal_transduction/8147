Plant zzso play important roles in zzso between plants and insects, but their role in communication among plants remains zzso Previous research on zzso communication has focused on interactions between zzso plants, largely overlooking the possibility that zzso function as signals within zzso Here, we show that zzso released by zzso leaves of hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prime zzso in adjacent leaves with little or no vascular connection to the wounded zzso Undamaged leaves exposed to zzso from wounded leaves on the same stem had elevated defensive responses to feeding by gypsy zzso larvae zzso zzso zzso compared with leaves that did not receive zzso zzso signals may facilitate systemic responses to localized zzso even when the transmission of internal signals is constrained by vascular zzso zzso via zzso is consistent with the short distances over which plant response to airborne cues has been observed to occur and has apparent benefits for emitting plants, suggesting that zzso zzso may have equal or greater ecological significance than zzso between zzso
