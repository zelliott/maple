During the evolution of zzso organisms, survival in an zzso environment came about by zzso responses, both to the zzso zzso metabolism within the cells of the zzso as well as the chemicals and low-level radiation to which they are zzso In addition to defense mechanisms shared with zzso organisms, zzso organisms are equipped with gap junctions which allow zzso and/or zzso synchronization of processes between coupled zzso The zzso zzso which code for the proteins zzso the gap zzso provide zzso regulation of cell zzso zzso and zzso responses of individual cells through a mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological consequences of the response of a zzso zzso to low-level radiation exceeding the background level of zzso damage to a cell in a tissue could be zzso cell zzso or cell zzso
