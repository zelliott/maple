zzso bacteria have been shown to zzso immune responses and could have therapeutic effects in allergic and inflammatory zzso However, the signaling pathways engaged by zzso are poorly zzso We have previously reported that a zzso product from zzso zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso high zzso production and prolonged survival of zzso via a zzso zzso We therefore studied the roles of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways on biological functions of human zzso zzso treated with zzso 

zzso were differentiated from human zzso with zzso and zzso for 5 days and cultured with zzso zzso zzso or zzso with or without specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that 1) the zzso zzso was positively involved in the prolonged DC survival induced by zzso zzso and zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso which zzso regulated DC zzso 2) zzso and zzso were positively involved in DC zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso which zzso regulated DC zzso 3) zzso and zzso were positively involved in zzso production, in contrast to zzso that was positively involved in zzso production whereas zzso was positively involved in zzso 4) zzso induced a zzso zzso similar to zzso and a zzso zzso similar to zzso 

We report for the first time that a zzso product of a zzso can zzso activate zzso zzso and zzso in order to zzso DC biological zzso These results give new insights on the fine-tuned balance between the maintenance of normal zzso zzso to zzso and zzso bacteria and the specific inflammatory immune responses to pathogen zzso
