zzso plays an important role in lung zzso and is also involved in maintaining innate immunity within the zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria is known to elicit acute zzso responses in lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, among zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that the clinically used, natural zzso product zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso from zzso human zzso zzso Here we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso of nuclear zzso a key regulatory zzso factor involved in zzso production, by preventing zzso of zzso and its subsequent zzso zzso is zzso by specific zzso zzso before zzso zzso inhibited activity of both alpha and beta zzso of zzso thereby delaying the zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso is zzso in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso in zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity induced by zzso Data are the first to show that zzso may regulate lung zzso in part by zzso zzso zzso production through reduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
