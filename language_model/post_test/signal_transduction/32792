zzso zzso species export zzso proteins via a type III machinery to escape their zzso killing during animal zzso Here, we reveal the type III export mechanism of zzso In the presence of zzso when type III zzso was zzso zzso zzso was not zzso The signal of zzso sufficient for the zzso of zzso fused reporter proteins was contained within the first 10 zzso of its open reading zzso Some zzso zzso that completely altered the zzso sequence specified by this signal did not impair zzso of the reporter zzso zzso the upstream untranslated zzso leader of zzso for that of zzso coli zzso also did not affect zzso However, removal of the first 15 zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso could be zzso after the zzso had been zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to be exported by a mechanism that couples zzso zzso translation with the type III zzso of the zzso zzso
