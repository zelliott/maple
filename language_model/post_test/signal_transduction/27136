zzso hormone zzso regulates calcium metabolism through a specific G zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso also binds and is activated by zzso protein zzso The human zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso with an apparent molecular weight of approximately zzso which contains four putative zzso zzso To zzso the functional role of zzso zzso if any, we studied hormone binding and signal zzso in human embryonic kidney cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso These cells zzso express zzso receptors per zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso concentration of zzso yielded completely zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso This zzso form is fully zzso it maintains zzso binding affinity for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso zzso and increases in zzso calcium zzso In addition, the highly potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso specifically to the zzso zzso The molecular weight zzso zzso of the band representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment with zzso Our findings indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso is not essential for its effective expression on the plasma membrane or for the binding of zzso known to interact with the native zzso The zzso zzso zzso remains fully functional with regard to both of its known signal zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso
