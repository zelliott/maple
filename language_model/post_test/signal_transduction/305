Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 is a zzso zzso factor with important functions in zzso signaling in a variety of zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso zzso is not well zzso We demonstrate that development of zzso inflammation is associated with the induction of zzso activity in zzso zzso cells zzso Studies in genetically engineered mice showed that zzso zzso zzso in zzso sodium zzso colitis is dependent on zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout mice with an zzso deletion of zzso activity were highly susceptible to experimental zzso indicating that zzso zzso regulates gut zzso zzso mice, upon induction of zzso showed a striking zzso of zzso zzso Gene chip analysis indicated that zzso regulates the cellular stress response, zzso and pathways associated with wound healing in zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso were found to be important in zzso experiments in zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates immune zzso in the gut by promoting zzso zzso wound zzso
