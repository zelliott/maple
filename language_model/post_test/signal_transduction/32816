Most of the information on the structure and function of the tight junction zzso has been obtained in zzso zzso zzso we have zzso zzso in this cell type, because this protein is involved in the response of the zzso to changes in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso cells comprises zzso zzso with a predicted open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso This sequence is 92 and zzso zzso to human and mouse zzso zzso Two nuclear sorting signals located at the zzso and zzso zzso and 17 zzso putative binding sites at the zzso domain were zzso We found two new zzso regions at the zzso zzso beta had not been reported in human and mouse counterparts, and zzso which was previously zzso in human and mouse zzso is now identified as a zzso zzso The expression of different beta and gamma zzso varies according to the tissue zzso With the information provided by the zzso Southern zzso and zzso experiments we can predict a single zzso copy of zzso that is at least zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso Its expression is regulated by zzso while the expression of zzso protein is zzso
