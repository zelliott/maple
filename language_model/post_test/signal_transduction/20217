In many zzso zzso sensing zzso zzso linear peptides that engage zzso receptors to coordinate gene expression among members of a local zzso zzso zzso employs the zzso peptides zzso and zzso to stimulate production of zzso zzso and to induce development of competence for genetic zzso Recent progress in the field reveals that these pathways not only monitor the presence of signal zzso but also sense environmental zzso Both kinds of information are integrated by regulatory networks that then generate multiple zzso even among parallel cells growing in identical zzso In this issue of zzso zzso Son and co-workers investigate how two medium types shape cellular responses to zzso and zzso zzso in individuals across a zzso Their findings characterize restrictive properties of media differing in zzso zzso content and reveal unusual zzso properties that contribute to zzso responses of gene zzso
