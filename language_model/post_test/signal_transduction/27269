The molecular basis of the zzso effect of ammonium zzso on signal zzso involved in zzso zzso was studied in resident zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso cell line, zzso A fourfold zzso in zzso free calcium levels was observed within 10 s following zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso controls both in zzso and in zzso the levels returned to zzso values within 70 zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso did not result in any appreciable change in zzso free calcium zzso Compared to zzso controls, treatment with zzso caused a significant zzso in zzso zzso calcium zzso Such zzso was not enhanced further by zzso zzso stimulation of zzso also resulted in a significant zzso of zzso protein zzso C zzso activity, which was, however, inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso Exposure to zzso also resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment at lower levels did not cause zzso indicating that zzso at these levels zzso with the zzso events rather than the zzso zzso zzso at higher exposure levels inhibited the activity even in zzso zzso No significant difference occurred in zzso zzso activities in control zzso zzso treatment at lower levels resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso activities following stimulation with zzso or zzso indicating that zzso might be interfering with the zzso zzso
