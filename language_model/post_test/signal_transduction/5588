zzso regulation of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is essential for cells to survive zzso zzso Here, we show that the two sensing mechanisms upstream of zzso display different signaling zzso The zzso branch is an zzso zzso system, whereas the zzso branch shows high zzso signaling that is restricted by a zzso feedback zzso A two-dimensional mathematical model of the zzso branch, including high zzso signaling and a zzso negative feedback, shows that a system with zzso signaling exhibits higher efficiency, with faster response times and higher sensitivity to variations in external signals, than would systems without zzso zzso Analysis of two other zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso signaling zzso indicates that high intrinsic zzso signaling may be a general property of zzso pathways allowing rapid and sensitive responses to environmental zzso
