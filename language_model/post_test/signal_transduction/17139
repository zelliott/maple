zzso inner ear development is characterized by the zzso of zzso onto zzso zzso that zzso from sensory zzso zzso The stereotypical formation of these sensory structures is dependent on the expression of key patterning genes and on zzso zzso One potential target of zzso signaling in the inner ear is the type II zzso protein zzso zzso which is zzso activated in hair cells, with intense zzso at the base of zzso In zzso zzso is zzso by seven zzso the expression of one of these genes zzso is enriched in hair zzso The suppression of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso by the pharmacological zzso zzso results in zzso zzso formation without preventing zzso zzso In fact, zzso suppression results in additional zzso hair cells and altered levels of zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are increased and zzso protein accumulates in hair cells of zzso zzso indicative of defective recycling and/or zzso Our findings indicate that zzso plays a critical role in the developing ear, influencing cell differentiation through zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in older zzso suggests continued roles in auditory sensory maturation and zzso
