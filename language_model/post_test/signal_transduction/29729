The zzso zzso zzso is known to mediate toxic responses to zzso zzso zzso and related compounds and has been extensively characterized from a zzso zzso However, it has recently been reported that the zzso may have a central role in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso during zzso zzso we analyzed the expression of zzso its nuclear partner zzso nuclear zzso and the major target gene zzso in bovine zzso complexes zzso by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso was observed in both zzso and surrounding zzso cells before and after in zzso maturation zzso Furthermore, after zzso both cell types showed a clear zzso of zzso zzso compared with the expression at 0 zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was observed in immature zzso at the background level, whereas no expression was observed in the surrounding zzso zzso Interestingly, a significant increase in zzso expression level was observed in both zzso and zzso cells after zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were treated throughout zzso with the zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso Both zzso decreased the level of zzso in zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was accompanied by a reduced ability of zzso to complete in zzso maturation until zzso II zzso These results suggest that zzso induction in zzso is necessary for correct proceeding of in zzso zzso maturation in bovine and suggest a zzso role of zzso during resumption of zzso
