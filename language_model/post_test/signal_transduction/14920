The signaling zzso Sonic zzso zzso plays a critical role in patterning the zzso zzso of zzso Our recent studies have established that the requirement for zzso zzso signaling in the chick zzso is modulated zzso and temporally in a complex manner across the zzso zzso Unfortunately, the patterns of expression of downstream regulators that might zzso the zzso signal in the zzso are not currently zzso To fill this zzso we have examined across time, the expression pattern of 14 genes that function in the zzso signaling cascade in the zzso and spinal zzso Our results suggest that zzso expression in the zzso zzso begins before the expression of known zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso genes are expressed and then eliminated very early from the zzso zzso However, they exhibit high and persistent expression in the zzso region zzso the zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Finally, we report for the first time that zzso is expressed in intermediate regions of the spinal cord, where its expression does not overlap with that of zzso
