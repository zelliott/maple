zzso intolerance seen in zzso disorders, such as type II diabetes, is commonly associated with improper execution of the insulin signaling pathway, as well as an imbalance of bone and fat zzso such that a gain in zzso tissue occurs at the expense of bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stem from a common zzso zzso zzso zzso positively regulates the commitment of the zzso cell toward zzso but its effects on energy zzso and the insulin signaling zzso are zzso To investigate the connection, focused zzso profiling of genes associated with the insulin signaling zzso was performed on zzso cells from zzso embryonic mice and zzso zzso treated with control and zzso zzso The zzso showed that addition of insulin resulted in a robust induction of genes zzso in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso cells cultured in control media were at an elevated state of energy metabolism and addition of insulin resulted in a marked suppression of genes required for insulin zzso zzso analysis revealed that the suppression occurred at all stages of the insulin pathway, from the receptors and zzso to nuclear zzso and target zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso is central for zzso and execution of the insulin regulatory zzso In conclusion, zzso actively regulates the gene network required for zzso metabolism and energy zzso in zzso zzso
