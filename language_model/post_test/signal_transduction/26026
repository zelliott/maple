Signaling zzso by the zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso is crucial in normal development, and zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in a wide variety of zzso Here we find that the zzso and zzso interactions between zzso and its zzso activate different signaling zzso While zzso zzso binding is sufficient for zzso of most zzso signaling zzso zzso binding is required for the zzso of the Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso As the zzso proteins are involved in many cellular responses including zzso migration and zzso these results assign a function to zzso interactions that has been omitted from zzso models of zzso zzso The existence of receptors with distinct signaling properties provides a way for zzso to respond to different zzso of the same zzso in zzso different zzso
