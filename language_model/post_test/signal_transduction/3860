The correlation between the zzso zzso concentration zzso and membrane potential in zzso of zzso normal rat kidney zzso zzso was zzso Using the fluorescent probe zzso spontaneous repetitive zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso were observed that were zzso throughout the entire zzso zzso spikes disappeared in zzso solutions and could be blocked by the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and membrane potential showed that these zzso spikes were paralleled by zzso of the plasma zzso Using patch clamp zzso action zzso zzso consisting of a fast spike zzso followed by a plateau phase were seen with similar zzso as the zzso zzso The action zzso could be blocked by zzso zzso channel zzso and were dependent on zzso zzso The plateau phase was predominantly determined by a zzso zzso and was dependent on zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso cells was confirmed by patch clamp zzso in single zzso It is concluded that zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibit spontaneous zzso action zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso This zzso of zzso of zzso may represent a novel zzso signaling zzso in zzso coupled zzso cells that were zzso considered to be zzso
