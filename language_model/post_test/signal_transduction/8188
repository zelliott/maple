zzso is an zzso zzso that regulates transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue growth factor zzso is recognized as a potent downstream zzso of the zzso effects of zzso zzso binding sites have been identified in both zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression and its role in the regulation of zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso cells is zzso 

Human model of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso was used and confirmed using a diabetic rat zzso zzso was performed to measure zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was performed to measure active zzso zzso or zzso was silenced in zzso cells using zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso in a zzso manner, zzso at 30 zzso zzso but sustained up to 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso which was zzso at 24 zzso zzso This was supported by our in zzso data demonstrating that zzso protein significantly increased while zzso zzso level was reduced in a diabetic rat zzso The zzso expression level of zzso decreased in zzso silenced cells compared to cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression level of zzso increased in zzso silenced cells zzso which was increased by zzso zzso Both zzso and protein levels of zzso decreased in zzso silenced cells zzso and zzso zzso accompanied by reduction in zzso zzso level in zzso silenced zzso 

zzso is induced rapidly by zzso limiting the response to zzso zzso likely plays a key role in promoting zzso activity by decreasing the availability of zzso and increasing zzso
