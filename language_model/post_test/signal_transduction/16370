zzso zzso genes zzso zzso factors that repress organizer genes and are essential for zzso zzso during early zzso in zzso In contrast to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso members, including zzso have been proposed as indirect targets of Bone zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is a critical downstream zzso of, and tightly regulated by, zzso zzso we hypothesized that its promoter contains a direct zzso response element to effect this zzso zzso We demonstrate that direct regulation by zzso is necessary for zzso of zzso its zzso promoter contains zzso binding elements for zzso and zzso crucial to induction in response to zzso zzso In addition to these direct zzso zzso responsive zzso an indirect zzso response element and several repressive elements exist in the zzso promoter to regulate its zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation during early zzso development as both the direct target of zzso signaling and as the direct and indirect target of positive and negative regulatory zzso
