zzso the male partner in the reproduction of flowering plants, comprises either two or three cells at zzso The current knowledge of the zzso zzso is limited to the model plant systems zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have zzso zzso grains at zzso Comparative studies on zzso of other zzso particularly crop plants, are needed to understand the zzso gene networks that are subject to functional and evolutionary zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso zzso to perform zzso profiling on mature zzso soybean zzso 

Compared to the zzso zzso the soybean zzso zzso revealed a restricted and unique repertoire of zzso with a significantly greater proportion of specifically expressed genes than is found in the zzso zzso Comparative analysis shows that, among the zzso soybean transcripts addressed in this study, zzso transcripts zzso are expressed in zzso Of the zzso zzso about zzso zzso are also expressed in zzso zzso and 810 zzso are selectively expressed in zzso Overall, the soybean zzso zzso shows an enrichment of zzso factors zzso zinc finger family zzso signal recognition zzso zzso heat zzso proteins and members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first report of a soybean zzso zzso zzso These data extend our current knowledge regarding regulatory pathways that govern the gene regulation and development of zzso A comparison between zzso factors zzso in soybean and those in zzso revealed some divergence in the numbers and kinds of regulatory proteins expressed in both zzso
