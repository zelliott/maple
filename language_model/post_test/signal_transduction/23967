zzso zzso is an essential zzso protein that binds to and activates a diverse population of downstream targets zzso zzso zzso that carry out its critical zzso zzso In spite of the central importance of zzso in zzso signal zzso pathways in all zzso many zzso remain to be identified and zzso zzso followed by gel overlay with zzso metabolically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a valuable method for following zzso zzso forensic and zzso changes in total zzso populations and to identify candidate zzso for further zzso zzso has also been adapted to isolate zzso zzso novel zzso in various zzso Recently, the method was used to examine the zzso complement zzso by the zzso zzso and to identify a new family of zzso zzso To add to its diversity, zzso may be useful for finding target proteins for work on zzso and for the screening of pharmaceuticals and toxic agents that, directly or zzso affect zzso and its target zzso This review discusses all of these topics and the role of zzso in characterizing a functional unit of the zzso regulated by zzso
