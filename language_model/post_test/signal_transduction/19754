The expression profiles of the zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso have been previously shown to provide molecular signatures of normal breast cells, breast tumor cells and invasive breast zzso zzso In particular, the expression of zzso zzso is lost in invasive breast zzso cell line zzso The comparative zzso profiles of native and zzso zzso cells using difference gel zzso zzso and liquid zzso zzso of selected proteins are presented in this zzso The expression of more than 70 proteins was significantly altered in zzso zzso zzso These altered proteins are involved in zzso cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA replication and zzso Although the majority of these proteins have been implicated in zzso the impairment of energy zzso and altered regulation of signaling pathways appear to be noteworthy targets of zzso Based on the identities of altered proteins and the pathways regulated by these zzso this study suggests that the interactions of zzso with a wide variety of proteins lead to altered zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso
