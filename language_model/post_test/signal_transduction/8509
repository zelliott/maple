The human lung produces considerable amounts of zzso In the normal zzso zzso of both the airways and the zzso zzso release of zzso is readily detected both in cell cultures in zzso and in the zzso breath of zzso The dual zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family found in zzso zzso The zzso are prominently expressed at the zzso cell pole of zzso cells in the airways and in type II cells of the zzso Recent studies focused on the functional consequences of zzso release by zzso into the lung lining zzso In the zzso a major function of zzso is to support zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso and there are indications that the zzso defense system is critically dependent on the function of the zzso zzso channel, which provides both zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso (for pH zzso to the airway surface zzso Although zzso is also functional in the zzso zzso no comparable zzso zzso is present in the zzso and thus zzso zzso release by zzso cells may have other functions, such as cellular zzso
