Because traits zzso resistance on zzso can reduce zzso traits, zzso may occur between tolerance and resistance zzso We examined these zzso in zzso of zzso zzso that were transformed to silence zzso zzso inhibitor zzso production zzso an zzso defense associated with zzso reductions in seed production, and the zzso signal cascade that elicits these defenses zzso by measuring stalk and zzso branch growth and seed production after two zzso regimes and zzso zzso zzso attack to bottom or middle and top stalk zzso zzso attack and zzso at middle and top leaves depressed seed production and increased zzso branching more than at bottom zzso zzso and zzso plants produced significantly longer zzso to zzso branches than did zzso zzso plants, results that are consistent with zzso zzso between resistance and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso plants restored zzso branch growth, suggesting that zzso acid zzso zzso suppresses regrowth and contributes to zzso zzso These results are consistent with the existence of zzso and zzso zzso between regrowth and zzso resistance zzso
