The proposal that birds descended from zzso dinosaurs with digits 2, 3 and 4 was recently given support by short-term fate zzso suggesting that the chick wing polarizing zzso group that Sonic zzso zzso rise to zzso zzso Here we show using long-term fate maps that Green fluorescent zzso chick wing polarizing region zzso contribute only to soft zzso along the zzso margin of zzso 4, supporting fossil data that birds descended from zzso that had digits 1, 2 and zzso In contrast, zzso IV of the chick leg with four digits zzso arises from the polarizing zzso To determine how zzso identity is specified over time, we inhibited Sonic zzso zzso Fate maps show that polarizing region and adjacent cells are specified in parallel through a series of anterior to zzso zzso zzso process of zzso zzso that we suggest is involved in patterning all zzso limbs with more than three zzso
