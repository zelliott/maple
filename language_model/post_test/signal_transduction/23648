An increasing number of studies support the use of zzso a common zzso drug, as a novel zzso zzso However, its mechanism of action has yet to be zzso In the current study, zzso was observed to effectively inhibit the growth of the zzso zzso but not zzso tumors in zzso The zzso effects of zzso were zzso by the induction of zzso and zzso of proliferation in zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso in the zzso zzso tumors, zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, at lower zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso These observations indicate that tumors with zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly arrested zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells in zzso phase in zzso and zzso zzso two important downstream zzso of the Ras signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was concluded to function as a potential zzso agent that has potential for cancer zzso
