Many zzso species including pathogens exhibit zzso growth zzso as a means of zzso for zzso zzso screens were performed to identify genes required for zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso proteins with established functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell wall integrity zzso zzso and zzso and cell polarity zzso were identified as potential regulators of zzso The zzso factors zzso and zzso induced invasive growth by promoting zzso bipolar budding in zzso zzso zzso of the cell wall integrity zzso including the cell surface proteins zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso contributed to multiple aspects of the zzso response including cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso through the signaling zzso zzso and components of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contributed to cell wall integrity in parallel with the cell wall integrity zzso and in opposition with the high zzso zzso response zzso Mass zzso approaches identified components of the zzso cell wall including the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which occurs as part of the maturation of the zzso was inhibited by the zzso layer of the cell wall, which highlights a new regulatory aspect to cell wall zzso in this zzso zzso of zzso linkages induced zzso shedding and resulted in defects in zzso zzso and invasion of cells into the zzso zzso
