The zzso protein family controls diverse zzso processes through interaction with zzso consensus sequences in protein zzso Its zzso specific member, zzso also known as zzso is highly expressed in differentiated zzso and in zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso To define the role of zzso in skin zzso in zzso we generated transgenic mice zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso and hair zzso zzso animals show decreased zzso thickness and hair zzso density associated with reduced number of zzso zzso and decreased levels of zzso 14, 5, and zzso zzso zzso isolated from transgenic mice manifest reduced proliferation and zzso Moreover, zzso assessment and zzso analysis reveal a reduction in zzso zzso cell number in transgenic zzso Response to IGF-1 is strongly impaired in cultured transgenic zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all IGF-1 downstream zzso is zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso controls the in zzso zzso zzso switch by reducing zzso potential and forcing zzso to exit the cell cycle, and that this effect associates with zzso of the IGF-1 zzso
