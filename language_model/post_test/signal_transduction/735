zzso zzso play a central role in signal zzso pathways in zzso A highly zzso group of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso was shown to mediate many diverse stress zzso In plants, zzso were shown to function in resistance responses to many zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that exposure of zzso roots to hydrogen zzso or to zzso oxide resulted in rapid zzso of protein zzso in the shoots that exhibited zzso zzso The same pattern of zzso was induced by direct injection of these compounds into leaves, indicating accurate long-distance transmission of zzso and NO zzso These results are important for the understanding of zzso signal transmission from the zzso throughout the zzso
