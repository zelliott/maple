zzso zzso factor zzso zzso plays a role in human zzso We identified the zzso effect of zzso acid zzso against zzso zzso in zzso activated zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso active zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and Western zzso experiments were zzso The shift zzso showed that the binding of zzso complexes with its specific zzso sites was suppressed by zzso zzso analysis also showed that the binding of zzso to zzso was also disrupted by zzso Western zzso analysis showed a decreased level of zzso in nucleus caused by zzso zzso did not decrease zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso and its zzso mechanism is related to the decreased binding of zzso complexes to consensus zzso
