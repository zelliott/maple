The impaired function of zzso T cells is characteristic of zzso C virus zzso persistent zzso zzso core protein has been reported to inhibit zzso T cell zzso To determine the mechanism of the zzso core in suppressing zzso zzso T cell responses, we generated a transgenic zzso zzso mice, where the expression of core protein is directed to the liver using the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso to deliver zzso we demonstrated that zzso mice failed to clear zzso zzso infection in the zzso The zzso function of zzso zzso T cells was particularly impaired in the zzso of zzso mice, with suppression of zzso zzso and zzso B production by zzso T zzso In addition, the impaired zzso T cell responses in zzso mice were accompanied by the enhanced expression of the zzso zzso programmed zzso zzso by zzso zzso T cells and its zzso zzso on liver zzso cells following zzso zzso zzso blockade of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso blocking zzso in zzso mice enhanced zzso function of zzso T cells and cleared zzso as compared with that in mice treated with control zzso This suggests that the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zzso zzso impaired T cell responses and viral persistence in the zzso This also suggests that manipulation of the zzso zzso may be a potential zzso to enhance zzso T cell responses during persistent zzso zzso
