The appearance of blasts in acute zzso leukemia zzso reflects a shift from cellular processes inducing maturation and cell death to those zzso survival and zzso We have monitored changes in the growth factor zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso and in the cell death protein zzso during maturation of zzso and zzso zzso blasts in zzso zzso zzso samples were cultured for 7 d in zzso medium with or without a supplement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso as assessed by zzso on zzso slides of zzso samples and by changes in surface CD markers on all 18 zzso occurred in both the absence and presence of zzso Cell numbers decreased to a mean of zzso after 7 d of zzso culture, but increased to zzso in zzso zzso The proportion of zzso cells, assessed by flow zzso increased over 7 d in zzso samples, from a mean of zzso to zzso in zzso cultures and to zzso in zzso cultures zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso By zzso zzso there was no significant change in zzso over 7 d of culture, while zzso increased, particularly in zzso cultures zzso which led to a significant decrease in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was briefly zzso after seeding zzso blasts into zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso which activates zzso inhibited this transient zzso zzso but was unable to block maturation as measured by acquisition of zzso in samples from 12 patients with low starting numbers of zzso zzso zzso however, reduced cell numbers in zzso liquid culture and, in zzso cultures, this was associated with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data demonstrate that most zzso populations can partially differentiate in zzso without the need for zzso or zzso The zzso zzso is not required for this zzso but it does maintain cell viability in the absence or presence of zzso A rise in zzso may not protect zzso blasts in the face of elevated zzso
