The kidney can achieve a structural and functional recovery after the damage induced by zzso and zzso This is due to the zzso of zzso zzso cells, the intervention of immature cells mainly localized in the zzso and a small number of bone zzso stem zzso In many instances, however, recovery is delayed or does not occur at zzso The mechanisms allowing the zzso cells to zzso still need to be clarified in order to find a therapeutic approach that can amplify this ability and then stop the zzso zzso and the progression toward zzso zzso Several authors have hypothesized a protective effect of EPO against zzso and zzso zzso damage and observed that patients zzso treated with EPO showed a slower progression of zzso zzso EPO has been demonstrated to have zzso and zzso effects in zzso models in the brain and cell zzso Moreover, EPO can mobilize stem cells and increase the zzso levels and the zzso expression of zzso These effects seem to be zzso and could be due to the zzso of signal zzso systems, like zzso and zzso In the presence of high doses of zzso EPO or during the treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors may be activated through a zzso zzso Further investigations are needed to determine new therapeutic applications for EPO and other analogous zzso Very zzso molecules or molecules with zzso but no zzso effect may represent useful tools in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso action and may have a rapid and safe therapeutic zzso
