zzso receptors zzso are a large family of proteins involved in the recognition and discrimination of numerous zzso These receptors belong to the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso for which little structural data are zzso In this study we predict the binding site zzso of OR proteins by analyzing a set of zzso OR protein sequences from mouse and zzso The central insight zzso is that functional contact zzso would be zzso among pairs of zzso zzso but considerably less zzso among zzso zzso Using judiciously selected zzso of 218 zzso pairs and 518 zzso pairs, we have identified 22 sequence positions that are both highly zzso among the putative zzso and variable among zzso These zzso are disposed on zzso zzso 2 to 7, and on the second zzso loop of the zzso zzso although the prediction makes no assumption about the location of the binding site, these zzso acid positions are clustered around a pocket in a structural zzso model of zzso mostly facing the inner zzso We propose that the identified positions constitute the zzso binding zzso This conclusion is supported by the observation that all but one of the predicted binding site zzso zzso to zzso positions in other zzso zzso
