The mast cell is one of the major zzso cells in inflammatory reactions and can be found in most zzso throughout the zzso During zzso an increase in the number of mast cells in the local milieu occurs, and such zzso requires directed migration of this cell zzso As it has previously been reported that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of mast cells, we hypothesized that zzso could be a mast cell zzso The present study shows that zzso is a potent zzso factor for mast zzso The zzso response was zzso and zzso reaching an optimal concentration of 5 zzso In addition, zzso analysis showed that cell migration towards this zzso was zzso rather than zzso Moreover, zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso has at least two classes of zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso on mast zzso Furthermore, the competitive binding zzso suggested that zzso is unlikely to zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a functional zzso zzso for zzso and zzso migration, on mast zzso In addition, the treatment of cells with zzso toxin and zzso C zzso zzso inhibited zzso migration, indicating that zzso zzso mast cell zzso through a zzso zzso C zzso zzso These results show that besides its zzso activities, zzso may have the potential to recruit mast cells to inflammation zzso
