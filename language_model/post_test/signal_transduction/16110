zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that is naturally resistant to zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso modification by zzso or zzso zzso resistance to zzso in various zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso We characterized zzso zzso and double zzso to determine the specific role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso sensitivity during infection of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso were attenuated approximately 2 and zzso logs, respectively, in zzso In bone-marrow derived zzso the zzso demonstrated zzso growth defects and increased induction of zzso zzso responses that zzso from a zzso and the zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso Each of the in zzso zzso was rescued upon infection of zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso restored zzso zzso host cell death, and zzso zzso growth zzso This surprising observation suggests that zzso zzso can access the zzso zzso and act on zzso zzso zzso
