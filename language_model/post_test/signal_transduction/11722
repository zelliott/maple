Despite the recent progress in the description of the molecular mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation controls in zzso the regulation of the zzso of normal zzso zzso remains unclear in zzso Computer simulation represents a powerful tool to investigate the complex field of cell proliferation regulation zzso It provides huge zzso capabilities to test, in a dynamic in zzso context, hypotheses about the many pathways and feedback zzso involved in cell growth and proliferation zzso Our approach combines a model of cell proliferation and a spatial representation of cells in zzso using the zzso zzso The cell proliferation model includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso protein - zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso and differentiation factors, zzso The zzso graph associates a polygon with every cell and the set of these polygons defines the tissue zzso Thus, the model provides a quantitative model of zzso signals and cell zzso as a function of the neighborhood during time dependent zzso The zzso simulations illustrate the influence of the zzso on cell proliferation in zzso layers of zzso zzso and of differential adherence in zzso differentiation and related upward zzso Our results particularly show the role of zzso zzso zzso the protein zzso in the zzso dependent control zzso of the transition from the zzso to S phase of the cell zzso
