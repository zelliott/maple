zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso both the zzso and the migration of zzso is involved in the recruitment of cells into zzso undergoing inflammatory zzso To explore the regulation of zzso in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, zzso expression in lung zzso was zzso zzso human zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were incubated in the presence or absence of various inflammatory zzso Culture zzso were collected, and the soluble zzso levels were determined with an zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso transcripts in lung zzso was assessed using quantitative zzso real-time zzso chain zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso individually induced negligible soluble zzso zzso by human lung zzso after 24 zzso However, the combination of zzso and zzso induced dramatic increases in both soluble zzso protein and zzso transcripts in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein also was observed after treatment with zzso and zzso The zzso and expression of lung zzso zzso were markedly reduced by specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that lung zzso are an important cellular source of zzso and may play a role in pulmonary inflammation and zzso
