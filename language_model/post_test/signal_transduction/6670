zzso if not all, signal zzso at cell surface receptors in animal cells appears to occur by one of four basic mechanisms, 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso 3) zzso channel zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso The end effects of all four signal zzso systems are largely zzso by protein zzso zzso and/or zzso Thus, the only known high affinity zzso receptors for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso protein zzso and protein zzso C respectively, while zzso of zzso zzso systems causes zzso zzso of several different protein zzso zzso zzso although not all, effects of elevated zzso are also zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso tests of the involvement of any of these zzso in control of a zzso system can be made using zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A family of four protein zzso zzso account for zzso of all known zzso or nuclear zzso zzso by these protein zzso Two of these zzso and zzso have a broad zzso specificity and appear to be highly zzso during evolution, being present in both animal and plant zzso zzso is zzso inhibited by protein zzso and zzso while the marine toxin and zzso promoter, zzso acid, zzso zzso with extreme potency and zzso less zzso zzso acid provides a novel zzso probe for examining the role of protein zzso and zzso and zzso in particular, in any zzso zzso Recent examples of its use are zzso These approaches can provide initial evidence that a particular protein is regulated in response to an zzso signal by protein zzso Confirmation of this hypothesis may be obtained by showing that the precise zzso zzso by the protein zzso in a zzso system are also zzso in intact cells in response to the zzso zzso Sensitive methods are now available for the analysis of zzso sites by gas phase sequencing and Fast zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso of zzso sites also allows the development of synthetic zzso zzso for the various zzso zzso These methods will be illustrated using the author's own studies on zzso of zzso of zzso zzso
