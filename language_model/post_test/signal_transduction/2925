To assess the zzso role of zzso zzso in the changes of zzso red blood cell zzso properties zzso zzso and zzso we employed several types of chemicals that can increase and decrease of the zzso zzso zzso The rise of zzso influx, zzso by mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a moderate red cell zzso lowering and an increase of their zzso In contrast, zzso entry blocking into the red cells by zzso led to a significant zzso zzso decrease and zzso zzso Similar zzso changes were observed in the red blood cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso (10 zzso an zzso zzso was added to zzso suspension, the zzso zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso more significant zzso rise appeared after zzso incubation with zzso Red cell zzso was significantly decreased under these conditions zzso On the whole the total data clearly show that the red cell zzso and deformation changes were connected with an zzso of both zzso signaling zzso zzso regulatory mechanism and zzso zzso And the final red cell zzso regulatory effect is connected with the zzso between these zzso
