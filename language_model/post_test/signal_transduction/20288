zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent two important nutrients for zzso cells, consistent with the observations that zzso processes are associated with enhanced zzso and zzso zzso depletion and zzso depletion have been shown to trigger growth arrest and eventually cell zzso Solid tumors often zzso the blood supply, resulting in zzso which is associated with zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso and zzso mechanisms to zzso have been zzso how cells directly sense and respond to zzso and zzso zzso remains zzso Using zzso profiling techniques, we compared the gene expression profiles of acute zzso cells, zzso cells and cells adapted to zzso zzso Here we report the global changes of the gene expression in those cells cultured under the defined zzso zzso Analysis of zzso profiling data revealed that zzso and zzso depletion triggered dramatic gene expression zzso Either zzso or zzso deletion leads to changes of the expression of cell cycle zzso but these conditions have distinctive effects on zzso regulators and gene expression zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso depletion triggered distinguishable zzso zzso The gene expression patterns support that zzso and zzso have distinctive zzso roles in supporting cell survival and zzso and cells use different mechanisms to sense and respond to zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso profiling database provides a resource for further investigating the zzso mechanisms and potential effects of zzso and zzso abundance on the biological behaviors of zzso
