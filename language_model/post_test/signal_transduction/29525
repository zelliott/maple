Cancer cells are derived from their precursor cells, which normally develop to the matured cells to form individual zzso zzso one of the most common pediatric solid tumors, originates from possible cancer stem cells derived from the neural zzso During the development, neural crest cells segregate into several lineages such as zzso enteric and sympathetic zzso However, the genetic events to cause zzso occur only in the sympathetic precursor cells or cancer stem zzso Furthermore, spontaneous zzso of a subset of zzso found in patients under one year of age mimics a zzso programmed zzso cell death that occurs in normal sympathetic zzso during the zzso zzso Thus, the genetic events to cause zzso may be programmed to occur in a zzso as well as zzso regulated zzso In this review, we discuss about the molecular link between neural development and the genesis of zzso based on our comprehensive zzso zzso
