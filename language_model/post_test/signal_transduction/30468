zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso tumor of zzso Nearly zzso of children present with zzso disease, frequently involving the lungs and bone zzso The prognosis for patients with zzso zzso is zzso with an estimated zzso overall survival of zzso zzso derived factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that plays a crucial role in the zzso attraction of tumor cells expressing its zzso zzso We investigated the role of the bone zzso zzso on zzso signaling through the zzso zzso in cell lines and primary zzso zzso media zzso isolated from cultured zzso bone zzso zzso cells zzso induced migration and proliferation in multiple zzso cell zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cell lines and primary tumors, with higher expression in zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso was zzso by all zzso cultures and zzso induced the migration and proliferation of zzso zzso Small zzso or blocking zzso zzso of zzso or zzso suppressed zzso cell migration towards zzso confirming the activity of this zzso Our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of the bone zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso of zzso These results form the basis for future studies to delineate the mechanisms of bone zzso zzso in zzso
