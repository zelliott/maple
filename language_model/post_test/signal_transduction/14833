zzso zzso zzso zzso are control elements in zzso zzso which bind zzso to zzso zzso and regulate their ability to interact with signal zzso receptors on the cell zzso zzso and zzso are novel zzso zzso that act on internal zzso zzso modifications within zzso and thereby zzso zzso interactions with various signaling zzso including zzso zzso Emerging evidence indicates the importance of zzso zzso signaling in a number of zzso including pancreatic zzso 

Both zzso proteins were zzso in human pancreatic zzso tumors and were broadly expressed in human pancreatic zzso cell zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso signaling in a zzso zzso Three of four pancreatic zzso cell lines tested exhibited zzso zzso zzso in that zzso zzso zzso were required to initiate downstream zzso zzso Exposure of these pancreatic zzso cells to a zzso inactive form of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited both zzso signaling and cell zzso zzso zzso in two of these lines resulted in markedly reduced zzso in zzso zzso 

We have identified the zzso as zzso of zzso zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer cells and have demonstrated their contribution to the growth and zzso of these zzso Since the zzso are zzso zzso they would be attractive targets for therapy of pancreatic zzso Our results run counter to the prevailing view in the literature that the zzso are negative regulators of zzso
