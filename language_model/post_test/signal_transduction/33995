zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates myriad important cellular zzso including growth, survival, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we report that treatment of zzso and zzso leukemia cells with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to block zzso formation surprisingly caused a large increase in expression of zzso zzso with induction of zzso Another zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso and produced dramatic increases in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso was not a specific effect of its zzso but rather was a consequence of zzso zzso The zzso drug zzso a potent zzso of zzso in these cells, also zzso zzso expression and activity and promoted zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso reduced not only zzso zzso but also the increased expression of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso factors to attract zzso cells, and we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells and primary zzso and zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso cells may zzso zzso to produce and zzso zzso that serves as a zzso signal for scavenger cells to engulf them in order to prevent zzso
