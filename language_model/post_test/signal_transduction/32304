The mechanisms that regulate the zzso subset of helper T cells and diseases zzso by zzso cells remain poorly zzso Here we found that the zzso zzso zzso was a powerful zzso of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso airway inflammation in zzso In polarizing conditions based on transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the production of induced regulatory T cells and the zzso subset of helper T cells and diverted zzso T cells to a zzso zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso which triggered induction of the zzso zzso in zzso T cells and the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso this subsequently led to the generation of zzso zzso Thus, our study identifies a previously unknown mechanism for the induction of zzso cells and may have important clinical implications in allergic zzso
