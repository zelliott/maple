zzso zzso is a key structural feature of diabetic zzso in the late stage of zzso Recent studies show that zzso zzso are involved in the zzso of cardiac zzso in diabetic mice, but more novel zzso remain to be zzso In this study, diabetic zzso characterized by zzso was induced in mice by zzso zzso Using zzso analysis of zzso zzso we were able to identify changes in expression in 19 zzso of which 16 zzso were further validated by real-time zzso and a total of zzso targets zzso were zzso Further analysis showed that 31 GO functions and 16 zzso pathways were enriched in the diabetic zzso Of these, zzso signaling zzso was zzso In zzso and in zzso studies have confirmed that three major zzso of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are specifically zzso in zzso zzso during zzso To further explore the potential involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso were exposed to high zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the cell size, and also reduced the level of its target gene zzso and zzso expression was regulated by zzso Our data highlight an important role of zzso in diabetic zzso and zzso the reliability of zzso analysis in shedding light on the mechanisms underlying diabetic zzso
