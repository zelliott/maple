zzso actively zzso during zzso and withdraw from the cell cycle during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are a direct target of zzso zzso signaling in skeletal and smooth muscle and regulate expression of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso in other cell zzso however, the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso inhibitor expression has not been reported for the developing zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso are expressed in the developing zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso inhibitor expression from embryonic to zzso zzso Cell culture studies show that embryonic zzso are responsive to zzso growth factor 1 zzso which results in the induction of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Likewise, zzso expression of zzso promotes zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, increased expression of zzso zzso affects zzso zzso In zzso zzso transgenic expression of zzso during heart development causes embryonic zzso at embryonic day zzso because of severe zzso defects that coincide with premature zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso expression of dominant negative zzso in zzso does not obviously affect heart development at embryonic day zzso but results in abnormal zzso of the zzso by embryonic day zzso along with decreased zzso zzso inhibitor expression and increased zzso zzso These data support zzso zzso factors as negative regulators of zzso proliferation and promoters of zzso cell cycle withdrawal during heart zzso
