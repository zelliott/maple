zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso are devastating plant zzso The most common species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have broad host ranges and are notoriously difficult to zzso zzso genetic resistance is the preferred method for disease zzso Only from tomato zzso zzso has a zzso resistance locus been zzso zzso the zzso gene that encodes a zzso zzso cell surface zzso Due to lack of a suitable model for zzso protein zzso resistance signaling in zzso zzso zzso so far relatively little is known about zzso signaling in pathogen zzso Here, we show that zzso remains fully functional after zzso transfer to zzso and that zzso zzso is resistant to race 1 but not to race 2 strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso nor to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that signaling components zzso by zzso in zzso to establish zzso resistance overlap with those required in tomato and include zzso zzso and zzso which strongly suggests that critical components for resistance signaling are zzso We subsequently investigated the requirement of zzso family members for zzso resistance in zzso revealing that zzso is required in addition to zzso Using zzso gene zzso the requirement of zzso for zzso resistance was confirmed in zzso Moreover, we show the requirement of zzso for resistance against the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso can be used as model to unravel the zzso of zzso zzso
