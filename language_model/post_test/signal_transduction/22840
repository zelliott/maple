The formation and organization of skeletal tissue is strongly influenced by mechanical zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso stress has an impact on the expression of early response genes in zzso cells and may play a role in the formation of zzso zzso In particular, zzso may be unique in their response to zzso stimuli since in these cells zzso has been reported to reduce collagen zzso while in zzso the opposite effect was zzso Here, we have investigated the influence of zzso induced by zzso on the collagen synthesis of human zzso cells zzso and studied the possible involvement of the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso synthesis was significantly increased by zzso under zzso at 13 zzso zzso an effect paralleled by the enhanced expression of the collagen I alpha 2 zzso zzso No difference was seen in the proportion of collagen types I, III, and V zzso by zzso zzso induced a markedly elevated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso suppressed the zzso stimulation of both collagen synthesis as well as zzso zzso expression by about zzso Our results show that the collagen synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso under zzso zzso This response appears to be partially zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
