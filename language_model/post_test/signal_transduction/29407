The effects of myostatin on zzso differentiation are poorly zzso and the underlying mechanisms are zzso We determined the effects of human zzso myostatin protein on zzso of bone zzso human zzso stem cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso For both zzso cell types, differentiation in the presence of myostatin caused a zzso reduction of zzso zzso and diminished incorporation of zzso fatty acid into cellular zzso zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso blocked the zzso effects of myostatin on zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso of its upstream zzso by an zzso inhibitor blocked the zzso effect of myostatin on zzso in zzso zzso an important role of zzso zzso in this zzso Furthermore, myostatin enhanced nuclear zzso of zzso and formation of the zzso complex, together with the altered expression of a number of zzso zzso genes in zzso The zzso effects of myostatin on zzso were blocked by zzso zzso of zzso and diminished by zzso of zzso zzso The conclusion is that myostatin inhibited zzso in human bone zzso zzso stem cells and zzso These effects were zzso in part, by zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso signal to zzso pathway, leading to zzso of zzso
