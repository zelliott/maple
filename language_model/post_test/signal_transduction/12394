Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by memory loss and the zzso of zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso and the nuclear factor zzso B zzso as well as a zzso of protein zzso A zzso activity and the zzso by zzso of its downstream factor zzso We investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the expression of these factors and on the cognitive performance of aged zzso zzso We found that chronic treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited zzso and zzso in the brains of zzso zzso zzso controls the expression of several genes related to zzso pathology, including zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased the cerebral expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso It has recently been observed that zzso zzso prevents cognitive impairment in a mouse model of zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso of long-term zzso zzso zzso with the idea that zzso zzso can improve cognitive abilities, we found that zzso restored working memory abilities in aged zzso mice without reducing zzso levels in the zzso These findings suggest that zzso reduced zzso pathology by reducing zzso
