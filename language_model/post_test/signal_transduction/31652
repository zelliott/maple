Our previous study has shown that an extremely zzso magnetic field zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso synthesis by zzso zzso NO zzso zzso in rat zzso The present study was designed to confirm that zzso affects zzso zzso zzso in several brain regions and to investigate the correlation between NO and zzso zzso The exposure of rats to a zzso zzso zzso for 5 days resulted in increases of NO levels in parallel with zzso zzso in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso violet zzso and electron microscopic evaluation revealed that there were no significant differences in the zzso and number of zzso in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso the numbers of zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in those cerebral areas in zzso zzso These data suggest that the increase in NO could be due to the increased expression and zzso of zzso in zzso Based on NO signaling in zzso and pathological states, zzso created by electric power systems may induce various zzso changes in modern zzso
