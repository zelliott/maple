Although zzso represent the most common class of tumors of the central nervous system, the molecular events underlying their genesis and development are still not well zzso In the present study we have used the zzso technique to study the expression level of the tumor zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso in primary zzso zzso We have also studied the induction of zzso and zzso in response to both zzso light and zzso We present evidence that the zzso zzso signaling zzso is defective in 5 out of 8 zzso of these zzso Furthermore, we have shown that the tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are differently expressed in these cells, with up to zzso difference between the lowest and the highest levels of each zzso These results suggest that the tumor zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso play important roles in the development of benign zzso
