zzso metabolism is tightly regulated by both cholesterol and its zzso in the zzso liver, but the regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso synthesis remains to be zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso is a key zzso involved in de zzso zzso synthesis in the liver via the zzso zzso zzso However, the regulatory mechanisms for the expression of zzso in the liver are not well zzso 

zzso zzso out zzso mice were fed a zzso supplemented with zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids were highly increased in the liver within a zzso However, the amount of zzso in very zzso zzso zzso but not in the liver, was reduced by zzso The zzso zzso tissue was almost eradicated in the long zzso DNA zzso and real-time zzso analyses revealed that the zzso expression of all the genes in the zzso zzso in the liver was suppressed in the zzso diet zzso zzso In particular, the zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso was markedly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso was also zzso In zzso analysis using zzso cells revealed that the protein expression of zzso was suppressed by treatment with zzso zzso 

These data using zzso mice indicate that cholesterol and its zzso are involved in regulating zzso metabolism through a suppression of zzso and zzso in the zzso This research provides evidence for the mechanism of zzso expression in the zzso
