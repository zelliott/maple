Tight junctions are essential for the maintenance of zzso cell zzso We have previously established a system for the primary culture of zzso zzso zzso cells that retain their ability to generate new zzso zzso and to zzso proteins in a zzso zzso Because cell polarity and zzso zzso are zzso for the formation of zzso zzso we have investigated the structure of the tight junctions in these zzso We have found two types of cellular organization in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has revealed tight junctions near the zzso region of the lateral zzso between cells in the zzso and cells at the surface of the zzso The cells in the interior of the clusters also have tight junctions and are organized around a central zzso These interior cells retain more zzso zzso than the surface or zzso cells, suggesting that they maintain their original character as zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso increases during culture, although it is not zzso in the cells immediately after isolation from the zzso zzso zzso has shown that zzso is zzso in the zzso and at the surface of the zzso but not inside the zzso Only zzso which is present in the original zzso cells following isolation and in the intact zzso has been detected inside the zzso These results suggest that differences in zzso expression are related to the three-dimensional structures of the cell cultures and reflect their ability to function as zzso zzso
