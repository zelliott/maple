To investigate the significance of sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patched zzso expressions in zzso cervical zzso and their relationships with zzso type 16 zzso 

zzso 183 cases of cervical zzso including 32 zzso zzso 71 cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso and 25 zzso and 80 zzso cell zzso zzso were selected from the Department of zzso zzso University Hospital, zzso Women Hospital, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins expression were investigated by zzso using tissue zzso platform, and the presence of zzso type 16 was detected by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were rare in normal cervical zzso but were strongly expressed in cervical cancer and its precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso In cervical cancer, the expression rate of zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso of zzso In cervical cancer, the expression of zzso was related with zzso infection zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes may play important roles in the development of cervical zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso molecules seems helpful for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer and its precursor zzso and are potentially therapeutic targets as zzso
