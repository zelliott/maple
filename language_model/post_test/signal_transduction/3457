The main functions of zzso are associated with zzso However, zzso has been shown to be of functional importance also in zzso target zzso Previous studies, especially zzso and clinical ones, have addressed zzso influence on zzso suggesting that zzso has a beneficial effect, but the biological mechanisms have not been zzso zzso exerts zzso effects in the target cells by binding to the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of the two zzso of zzso varies depending on the zzso The overall objectives of this thesis were to study the functional importance of zzso receptors in the zzso with special focus on zzso and zzso of inflammation and their signaling zzso The thesis is based on the following five zzso In Paper I, effects of zzso on zzso coli zzso zzso cell production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso are zzso by using zzso Furthermore, effects of zzso and zzso on the normal characteristics of the zzso cell such as collagen synthesis and cell proliferation is determined by using zzso incorporation and measurement of DNA zzso zzso 

zzso coli zzso stimulates zzso cell zzso and zzso production but has no effect on the normal zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is not reversed by zzso suggesting that zzso has no zzso effect in these zzso In Paper II, we investigate the effects of zzso and aging on tooth attachment in female mice by using zzso zzso 

zzso of female sex hormone production by zzso has no effect on zzso bone height and zzso termination of the zzso zzso In a second series of experiments these parameters are similar in mice sacrificed at zzso weeks of age, suggesting that tooth attachment is preserved with age in mice within a period of six zzso In Paper III, the objective is to investigate the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso in human zzso cells by determining zzso transcript levels zzso quantitative real-time zzso and protein levels zzso zzso 

A zzso concentration of zzso reduces the expression of zzso zzso by about zzso compared to zzso cells treated with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso differences in the effects of zzso on zzso zzso expression are zzso These findings indicate that zzso affects zzso expression in zzso cells showing a complex pattern involving zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso exerts both zzso and zzso effects through these zzso In Paper IV, zzso expression in human zzso zzso and effects of zzso on cultured zzso zzso cell zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is determined by zzso and effects of zzso on zzso proliferation monitored by measuring DNA zzso 

zzso cells show strong zzso zzso but low zzso zzso both in zzso and in culture, suggesting that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso in zzso High, but not low, zzso of zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells, indicating a zzso zzso In Paper zzso the objective is to investigate the effects of zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso on zzso production in human zzso cells and zzso cells, and the signaling mechanisms zzso zzso real-time zzso is used to determine zzso zzso levels and zzso to determine zzso zzso 

zzso coli zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso production in zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso oxide zzso inhibitor zzso reduces zzso by zzso while zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso oxide zzso does not affect zzso levels, showing a mechanism probably involving zzso oxide formation via zzso zzso oxide zzso Treatment with the zzso steroid zzso totally zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso zzso
