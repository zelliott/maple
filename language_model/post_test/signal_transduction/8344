The zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso processes and encloses the zzso muscles to form a muscle zzso Because muscle zzso can respond to zzso forces applied at a zzso surface, we were interested in the mechanical effects this zzso may have on zzso signaling from zzso zzso muscles during zzso zzso The discharge of zzso muscle zzso at rest and in response to muscle history were investigated in the presence and absence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was induced by positioning the zzso vertebra in conditioning directions that zzso and shortened the zzso zzso The vertebra was then returned to an intermediate position for testing the zzso Neither resting discharge zzso zzso zzso nor the effects of muscle history zzso zzso zzso was significantly different with the zzso intact zzso zzso Our data showed that the zzso zzso did not influence zzso signaling from zzso zzso muscles zzso during small passive zzso movements in zzso In addition, comparison of the zzso threshold pressures needed to stimulate our sample of muscle zzso in the cat with the zzso zzso zzso pressures measured in humans during previous studies suggests that the zzso zzso likely does not affect zzso signaling from zzso zzso muscle zzso in zzso
