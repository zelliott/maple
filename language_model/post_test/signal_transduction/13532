The following studies were undertaken to develop a cultured zzso zzso model which would allow further clarification of the zzso signal zzso mechanisms zzso by these zzso After mechanical removal of the zzso rabbit zzso zzso were isolated by an overnight zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The isolated zzso were maintained in culture in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso fetal bovine serum along with zzso M zzso zzso zzso and zzso The phase contrast and electron zzso appearance of these cells was consistent with that previously reported for smooth muscle zzso in zzso zzso studies utilizing zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso confirmed the presence of smooth muscle zzso in these cultured zzso Western zzso studies similarly confirmed the presence of zzso muscle zzso in rabbit zzso tissue and the cultured zzso both the primary and F1 zzso After zzso the zzso with zzso zzso stimulation experiments demonstrated zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation experiments confirmed zzso production in these cultured zzso and the ability of zzso an zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso production confirmed the presence of functional zzso zzso receptors in these zzso In conclusion, these cultured rabbit zzso zzso have provided an in zzso model which can be zzso to further clarify the zzso zzso signal zzso mechanisms in zzso tract smooth zzso
