The assembly and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso depend on the zzso zzso zzso This plus zzso motor carries zzso transport particles from the base to the tip of the zzso where structural components of the zzso are zzso Here we test the idea that zzso also is essential for signal zzso When zzso plus zzso and zzso minus zzso zzso of the zzso green zzso zzso are mixed together, binding interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso initiate a signaling zzso that leads to increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A critical question in zzso zzso has been how zzso interactions are coupled to increases in zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso were found to not form zzso at the restrictive temperature (32 degrees zzso We found that, although the rates and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso at 32 degrees C are indistinguishable from zzso zzso the cells do not undergo zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso at 32 degrees C regulated zzso location and underwent zzso fusion when the cells were incubated in zzso zzso indicating that their capacity to respond to the zzso signal was zzso We show that the cellular zzso in the zzso zzso at 32 degrees C is a failure to undergo increases in zzso during zzso zzso Thus, in addition to being essential for assembly and maintenance of the structural components of zzso zzso transport plays a role in sensory zzso in these zzso
