Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso may have zzso effects on some zzso The zzso effects of zzso have not been established or studied in brain zzso zzso cultures of three fetal zzso and 18 zzso were treated with zzso alone or with zzso DNA synthesis was assessed by zzso zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso and reductions in zzso were assessed by Western zzso zzso produced a significant reduction in zzso stimulation of DNA synthesis in a zzso culture zzso zzso zzso and 1 of 6 WHO grade I and 1 of 4 grade II zzso at 24 h and in 3 of 6 WHO grade I, 4 of 4 grade II and 1 of 1 grade III cell cultures zzso zzso zzso at 72 zzso zzso reduced zzso stimulation of zzso of zzso in the 22 week fetal zzso cell cultures and in cells from 1 grade I zzso at 24 zzso but in none of 4 grade I and 5 grade II zzso at 6 zzso zzso had no notable effect on zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso 3 or zzso zzso zzso treatment for 24 h had no effect on zzso zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso in all four zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso may inhibit zzso growth, and does so in part by cell cycle zzso Additional evaluation of zzso as a potential adjunct chemotherapy is zzso
