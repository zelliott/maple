zzso zzso acting at zzso and zzso zzso has recently been shown to contribute to airway zzso The aim of our study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso regulation of zzso production by airway zzso zzso Treatment of human normal zzso zzso cells with zzso or its two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso through the zzso zzso zzso complex, a process requiring zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but independent from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also occurred in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were only detected in zzso zzso zzso human primary zzso zzso cells expressed all four zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso caused zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso Although these zzso did not induce significant zzso gene expression by these cells, they markedly enhanced zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso expression and zzso Application of zzso or zzso at the zzso side of polarized human primary zzso zzso cells zzso to cause zzso zzso release by these zzso Thus, zzso promotes zzso zzso expression through zzso zzso zzso zzso entry, leading to zzso zzso zzso and binding of active zzso to zzso gene zzso
