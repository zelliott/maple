We have previously shown that zzso zzso flux plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso during nerve growth factor zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso Here we found out that zzso channel 4 zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso Using a zzso technique, we found that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso in zzso cells, an effect which was blocked by zzso of zzso of zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso was suppressed in the zzso knock down zzso Moreover, zzso knock down also suppressed the zzso outgrowth in response to long-term treatment of zzso in zzso cells and in primary cortical zzso In zzso our results suggest that zzso is an important zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and thus, the zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
