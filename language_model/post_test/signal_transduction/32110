How muscle diversity is generated in the zzso body is poorly zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso muscle masses constitute the first zzso diversification, as each gives rise to distinct zzso zzso zzso after muscle precursor cells zzso have migrated from the zzso to the limb bud and populated the prospective muscle zzso Here, we show that Sonic zzso zzso from the zone of polarizing activity zzso drives zzso specifically within the zzso muscle zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso to initiate zzso zzso and zzso through essential zzso sites located in the zzso limb zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso is delayed, zzso fail to migrate zzso and zzso paw muscles fail to zzso Thus, zzso production in the limb zzso is essential for the zzso control of zzso and coordinates muscle and skeletal development by acting directly to regulate the formation of specific zzso zzso
