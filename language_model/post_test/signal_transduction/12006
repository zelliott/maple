zzso zzso the most frequent zzso in the Western world, is characterized by an important zzso zzso zzso zzso and a process of zzso in the zzso zzso One zzso assumption is that transforming growth zzso zzso acts through zzso zzso and plays a role in zzso implicating also zzso zzso Another recent notion is the active involvement of inflammatory zzso in the zzso process of zzso zzso 

A total of 105 zzso valves was collected from patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso with either zzso valve zzso or zzso zzso valve zzso rheumatic zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Each valve was incubated for 24 h in culture medium and the zzso zzso media) were used to measure the zzso of zzso B4 zzso and zzso and to zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were significantly higher in media zzso by AS valves compared to those zzso by zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso correlated significantly with the calcium content of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso media did not differ significantly between the various groups of valves, and there was no significant correlation between zzso and either zzso or the number of zzso released from the zzso zzso 

Taken together, these results indicate that inflammatory signaling through zzso may be more closely linked to zzso and zzso zzso than signaling through zzso and zzso
