We tested the hypothesis that zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways regulate zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso 2-4 human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were grown to zzso on zzso zzso zzso The flux of zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso served to determine zzso Application of 1 zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for 60 zzso with a selective zzso inhibitor zzso at zzso and 27 zzso blocked zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso did not influence the zzso zzso zzso zzso administered at 27 zzso decreased baseline zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso signaling zzso is important in the regulation of baseline zzso and zzso zzso
