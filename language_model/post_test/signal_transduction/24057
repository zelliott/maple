To establish infections, viruses use various strategies to suppress the host defense zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that cells infected with a wild strain of zzso virus zzso displayed nearly complete suppression of zzso zzso state, but not zzso zzso This phenomenon is due to the suppression of zzso gene expression at a zzso zzso In the zzso signal zzso pathway, zzso zzso induced by zzso is dramatically suppressed in zzso zzso however, zzso induced by zzso is zzso We performed zzso experiments using zzso against type 1 zzso zzso chain 1 zzso and zzso against zzso which is reported to be a scaffold protein interacting with type I zzso zzso chain 2 and zzso These experiments indicated that zzso forms a complex containing the zzso proteins C and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso of this complex in the infected cells altered little by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso suppresses the zzso but not zzso signaling zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that functional disorder of the type I zzso zzso complex is due to zzso of the zzso through its association with the C and/or V proteins of zzso
