The zzso growth of the zzso during gestation involves gradual changes in cellular zzso from the early zzso to the intermediate synthetic phase of cellular zzso ending in the final zzso zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates cell growth and proliferation in many zzso We hypothesized that zzso was a zzso of zzso zzso zzso during zzso The protein expression and zzso levels of zzso its upstream regulators zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso were analyzed throughout normal pregnancy in zzso In addition, we used an zzso zzso rat model to analyze the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso by zzso alone and in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso Our results demonstrate that insulin zzso zzso protein levels and the zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in the rat zzso during the zzso phase of zzso Treatment of the zzso rats with zzso caused a transient increase in zzso followed by an zzso of the zzso pathway, which became apparent by a cascade of zzso reactions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins and significantly reduced the number of zzso cells in the zzso of zzso zzso Our in zzso data demonstrate that zzso was able to activate the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso and suggest that this zzso is responsible for the induction of zzso zzso during early zzso
