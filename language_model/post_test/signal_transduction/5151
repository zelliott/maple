Here we explore association with human longevity of common genetic variation in three major candidate zzso zzso zzso DNA damage signaling and repair and zzso by investigating zzso tagging zzso in 148 genes zzso these zzso In a zzso study of zzso zzso (age zzso and zzso middle-aged zzso we found 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5 DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be associated with longevity after correction for multiple zzso In a zzso study with 11 years of follow-up on survival in the zzso zzso we found 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be associated with mortality in late life after correction for multiple zzso When examining the 11 zzso from the zzso study in the zzso data, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated the same directions of effect zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso indicative of effects also in late life zzso In addition, zzso zzso presented the same direction of effect when inspecting the 6 zzso from the zzso study in the zzso data, zzso suggesting an effect also in survival from middle age to old zzso No formal zzso were observed when investigating the 11 zzso from the zzso study in zzso zzso (age zzso and zzso middle-aged zzso although zzso zzso did show a supportive zzso tendency zzso zzso zzso The same was true for zzso zzso zzso zzso when examining the 6 zzso from the zzso study in a Dutch zzso cohort of zzso (age zzso zzso In conclusion, the present candidate gene based association study, the largest to date applying a zzso approach, not only points to potential new longevity zzso but also zzso the difficulties of replicating association findings in independent study populations and thus the difficulties in identifying universal longevity zzso
