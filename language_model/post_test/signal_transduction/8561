In zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling system and zzso zzso are involved in the action of the zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso stress zzso zzso response regulators zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in the growth zzso effects of these zzso To gain further insights into the molecular basis for these signaling systems, we performed DNA zzso analyses of zzso and zzso stress responses in zzso A global expression analysis revealed that a large number of genes were modulated by zzso treatment in an zzso manner, whereas zzso hardly contributed to this zzso The zzso zzso or zzso genes zzso or zzso zzso are also dependent on the zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso regulates expression of zzso gene zzso a zzso factor involved in zzso stress zzso From the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso largely overlapped with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions downstream of the zzso zzso A series of zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso response to zzso stress as well as zzso The zzso zzso double zzso turns off the zzso and zzso pathways and showed sensitivity to zzso stress but no resistance to zzso Our data revealed that the growth zzso effect of zzso depends on factors other than zzso in spite of the fact that zzso functions downstream of the zzso zzso zzso The complexity of the stress response in the zzso zzso system followed by the zzso zzso cascade is zzso
