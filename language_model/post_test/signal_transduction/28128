The effects of zzso zzso on zzso relaxation zzso and on zzso zzso concentration zzso were examined in mouse zzso mouse zzso zzso cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso In mouse zzso rings zzso with zzso zzso or zzso an increase in zzso zzso concentration zzso from 6 to 12 zzso inhibited zzso concentration zzso In zzso cells, an increase in zzso inhibited the zzso zzso increase concentration zzso Similar to zzso zzso also inhibited zzso and the increase in zzso concentration zzso In zzso zzso increasing zzso from 6 to 12 zzso zzso membrane potential from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the holding potential from zzso to zzso zzso decreased zzso significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, P zzso zzso and further decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the holding potential from zzso to 0 zzso zzso zzso 11, P zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso inhibited zzso and the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversed the zzso zzso of zzso and increase in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and increase in zzso was abolished by the zzso pump inhibitor zzso (10 zzso These results indicate that an increase of zzso in the zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso cells and diminishes zzso by zzso the membrane potential, decreasing zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso thereby modulating the release of zzso zzso factors from zzso cells and zzso zzso
