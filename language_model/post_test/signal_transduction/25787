Recent evidence suggests that zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is involved in modulating the negative symptoms of zzso zzso In this study, a series of experiments were performed to further characterize the role of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso physical signs of zzso zzso zzso axis zzso enhanced zzso zzso turnover in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso expression in the nucleus of the solitary zzso zzso cell group zzso 

The contribution of zzso zzso in zzso withdrawal was assessed by zzso infusion of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were implanted with two zzso (or zzso zzso Six days later, rats were zzso with zzso or saline 10 zzso before zzso and the physical signs of zzso the zzso axis activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were measured using zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso showed decreased levels of zzso signs of zzso zzso withdrawal, but the zzso response was not zzso zzso attenuated the increased production of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the enhanced zzso turnover observed in zzso zzso Finally, zzso antagonized the zzso zzso at zzso induced by zzso zzso 

These results suggest that physical signs of zzso withdrawal, zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso pathways zzso the zzso are modulated by zzso zzso Furthermore, they indicate a marginal role for the zzso axis in zzso of zzso zzso
