zzso in zzso are constantly subjected to mechanical zzso stresses that play important regulatory roles in various zzso and pathological zzso zzso reorganizations that occur in response to zzso flow have been studied zzso but whether the zzso of an adherent cell adapts its mechanical properties to respond to zzso is largely zzso Here we develop a new method where fluorescent zzso are zzso injected into the cells to probe, with high resolution, possible local zzso changes in the zzso of individual cells subjected to fluid zzso This new zzso ballistic zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso flow zzso a dramatic sustained zzso increase in zzso zzso in zzso Swiss zzso zzso By contrast, cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso show highly transient stiffening of much lower zzso despite the formation of similar zzso zzso zzso zzso stiffening is attenuated by zzso zzso interactions and is entirely eliminated by specific zzso zzso zzso Together, these results show that zzso and zzso stimuli may elicit the formation of zzso similar zzso structures zzso stress fibers and focal zzso but zzso zzso different zzso zzso Our results suggest that when an adherent cell is subjected to zzso zzso its first order of action is to prevent detachment from its zzso by greatly stiffening its zzso through enhanced zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso
