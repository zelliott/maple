We review the extensive body of data on the molecular zzso of hormone zzso disease in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso emphasis is placed on the crucial role of the bone zzso especially the zzso interactions of zzso prostate cancer cells and zzso in promoting the establishment of hormone zzso zzso Resistance of zzso cells to zzso therapies is generally viewed as a phenomenon almost exclusively determined by zzso defects and/or gene zzso However, it is now well-documented that the local milieu of the bone zzso can also protect zzso cells from zzso zzso induced zzso either independently or zzso with zzso genetic zzso A key zzso of this protection is the zzso cascade which zzso the local concentration of survival factors, such as zzso growth factor zzso The molecular pathways zzso this major growth and survival factor for prostate cancer cells exerts its zzso effect on prostate cancer cells are zzso
