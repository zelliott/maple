There are different types of zzso zzso cells that can be induced to differentiate to mature zzso or zzso by different zzso regulatory zzso One type of zzso clone can be induced to differentiate by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso which we have shown is zzso zzso and another type of zzso clone can be differentiated by zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso There was no zzso of growth zzso or zzso cells before induction of differentiation in either type of zzso In both zzso induction of zzso requirement for a zzso protein for cell zzso zzso of the cells was maintained by zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor zzso but not by zzso in the cells differentiated by zzso and by zzso or zzso but not by zzso or zzso in the cells differentiated by zzso or zzso The viable cells with a differentiated zzso continued to zzso In zzso zzso cells with no or few surface receptors for some of these zzso there was an zzso of the number of receptors during differentiation for the proteins to which the cells zzso But there were also zzso zzso cells with an zzso of zzso receptors although zzso could not maintain the viability of the zzso zzso The results indicate that induction of hormone responsiveness and zzso of the hormone receptors can both occur in zzso zzso cells, and that the regulation of these two events can be zzso
