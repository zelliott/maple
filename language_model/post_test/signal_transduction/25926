zzso employ a modified zzso system for zzso where the receptors form zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These complexes are arranged in zzso zzso clustered predominantly at the cell zzso The prevailing models assume that these zzso are zzso and reorganize only locally in response to zzso zzso Recent studies have zzso however, that these structures may in fact be much more zzso We investigated the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso using zzso and live cell zzso zzso We found that the receptors were localized in clusters at the poles in most zzso However, when the cells were exposed to zzso the number exhibiting polar clusters was reduced roughly zzso whereas the number exhibiting lateral clusters distinct from the poles increased zzso These changes in zzso zzso were zzso as polar zzso was zzso in adapted zzso We also investigated the dynamic zzso of zzso a hybrid protein consisting of an zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso response regulator domain that is known to be zzso by zzso using zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso was localized predominantly at lateral clusters in zzso zzso However, upon exposure to zzso zzso was found to be predominantly localized to the cell zzso Moreover, changes in zzso zzso are zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso are dynamic structures and that feedback zzso involving zzso may regulate the positioning of individual zzso
