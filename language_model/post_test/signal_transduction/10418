zzso zzso agent zzso is a zzso for the zzso zzso and the zzso form is able to bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso leads to a rapid and transient zzso of several protein zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso but with a reduced potency and a more delayed time zzso In addition, zzso and zzso are able to increase zzso of zzso proteins which are classical members of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso device, thus suggesting a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso toxin zzso which blocks zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso the zzso tissue growth factor zzso and collagen as important hallmarks in the zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso and zzso are able to mimic these effects of zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso markedly zzso zzso and collagen type IV protein zzso In addition, the tissue inhibitor of zzso is zzso activated by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso type II by the zzso zzso technique blocks not only zzso zzso but also zzso zzso Similarly, zzso depletion by zzso zzso also abrogates zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data show that zzso and zzso not only activate the zzso zzso cascade in zzso cells, but also zzso the expression of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso may have additional effects besides the established zzso action and, importantly, a zzso activity has to be considered in future experimental zzso
