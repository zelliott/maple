zzso zzso zzso plays key roles in zzso zzso and metabolism of zzso zzso zzso zzso is transcribed via five zzso arranged promoters into seven zzso The zzso of zzso V is controlled by promoter zzso Previously we found that zzso zzso zzso was responsible for the induction of zzso in rat zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso In the current study, the underlying mechanism was zzso zzso deletion and zzso analysis demonstrated that an zzso element zzso in the zzso region of zzso promoter 5 zzso was responsible for the zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso showed an increased binding activity of zzso zzso after zzso zzso The nuclear content of zzso factor 2 zzso was significantly increased by zzso The recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso after zzso treatment was demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The tissue expression pattern of zzso zzso V was previously zzso Using zzso chain reaction, we found that zzso zzso zzso was expressed in many zzso in zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in rat zzso and its zzso and zzso expression is zzso through zzso zzso
