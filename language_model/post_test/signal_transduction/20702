This review summarizes the evidence showing that the duration of the nocturnal zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso seasonally appropriate zzso zzso and behavioral responses in zzso We review experiments using the timed infusion paradigm zzso to deliver zzso either zzso or centrally to zzso zzso and zzso In this zzso zzso is zzso usually once daily, for a specific number of hours and at a predetermined time of zzso This experimental strategy tests most directly those features of the zzso signal that are necessary to trigger zzso zzso The data suggest that the duration of the zzso stimulation is the critical feature of the zzso signal for both zzso and zzso effects of the hormone on the zzso control of zzso development in juvenile zzso zzso and for the zzso control of zzso and zzso responses in adult zzso and Syrian zzso and zzso The use of the zzso reveals the importance of the frequency of the signal presentation of zzso and suggests the importance of a period of zzso circulating zzso of the zzso The zzso also reveals that the characteristics of the zzso signal that regulate male sexual behavior are similar to those that are critical for zzso and zzso responses in Syrian zzso We zzso the locations of possible functional zzso target sites identified by combining the zzso with traditional brain zzso zzso Evidence from such studies suggests that the integrity of the zzso nucleus zzso region in zzso zzso and the anterior zzso in Syrian zzso is necessary for the response to zzso zzso zzso The zzso has been used to deliver zzso to putative target sites for the hormone in the brain of juvenile and adult zzso zzso The results of these preliminary experiments suggest that the regions of specific zzso binding in this species, especially the zzso are effective sites where zzso may stimulate zzso zzso In contrast, results from zzso application of zzso in sheep suggest the zzso zzso zzso as a critical site of zzso Finally, we also discuss potential applications of the zzso for identification of brain zzso target sites, understanding of other zzso phenomena and responses, and resolution of the zzso basis underlying the reception and interpretation of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
