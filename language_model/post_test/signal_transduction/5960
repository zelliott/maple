The zzso zzso of zzso A is an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso transmission, functioning in negative feedback control of zzso zzso We explored naturally occurring zzso in the zzso acid sequence of zzso Three human zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested for ability to inhibit four zzso zzso The rank order of potency for zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in potency was paralleled by decline in Hill zzso suggesting that negative zzso at ascending dose might zzso loss of zzso Several lines of evidence indicated that each zzso acted as a zzso zzso potency to inhibit zzso paralleled zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso with similar potency when triggered by several zzso zzso though not by agents using other zzso pathways or bypassing the zzso zzso and blockade of zzso was zzso with zzso zzso also inhibited zzso of zzso after prior zzso exposure and stimulation of zzso protein zzso by zzso Rank order of zzso zzso potency for all four zzso processes was identical zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting mediation by similar combinations of zzso zzso zzso and that crucial zzso zzso are likely to be identical across the four zzso When zzso zzso were mixed in likely zzso zzso M zzso combinations, the zzso curve was zzso onto that of the more potent zzso in the zzso suggesting zzso zzso The results have quantitative implications for zzso variations in human zzso zzso
