The lineage fate of developing zzso is determined by the persistence or zzso of T cell zzso zzso signaling during positive selection, with persistent zzso signaling required for zzso lineage zzso We show here that zzso zzso of zzso expression is essential for zzso lineage choice during major zzso complex class II zzso zzso positive selection and is critical for zzso lineage choice in zzso mice whose zzso compete for the identical selecting zzso zzso zzso occurred for zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso were zzso during positive selection, zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and causing lineage errors regardless of the absolute number or signaling strength of transgenic zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso expression during zzso zzso positive selection determines the integrity of zzso lineage choice, revealing an elegant symmetry between zzso zzso and lineage zzso
