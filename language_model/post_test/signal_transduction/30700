The mechanism of zzso of pathogens remains to be fully zzso We report a novel zzso zzso for zzso zzso which is initiated by zzso membrane zzso and is dependent on zzso primarily an immune regulator with both positive and negative zzso zzso of Lyn or blocking of cholesterol synthesis significantly inhibited zzso by zzso zzso We found that zzso via zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso bound to and then activated zzso and zzso to regulate zzso zzso of the engulfed zzso zzso Further analysis indicates that Lyn and raft components entered in zzso and late zzso Finally, respiratory burst was dependent on Lyn and membrane zzso as confirmed by small interfering zzso and zzso zzso Our investigations demonstrate that Lyn along with membrane zzso plays a fundamental role in zzso by zzso zzso during zzso
