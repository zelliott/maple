Acute liver injury can develop as a consequence of viral zzso zzso or zzso toxicity or rejection after liver zzso whereas chronic liver injury can be due to long-term exposure to alcohol, zzso chronic viral zzso zzso or zzso zzso During liver injury, liver cells are exposed to increased levels of zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso This results in death of zzso In contrast, zzso cells become active and are resistant against cell zzso Eventually, acute and chronic liver injury is followed by loss of liver function for which no effective therapies are zzso zzso are well equipped with protective mechanisms to prevent cell zzso As long as these protective mechanisms can be zzso the balance will be in zzso of cell zzso However, the balance between cell survival and cell death is delicate and can be easily tipped towards cell death during liver zzso Therefore understanding the cellular mechanisms controlling death of liver cells is of clinical and scientific importance and can lead to the identification of novel intervention zzso This review describes some of the mechanisms that determine the balance between cell death and cell survival during liver zzso The strict regulation of zzso cell death allows therapeutic intervention zzso In this light, zzso zzso and zzso cell death are discussed and strategies are provided to selectively interfere with these zzso
