The zzso human zzso cell line exhibits opposing zzso responses toward tumor necrosis zzso zzso treatment, dependent upon the zzso state of the zzso zzso active cells in log growth respond to zzso by rapidly undergoing zzso whereas zzso exposure stimulates cellular proliferation in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was monitored by cellular zzso activity and confirmed by both DNA zzso and DNA zzso Moreover, these responses could be detected by measuring zzso zzso activity, enabling rapid prediction zzso approximately zzso h of zzso zzso of the fate of the cell in response to zzso Growth factor zzso of zzso cells, resulting in zzso of cell zzso altered zzso action from a zzso stimulus to an zzso zzso zzso levels of the type II zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to correlate with sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso of log growth zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso by greater than zzso Studies utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso implicated zzso in zzso zzso zzso These data show a zzso zzso role for zzso in zzso cells that is dependent on zzso activity and controlled by the zzso
