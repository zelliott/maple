zzso growth zzso zzso is a critical regulator of skeletal zzso While zzso has been shown to be a potent zzso zzso in zzso its role in zzso differentiation is less well zzso We chose to study the action of zzso on an accepted model of zzso zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso sufficiently high to interact with the zzso zzso are routinely used to induce zzso cells to zzso zzso we first examined the ability of zzso to promote zzso differentiation at zzso zzso zzso could induce differentiation of these cells at zzso below 10 zzso However, increasing zzso zzso were less potent at inducing zzso We hypothesized that zzso effects of zzso might inhibit its zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso cell DNA synthesis while enhancing zzso This suggested that the ability of zzso to promote both proliferation and differentiation might require that its signaling be modulated through the differentiation zzso We therefore compared zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso cells, but minimal zzso response was seen in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was unchanged by zzso indicating intact upstream zzso zzso zzso Similar findings were observed in the zzso zzso cell line and in primary chick zzso We conclude that zzso promotes both proliferation and differentiation of zzso and that the differentiation effects of zzso may require zzso of signaling to the zzso zzso
