This report establishes that increasing the activity of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in embryonic day zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion gene is not induced by treatment with zzso hormone in zzso zzso zzso However, treatment of the zzso with zzso an zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with an expression zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to render the fusion gene zzso zzso Similar results are obtained after zzso treatment of zzso zzso that have been zzso with a zzso that contains the zzso reporter gene under zzso control by the zzso zzso promoter and a zzso zzso with two zzso response elements zzso In contrast, zzso zzso but is not required to achieve zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso that contains the reporter driven by a minimal promoter with six juxtaposed zzso Based on these results, we zzso that zzso zzso contain zzso receptors whose signal zzso properties are enhanced by zzso Unlike the zzso expressed zzso zzso fusion zzso however, zzso of zzso does not render the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Thus, its expression appears to be subject to an additional level of control in the developing zzso
