zzso zzso are involved in cell zzso of growth factors such as insulin and zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso receptors which possibly feedback on insulin release are established in zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso in insulin zzso is zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso and zzso zzso but not its structurally similar albeit biologically inactive analogue zzso increase insulin release at zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, an insulin zzso cell zzso zzso zzso activity is inhibited by zzso but not zzso The zzso effects of either insulin or zzso on insulin release are abolished by zzso M zzso but not by zzso indicating an involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso effect of both insulin and zzso on insulin zzso Since zzso was argued not to be specific for zzso zzso several second zzso were zzso zzso is not zzso The zzso effect of acutely administered zzso is not influenced by zzso while in protein zzso C zzso cells the zzso effect of zzso is zzso both indicate no involvement of zzso in zzso zzso Since zzso toxin zzso zzso has no effect on the zzso effects of zzso on insulin release, a zzso zzso is not likely to be zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso is involved in the zzso effects of insulin and zzso on insulin release in zzso cells, possibly zzso the negative feedback zzso
