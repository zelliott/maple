zzso zzso acid zzso was critical for many plant growth and zzso processes including seed zzso zzso and response to environmental zzso With the purpose to detect the possible zzso related signal zzso zzso we tried to isolate zzso genes through zzso zzso technology using zzso rice zzso as materials (under treatment for 2, 4, 8 and 12 zzso Of zzso zzso clones tested, 37 differential clones showing induction or suppression for at least one time, were zzso Of them 30 and 7 were zzso or zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the putative zzso proteins were involved in different possible zzso including transcription, metabolism and resistance, photosynthesis, signal zzso and seed zzso 6 zzso clones were found to zzso proteins with unknown zzso zzso by zzso of 7 selected clones relating to signal zzso or metabolism was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso In addition, some clones were further shown to be regulated by other plant growth regulators including zzso and zzso which, however, indicated the complicated interactions of plant zzso zzso signal zzso pathways involved in zzso were zzso
