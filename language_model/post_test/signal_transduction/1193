To investigate changes of the zzso calcium zzso signals during the zzso and zzso of neural zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso 

The zzso calcium concentration and the zzso dependent protein zzso zzso zzso activity were determined by zzso zzso method and zzso zzso method in the process of cell zzso and zzso 

During the zzso and zzso of zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso raised obviously than that of the control zzso zzso zzso And it was decreased by zzso sensitive calcium channel zzso inhibitor zzso zzso While the zzso zzso activity was lower than that of the control group during the zzso and was higher during the zzso and displayed zzso and zzso relation zzso zzso zzso that was blocked by zzso zzso zzso 

During the zzso and zzso of zzso cells evoked by zzso zzso was both increased zzso zzso activity was decreased in the zzso and improved in the zzso It is suggested that zzso and zzso may be involved in the zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of neural zzso receptors induced by zzso
