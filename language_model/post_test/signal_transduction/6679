zzso zzso receptors were originally zzso into the zzso M and D based on the findings that zzso contracted the guinea-pig zzso by two different zzso zzso directly by an effect on receptors located on smooth muscles (via D zzso and zzso indirectly by an effect on zzso receptors zzso zzso the zzso of which caused zzso zzso With the introduction of zzso studies and the development of more selective zzso zzso and antagonists, it rapidly became apparent that this zzso is an zzso and it is now accepted that at least three, possibly four main families of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso receptors are not a homogeneous class, but are subdivided further into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whether zzso and zzso receptors are also a zzso class of receptors is still a matter of zzso Besides the differences in specific zzso and antagonists, zzso zzso seem to differ also in their zzso zzso zzso receptors (with the exception of zzso are coupled to zzso zzso predominantly in an zzso fashion, but zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been also zzso zzso receptors (and zzso are coupled to zzso zzso while zzso receptors appear to be coupled directly to fast zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso receptors couple obviously in an zzso fashion to zzso zzso
