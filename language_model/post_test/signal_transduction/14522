zzso zzso a fatty acid primary zzso discovered in the zzso fluid of sleep-deprived zzso has a variety of actions that give it potential as a signaling zzso although these actions have not been extensively investigated in the cardiovascular zzso The synthetic zzso probably involves synthesis of zzso and then conversion to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso breakdown of zzso is by fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso channels and zzso with zzso and zzso receptors as well as having zzso zzso The latter have been suggested to be due to zzso of the effects of zzso such as zzso by zzso zzso zzso This might zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protect the active zzso from zzso by zzso However, zzso has direct zzso actions at zzso zzso receptors and also activates the zzso zzso zzso Other actions include zzso of zzso communication, and this might give zzso a role in zzso zzso Many of these actions are absent from the trans zzso of zzso One of the most potent actions of zzso is zzso In rat small zzso artery the response does not involve zzso zzso receptors but another zzso zzso G zzso zzso as yet zzso This zzso is sensitive to zzso and zzso an zzso at the putative zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso oxide, zzso zzso and also through zzso of zzso zzso A zzso role for zzso in the heart and circulation has yet to be demonstrated, as has production by cells of the cardiovascular system, but this zzso has a range of actions that could give it considerable zzso zzso
