zzso I zzso zzso zzso complexes represent a unique type of DNA zzso whose repair and processing remain zzso In this study, we show that Top zzso zzso complexes zzso arrest zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso Arrest of zzso zzso is coupled to zzso of zzso degradation of Top I and the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso Recovery of zzso occurs gradually and depends on both zzso degradation of Top I and functional zzso repair zzso These results suggest that arrest of the zzso zzso zzso complex by the Top zzso zzso complex triggers a zzso zzso signaling zzso leading to degradation of both Top I and the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso degradation of Top I and zzso zzso II precedes repair of the exposed zzso breaks by zzso
