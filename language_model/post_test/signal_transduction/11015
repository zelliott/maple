Although primary zzso zzso express receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso understanding of the cellular effects of these receptors is zzso We determined that zzso receptors regulate gene zzso in primary zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner that was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso The response to zzso also occurred in adult zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not alter the concentration of free zzso calcium in zzso or adult zzso zzso zzso data showed that one downstream effect of the zzso signaling zzso was zzso of zzso response element binding zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulates gene zzso This interpretation was supported by evidence that zzso increased zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso DNA reporter zzso The effect of zzso on gene zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso indicating that protein zzso A and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that mediate effects of zzso on gene zzso zzso zzso receptors may regulate expression of proteins by primary zzso zzso during development and in response to zzso zzso
