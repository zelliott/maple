The formation of precise zzso networks is critically dependent on the zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso of guidance cues evoke localized zzso zzso to attract or repel the growth zzso Recent studies strongly suggest that the polarity of growth cone guidance, with respect to the zzso of zzso signals, is determined by zzso release from the zzso zzso zzso in the following zzso zzso signals containing zzso zzso release cause growth cone attraction, while zzso signals without zzso zzso release cause growth cone zzso Recent studies have also shown that zzso and zzso membrane trafficking can drive growth cone attraction and zzso respectively, downstream of zzso zzso Most zzso these two mechanisms zzso zzso zzso guidance, in which a localized imbalance between zzso and zzso dictates zzso growth cone zzso In this zzso zzso I zzso recent advances in growth cone research and propose that polarized membrane trafficking plays an zzso role to zzso zzso steering zzso such as zzso components and zzso zzso
