As one of the most common sources of indoor zzso worldwide, zzso is important in causing zzso and asthma while the mechanisms underlying remain zzso Since T helper zzso type 2 polarization plays an important role in the zzso of allergic diseases, we investigated the effect of zzso g 7, a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso polarization which is controlled by zzso zzso cells zzso zzso by zzso zzso g 7 zzso g zzso immature zzso obtained from human exhibited zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso with zzso T cells, challenged zzso increased the ratio of zzso versus zzso of zzso T cells, suggesting a balance shift from zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso against zzso zzso and zzso reversed the enhancement of zzso ratio and alleviated the zzso release induced by zzso g 7, indicating that the zzso polarization provoked by zzso g 7 challenged zzso is via zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the present findings implied a crucial role of zzso g 7 in the development of zzso zzso and highlighted an involvement of zzso zzso polarization in zzso zzso
