To demonstrate whether the original zzso zzso is maintained with zzso activity by suppressing zzso signaling in zzso monkey zzso expanded in a zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso monkey zzso were isolated from central zzso buttons by zzso zzso for 16 hours, seeded on plastic in zzso modified zzso medium zzso containing zzso zzso zzso supplement zzso or zzso fetal bovine serum zzso zzso or in a defined zzso zzso medium zzso After zzso cells in zzso were continuously zzso at a zzso zzso Cellular proliferation was analyzed by zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso The cellular zzso was determined by zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by the expression of zzso zzso enhanced zzso fluorescent protein zzso The stability of the zzso zzso was examined by switching zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling was monitored by measuring the promoter activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso after transient zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso 

In zzso monkey zzso proliferated while maintaining the expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso for at least 15 zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso and the promoter activities of zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso In zzso an increase of zzso to zzso zzso and addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter activity, facilitated zzso and zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso 

The normal monkey zzso zzso can be maintained in a zzso zzso medium by zzso zzso zzso zzso
