We studied the expression and function of the zzso zzso and zzso family of receptors in male germ zzso zzso zzso zzso showed expression of zzso zzso the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors in human zzso and the presence of zzso and zzso receptors alpha and beta proteins was confirmed by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso studies showed expression of these receptors in the germ line in the human zzso and in human and bovine zzso zzso zzso studies with bull zzso indicated that zzso zzso for increased zzso of zzso in these cells at zzso zzso compatible with expression of functional zzso zzso receptors in these zzso In contrast, zzso failed to induce increased zzso zzso in bull zzso zzso using zzso zzso that express functional zzso and zzso receptors confirmed that zzso but not zzso zzso for increased zzso zzso Our findings suggest that differential zzso for increased zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso is a property that depends on the identity of the zzso forming part of the zzso and is not a property specific to the germ zzso
