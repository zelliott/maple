The biological control zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso employs two zzso sensing zzso zzso zzso regulates the production of the antibiotics zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso whereas zzso regulates currently unknown aspects of the cell zzso Previously characterized derivatives of strain zzso with zzso in each zzso system and in the zzso zzso genes were screened for their ability to form zzso zzso populations in zzso using zzso plate and flow cell zzso zzso and on seeds and zzso zzso from in zzso seed, and root studies demonstrated that the zzso and the zzso zzso regulatory systems contribute to the establishment of zzso with zzso in zzso having a significantly greater effect than zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso production was necessary for zzso formation to the same extent as the zzso zzso system, suggesting the loss of zzso was responsible for the majority of the zzso zzso in these zzso In zzso analysis indicated that genetic zzso or AHL addition to the growth medium restored the ability of the AHL zzso zzso zzso to form zzso However, only zzso addition or genetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in trans restored zzso formation by zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso production were also involved in the establishment of zzso populations on wheat seeds and plant roots, and, as observed in zzso the addition of AHL extracts restored the ability of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to form surface attached populations on zzso Similarly, the presence of the wild type in zzso with the zzso restored the ability of the zzso to colonize wheat roots, demonstrating that AHL and/or zzso production by the zzso population could complement the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Together, these data demonstrate that both zzso systems are involved in the formation of zzso populations required for zzso formation by zzso zzso strain zzso and indicate a new role for zzso antibiotics in zzso community development beyond zzso of other zzso zzso
