We examined the role of zzso signaling generated by zzso zzso in zzso of zzso and host defense against zzso zzso zzso Using mice with an zzso zzso reporter construct zzso zzso we found that zzso administration of zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso influx and zzso of zzso To determine the effects of zzso oxygen species generated by the zzso zzso system on zzso of zzso we zzso mice deficient in zzso with zzso reporter mice zzso These zzso mice were unable to activate zzso to the same degree as zzso mice with intact zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso In addition, lung zzso levels were significantly lower in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso clearance was impaired in zzso zzso In zzso studies using bone zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso 4 was necessary for zzso zzso following treatment with zzso zzso Additional studies with zzso from zzso mice confirmed that zzso signaling was necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso respiratory burst zzso by zzso infection contributes to host defense by modulating zzso signaling through the zzso zzso
