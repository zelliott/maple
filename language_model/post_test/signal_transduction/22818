By occupying specific surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular, functional and zzso studies have shown that zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Until now, the characteristics of the specific zzso binding and the zzso of zzso receptors in human zzso have not been zzso In the present study, we used the zzso zzso zzso for zzso binding studies and a zzso zzso probe in order to zzso the zzso binding sites in human zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso receptors with selectivity and zzso although with a low binding zzso zzso analysis showed a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a maximum density of binding sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The good affinity and selectivity of the zzso zzso probe for zzso zzso receptors allowed us to zzso them, after zzso with zzso zzso as zzso gold particles on the zzso surface and inside the zzso The zzso of the zzso complex was followed in a controlled temperature system, and occurred through a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso trafficking was fast, taking less than 5 zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso complex is a useful marker for the specific zzso of zzso binding sites and to follow the zzso trafficking of these zzso
