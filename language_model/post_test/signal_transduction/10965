The importance of zzso signaling is well recognized for numerous aspects of central nervous system zzso function, ranging from zzso organization of neuroendocrine and behavioral circuits to zzso capacity, resistance and zzso Nonetheless, concepts for the therapeutic use of zzso in neurological and mental disorders are far from being zzso This review outlines some critical issues which interfere with decisions on the suitability of zzso as therapeutic agents for zzso zzso Among these, zzso organization of neural zzso and resulting differential responsiveness to zzso zzso steroids, convergence of steroid hormone actions on common molecular targets, zzso of different sex steroid receptors in target zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of natural zzso apparently pose the principal obstacles for the characterization of specific zzso effects of zzso Additional important, albeit less explored aspects consist in insufficient knowledge about molecular targets in the zzso which are under exclusive or zzso zzso zzso Own experimental data illustrate the zzso of pharmacological effects of natural and synthetic zzso on zzso functions of zzso zzso such as sexual behavior, anxiety and zzso responsiveness to zzso Finally, we present results from an analysis of the consequences of aging for the rat brain zzso and examination of the influence of zzso on zzso expressed genes with zzso significance in zzso
