The mechanisms involved in the zzso effect of zzso are not fully understood and are thought to involve a cascade of zzso signals related to T cell zzso zzso This study shows that zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso seeds, is a potent zzso zzso of human zzso This effect is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso and is accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso expression and by a zzso zzso gene expression and zzso protein zzso zzso also zzso zzso and activates zzso inducing its zzso from the zzso to the zzso Both effects are blocked in the presence of zzso or by zzso zzso In zzso zzso interacting with zzso activates signaling pathways related to zzso and thereby triggers zzso and zzso pathway, which zzso T cell zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso might be a useful tool to study zzso mechanisms following T cell zzso that link upstream signaling pathways to downstream zzso
