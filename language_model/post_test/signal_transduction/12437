zzso zzso analyses from the phase 3 global advanced zzso cell zzso zzso trial were conducted to determine if baseline levels of the tumor molecular markers zzso and zzso alpha correlated with efficacy in patients treated with zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 

Patients in the zzso group received 3 million U zzso zzso zzso weekly, escalating to 18 zzso Patients in the zzso group received 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha baseline levels were measured in zzso tumor specimens by zzso 

There was no correlation between baseline zzso and zzso alpha levels and treatment effect with respect to overall survival zzso zzso survival, or objective response rate zzso in patients with advanced zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

The baseline status of the molecular markers zzso and zzso alpha did not correlate with efficacy in zzso cell zzso patients treated with zzso versus zzso Patients demonstrated zzso and zzso survival benefit when treated with zzso regardless of zzso and zzso alpha zzso Thus, baseline zzso and zzso levels may not predict response to zzso zzso the lack of correlation may be due to the zzso in tumor specimens that occurred because of the global nature of the clinical zzso Other markers in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be of utility as zzso of response to zzso in patients with advanced zzso cell zzso
