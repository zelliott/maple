We here present a method to study the interaction of parallel neural input channels regarding their effects on a zzso In particular, the method allows to disclose the effects of zzso pathways that may exist in parallel to direct zzso connections to the zzso Two (or more) zzso zzso are zzso with random patterns of zzso The response of the cell to these patterns is evaluated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso One of the two stimulus trains is selected as the one to yield reference events for the zzso zzso From this stimulus train are selected those stimuli as reference events which are zzso at defined mean zzso by stimuli in the same or a parallel zzso These zzso stimuli are determined zzso separately from each single stimulus train and zzso zzso from the two trains as events occurring simultaneously in zzso The effects exerted by these various conditioning events on the effects of the zzso zzso on the cell response yield insights into the interactions between the two (or more) zzso These methods are demonstrated on spinal Renshaw cells activated by independent random stimulation of two muscle nerves and on zzso horn zzso responding to zzso nerve zzso
