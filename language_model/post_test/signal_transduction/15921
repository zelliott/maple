It is generally accepted that zzso zzso result from the zzso into zzso of a ubiquitous zzso the so-called prion zzso As a consequence, the dynamics of zzso formation should explain the characteristics of the prion zzso zzso as well as sporadic and genetic zzso long incubation time, species barriers and strain zzso The success of this zzso hypothesis is due to the good qualitative agreement of this hypothesis with the zzso However, a number of difficulties appeared when comparing zzso the in zzso experimental results with the theoretical models, suggesting that some differences should hide important zzso We used well defined quantitative models to analyze the experimental results obtained by in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso prion zzso Although the dynamics of zzso resembles a simple zzso zzso neither the initial concentration dependence nor zzso hypothesis fit with experimental zzso Furthermore, seeded zzso starts after a long time delay suggesting the existence of a specific mechanism that takes place before nucleus zzso On the other hand, zzso dynamics reveals a highly zzso zzso the origin of which appears to be caused by nucleation zzso Moreover, the specific structures generated during nucleation are maintained during successive seeding although a clear improvement of the dynamics parameters zzso rate and lag zzso is zzso We propose that an additional zzso reaction takes place before nucleation and it is responsible for the zzso of structures produced during prion protein zzso in zzso These zzso structures behave like prion zzso A model is proposed to explain the genesis of zzso among prion zzso
