The present study was aimed to zzso the cellular zzso controlling vascular relaxation triggered by stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a stable zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso relaxation in zzso guinea-pig zzso contracted with zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation was almost abolished in zzso zzso indicating a major role of zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation was practically abolished by a selective zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso or by zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso The relaxation induced by zzso was not significantly affected by other zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but was slightly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso levels, suggesting a role for zzso zzso zzso A selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely zzso this zzso Moreover, tension zzso due to zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was thoroughly restored by zzso zzso zzso confirming a role for a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso relaxation though it almost totally inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso contents induced by zzso suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism that is zzso zzso Moreover, zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso for 6 zzso which activates the zzso G protein of zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso contraction both in the absence and presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also capable of restoring the relaxation induced by zzso These findings suggest that zzso channel plays a primary role in zzso smooth muscle relaxation following stimulation of zzso zzso with zzso in guinea-pig zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso pathways contribute to the zzso zzso relaxation following zzso zzso stimulation in this vascular zzso zzso regulation of zzso channels by zzso may partly account for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
