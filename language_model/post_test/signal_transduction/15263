Different studies show evidence that several zzso organisms display a cellular zzso structure characterized by a set of zzso which are always in an active state zzso zzso while the rest of the molecular zzso reactions exhibit zzso changing zzso This zzso zzso zzso seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of zzso common to all living cellular zzso In a recent analysis performed with zzso zzso networks zzso we have shown that this global functional structure emerges in zzso networks with a relatively high number of zzso zzso under particular conditions of zzso zzso regulatory zzso 

Here, to investigate the mechanism behind the emergence of this zzso organization of zzso we have performed extensive zzso simulations zzso zzso zzso taking into account the proportion of the zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso present in the networks, the variation in the number of zzso zzso and regulatory signals per zzso element, as well as the random selection of the zzso elements that receive zzso zzso from the zzso The zzso approximations obtained show that the percentages of zzso with zzso zzso grow with the number of zzso zzso zzso to zzso for all zzso 

The results show evidence that the fundamental factor for the spontaneous emergence of this global zzso zzso structure is the number of zzso elements in the zzso zzso Our analysis corroborates and expands on our previous studies illustrating a crucial property of the global structure of the cellular zzso These results also offer important insights into the mechanisms which ensure the zzso and stability of living zzso
