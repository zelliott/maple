zzso zzso rhythms originate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from which rhythmic neural activity can be recorded in zzso Application of zzso can reset this zzso Here we determine cellular zzso of the zzso properties of zzso Y zzso on the zzso zzso clock in zzso Drug or control treatments were applied to zzso slices containing the zzso on the first day in zzso The firing rates of individual cells were sampled on the second day in zzso Control slices exhibited a peak in firing rate in the middle of the zzso zzso application of zzso to the zzso phase advanced the time of peak firing zzso This zzso effect of zzso was not altered by block of sodium channels with zzso or block of calcium channels with cadmium and nickel, consistent with a direct zzso site of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso also did not alter phase shifts to zzso zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso had effects only at very high zzso doses of zzso whereas blocking zzso receptors did not alter effects of zzso Phase shifts to zzso were blocked by zzso with zzso of protein zzso C zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may be necessary for these zzso Bathing the slice in low zzso zzso can block phase shifts to zzso possibly via a zzso zzso A zzso high zzso bath can also block zzso phase zzso The results are consistent with direct action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso through a signal zzso zzso that depends on zzso of zzso
