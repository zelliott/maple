Advanced pulmonary zzso hypertension is characterized by extensive vascular zzso that is usually resistant to zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso A zzso zzso the zzso step for cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and to block cell proliferation through zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso on DNA zzso cell cycle zzso and cell proliferation in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso We found that zzso induced zzso arrest and decreased DNA synthesis in rat zzso and did so in association with an increase in both total and zzso zzso zzso This caused a marked decrease in zzso E zzso activity, which suggests an important role for zzso in the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso However, in zzso lacking functional zzso zzso still decreased zzso E zzso activity, caused zzso arrest, and decreased DNA zzso In zzso zzso zzso induced a greater reduction of zzso E protein levels (to zzso of zzso than in zzso cells (to zzso of zzso and also reduced the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso also caused zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso and was able to do so at a dose that did not induce cell cycle zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso can both inhibit cell proliferation and induce zzso in zzso through zzso pathways and may be important therapeutic agents in pulmonary zzso zzso
