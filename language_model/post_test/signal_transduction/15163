Increasingly, zzso are being diagnosed at an early zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to cancer in zzso of zzso We performed genetic analysis using zzso zzso and zzso in 6 patients, 3 with zzso zzso and 3 with early tongue cancer, to evaluate the usefulness of these methods in the diagnosis of zzso zzso and early zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso were collected by laser zzso zzso was zzso and the signals converted to zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso against zzso zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso Five genes showed a 2 times or greater level of increase in expression in zzso tissue in comparison with in normal zzso while 4 genes showed a 2 times or greater increase in early cancer zzso In cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso class III was expressed at zzso times and 11 times the level of that found in normal zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso revealed no positive cells in normal zzso Positive cells were noted in the zzso and zzso cell zzso and partially in the zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso layer of early cancer zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso signal zzso is associated with oral zzso
