It has been reported that the zzso zzso mediates the zzso effect of zzso zzso This zzso couples zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso in zzso is zzso 

We compared the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso density zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity as determined by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and baseline and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities zzso in control and zzso rabbit zzso The control population zzso zzso zzso received 0, 10, 20, and 60 minutes of coronary zzso zzso zzso 6 to 8 per zzso and zzso rabbits zzso zzso 24) received two cycles of alternating zzso zzso and zzso before sustained zzso zzso zzso 6 per zzso In control hearts, zzso induced rapid and progressive reductions in the zzso zzso and zzso after 10 to 60 minutes of zzso zzso did not affect the reduction in zzso but it preserved reductions in zzso activity and zzso after 10 to 20 but not 60 minutes of sustained zzso In another study, 18 rabbits were treated with zzso toxin 48 hours before surgery to block zzso During treatment, no significant difference was observed in the zzso reduction in zzso in the zzso region between control zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso zzso 10) animals after 20 minutes of zzso 

zzso delays zzso reductions in zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso is not the target effect of the zzso zzso zzso responsible for the zzso role of zzso
