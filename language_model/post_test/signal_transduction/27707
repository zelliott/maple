zzso zzso is a potent zzso hormone and a potentially important drug in the treatment of Type II zzso diabetes zzso We have investigated whether it acts as a growth factor in beta zzso and have studied the zzso pathways and zzso factors implicated in this zzso 

Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso incorporation zzso We have examined the action of zzso zzso on the zzso activity of zzso zzso The DNA binding activity of zzso factors was investigated by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso were done using the northern zzso 

zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso incorporation in beta zzso and zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocked the effects of zzso zzso on DNA zzso zzso factor pancreatic and zzso zzso gene 1 zzso DNA binding activity was increased by zzso zzso at 3 or 11 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed the action of zzso zzso on zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone did not change zzso zzso DNA binding zzso They zzso however, to increase the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and insulin zzso Finally, zzso zzso increased the incorporation of zzso zzso in isolated rat zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso may act as a growth factor for the beta cell by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could also regulate the expression of the insulin gene and genes zzso zzso implicated in zzso transport and metabolism through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
