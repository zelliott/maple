One of the major challenges when testing drug candidates targeted at a specific zzso in whole animals is the discrimination between specific effects and zzso zzso zzso Here we used the zzso to define several zzso defects caused by impairment of zzso zzso a major zzso of interest in tumor zzso We zzso zzso signaling by genetically blocking zzso expression or using specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We show that the combined occurrence of defects in cartilage formation, zzso of blood flow in the trunk and a decrease of zzso basic protein expression represent good indicators for impairment of zzso zzso Finally, we present a zzso of known zzso zzso zzso according to their specificity for the zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso indicators can help to discriminate between specific effects on the target zzso from zzso effects in zzso targeted drug screening experiments in whole animal zzso
