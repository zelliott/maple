The zzso zzso regulates cancer cell invasion through inhibitor of DNA zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in human lung zzso The current study aimed at identifying zzso zzso involved in the zzso signaling in lung zzso zzso of lung cancer cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso led to the zzso of several zzso including zzso which was the most highly zzso zzso with predicted binding to the zzso zzso region zzso zzso reporter zzso confirmed direct binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso levels and significantly reduced migration and zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the other hand, enhanced zzso zzso and protein levels, and significantly increased lung cancer cell migration and invasion, a hallmark of the zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells was able to rescue the migratory potential of these zzso Both, zzso and zzso zzso diminished the effects of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on migration and zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso repression on zzso and led to increased zzso protein levels, whereas forced expression of zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso In agreement, we showed direct recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in primary lung zzso samples compared with matched zzso lung zzso and zzso expression was a significant zzso factor for patient zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso signaling pathway, is zzso in lung zzso and is a potential zzso marker for zzso zzso zzso
