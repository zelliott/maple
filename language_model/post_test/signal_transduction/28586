zzso zzso by protein zzso A and the zzso response element binding protein zzso has been linked to the establishment of long-term memory and cell zzso However, all of the major targets for activated zzso have yet to be zzso Given the fact that zzso zzso is intimately involved in cellular processes of learning and memory and that zzso activity can be regulated by synaptic zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have studied the role of the zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso required for functional zzso zzso We now report that levels of zzso zzso protein in primary zzso cultures are increased zzso in response to zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is paralleled by a twofold increase in zzso levels and an zzso increase in zzso zzso reporter activity that is dependent on protein zzso zzso Three zzso regulatory elements zzso in the rat zzso promoter zzso zzso - 67, and - zzso bind zzso in zzso and zzso increases binding to two of the sites zzso zzso and - zzso zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso DNA reveals that zzso is bound in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Increased presence of the activated zzso zzso form is dependent on the length of exposure to zzso Taken together with the results of zzso analysis, the findings strongly suggest that zzso of zzso is regulated by the zzso signaling pathway, most likely through the binding of zzso and its zzso by zzso zzso
