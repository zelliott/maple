zzso are environmental sensors, historically thought of as zzso zzso in zzso Their zzso occurs through a zzso linked zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso change zzso through the protein to a variable output zzso The zzso composition is zzso typically consisting of a zzso architecture for the zzso zzso zzso A collection of three-dimensional structures has uncovered key features, including an unusual zzso zzso an extension reaching from the zzso domain to the zzso zzso domain, and a centrally located, long zzso hypothesized to be crucial for zzso zzso Continuing identification of zzso in microbial systems has expanded the assigned sensory abilities of this family out of the red and into the yellow, green, blue, and violet portions of the zzso Furthermore, zzso acting not as zzso but as zzso sensors have been zzso In addition, zzso other than zzso are known, thus revealing zzso to be a varied group of sensory receptors evolved to zzso their modular design to perceive a signal and respond zzso This review focuses on the structures of bacterial zzso and implications for signal zzso We also discuss the small but growing set of bacterial zzso for which a zzso function has been zzso
