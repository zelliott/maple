The activity, zzso and fate of many cellular proteins are regulated through zzso a process zzso one or more zzso zzso zzso or chains are zzso attached to target zzso While zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso we lack a high-resolution picture of the dynamics of zzso in response to zzso In this study, we describe the zzso growth factor zzso zzso as obtained by two complementary zzso strategies coupled to quantitative zzso Our results unveil the complex impact of growth factor signaling on zzso zzso networks to levels that extend well beyond what might have been zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso zzso includes a large number of signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and proteins involved in translation and zzso The zzso signaling network appears to intersect both zzso and regulatory zzso of cellular zzso Finally, as proof of principle of the biological relevance of the zzso we demonstrated that zzso is a novel, downstream zzso target of zzso growth factor zzso zzso critically involved in zzso biological zzso
