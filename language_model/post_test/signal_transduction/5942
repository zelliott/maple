The zzso surface zzso previously associated as a zzso marker for zzso zzso of T zzso has now been critically identified as the zzso protein for human zzso viruses zzso The human zzso zzso is readily zzso on zzso T zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope protein zzso binds native or zzso zzso with equal affinity estimated to be 4 to 8 zzso zzso All human tissue sources of zzso bind zzso zzso to the same relative zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not bind the zzso envelope zzso Lack of sufficient recognition by the zzso zzso zzso suggests divergence in the zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso is dependent upon intact zzso bonds within zzso zzso and zzso zzso native zzso is unable to bind zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments cannot bind to the zzso zzso although they serve as zzso for zzso zzso zzso A number of synthetic peptides to putative critical zzso of zzso have been studied for their antagonism of native zzso zzso zzso T zzso or synthetic zzso of zzso proposed to bind the zzso zzso involved in zzso binding had no competitive displacement of native zzso binding as assessed by two independent methods that measure zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso fragments, also containing other putative zzso did not zzso native zzso from zzso zzso appears to be critical in the maintenance of the structure of the binding domain of zzso Native zzso binding to zzso is sufficient for the zzso of cellular metabolism that alters target cell gene expression and zzso suggesting that the virus binding contributes to the zzso of the host zzso
