zzso zzso occurs in many foods such as carrot, celery, and several reports have shown that it has zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso effect and the mechanism of zzso on zzso growth factor zzso proliferation of rat zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso proliferation and DNA synthesis of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso blocked the cell cycle progression at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with 9 zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso proliferation of zzso might be zzso by blocking zzso of zzso and that of zzso
