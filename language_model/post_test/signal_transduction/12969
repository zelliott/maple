zzso growth zzso zzso conveys regulatory signals through multiple zzso zzso subsequently affecting various cellular zzso To identify new targets for zzso we studied the changes in the zzso of zzso lung zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein spots, affected by zzso were selected, and proteins were identified by zzso zzso zzso Among them, proteins involved in regulation of immune response, zzso regulation of zzso zzso metabolism and DNA repair were zzso zzso of the 38 proteins are new targets for zzso thus suggesting novel ways of integration of zzso zzso in zzso regulatory zzso We show that zzso decrease in expression of one of the new targets, zzso zzso with a decrease in DNA repair zzso This was evaluated by formation of nuclear zzso DNA repair complexes in response to DNA damage, by single cell gel zzso and by cell survival zzso The zzso zzso of DNA repair was reversed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso can promote DNA instability through zzso of zzso and zzso of DNA zzso
