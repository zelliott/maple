The mouse zzso B4 zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso of human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso expressing zzso demonstrated a high affinity and specific binding for zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In competition binding experiments, zzso was the most potent competitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso In zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso inhibited zzso zzso production and induced an increase of zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is coupled to zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso confirming the zzso of zzso production induced by zzso BLT receptors share significant sequence zzso with zzso receptors zzso and zzso that act as human zzso virus zzso zzso However, among the 16 zzso strains tested, the human BLT zzso did not act as a zzso for virus entry into zzso cells based on infection and zzso fusion zzso In zzso mice, the absence of zzso B4 zzso did not zzso alter zzso zzso binding in zzso obtained from zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso gene will form the basis of future experiments to zzso the selective role of zzso as opposed to zzso in zzso models of zzso
