Patients receiving zzso tamoxifen whose tumors express high levels of both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often develop tamoxifen zzso We used a breast cancer model system with high expression of zzso and zzso to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying this zzso 

zzso breast cancer cells, which express high levels of zzso and a zzso zzso cell line engineered to zzso zzso zzso were treated with estrogen, zzso zzso growth factor zzso or zzso in the absence or presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso We analyzed zzso of signaling zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity with reporter gene zzso and zzso analysis of zzso gene products, promoter assembly by zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cell growth in zzso by zzso colony formation and in zzso using zzso in nude zzso 

zzso tumors were completely growth inhibited by zzso deprivation but were growth zzso by zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso pathways was increased in the zzso cells compared with zzso cells, with zzso and zzso of both the zzso and the zzso zzso the signaling molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso itself with both zzso and tamoxifen zzso zzso recruited zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene promoter in zzso cells and zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso 3) in zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso on target gene zzso eliminated zzso zzso effects, and restored its zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso behaves as an zzso zzso in breast cancer cells that express high levels of zzso and zzso resulting in de zzso zzso zzso ability to eliminate this zzso and to restore zzso zzso effects should be tested in the zzso
