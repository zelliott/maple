Following the initial discovery of the heat shock zzso omega zzso gene of zzso zzso to be zzso zzso and also zzso by cell stress, other zzso long zzso zzso zzso have been described in diverse zzso In view of the rapid sequence divergence of zzso present knowledge of stress zzso is limited and zzso Several known stress-related zzso associated with specific nuclear speckled zzso or zzso provide structural base for zzso diverse zzso zzso Others have roles in zzso or zzso zzso during stress or in signaling zzso functions of several other zzso are not yet zzso Most stress-related zzso act primarily by modulating activity of the proteins to which they bind or by zzso specific sets of proteins away from the active zzso A common emerging theme is that a given zzso targets one or more zzso with key zzso in the cascade of events triggered by the stress and therefore has a widespread zzso zzso Since proteins associate with zzso through short sequence zzso the overall base sequence of functionally similar zzso is often not zzso except for specific zzso The rapid zzso of zzso sequences provides elegant zzso for zzso to changing environment as binding of one or the other protein to zzso can alter its structure and functions in distinct zzso Thus the stress-related zzso act as hubs in the cellular networks to coordinate activities of the members within and between different networks to maintain cellular zzso for survival or to trigger cell zzso
