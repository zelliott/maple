zzso shock results in multiple organ zzso At present, two different mechanisms of cellular destruction are of zzso necrosis and zzso zzso we started to investigate in pigs whether cell death due to zzso is involved in this zzso zzso DNA fragments were detected by zzso specific for zzso DNA fragments in three different experimental settings, Pigs were zzso followed by zzso infusion zzso group, zzso zzso zzso or zzso without zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and compared with control animals zzso zzso zzso 6 h of continuous zzso (5 zzso resulted in a significantly enhanced zzso in liver as compared with controls animals zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso whereas in the zzso group, only a minor increase of 166 zzso zzso was zzso In zzso of zzso animals, an enhanced zzso of 150 zzso zzso compared with controls was shown in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso whereas kidney remained zzso These results were confirmed by zzso DNA gel zzso A typical DNA zzso was detected in liver and zzso but not in kidney of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso detection of DNA strand breaks with terminal zzso zzso in liver sections revealed a drastic increase of stained zzso The induction of zzso correlated with a reduced zzso content in zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that 6 h of zzso treatment leads to zzso in liver and zzso in zzso whereas kidney of zzso animals remains zzso This process may be zzso by reduction of zzso by zzso zzso
