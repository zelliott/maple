zzso zzso signaling directs a variety of cellular processes during animal development by promoting the association of zzso with zzso on zzso enhancers zzso zzso ends zzso a nuclear protein containing zzso recognition motifs zzso and a zzso domain, is required for optimal zzso signaling in several fly zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the only other fly protein containing zzso and a zzso domain, acts together with zzso to positively regulate zzso zzso The partial zzso in zzso signaling observed with zzso zzso was enhanced by simultaneous zzso of zzso while it was rescued by expression of zzso in wing zzso zzso In cell culture, depletion of both factors causes a greater zzso in the zzso of several zzso targets than zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso These nuclear proteins are not required for zzso stabilization or the recruitment of zzso and zzso to a zzso Loss of zzso target gene zzso in cells depleted for zzso and zzso was not dependent on the zzso zzso Yan or zzso of zzso two previously identified targets of zzso We propose that zzso and zzso act zzso downstream of zzso to activate many zzso zzso zzso
