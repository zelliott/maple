zzso zzso proteins that stimulate the de zzso zzso of zzso zzso are important for diverse cellular and zzso zzso especially those dependent on polarity zzso A subset of plant zzso referred to as group I, is distinct from zzso from other species in having evolved a unique zzso structure with a signal zzso a zzso potentially zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso We show here that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso tubes zzso the formation of zzso of zzso cables that project into the zzso from the cell membrane and that its zzso structure targets zzso to the cell zzso zzso tube zzso is a polar cell growth process dependent on an active and tightly regulated zzso zzso Slight increases in zzso stimulate growth, but its zzso zzso tube zzso growth zzso and growth arrest in transformed zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is important for the polar zzso cell growth zzso Moreover, severe membrane deformation was observed in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso tubes in which an abundance of zzso zzso zzso cables was zzso These observations suggest that regulated zzso activity at the cell surface is important for maintaining zzso cell membrane expansion for the polar extension of zzso zzso The cell zzso zzso zzso may play the zzso role as zzso of external stimuli to the zzso zzso and zzso could be important for zzso zzso signals from female zzso to elicit the proper zzso tube growth response during zzso
