Previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso of zzso receptors serve as platforms for the formation of a zzso signaling complex consisting of various interacting partners zzso et zzso 2009, Cell zzso 21, zzso zzso et zzso 2010, zzso zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso a zzso enriched scaffold protein associates with zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso in zzso an interaction that is altered upon zzso administration and enhanced upon zzso treatment for both zzso and zzso zzso association with the zzso receptors is zzso via the third zzso loop and a zzso region of the zzso zzso The portion of zzso responsible for interaction with the zzso and zzso is narrowed to a region encompassing zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of G proteins form a zzso complex using specific regions of zzso and a zzso zzso acid stretch of the zzso tails of both zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leaving unaffected the levels of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso indicated that the presence of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso of the zzso but not the zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso associates with both zzso and zzso and G protein zzso in zzso cells participating in a zzso signaling complex that displays a differential regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso
