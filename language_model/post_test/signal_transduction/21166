The zzso zzso zzso genes of most zzso organisms are arranged in one or more tandem zzso often termed zzso organizer zzso The biological implications of this tandem organization are not zzso We have tested the requirement for such a zzso organization by directly comparing the zzso and processing of zzso in zzso strains of zzso zzso that differ only in the organization of their zzso zzso zzso zzso carries the zzso zzso consisting of zzso copies of the zzso genes in a tandem array on zzso zzso zzso zzso has a complete deletion of the zzso zzso but carries many copies of a zzso that includes a single zzso zzso While this strain grows reasonably well, the average zzso activity of the zzso genes is substantially less than that of the zzso zzso However, there is little difference in the processing of the zzso zzso to the mature zzso and zzso zzso Thus, neither a zzso location nor a tandem repeat of the zzso genes is important for the assembly and function of the many protein and zzso molecules necessary for the processing of the zzso zzso We investigated the consequence of a dispersed gene arrangement on zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that in strain zzso the zzso zzso zzso rather than being confined to a defined zzso at the edge of the nucleus as it is in cells with the normal arrangement of zzso zzso is spread throughout the zzso This observation implies that each zzso zzso gene can serve as a zzso zzso Finally, data from zzso experiments show that the repression of zzso zzso due to failure of the zzso zzso is independent of whether the zzso genes are at the zzso locus on zzso zzso or on zzso This result suggests that the regulation of zzso zzso occurs at the level of soluble factors rather than zzso zzso
