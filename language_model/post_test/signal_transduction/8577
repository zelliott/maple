zzso resistance and disease zzso is a challenging clinical problem in the treatment of breast zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso zzso interaction between zzso (a primary zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso which regulates a number of human breast tumor cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso binding to zzso promotes zzso zzso which, in turn, increases the zzso of the stem cell marker, zzso in the breast tumor cell line zzso zzso zzso is then zzso from the zzso to the nucleus and becomes associated with zzso III zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This process leads to zzso zzso production and a tumor zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cell death zzso zzso All of these events contribute to zzso of zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso and chemotherapy zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso small interfering zzso effectively blocks zzso zzso signaling events, abrogates zzso production, and increases zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso signaling zzso causes zzso zzso zzso and zzso To further evaluate the role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells were also zzso with a specific zzso inhibitor in order to silence zzso expression and inhibit its target zzso Our results indicate that zzso inhibitor not only enhances zzso zzso binding but also blocks zzso tumor cell zzso Thus, this newly discovered zzso signaling zzso should provide important drug targets for zzso tumor cell zzso and overcoming chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer zzso
