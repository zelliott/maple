The development of an zzso state is a complex process involving the zzso of multiple independent zzso that lead to deregulation of cell zzso pathways central to the control of cell growth and cell zzso The ability to define cancer zzso recurrence of disease and response to specific therapies using DNA zzso gene expression signatures has been demonstrated in multiple zzso Various studies have also demonstrated the potential for using gene expression profiles for the analysis of zzso zzso Here we show that gene expression signatures can be identified that reflect the zzso status of several zzso zzso When evaluated in several large collections of human zzso these gene expression signatures identify patterns of zzso deregulation in zzso and clinically relevant associations with disease zzso Combining zzso predictions across several pathways identifies coordinated patterns of zzso deregulation that distinguish between specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso signatures further defines prognosis in respective patient subsets, demonstrating that patterns of zzso zzso deregulation zzso the development of the zzso zzso and reflect the biology and outcome of specific zzso zzso of zzso deregulation in cancer cell lines are also shown to predict the sensitivity to therapeutic agents that target components of the zzso Linking zzso deregulation with sensitivity to zzso that target components of the zzso provides an opportunity to make use of these zzso zzso signatures to guide the use of targeted zzso
