zzso zzso cells are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously we showed that the combination of zzso and zzso facilitated zzso zzso in these cells and enhanced cell surface expression of TRAIL zzso The aim of this study was to further characterize the mechanism by which these zzso zzso primary zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was active in zzso cells and this activity was significantly decreased after exposure to zzso A zzso zzso inhibitor zzso could enhance the zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso reinforcing the zzso role of zzso on TRAIL zzso In conclusion, zzso treatment zzso human zzso cells to zzso zzso through increased surface expression of TRAIL zzso increased expression of zzso and Bid, and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
