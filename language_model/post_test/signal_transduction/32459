The effects of different levels of zzso mercury zzso on zzso or zzso zzso signals were studied in zzso zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso did not alter the resting zzso free zzso concentration zzso but enhanced the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that these zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso current through zzso zzso Also, zzso treatment amplified the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso increase zzso by zzso was zzso At slightly higher zzso (1 to 2 zzso zzso caused a sustained rise of the resting zzso This increase did not occur in zzso medium and was prevented by zzso with zzso or with the zzso zzso channel blockers, zzso and zzso zzso did not mobilize zzso from zzso stores sensitive to zzso zzso or zzso At 2 zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The loss of the zzso zzso response to zzso was independent from the zzso overload elicit by zzso instead, it was associated with zzso of zzso zzso Exposure to the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso treatment with 2 zzso zzso caused cell zzso Our results show that zzso mercury has selective and different effects on zzso signaling in zzso cells depending on the zzso within a narrow zzso
