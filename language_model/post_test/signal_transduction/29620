The present paper reports on the results obtained in a rabbit model of prenatal cocaine exposure that mimics the zzso of crack cocaine in humans, and relates these findings to studies in other species including zzso A general finding is that prenatal exposure to cocaine during zzso produces zzso in signal zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cortical zzso development leading to permanent zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso and other brain zzso zzso in the precise effects obtained appear to be due to the dose, route and time of cocaine zzso Related to these effects of in zzso cocaine exposure, animals demonstrate permanent deficits in cognitive processes related to zzso focus that have been correlated with impairment of stimulus processing in the anterior zzso zzso The long-term cognitive deficits observed in various species are in agreement with recent reports indicating that persistent zzso and other cognitive deficits are evident in zzso children as they grow older and are challenged to master more complex cognitive zzso
