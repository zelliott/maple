The zzso zzso zzso is deficient in the transfer of zzso from root zzso and cortical cells to the zzso The zzso gene was identified by a zzso cloning zzso The zzso half of zzso is mainly zzso whereas the zzso half has six potential zzso zzso zzso shows no zzso with any characterized zzso zzso including the family of zzso zzso identified in plants and zzso zzso shows highest zzso with the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso leukemia zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso protein involved in the mating zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the roots and is zzso zzso under zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso reveal zzso expression of the zzso promoter in the zzso cells of the root and the lower part of the zzso There also is zzso zzso of zzso cells that are adjacent to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains 10 additional genes showing zzso with zzso Thus, zzso defines a novel class of proteins involved in zzso transport in zzso
