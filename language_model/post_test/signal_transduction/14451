zzso production of zzso requires that the zzso protein zzso be induced at end stages of differentiation in response to zzso zzso zzso The critical zzso pathways inhibited by zzso in zzso are zzso We used gene targeting in the mouse to evaluate the zzso factor zzso which is zzso zzso during zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are viable and zzso zzso blood counts revealed a profound zzso and zzso despite normal serum zzso levels and blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited massive zzso with zzso and bone zzso zzso and reduced zzso in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso populations were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were hypersensitive to zzso and resistant to zzso zzso by zzso deprivation and calcium zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso zzso revealed increased expression of cell cycle and zzso zzso including zzso and diminished expression of cell death and B zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso in opposition to the zzso zzso survival zzso appears indispensable for regulation of zzso production and maintenance of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and coordinated regulation of zzso and zzso zzso family members may represent a general regulatory paradigm in zzso
