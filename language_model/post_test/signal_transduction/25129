In zzso zzso zzso colon zzso cells, zzso death is zzso via zzso zzso zzso interactions after zzso deprivation and inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The objective of the study was to zzso whether other modes of DNA damage induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso could elicit a similar zzso response in zzso cells by signaling via the zzso death zzso After a zzso drug exposure, a loss in zzso survival that was not prevented by zzso was induced by each agent in the absence of acute zzso yielding zzso values of 5 zzso 10 zzso and 150 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cell clones selected for resistance to zzso zzso zzso were zzso to the induction of zzso death after zzso deprivation but were not zzso to zzso zzso or zzso A close correlation was found between acute induction of zzso (24 zzso and zzso expression of zzso at high zzso of each of the three agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was zzso dependent but zzso zzso At all drug zzso cell cycle distribution analyses demonstrated marked zzso of cells in the zzso zzso At zzso drug zzso prolonged arrest of zzso cells in zzso phase resulted in the zzso of zzso expression and the delayed appearance of zzso cells (6 zzso which could also be inhibited by the general zzso inhibitor zzso but not by zzso or zzso In zzso zzso zzso did not rescue cells treated with zzso in contrast to treatment with zzso or zzso stress, suggesting an irreversible commitment to cell death in zzso zzso zzso of zzso at all drug zzso appeared to be unrelated to the mechanism of drug-induced zzso This was in contrast to the zzso regulation of zzso death, which could be inhibited by blocking zzso zzso
