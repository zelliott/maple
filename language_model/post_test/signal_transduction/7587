zzso smoke zzso cellular zzso has been implicated in the zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease, and zzso a zzso zzso zzso this zzso presumably through the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso controls cellular zzso by eliminating damaged cellular components and is zzso regulated by zzso signaling through the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso a representative zzso family, has been demonstrated to activate zzso but a role for zzso in zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso we sought to investigate the regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso during zzso cellular zzso zzso expression levels were modulated by zzso and small interfering zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso of zzso were performed to evaluate zzso We demonstrated that zzso expression levels were decreased in lung zzso from chronic zzso pulmonary disease patients, and zzso expression levels correlated significantly with the percentage of forced zzso volume in 1 zzso vital zzso zzso extract zzso suppressed zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso activity enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso attenuated the zzso effect of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso via zzso regulation, which can be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso
