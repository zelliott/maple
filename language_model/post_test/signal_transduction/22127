Although many previous reports have examined the function of zzso zzso zzso in the migration and proliferation of various cell types, the role of the zzso zzso in human zzso stem cells zzso migration and proliferation has not been zzso The present study examined the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso migration and proliferation and its related signal zzso zzso zzso increased both cell migration and zzso and also increased zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth of zzso zzso also activated zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso and induced zzso level and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso decreased the level and organization of zzso In addition, specific zzso for TRIO and zzso protein zzso reduced the zzso increase in zzso migration and zzso Together, these experimental data demonstrate that zzso partially stimulates zzso migration and proliferation by interaction of zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
