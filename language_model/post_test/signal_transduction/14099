In the zzso nervous system, zzso are commonly surrounded by zzso a zzso sheath that is essential for precise and rapid zzso of nerve zzso In the peripheral nervous system zzso zzso zzso are formed by zzso cells which wrap around individual zzso While the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso are established zzso of peripheral zzso less is known about the functions of the related zzso growth factor zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Here, we report a peripheral neurodegenerative disease caused by increased zzso zzso Specifically, we characterize a zzso and zzso zzso zzso muscular zzso in transgenic mice zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso examination revealed a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and molecular analysis of signaling pathways showed reduced protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso in the nerves of zzso mice, indicating that the muscular zzso is secondary to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Crossing of zzso mice into an zzso background revealed the pathology to be completely zzso This mouse line provides a new model for studying molecular events associated with early stages of peripheral zzso an essential prerequisite for the development of successful therapeutic zzso
