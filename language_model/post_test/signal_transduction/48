Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso thought to be exclusively required for the development of the nervous system, are also involved in controlling zzso zzso Here, we show that primordial zzso formation is decreased in the absence of nerve growth factor zzso or its zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso This zzso is not due to premature zzso loss, because the zzso of zzso and zzso mice do not show an increased rate of zzso death zzso the initiation of zzso Moreover, exposure of zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso if zzso receptors are present, suggesting that the absence of zzso causes a zzso and not an zzso loss, of zzso zzso Both the number of secondary zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression are diminished in zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso lacking the common zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso zzso to zzso increases zzso gene expression and enhances the ability of the zzso to respond to zzso with formation of zzso zzso a cell cycle protein zzso the zzso actions of zzso in the zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso receptors are necessary for the timely assembly of primordial zzso and for sustaining early zzso zzso They also suggest that a mechanism by which zzso receptors facilitate subsequent zzso development is by inducing the formation of functional zzso
