The coordination of blood flow control in exercising skeletal muscle is exemplified by the interaction among muscle zzso nerves, and the smooth muscle and zzso cells which comprise the resistance zzso During functional zzso in active muscle, zzso flow exceeds resting values by zzso to zzso according to muscle fiber type and recruitment zzso The control of muscle blood flow is coordinated among many vessel zzso encompassing the resistance arteries external to the muscle and the zzso network embedded within the zzso As motor unit recruitment and zzso demand increase with exercise intensity, the locus of blood flow control zzso from zzso zzso which govern zzso zzso and flow distribution, into the zzso zzso and feed zzso which control the volume of flow into a zzso The organization of zzso responses within and among resistance vessels can be explained by the spread of zzso chemical, and physical signals between zzso and smooth muscle zzso These signals are triggered by substances released from muscle fibers and nerve terminals and by changes in zzso pressure and zzso zzso Thus, from several perspectives, zzso communication coordinates blood flow control in zzso with the zzso demands of active muscle zzso
