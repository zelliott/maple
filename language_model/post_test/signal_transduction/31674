zzso are potent zzso for immune and zzso zzso In the central nervous system, zzso play an important role in inflammatory responses through zzso of zzso zzso and/or resident zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso injury induced zzso production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso slice zzso In the present study, we examined zzso expression and protein production of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso injury in the slice zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso increased by zzso treatment in a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was produced predominantly in zzso zzso of zzso cells from the slice cultures by zzso with zzso zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso expression after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was partially but significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso conversely, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso These results, combined with our previous findings, demonstrate that zzso zzso injury zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso and zzso respectively, through zzso of different zzso signaling zzso
