zzso a decrease in oxygen tension occurring in pathological zzso has a profound effect on zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated cellular and molecular responses of zzso zzso zzso cells to low oxygen zzso Our study revealed that zzso induced zzso cells zzso and cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso The result of Western zzso showed that the expression of zzso related signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso was activated under zzso The result of zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor zzso B zzso was also increased by hypoxic zzso Furthermore, gene expression profiles of zzso zzso induced by zzso showed that zzso treatment may alter expression of genes related to zzso survival, cell cycle, metabolism and structural zzso
