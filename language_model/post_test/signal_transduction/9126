zzso zzso have been found in all types of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Latest research has focused only on the zzso zzso zzso However, previous studies have also indicated the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to show the decrease of zzso zzso formation and protein zzso A zzso activity after stimulation of zzso or zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied using zzso zzso The zzso concentration was determined with an zzso zzso and zzso activity was estimated by the consumption of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso revealed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso In bovine zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso formation was decreased and zzso activity was inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner zzso 

The findings indicate that stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells resulting in decreased protein zzso A zzso Further work will be needed to clarify the zzso role of this signaling zzso in zzso zzso and zzso
