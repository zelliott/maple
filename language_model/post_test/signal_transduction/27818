zzso of zzso fields requires mechanisms to coordinate zzso decisions made by populations of zzso Evidence is accumulating that the necessary information is provided by localized sources of zzso zzso proteins which act as zzso We review evidence that zzso zzso and zzso proteins act as zzso in the developing wing of zzso and discuss recent work illustrating that zzso helps to shape their activity zzso by regulating zzso distribution and by modulating the responsiveness of target zzso These studies suggest that there is more to being a zzso than formation of a zzso zzso by passive zzso
