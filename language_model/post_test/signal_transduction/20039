zzso prevents premature aging, suggesting a link to genes that regulate zzso Further characterization of zzso mice revealed that these mice develop zzso insulin resistance, and zzso intolerance similar to those seen in mice lacking two key zzso regulators, Silent information regulator zzso zzso and zzso While the roles of zzso and zzso in metabolism have been well zzso their upstream regulators are not well zzso We found that zzso is important in regulating energy metabolism by accumulating in response to zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased fatty acid zzso Moreover, we found that zzso lowers blood zzso levels in response to zzso Restoration of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice rescued some of the zzso defects of the zzso zzso Our study defines a role for zzso in metabolism and weight zzso
