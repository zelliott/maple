The zzso plays an important role in the differentiation of the zzso zzso and the neural zzso We have analyzed the role of the zzso in zzso differentiation and subsequent formation of the zzso column using a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso the skeletal zzso is most probably a result of zzso and subsequent loss of the zzso The zzso gene is known to interact with zzso zzso a zzso zzso Double zzso between zzso and zzso zzso show an increase in the severity of the zzso mainly in the zzso parts of the zzso We also show that part of the zzso zzso is zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso As zzso is known to be caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso we analyzed zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression is reduced, providing a potential molecular basis for the genetic interaction zzso A complete loss of zzso expression in zzso intact zzso was found in the lower zzso region, which is zzso very similar to the corresponding region in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso coincide closely, both in time and space, with zzso changes, as determined by zzso T zzso zzso These findings indicate that an intact zzso is necessary for normal zzso expression in zzso cells, which is in turn required for the formation of the zzso parts of the zzso The observed correlation among structural changes of the zzso zzso expression levels and skeletal zzso suggests that zzso might be an intrinsic zzso of zzso signals during the zzso zzso of zzso
