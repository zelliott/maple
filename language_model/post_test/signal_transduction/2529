zzso stress, the zzso component of zzso forces, activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in cultured vascular zzso cells to induce the zzso zzso of many immediate early zzso It appears that zzso zzso zzso and the structural integrity of zzso are important factors involved in these zzso zzso zzso The underlying molecular events were investigated by the application of a zzso stress of 12 zzso on bovine zzso zzso cells zzso We found that such a zzso stress increased the zzso zzso and the zzso activity of focal zzso zzso zzso and its association with growth factor zzso binding protein 2 zzso in a rapid and transient manner, suggesting that zzso may be linked to these zzso protein zzso signaling pathways through a zzso Son of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a dominant negative zzso of zzso attenuated the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a dominant negative zzso of zzso in which the zzso zzso exchange domain has been deleted, also attenuated zzso stress zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with a blocking type zzso zzso zzso zzso had similar zzso effects in these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso microscopic observation further demonstrated that zzso tended to cluster with zzso zzso near the zzso side of the sheared zzso These results demonstrate that zzso signaling is critical in the zzso zzso dual zzso of zzso and zzso
