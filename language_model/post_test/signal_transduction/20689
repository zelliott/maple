zzso factors that bind to zzso elements zzso regulate the expression of target genes in response to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It is generally thought that zzso is obtained through direct zzso by the zzso protein zzso We have isolated the gene zzso zzso zzso which encodes multiple members of the zzso protein family, by zzso alternative zzso Various zzso have been zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the function of the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso Multiple zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in zzso as well as in zzso by zzso Although there is no effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso DNA zzso we observed a dramatic effect on the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso shows that the zzso potential of zzso zzso is strongly reduced by zzso This represents the first example of negative regulation of a zzso factor of this class by zzso
