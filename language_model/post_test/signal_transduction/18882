zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an essential zzso signaling element that acts through its two zzso zzso zzso inducing both proliferation of zzso cells and vascular zzso Given the importance of zzso and zzso to early pregnancy, it is of interest to understand the mechanisms regulating vascular development at this zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso and receptors are zzso during zzso zzso in an unique animal model, the zzso a species displaying zzso embryonic zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso during early pregnancy and established the mechanisms of this zzso We demonstrate that activated zzso zzso zzso and that expression of zzso zzso protein in the zzso is dependent upon direct contact with invading zzso cells during zzso Using mink zzso zzso cells zzso with mink zzso promoter driving the zzso reporter zzso we show that zzso zzso promoter zzso and that this response can be eliminated by blockade of protein zzso zzso Treatment with zzso to zzso receptors zzso and zzso eliminated the zzso response in zzso zzso zzso studies of the promoter revealed that a region of 99 zzso upstream of the zzso start site is required for zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso found within the 99 zzso completely eliminated the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso confirmed binding of the zzso and zzso zzso factors to the zzso mink zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso associated with the promoter region containing the zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso and thus zzso vascular development, acting through its receptors zzso and zzso provoking protein zzso A zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso
