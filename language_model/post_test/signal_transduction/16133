zzso 3 zzso is a valuable diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the efficacy of targeting zzso at the zzso level, we used zzso interference to examine the zzso and molecular effects of zzso suppression in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso small interfering zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso together with cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase, zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso suppression significantly correlated with transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at both zzso and protein zzso The effects of zzso suppression by zzso can be zzso by addition of human zzso zzso to zzso cells in culture, suggesting the possible involvement of zzso in growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso partially attenuated the effects of zzso suppression on cell zzso cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirming the involvement of zzso in zzso growth zzso In zzso zzso suppression significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso accompanied by increased zzso zzso reduced cell proliferation zzso by zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and enhanced zzso (by zzso zzso In conclusion, molecular targeting of zzso at the zzso level offers an effective option for the clinical management of zzso zzso zzso
