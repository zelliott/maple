We introduce a novel dynamic model of stem cell and tissue zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cellular and tissue level of description, this model links a broad spectrum of experimental observations encompassing zzso confined cell zzso directed cell migration, multiple cell lineage decisions and zzso zzso zzso simulations we demonstrate that the model is capable of zzso describing and predicting the dynamic zzso of the zzso tissue during steady state as well as after cell damage and following selective gain or loss of gene function zzso affecting zzso and zzso Our simulation results suggest that zzso and flexibility of cellular decisions are key elements of robust tissue zzso of the zzso We predict that the tissue should be able to fully recover after complete elimination of cellular zzso including zzso deemed to be functional stem zzso This challenges current views of tissue stem cell zzso
