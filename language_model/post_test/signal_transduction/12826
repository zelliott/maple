To evaluate the significance of zzso double minute 2 zzso zzso in human breast cancer as a zzso shuttling zzso an zzso zzso zzso alpha regulator, and a zzso marker and to study how zzso is zzso we investigated its status in tissue samples and examined the correlation between zzso and zzso gene zzso status, and zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso in both nucleus and zzso by zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso absence of zzso zzso involvement, and increased levels of zzso alpha zzso Our molecular zzso found no point zzso in zzso but there was a correlation between zzso zzso and the lack of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the distribution of zzso reflects its zzso shuttling zzso that interaction between zzso and zzso for tumor progression is not enhanced by point zzso at zzso zzso and that the expression of zzso zzso zzso is a reason for the lack of its zzso zzso zzso zzso with favorable zzso zzso A decreased level of zzso will lead to a zzso from the zzso alpha signaling zzso
