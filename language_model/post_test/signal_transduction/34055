zzso zzso zzso involves liver zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso The transition towards zzso inflammation represents a key step in zzso because it will set the stage for further liver damage, culminating in zzso fibrosis, zzso and liver zzso The actual risk factors that drive zzso inflammation during the progression to NASH remain largely zzso The role of zzso and dietary cholesterol in the zzso of zzso NASH was investigated using zzso mouse models fed a Western zzso zzso of male and female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse models were compared with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice after short-term feeding with a high-fat diet with cholesterol zzso and without zzso Whereas zzso mice displayed only zzso after a short-term zzso diet, female zzso and zzso mice showed zzso with severe inflammation characterized by zzso of zzso and increased nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso male zzso and zzso mice developed severe zzso inflammation in the absence of zzso after 7 days on an zzso diet compared with zzso zzso An zzso diet induced zzso zzso zzso cells in male and female zzso and zzso zzso zzso inflammation was found to be linked to increased plasma very zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso cholesterol from the zzso diet lowered plasma zzso cholesterol and prevented the development of inflammation and zzso foam zzso 

These findings indicate that dietary cholesterol, possibly in the form of modified plasma zzso is an important risk factor for the progression to zzso inflammation in zzso zzso
