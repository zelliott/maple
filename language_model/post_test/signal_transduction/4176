zzso zzso the zzso agent of rice blast disease, zzso a specialized infection cell, an zzso that is required for infection of its zzso Previously, zzso was implicated in the zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso To obtain direct evidence for the role of zzso in zzso formation, the gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso designed after highly zzso regions in the same gene from other organisms were used to amplify zzso DNA zzso The cloned amplification products were used to identify zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated that zzso is present as a single copy in the zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso including three short zzso sufficient to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso shares zzso zzso identity with other zzso zzso and contains all functional motifs and zzso with the addition of a zzso region at the N zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso had been replaced with a zzso resistance gene zzso were unable to produce zzso could not be induced to form zzso by zzso and were zzso on susceptible rice, even when leaves were zzso These results were confirmed by analysis of 57 progeny from a cross between zzso zzso and the zzso laboratory strain zzso Other aspects of growth and development, including zzso growth as well as asexual and sexual zzso were unaffected when measured in zzso These results provide direct evidence that the zzso protein zzso is necessary for zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso
