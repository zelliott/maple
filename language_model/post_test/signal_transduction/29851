The zzso zzso a member of the G protein coupled zzso family mediates the cellular actions of zzso in the zzso A considerable amount of information regarding its structure, mechanism of zzso and regulation of expression has emerged in recent zzso Here we provide a brief overview of the current information on the structural organization of the zzso and the mechanism of zzso zzso signaling as well as an in-depth discussion on recent developments pertaining to the regulation of zzso zzso Specifically, we describe studies from our laboratory showing that the zzso regulation of the zzso involves an zzso zzso zzso zzso We also propose a model to explain the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels during zzso zzso
