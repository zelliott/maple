zzso zzso zzso a constituent of zzso bears various beneficial effects on neuroendocrine zzso Previous studies have indicated that zzso can enhance zzso release in zzso and differentiated zzso cells via the protein zzso A zzso signaling zzso We hypothesized that zzso stimulates rat zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso proliferation and zzso by promoting the cell cycle at all regulatory zzso This mechanism is partly zzso via the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which zzso promotes cell cycle zzso from the zzso zzso The cell cycle zzso of these cells were determined using flow zzso DNA zzso Analysis of the zzso cell cycle revealed that zzso may affect all zzso of the cell cycle and accelerate cell cycle zzso by stimulating zzso phase zzso to S and zzso zzso The cell cycle zzso were decreased by zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Compared with the zzso group, the zzso inhibitor zzso produced a marked decrease in the zzso cell cycle zzso by zzso zzso phase from zzso to the S zzso These results support the position that zzso exerts a zzso effect on cell cycle zzso to promote zzso cell zzso The result also suggests that the division rate is zzso via the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
