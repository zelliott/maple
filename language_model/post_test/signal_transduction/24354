Human zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that exerts a zzso effect in multiple sclerosis and zzso lateral zzso Clinical application of human zzso however, was prevented by high toxicity at higher zzso Human zzso elicits cellular responses by induction of a zzso complex consisting of the zzso zzso zzso which is not involved in signal zzso and the zzso zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso Previous studies with rat zzso demonstrated that rat zzso is unable to interact with the human zzso zzso whereas at high zzso it can directly induce a signaling zzso of human zzso and human zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that human zzso cannot directly induce a zzso of human zzso and zzso However, human zzso can use both the zzso and the soluble human zzso as a substitute for its zzso zzso and thus widen the target spectrum of human zzso Engineering a zzso human zzso zzso may therefore be a prerequisite to improving the safety profile of zzso
