The zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso in cultured zzso cells as well as the underlying mechanism were zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso caused the loss of cell zzso which was associated with the zzso in zzso rate, the formation of zzso oxygen species and the disruption of zzso zzso zzso It was also shown that zzso significantly induced zzso of zzso ratio and zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso reversed these zzso and had its maximum protective effect at 1 zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso since zzso failed to rescue cells from zzso insult in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the downstream zzso of zzso zzso was activated by erythropoietin, and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on zzso oxygen species levels was also blocked by zzso zzso These results show that zzso may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson zzso
