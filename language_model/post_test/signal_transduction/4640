The extra domain A zzso zzso zzso an alternatively spliced form of the zzso zzso protein zzso is predominantly expressed in various zzso but not in normal zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential zzso effects of extra domain A zzso vascular zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We detected the expressions of zzso and zzso in 52 human zzso tumor zzso and their surrounding zzso by zzso analysis, and further tested the correlation between the expressions of these two proteins in aforementioned zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were abundantly expressed in the specimens of human zzso zzso And zzso was associated with increased expression of zzso in human zzso according to linear zzso zzso Besides, zzso expression was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso tumor differentiation and clinical stage by zzso analysis of tissue zzso containing tumor zzso of 115 zzso zzso Then, human zzso cell zzso was zzso with zzso to elicit expression of zzso against zzso zzso and zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso was zzso in zzso cells, and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso signaling zzso was found to be involved in zzso zzso zzso The in zzso result demonstrated that zzso could promote tumor growth and zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso Our findings provide evidence that zzso could play a role in zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cancer, which is associated with the zzso zzso
