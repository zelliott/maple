The traditional scheme for asthma zzso depends on increased T helper type 2 zzso over T helper type 1 zzso responses to allergic and zzso stimuli and zzso airway zzso zzso and zzso Here we question whether the innate immune system, including airway zzso cells, and the zzso one may manifest an zzso zzso response as an additional basis for chronic inflammatory diseases, including zzso 

We focused on the signal zzso and genetic basis for zzso zzso inflammation and zzso especially in relation to airway zzso We concentrated on the response to zzso because these agents are closely associated with common acute and chronic airway zzso We used zzso cellular and mouse models, as well as human subjects, for study and made comparisons among these zzso Our approach aims to answer 2 major questions: zzso what are the factors that control acute zzso zzso and zzso how can these transient infections cause long term airway zzso 

Our studies show that zzso defense depends on a special network of zzso immune response genes that signal to the zzso immune zzso zzso zzso trigger this network, but it is also permanently activated in zzso even in the absence of viral zzso In addition, we find that, in susceptible genetic backgrounds, respiratory viruses cause a zzso phenomenon indicated by the development of an zzso zzso long after the infection has zzso On the basis of this information, we developed a new scheme for asthma zzso that includes zzso viral and allergic components and allows viral zzso of host zzso
