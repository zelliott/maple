Previous results indicated that intravenous injection of copper in the form of a zzso complex in rats triggers the zzso induction of the zzso form of zzso oxide zzso zzso Here, the authors demonstrate that copper activates the zzso factor zzso in the liver and lung zzso of rats, and that this effect is zzso by zzso stress, since all zzso changes, which include zzso zzso formation of zzso vascular pressure drop, production of tumor necrosis zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso are readily prevented by zzso of the animals with the zzso zzso By using zzso mobility shift zzso the zzso zzso and higher molecular weight zzso have been found to be involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene involved in the inflammatory response, was also zzso induced by copper, this effect being reduced in the presence of zzso These results suggest that a zzso status, characterized by zzso situations, may lead to the onset of inflammation through production of zzso and zzso of zzso
