The area of contact between a T cell and an zzso cell zzso is known as the zzso zzso Although its exact function is unknown, one model suggests that it allows for T cell zzso zzso zzso and for sustained signaling in T cells for many zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso T cells occurred primarily at the periphery of the zzso and was largely abated before mature zzso zzso had zzso These data suggest that many hours of zzso signaling are not required for T cell zzso These observations challenge current ideas about the role of zzso zzso in T cell zzso
