zzso play a significant role in vascular development and zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, while zzso signaling results in the stabilization of vessel structure, zzso has been linked to vascular zzso The ratio of these two zzso zzso is thus critical for vascular stability and zzso This study identifies a mechanism of growth zzso reduction in zzso expression in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso within 4 zzso with a subsequent decrease in zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso rates revealed that zzso stimulation did not alter zzso zzso rates, but instead induced a zzso mechanism of rapid zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was reduced by at least 50% after zzso zzso The zzso zzso turnover mechanism was dependent on several zzso zzso including zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso which did not significantly activate zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso expression through zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso adjust zzso expression through multiple mechanisms, including changes in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso
