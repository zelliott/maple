zzso zzso zzso is one of two principal zzso for the entry of zzso into target zzso zzso is known to form zzso We previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso of viral zzso protein II zzso is the major zzso for zzso recognition, and that zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso Interestingly, an zzso acid analogue of zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed an even higher binding affinity and strong zzso activity in zzso the replication of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso linked two zzso peptides with the formation of a zzso bond between the two zzso zzso present in the zzso sequence to generate a zzso zzso potentially capable of interacting with two zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited enhanced binding affinity and zzso activity compared with those of zzso zzso zzso binding site mapping experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso on zzso binding sites, including several zzso zzso zzso located close to the zzso side and the zzso of zzso This finding was supported by the molecular modeling of zzso zzso zzso interaction based on the crystal structure of zzso which showed that zzso zzso is capable of interacting with the zzso zzso structure by allowing the zzso of each zzso zzso to reach into the binding pocket of zzso zzso The development of this zzso zzso provides a tool for further probing the functions of zzso zzso and studying zzso zzso with other zzso
