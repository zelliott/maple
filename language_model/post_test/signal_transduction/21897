Reliable procedures to induce neural commitment of zzso zzso embryonic stem zzso cells have provided new tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate zzso We extensively characterized the zzso potential of zzso neural cells obtained using an adaptation of the zzso induction zzso We provided evidence that zzso neural zzso cells are endowed with stem cell properties such as extensive zzso capacity and zzso zzso In zzso conditions, cells matured exclusively into zzso zzso and zzso All these features have been previously described in only zzso neural stem cells zzso zzso we consider it more appropriate to zzso our cells zzso zzso These similarities between the two zzso populations induced us to carefully compare their proliferation ability and differentiation zzso Although they were very similar in overall behavior, we scored specific zzso For instance, zzso zzso proliferated at higher rate and consistently generated a higher number of zzso compared with zzso zzso To further investigate their zzso we carried out a molecular analysis comparing their zzso profiles during zzso We observed a large fraction of shared expressed zzso including genes previously described to be critical in defining zzso zzso zzso Among the genes differently zzso candidate genes possibly responsible for zzso between the two cell types were selected and further zzso In particular, we showed that an enhanced zzso zzso protein zzso signaling is acting in zzso zzso probably triggered by zzso growth zzso This may contribute to the high proliferation rate exhibited by these cells in zzso
