zzso an zzso binding zzso zzso zzso networks and promotes zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been reported in several human zzso zzso stimulates cell migration, invasion, and experimental zzso However, the underlying mechanism is not still zzso In the present study, we therefore evaluated the possibility that zzso could be appropriate as a molecular target for cancer gene zzso In 70 primary oral zzso cell zzso and 10 normal oral zzso zzso zzso expression was evaluated by zzso zzso and the correlations of the zzso of zzso with zzso factors were zzso zzso of zzso was detected in 32 of 70 oral zzso cell zzso significantly more frequently than in normal oral zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in higher grade zzso according to T zzso N zzso and invasive zzso Moreover, zzso decrease in zzso expression reduced zzso zzso of zzso expression increased the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso also reduced zzso expression via zzso zzso These results consistently indicate that the zzso of zzso is strongly associated with an aggressive zzso of oral zzso cell zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso could be a potential molecular target of gene therapy by zzso targeting in oral zzso cell zzso
