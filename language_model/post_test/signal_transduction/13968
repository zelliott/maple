zzso zzso metabolism has a critical function in zzso functions in mature T cells, but zzso data linking defects in zzso signals with altered zzso development are zzso To study the effect of increased zzso metabolism in zzso development, we engineered a zzso zzso active version of zzso zzso zzso We show that transgenic expression of zzso active zzso leads to zzso defects in T cells, with a marked zzso of immature zzso zzso and a reduction in positive selected zzso These zzso are reflected in the periphery by a zzso cell imbalance and general zzso zzso The results link zzso metabolism to zzso zzso and show that correctly controlled generation and consumption of this zzso at the plasma membrane ensure zzso passage through quality-control checkpoints during zzso
