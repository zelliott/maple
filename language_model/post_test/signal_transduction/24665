The effects of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested on the dysfunction of neurotransmitter and signal zzso systems and zzso damage 7 days after transient zzso zzso in zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso binding sites were mapped by in zzso quantitative zzso zzso All zzso used in the present study decreased significantly in the zzso zzso 7 days after zzso In zzso animals, zzso with zzso failed to protect against decreased zzso binding in the zzso 7 days after zzso Moreover, in a zzso study, zzso and zzso of zzso failed to show protective effects against zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso without maintaining body temperature, prevented the zzso death of zzso zzso 7 days after zzso These results weaken the hypothesis that zzso zzso may play a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso damage after transient zzso zzso
