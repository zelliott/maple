The zzso cell surface zzso zzso has been implicated in cellular signaling during growth and differentiation in the zzso and nervous zzso Because zzso expression is induced early in development in sensory and sympathetic zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso We zzso zzso cells from zzso sympathetic zzso on immobilized zzso zzso or zzso against other cell surface zzso We show here that zzso an zzso zzso that has been shown previously to activate zzso cells in zzso promotes robust zzso outgrowth from sympathetic zzso that is greater than that on other zzso surfaces and is comparable to zzso outgrowth on a collagen zzso In addition, zzso causes dramatic zzso changes in zzso and zzso from zzso zzso including a zzso of these zzso Because zzso interacts with zzso in many cell types including zzso cells, and specifically with the zzso zzso in some cells, we tested whether the effect of zzso on zzso outgrowth is zzso by this zzso An zzso zzso Ralph zzso zzso the extent of zzso outgrowth on zzso and zzso but not on zzso Because the zzso zzso has been shown to mediate zzso outgrowth on different zzso these results provide a functional significance for the zzso zzso downstream signaling may be activated by this zzso interaction on the cell surface in response to external cues that promote zzso zzso
