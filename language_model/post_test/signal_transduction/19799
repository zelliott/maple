The zzso factor zzso type zzso zzso belongs to the family of G zzso zzso The zzso possesses an zzso zzso signal zzso that is unable to mediate targeting of the nascent chain to the zzso zzso membrane during early zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso remains zzso and consequently forms an additional zzso zzso domain with unknown function that is unique within the large G zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we have analyzed the functional significance of this domain in comparison with the conventional signal zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso type 1 zzso We show that the presence of the zzso signal zzso leads to a very low cell surface zzso expression of the zzso in comparison with the zzso Moreover, whereas the presence of the zzso signal zzso did not affect zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was zzso The properties zzso by the zzso signal zzso were entirely zzso to the zzso in signal zzso exchange zzso Taken together, our results show that signal peptides do not only influence early protein zzso In the case of the zzso factor zzso zzso the use of conventional and zzso signal peptides have an unexpected influence on signal zzso
