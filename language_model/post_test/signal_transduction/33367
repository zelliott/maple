We investigated, in dog zzso zzso the ability of the dog zzso zzso zzso to interact with the zzso G proteins expressed in this zzso zzso of the zzso led to increased incorporation of the zzso zzso analog zzso zzso into zzso alpha zzso of three G protein families: zzso zzso zzso This effect was not due to a general loss of zzso G protein specificity since zzso in the same membrane zzso only zzso the binding of the zzso analog to the alpha zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the multiple zzso of the dog zzso zzso in intact cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso experiments were zzso When zzso were zzso with zzso toxin zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased by approximately zzso with zzso at 1 zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso coupled to both zzso and zzso in zzso On the other hand, no increase in zzso zzso nor zzso zzso was observed in the presence of zzso These data in intact cells are thus in contradiction with those obtained in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso may zzso a specificity which itself may reflect a zzso and organization of the different components zzso G zzso zzso in the plasma membrane of intact zzso As in some cells, zzso activates zzso by hormone activated zzso zzso we tested its role in the stimulation by zzso of the proliferation of zzso This was not affected by zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso does not involve zzso
