Bone cells can be exposed to high calcium in the course of zzso zzso To investigate the effects of high calcium on bone cell function, responses of a rat zzso cell line zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the cells to zzso hormone, zzso F1 zzso and zzso was assessed by measuring calcium zzso zzso by these zzso Raising the medium calcium from zzso to 50 zzso did not alter cell zzso zzso of the cells with the calcium pump inhibitor sodium zzso prevented zzso hormone effects and slightly decreased zzso F1 alpha effects in both normal and high zzso The effect of zzso was prolonged in high calcium when zzso was zzso The results suggest that cells of the zzso zzso can maintain calcium signaling in the presence of high zzso zzso These processes could play a role in the therapeutic effectiveness of high calcium in zzso zzso
