We have studied the function of the zinc finger zzso factor zzso in auditory system development by zzso zzso profiles of gene expression during differentiation of zzso zzso cell lines derived to model specific auditory cell types and zzso zzso We tested and applied a novel zzso method called the gamma Model for zzso zzso to zzso zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso zzso levels estimated by this method correlated closely zzso across a zzso range with those measured by quantitative zzso for a sample of 61 different zzso In an unbiased list of 26 genes whose zzso profiles clustered most closely with that of zzso in all cell lines, 10 were linked to zzso Growth Factor zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was associated with a decrease in expression of genes linked to zzso including zzso zzso and several zzso zzso It also led to a small decrease in protein levels of the zzso zzso zzso a dramatic increase in zzso protein and relocation of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a known target of zzso simultaneously zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice the expression of zzso correlated with high levels of activated zzso This functional relationship could explain the diverse function of zzso during development, the hearing loss associated with zzso zzso zzso mice and the broader symptoms of human patients with zzso anomaly zzso
