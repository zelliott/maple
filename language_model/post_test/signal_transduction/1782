We recently introduced an zzso zzso approach where pharmacological zzso can be used to reveal zzso zzso zzso in a temporally controlled zzso This approach takes advantage of zzso between pharmacological and genetic zzso to alter the function of specific signaling zzso For example, mice zzso for a point zzso zzso in the zzso zzso II zzso gene show normal learning and zzso However, a concentration of an zzso zzso zzso zzso that does not affect learning in zzso zzso zzso reveals learning deficits in this zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso application of a concentration of zzso zzso zzso ineffective in zzso zzso slices induced deficits in zzso slices in zzso long-term zzso zzso a mechanism thought to be involved in learning and zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the expression or maintenance of zzso in zzso slices from zzso zzso Thus, this zzso approach allowed us to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is required during the induction but not maintenance of zzso This ability to temporally induce zzso zzso zzso could be zzso to a broad range of problems and genetic zzso
