zzso zzso is a zzso protein present in bodily zzso and zzso It is subject to multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso receptors regulates zzso zzso that affect processes such as zzso migration, invasion, zzso and cell zzso A variety of cells and zzso express zzso including bone, zzso zzso inflammatory cells and numerous zzso zzso zzso zzso roles include regulation of immune functions, vascular zzso wound repair and zzso zzso zzso also is expressed in many zzso and elevated levels in patients' zzso tissue and blood are associated with poor zzso zzso growth is regulated by interactions between zzso cells and their tissue zzso Within a zzso mass, zzso can be expressed by both zzso cells and cellular components of the zzso zzso and both zzso and normal cells may have receptors able to bind to zzso zzso can also be found as a component of the zzso zzso The functional roles of zzso in a zzso are thus complex, with zzso zzso by both zzso cells and cells in the zzso zzso both of which can in turn respond to zzso Much remains to be learned about the zzso between normal and zzso cells within a zzso and the role of multiple forms of zzso in these zzso zzso zzso interactions within a zzso will be important for the development of therapeutic strategies to target zzso
