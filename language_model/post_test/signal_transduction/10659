This review will outline examples of the zzso focused zzso approaches to studying signal zzso pathways in smooth zzso By focusing the use of traditional zzso techniques with zzso selection methods, this approach efficiently addresses the identification of novel elements in a signal zzso zzso of zzso However, focused zzso serves only as a starting point in the investigation of novel signaling zzso While focused zzso studies can suggest the involvement and general zzso function of a protein in a signaling pathway, these findings must be further investigated and zzso Through the integrated use of focused zzso with complementary approaches such as zzso zzso and cell zzso a complete and detailed mechanism of signal zzso can be zzso
