zzso of zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso by zzso zzso allows zzso zzso protein binding to zzso zzso which include the zzso zzso This zzso switch zzso zzso zzso in a cell culture zzso Here, we generated an zzso recognizing zzso zzso at the zzso binding sites zzso and zzso to determine the zzso status of zzso using a rat model of zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contents in isolated zzso were measured by western zzso Before experimental zzso both zzso and zzso were zzso and most of the zzso was zzso Before the onset of overt zzso however, zzso of both zzso and zzso rapidly decreased and became almost zzso During this period, the amount of zzso in zzso began to decrease, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso of patients with minimal change zzso was significantly decreased compared with that in normal zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso of zzso by regulating zzso formation may be important for the maintenance of normal zzso zzso and zzso
