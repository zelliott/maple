The effects of zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso and high zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Two human brain zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as model cellular zzso zzso channel zzso and increased zzso zzso concentration inhibited zzso cell growth in a zzso fashion in both cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso channel zzso and high zzso zzso Thus, these results suggest that zzso channel zzso are effective zzso of brain zzso cell growth and that their growth regulation may be due to the interference with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
