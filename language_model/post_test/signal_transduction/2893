The zzso factors zzso and zzso have been shown to be essential for zzso zzso zzso expression in activated T zzso zzso has been previously reported to bind to two sites in the zzso promoter: in association with zzso at the zzso zzso response element at zzso and at zzso On the basis of zzso I zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel shift zzso and zzso experiments, we have identified three additional zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso all five zzso sites are essential for the full induction of promoter activity in response to zzso zzso zzso Four of the five zzso sites are part of composite elements able to bind zzso in association with zzso These sites display a diverse range of zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso proteins for zzso One of the zzso sites directly zzso the zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso component in zzso composite zzso These findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso
