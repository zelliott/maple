The zzso alpha zzso of the signal zzso zzso protein complex, which stimulates zzso zzso zzso incorporated less of the zzso probe, zzso in extracts from zzso cell lines in comparison with zzso cell lines derived from mouse lung zzso zzso experiments using zzso alpha zzso demonstrated that tumor cells do not have a decreased amount of zzso alpha and zzso of tumor cell zzso alpha increased when the rate of zzso exchange was zzso zzso tumor cell zzso alpha function may be zzso zzso with this hypothesis is the observation that the tumor cells exhibited decreased responsiveness to the zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso in growing zzso cells was reduced to a level resembling that observed in tumor cells, but zzso increased when cells became zzso This increase in zzso incorporation into zzso alpha by normal cells at zzso was not seen in the zzso zzso Since zzso alpha zzso was zzso zzso to the percentage of zzso zzso at zzso we suggest that the altered zzso alpha in tumor cells is involved in the loss of cell growth zzso
