Human zzso is an zzso cell zzso zzso Its large zzso domain rapidly zzso zzso especially zzso released from activated zzso zzso further zzso zzso Previous studies using our zzso soluble zzso demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso We now report effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on full-length zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso modified zzso was less than zzso contrasting the enhanced activity of their soluble zzso Furthermore, conservative zzso zzso and zzso led to zzso with activities greater than the zzso modified zzso but less than zzso zzso in zzso activities were primarily associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity were not attributable to gross changes in the zzso binding pocket or the zzso ability to zzso Thus, composition of the active site of zzso zzso appears zzso for zzso function in the context of the zzso zzso
