zzso a zzso zzso is released from metabolically active cells into zzso space and plays an important role in various zzso zzso zzso regulates many biological responses including inflammation by the interaction with their receptors such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be expressed in zzso zzso To the end, zzso zzso have been reported to have an zzso zzso In our continuous efforts to develop new zzso agents, we found a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was a potent human zzso zzso The study was designed to investigate whether zzso has an zzso potential in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells and mouse zzso model in zzso zzso exhibited an effective zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso was suppressed by the treatment of zzso in the protein and zzso levels in zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso Further examination revealed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding activity, and zzso zzso In addition, in in zzso zzso mouse zzso model, zzso exerted the increase of survival rate compared to zzso zzso The analysis of the protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso was also suppressed by the zzso groups in lung zzso These results suggest that zzso might have an zzso activity through the zzso of zzso zzso expression by modulating zzso and zzso signaling zzso
