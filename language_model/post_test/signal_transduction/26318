zzso affects insulin resistance and is a risk factor for diabetes zzso type 2 zzso and zzso diabetes zzso zzso Two single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso were predicted to zzso zzso for zzso Here, we show using patch clamp analysis and total internal reflection zzso zzso that insulin stimulates zzso activity via a zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cell surface expression of zzso Interestingly, insulin failed to activate the genetic zzso zzso and zzso which is likely due to the inability of the insulin signaling zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, by measuring total zzso zzso zzso in zzso pregnant women as a measure of zzso control, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are associated with higher zzso and zzso a higher likelihood of developing zzso The impaired response of zzso and zzso to insulin represents a unique molecular zzso leading to zzso where the zzso is located in zzso
