The zzso of zzso zzso is a well-established model for DNA damage response zzso zzso However, the molecular basis of the observed cell death resistance in the zzso of these animals remains zzso We established a set of techniques to study zzso zzso DNA damage generation and zzso zzso in a whole intact zzso Our zzso analyses reveal that, although zzso and zzso cells show similar levels of inflicted DNA damage, zzso cells, differently from zzso cells, do not activate the crucial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso signaling proteins are zzso in all zzso cells and this is due to zzso zzso However, DNA repair genes are expressed and zzso cells retain the ability to efficiently repair DNA zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso cells, when induced to zzso into zzso cells within the zzso lose the ability to activate zzso Overall, these observations provide a molecular mechanism for the known, but zzso zzso resistance to DNA zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the observed lack of signaling and cell death but retention of DNA repair functions in the zzso is a zzso zzso strategy to cope with its lack of adult zzso stem cell pools and zzso zzso
