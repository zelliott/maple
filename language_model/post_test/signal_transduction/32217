It has been known for more than a decade that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in the zzso nerve terminals zzso the adrenal zzso Both zzso are robust zzso for zzso release from zzso zzso Here, we review the unique contribution of zzso to the functioning of the zzso zzso in zzso While zzso is released across a wide range of firing zzso zzso is released only at high zzso of zzso and its role in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso is highly zzso zzso is responsible for long-term zzso zzso using zzso mechanisms different from the rapidly desensitizing zzso evoked by zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling also maintains zzso synthesis required for sustained zzso during prolonged stress via induction of the zzso zzso and zzso and enhances zzso of additional zzso molecules found in zzso cells that alter further zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso thus mediates zzso cell plasticity via functional zzso of cellular zzso These features of zzso action at the zzso zzso may be zzso for the general actions of zzso as zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
