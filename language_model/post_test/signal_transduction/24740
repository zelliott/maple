The zzso effects of caffeine on zzso zzso zzso signal generation in isolated mouse pancreatic zzso cells were zzso Using the ability of caffeine to zzso zzso zzso we measured simultaneously the free zzso zzso concentration zzso and the zzso caffeine concentration zzso We also measured zzso zzso zzso production with a zzso zzso When caffeine was added to the zzso solution during a sustained zzso increase in zzso zzso rose to its steady level within a few zzso This was accompanied by a decrease of zzso which started only after zzso had reached an apparent threshold concentration (about 2 zzso in the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Above this zzso level there was a linear relationship between zzso and zzso Throughout the caffeine exposure zzso remained at a steady low zzso Following removal of caffeine from the bath, zzso decreased to zero within zzso There was no significant increase in zzso until zzso had been reduced to the threshold level (about 2 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso signals evoked by zzso zzso and zzso and also inhibited signals generated in the absence of external zzso zzso application had the same effect as removal of zzso allowing recovery from apparent zzso zzso inhibited the zzso production of zzso in a zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the acute and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal generation due to rapid zzso caffeine zzso and zzso The zzso can be explained by the reduction of zzso zzso zzso
