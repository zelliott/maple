zzso receptors activate multiple signal zzso zzso resulting in the induction of specific target zzso We have recently identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene contains a zzso zzso element that is specifically induced by the beta c zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso in transient zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso inhibited the induction of zzso and zzso by zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso inhibited the induction of zzso but not zzso A zzso form of zzso inhibited the induction of zzso but had no effect on the induction of zzso by zzso The requirement for zzso in the stimulation of the zzso zzso was further supported by the suppression of zzso induction in zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso activates a zzso signaling zzso that is required for zzso induction and is independent of zzso
