We have shown earlier a requirement for zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and protein zzso B zzso key zzso of zzso zzso and zzso responses in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso Because the effect of zzso is zzso through zzso protein zzso II zzso we have investigated here the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by using pharmacological zzso of zzso and zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso strategies for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso attenuated zzso responses of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso also exhibited an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso and with zzso of zzso alpha attenuated the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso and zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso with zzso alpha zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced zzso zzso of zzso which was inhibited by both zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso plays a critical upstream role in zzso the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
