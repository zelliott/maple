zzso zzso is one of the most devastating zzso and presents unique challenges to therapy because of its aggressive zzso zzso or zzso cells have been described to be the only cell population with zzso capacity in zzso zzso effective therapeutic strategies targeting these cells or the early precursors may be zzso We have established different cultures of zzso cells zzso derived from surgical specimens and found that, after induction of zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso as determined by analyzing key proteins such as zzso and zzso and the zzso of a number of target zzso We also showed that blockade of nuclear factor zzso signaling in zzso zzso by different genetic strategies or treatment with zzso zzso promoted replication arrest and zzso This effect was partly zzso by reduced levels of the zzso target gene zzso zzso because its zzso by zzso interference reproduced a similar zzso Furthermore, these results were confirmed in a zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso mice bearing human zzso tumors with a novel zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso induced zzso of tumor cells but no zzso zzso of the brain zzso were zzso These findings reveal that zzso of zzso may keep zzso zzso from acquiring a mature zzso zzso thus allowing cell zzso and support the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed to promote premature zzso of zzso zzso by blocking key factors within the zzso zzso
