zzso zzso growth factor and its zzso zzso and zzso are key regulators of zzso Unlike zzso the role of zzso has remained zzso zzso is produced as soluble zzso and full-length zzso Here, we show that zzso from multiple zzso produce zzso To define the zzso role of zzso we chose the zzso zzso as a model zzso zzso of zzso from specialized zzso zzso known as zzso causes reorganization of their zzso with massive zzso and kidney failure, characteristic features of zzso syndrome in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso this zzso demonstrating zzso of the full-length zzso Using cell imaging, zzso and zzso we show that zzso binds to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso on the surface of zzso promoting zzso and rapid zzso zzso zzso also regulates zzso function in vessels outside of the zzso Our findings demonstrate an zzso function for zzso to control zzso zzso
