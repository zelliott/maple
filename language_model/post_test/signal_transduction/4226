The zzso zzso levels of the zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso and its signal zzso zzso zzso were examined in the rat zzso cell line, zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso and/or zzso zzso In contrast to our previous findings in zzso zzso et zzso 1993, zzso zzso in zzso zzso seemed to be the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso seemed to have little effect on the expression of its own zzso zzso zzso However, the presence of other zzso influenced the zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At 6 zzso cells zzso with zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso This stimulation was additive with the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso At the same time, zzso zzso the presence of a second smaller zzso zzso This zzso species contained the zzso domain but lacked both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso suggesting alternate zzso possibly coding for a soluble form of zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso normally expressed as two species of zzso was not regulated to any major extent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso bands zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso whereas zzso zzso mainly the upper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
