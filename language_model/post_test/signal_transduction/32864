We have identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as an inhibitor of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and demonstrate that it acts in a negative feedback loop to zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso is expressed in response to the zzso signaling pathway, and loss of zzso activity is associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso with our zzso studies, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso mimics a loss of zzso zzso We show that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso can inhibit and physically associate with the zzso suggesting potential models for this zzso zzso
