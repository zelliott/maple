zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be necessary for zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso We studied the role of zzso in three forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by very zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso and mossy fiber zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso was activated in area zzso after the induction of both 200 zzso and zzso and that this zzso required the influx of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling cascade with either zzso zzso or zzso prevented the induction of both 200 zzso and zzso in area zzso In contrast, neither zzso zzso nor zzso prevented zzso in area zzso induced by either brief or long trains of zzso zzso zzso also did not prevent zzso zzso in area zzso However, incubation of slices with zzso an zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso did result in increases in active zzso and zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso in area zzso The zzso increase in active zzso was inhibited by zzso whereas the increase in zzso zzso was not, which suggests that in area zzso the zzso cascade is not coupled to zzso zzso via zzso Overall, our observations indicate that zzso of the zzso signaling cascade is necessary for zzso zzso zzso in area zzso but not in area zzso and suggest a divergence in the signaling zzso underlying zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso
