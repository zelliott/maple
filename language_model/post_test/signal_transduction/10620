zzso of the zzso family of zzso factors is regulated by zzso and growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are linked to the zzso zzso and function of zzso We have previously described a unique zzso inducing zzso zzso which is zzso by insulin stimulation and depends on protein zzso C delta zzso In this study, we assessed zzso zzso downstream of this zzso and characterized the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Following insulin zzso zzso zzso with zzso but not with any other zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso were essential for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso association and nuclear zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was induced and nuclear zzso remained zzso This study indicates that zzso zzso is a primary regulator of zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is essential in directing zzso signaling in zzso zzso
