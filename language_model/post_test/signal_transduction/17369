Cellular zzso is an intrinsic defense mechanism to various cellular zzso while still metabolically active, zzso cells stop dividing and enter a proliferation zzso Here, we identify zzso a member of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a key regulator of the proliferation potential of human primary zzso Following depletion of zzso cells show a severe proliferation zzso and display a zzso zzso including a flattened and enlarged zzso elevated level of zzso oxygen species zzso increased zzso activity, and formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso depletion leads to a reduced level of zzso active zzso we observed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso including zzso independent of zzso zzso experiments show that key regulators of zzso zzso including ID zzso are under direct control of zzso Because ID proteins are negative regulators of the zzso factors zzso depletion of zzso leads to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and thus to a zzso zzso zzso zzso of ID protein expression can partially rescue the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso controls proliferation by regulating ID proteins zzso which in turn lead to zzso zzso
