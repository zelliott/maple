In the past decade, zzso methods have emerged for the quantitative profiling of dynamic changes in protein zzso allowing the behavior of thousands of zzso sites to be monitored in a single zzso However, when one is interested in specific signaling zzso such shotgun zzso are not ideal because they lack selectivity and are not cost and time efficient with respect to instrument and data analysis zzso Here we evaluate and explore a zzso zzso generated to selectively enrich peptides containing the zzso protein zzso zzso consensus zzso This targeted zzso strategy is used to profile zzso quantitative changes of potential zzso zzso in zzso T zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso which increases zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method combines zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso stable isotope zzso zzso We identified 655 zzso of which zzso zzso zzso contained the consensus motif zzso When our data were compared with a large-scale zzso zzso zzso zzso containing more than 10,500 zzso a minimal overlap of zzso was zzso This stresses the need for such targeted analyses when the interest is in a particular zzso Our data provide a resource of likely zzso of zzso and potentially some zzso of closely related zzso Network analysis revealed that about half of the observed zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso Still, the other half of the zzso zzso have been less well zzso representing a valuable resource for future zzso
