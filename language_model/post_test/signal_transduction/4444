zzso anemia zzso nuclear core complex is a zzso complex required for the functional integrity of the zzso zzso regulating DNA zzso This zzso is zzso in zzso a devastating genetic disease, which leads to zzso defects and cancer in zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel zzso zzso protein zzso We show that zzso is an integral component of the zzso nuclear core zzso We identify a region on zzso that physically interacts with zzso and show that zzso regulates stability of this zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and binds zzso zzso chains in zzso The zzso domain is not required for interaction with zzso but is required for zzso zzso loading of zzso and the functional integrity of the zzso zzso These findings reveal critical roles for zzso in the zzso zzso of DNA damage repair and zzso zzso
