zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a recently described zzso zzso expressed by zzso cells zzso zzso zzso are known to engage zzso T cells through zzso zzso This study investigated the expression and function of zzso in resting zzso We showed by zzso and flow zzso that zzso from zzso and zzso mice, as well as zzso 212 zzso cell line zzso and human zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso of zzso skin zzso and zzso with zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso induction for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso studies on mouse zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso confirmed corresponding zzso and zzso protein production by zzso zzso induction was shown to be zzso zzso proliferation was enhanced by the addition of zzso This was reversed by zzso with an zzso zzso We conclude that zzso express zzso and that through this important zzso zzso they have the potential to influence zzso numbers in the skin through zzso production and through a direct zzso effect on zzso zzso
