zzso acting via zzso zzso zzso regulates serum zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the cellular pathways zzso this regulation are zzso zzso signals through classical zzso response element zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using targeted zzso in mice to disrupt zzso DNA binding activity, we previously demonstrated that zzso signaling is sufficient to suppress serum zzso zzso In this study, we examined the relative roles of zzso and zzso zzso signaling in zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein content, and serum zzso zzso zzso signaling was not sufficient for zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso or suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso content, or serum zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso signaling was sufficient to reduce zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together with previous serum zzso results, these findings suggest zzso zzso signaling suppresses serum zzso via reduced zzso not zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso pathways may distinctly regulate steps involved in the synthesis and zzso of zzso
