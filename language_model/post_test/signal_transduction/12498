Growth hormone zzso is zzso in a zzso fashion from the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso is governed by two zzso zzso growth zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso resulting in zzso episodes with a zzso of zzso h in the male zzso zzso is an additional recently identified potent zzso However, its in zzso interactions with the zzso neuroendocrine axis remain to be zzso Moreover, two different sites of zzso synthesis are involved, the stomach and the zzso We used our previously developed core model of zzso zzso and added the sites of zzso action at the zzso and in the zzso With this extended model, we simulated the effects of central and peripheral zzso injections, monitored the zzso profile and compared it with existing experimental zzso zzso administered zzso elicits a zzso pulse independent of zzso but only in the presence of zzso The peripheral zzso signal is zzso to the brain via the zzso zzso where it zzso the release of zzso and stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, centrally administered zzso zzso a zzso pulse by increasing the zzso level and by zzso the zzso block at the zzso In addition, zzso zzso are zzso which trigger a delayed zzso zzso The major novel features of the present model are a) the role played by zzso and b) the dissimilar functions of zzso in the zzso and at the zzso Furthermore, the predictions of the model were zzso examined and zzso
