zzso of the zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso and its conversion into a persistently activated form by zzso are thought to be crucial events underlying the induction of long-term zzso zzso by increases in zzso zzso Because increases in zzso can also activate protein zzso that oppose persistent zzso zzso zzso induction may also require zzso of signaling pathways that suppress protein zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso zzso A signaling zzso may provide a mechanism for suppressing protein zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso changes in synaptic strength and on levels of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region of zzso zzso briefly zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso transient zzso of synaptic transmission that could be converted into a persistent zzso by the addition of zzso zzso or zzso zzso To examine zzso changes in zzso zzso we replaced electrical zzso fiber stimulation with an increase in zzso zzso to achieve a more global synaptic zzso during zzso of high zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso zzso or the protein zzso inhibitor zzso A, this treatment induced a zzso synaptic zzso and a persistent increase in zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso or zzso A, it had no lasting effect on synaptic strength and induced a persistent decrease in zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by suppressing protein zzso and enabling a persistent increase in the levels of zzso zzso
