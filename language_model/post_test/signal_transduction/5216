A complex set of zzso and intrinsic signals acts in specific zzso and spatial orders to enable neural differentiation during zzso These processes have been extensively studied in animal models, but human neural development remains much less zzso This lack of detailed information about human early zzso is a hindrance for the differentiation of zzso stem cell lines into specific zzso zzso zzso it is important to strengthen the zzso comparative zzso We describe a novel model system in which in zzso differentiation of human and mouse embryonic stem zzso cells are temporally aligned to each other and compared with mouse zzso zzso in zzso In this comparative model system, we tested the in zzso role of zzso zzso signaling for zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso signaling mediates zzso patterning during early stages of zzso zzso We monitored the effect of pharmacological zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso zzso factors and signaling molecules relevant for zzso development in zzso zzso strongly zzso the expression of zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse and human cells, thus reflecting the in zzso process of the zzso zzso zzso patterning and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso but at lower levels in human compared with mouse zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso affected, in mouse and human cells, the expression of molecules of the zzso pathway, especially the zzso and zzso zzso Sonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results provide evidence for the different default differentiation of mouse and human zzso cells and prove the utility of the comparative system for zzso the directed differentiation of human zzso stem zzso
