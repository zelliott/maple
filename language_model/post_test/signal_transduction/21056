zzso growth zzso zzso and insulin are known to activate a signaling cascade involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent reports suggest that zzso of this zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso and zzso zzso but is not required for insulin action on zzso processes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Previously we and others have demonstrated that substitution of both zzso at positions zzso and zzso in the zzso region of the human zzso zzso has relatively small effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso but completely zzso the ability of these cells to form tumors in nude mice or zzso in response to zzso in zzso Replacement of the zzso at position zzso also did not affect the zzso activity of the zzso with respect to zzso or zzso of zzso zzso but did reduce the ability of the zzso to mediate zzso or zzso zzso To further characterize the role of these zzso in zzso zzso function, we have used three distinct approaches to examine the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mobility shifts indicative of zzso zzso zzso and 3) in zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same cell zzso By each method we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not different between cells zzso zzso zzso receptors and cells carrying zzso receptors having zzso motifs replaced at positions zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso signals involving zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso include pathways other than the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
