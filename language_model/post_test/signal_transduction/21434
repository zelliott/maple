Novel zzso zzso in sporadic zzso cancer zzso have recently been identified on major zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso The presence of these zzso point zzso including the well characterized zzso zzso zzso represent up to zzso of cases in zzso These zzso that have been implicated in the zzso transition, cause deregulation and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rendering growth advantages to colon tumor zzso This review focuses on the key genetic zzso underlying the cumulative effect of multiple zzso within the colon cancer zzso Moreover, the currently available and alternative treatment approaches that may target these different genetic zzso are discussed, such as the novel zzso zzso Identification of novel zzso as well as differential gene expression analyzed by zzso reveal potential targets for combined therapeutic protocols which will result in personalized treatments in the near zzso
