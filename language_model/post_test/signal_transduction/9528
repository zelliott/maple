A high zzso zzso binding ratio is critical for the activity of zzso such as zzso and zzso that attack cancer cells directly and eliminate them by recruiting immune zzso zzso zzso binding profiles of other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso that stimulate or block immune zzso are less zzso In this study, we analyzed the importance of zzso and zzso interactions in controlling the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the parental zzso zzso zzso were engineered and used to promote zzso and cellular responses against zzso The mouse zzso zzso was highly zzso and outperformed the parental zzso when promoting zzso zzso and T cell zzso and zzso responses zzso to zzso In contrast, zzso was almost completely zzso Studies in zzso knockout mice demonstrated a critical role for the zzso zzso in zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In zzso experiments established that the zzso effect of zzso was zzso through zzso zzso delivered in trans between neighboring cells and did not require zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided effective zzso of zzso zzso in zzso suggesting the critical role of zzso in zzso reflects its cellular distribution and zzso as much as its affinity for a particular zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate an essential zzso role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity and suggest that zzso will be an important issue when zzso zzso for clinical zzso
