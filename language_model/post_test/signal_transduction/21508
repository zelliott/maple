zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is a potent zzso zzso also involved in cellular differentiation zzso zzso and both of its receptors zzso and zzso can be zzso on the same cell, allowing for local zzso This study has examined the expression of all components necessary for zzso zzso regulation during human zzso zzso and zzso models of cellular zzso zzso and zzso differentiation of human peripheral blood zzso decreased their zzso and zzso expression while increasing the zzso zzso In colon zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso was decreased upon zzso No changes, however, were seen during human skin zzso zzso zzso expression was unchanged in all three zzso lineages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases the zzso message in zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that there is no general principle for zzso signaling during conversion of cells from zzso to a more differentiated zzso zzso signaling by zzso to orchestrate different cell types during tissue development and zzso therefore, probably zzso the zzso regulation of differentiation by zzso zzso zzso may protect zzso and zzso from the zzso effects of local zzso zzso
