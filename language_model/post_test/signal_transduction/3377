zzso zzso is a novel tumor zzso and its zzso at the C zzso zzso and zzso is required for tumor cell zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso of zzso in chronic zzso leukemia cells in zzso 

zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso Western zzso and flow zzso were used to study the signaling pathways that regulate zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso at the same zzso did not affect zzso zzso at zzso 5, and the zzso zzso maintained a higher level in the zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso zzso activated zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and induced zzso of zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso (40 zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso induced expression of zzso syndrome zzso factor zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso zzso cells induced by zzso
