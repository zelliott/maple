zzso zzso zzso result from zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso protein suppresses a variety of zzso zzso zzso including zzso regulated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso and zzso are active in human zzso and here we show that zzso are also persistently active in human VS zzso With use of cultures of human zzso we investigated the contribution of each of these signals to the zzso and survival response of VS zzso zzso of zzso or zzso signaling reduced VS cell proliferation but did not increase zzso whereas zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduced VS cell proliferation and survival by inducing zzso By contrast, zzso activity promotes zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso intensity of VS cells loaded with zzso zzso zzso a fluorescent probe for zzso oxygen species zzso Furthermore, zzso a zzso scavenger, rescued VS cells with suppressed zzso from zzso suggesting that zzso activity protects VS cells from zzso by limiting zzso of zzso VS cultures treated with zzso zzso demonstrated significantly higher levels of zzso Red fluorescence, zzso that persistent zzso activity specifically suppresses zzso production in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso in VS cells with suppressed zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that persistent zzso activity enhances VS cell survival, at least in part, by suppressing zzso of zzso zzso
