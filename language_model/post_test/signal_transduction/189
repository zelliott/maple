The zzso zzso acid zzso is a key regulator of plant growth and development as well as plant responses to situations of decreased water zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso from group A, which includes the zzso and zzso zzso are key negative regulators of zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to affect both seed and zzso responses to zzso To further understand their contribution to zzso signaling and to unravel possible genetic interactions and functional zzso among them, we have generated different combinations of double and triple zzso impaired in these zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso double zzso showed reduced water loss and enhanced resistance to drought stress, which further supports the role of zzso in zzso responses to zzso Two triple zzso and zzso zzso were generated, which showed an extreme response to zzso zzso impaired growth, and partial zzso response to zzso zzso Thus, zzso analysis revealed a partial zzso of a subset of zzso genes in both triple zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso responses in the different zzso zzso showed that a progressive increase in zzso sensitivity could be obtained through combined zzso of these zzso These results indicate that zzso response is finely tuned by the integrated action of these zzso which is required to prevent a zzso response to zzso zzso that might have a deleterious effect on growth and development in the absence of environmental zzso
