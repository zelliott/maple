zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso pole of the zzso zzso is essential for abdominal zzso and zzso development during zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a complex zzso zzso signal in the zzso 3' untranslated region that comprises multiple partially redundant zzso zzso analysis suggests that this signal is recognized by zzso proteins and associated factors that package zzso zzso into a zzso competent zzso zzso However, functional zzso among zzso elements has made the identification of individual zzso factors zzso Indeed, only a single zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso has been identified thus zzso Through a zzso genetic screen, we have now identified the zzso family member zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso with zzso in an zzso zzso Our results support a role for zzso independent of its function in zzso zzso as a component of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
