zzso analysis has been widely used in the studies of complicated chemical reaction and biological networks, for example, in combustion studies and zzso control analysis of zzso In the latter cases, the responses of system properties at steady states with respect to changes of zzso such as initial zzso and rate constants, are often expressed as zzso Besides zzso sensitivities, zzso sensitivities should be zzso however, the explicit use of them in analyzing complicated biological systems has so far been zzso Using the coupled zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso system of the Ras zzso known to be involved in about zzso of human zzso as an example, we show that zzso sensitivities are useful for the studies of complex biological zzso They zzso for example, the following information: zzso multiple time scales existing in a complex system involving zzso and feedback zzso zzso the signs and strengths of responses to zzso (as system complication increases, the signs of global responses are not always easily zzso for example, response may change sign more than once as time zzso zzso beyond concentration zzso sensitivities revealing further details about the intricate dynamics and the effects of the zzso zzso ranking of vulnerability of zzso of a biological network using integrated zzso first step toward the identification of drug zzso zzso reduced sensitivity serving as a measure of the stability or zzso of zzso Our results indicate that the role of the zzso branch in the coupled pathways is to enhance the zzso of the zzso zzso More importantly, they demonstrate that zzso sensitivity analysis can be a valuable tool in system zzso
