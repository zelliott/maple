zzso functioning of pancreatic beta cells is a key hallmark of type 2 zzso beta cell function is modulated by the actions of different classes of zzso G zzso The functional consequences of zzso specific beta cell G protein signaling pathways in zzso are not well understood at present, primarily due to the fact that beta cell G zzso receptors zzso are also expressed by many other zzso To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a zzso approach that allows for the conditional and selective zzso of specific beta cell G proteins in intact zzso Specifically, we created two lines of transgenic mice each of which expressed a specific designer zzso in beta cells zzso zzso the two designer receptors differed in their G zzso properties zzso versus zzso They were unable to bind zzso zzso but could be efficiently activated by an otherwise zzso zzso compound zzso leading to the conditional zzso of either beta cell zzso or zzso G zzso Here we report the findings that conditional and selective zzso of beta cell zzso signaling in zzso leads to striking increases in both zzso and zzso insulin release, greatly improved zzso tolerance in obese, zzso mice, and elevated beta cell mass, associated with zzso zzso in zzso gene expression zzso Selective stimulation of beta cell zzso triggered zzso similar in zzso zzso zzso Thus, this developed zzso strategy represents a powerful approach to study G protein regulation of beta cell function in zzso
