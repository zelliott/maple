zzso of the zzso Middle T zzso zzso in zzso cells results in zzso transformation to zzso producing zzso zzso To study the mechanism of zzso zzso we used the zzso induced mouse brain zzso cell line, zzso expressing zzso active and dominant negative zzso of the small zzso zzso The zzso cell zzso of zzso loss of normal growth control and formation of zzso rather than zzso tubes in zzso gels was reversed by expression of dominant negative zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso action in blocking the zzso cell zzso zzso did not involve effects of zzso on the zzso zzso since this component of the zzso cell zzso was not zzso Furthermore, the zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system was not affected by zzso zzso zzso of the downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to be zzso activated by zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation and zzso formation in zzso gels even in cells expressing zzso zzso active zzso but they did not restore zzso tube zzso These results demonstrate that middle T zzso induced zzso cell transformation requires signal zzso by zzso The downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso effects on cell proliferation and zzso formation, but other unknown zzso of zzso are required for the zzso changes and zzso of the zzso zzso
