We previously reported that hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso in isolated rat zzso The present study was designed to determine the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso delayed zzso zzso cardiac zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for 30 zzso and then cultured for 20 h followed by zzso zzso SP significantly increased cell zzso percentage of zzso cells, and zzso zzso after 10 zzso of zzso Given 30 zzso before and during lethal zzso two selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, SP zzso the expression of zzso and increased zzso production in the cardiac zzso These effects were significantly attenuated by zzso an zzso zzso channel zzso blocker, and zzso a selective protein zzso C zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of both zzso and zzso is required for the stimulation of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso failed to regulate zzso protein expression but inhibited zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso In conclusion, we provided the first evidence that SP may produce delayed zzso via zzso dependent induction of zzso expression and via zzso zzso zzso zzso
