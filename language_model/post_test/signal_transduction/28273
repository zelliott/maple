The zzso zzso protein is an integral membrane protein required for the viability of differentiated cells and zzso influx induced by mating zzso Our previous study has identified a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is completely unable to maintain zzso but still has zzso zzso activity near the zzso zzso Here we further examined in detail the zzso zzso to unravel the function of zzso After exposure to the zzso the zzso zzso was not fully rescued by high zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso itself are also required for viability maintenance mechanism that does not involve zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids for zzso caused zzso and low zzso zzso but those of zzso zzso acids did zzso zzso of small zzso acids for zzso caused a significantly reduced zzso but did not affect zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso is important for both viability maintenance and zzso zzso and that its size for viability zzso
