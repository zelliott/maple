This study concerns the significance of zzso expression of zzso and zzso of the zzso gene in zzso Fourteen zzso type and one zzso zzso type zzso were zzso zzso 13 of 14 zzso type zzso showed typical features, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso cells were frequently observed in the areas of zzso zzso On zzso all typical zzso type zzso showed zzso expression of zzso predominantly in cohesive cells within the zzso zzso and in cells transitional towards ghost cells, where zzso for zzso was almost zzso The cohesive cells in the zzso zzso also demonstrated loss of zzso zzso zzso Using direct sequencing of amplified zzso zzso nine of the 13 typical zzso type zzso with nuclear zzso zzso showed zzso zzso substitution zzso of the zzso zzso The other unusual zzso type and zzso zzso type zzso showed no obvious zzso zzso zzso and no zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting molecular zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of typical zzso type zzso is associated with abnormalities of zzso zzso that act as a zzso signal towards zzso zzso and ghost cells rather than as simple proliferation zzso
