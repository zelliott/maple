The formation of foam cells is crucial in the initiation and progression of zzso One of the critical steps in foam cell formation is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso via scavenger receptors zzso This study examined the role of protein zzso C zzso zzso on foam cell zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso against classical zzso and novel zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso and primary zzso The zzso of zzso inhibited oxidized LDL zzso zzso and zzso cholesterol zzso in both cell zzso The reduction of zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso and zzso Similar conclusions were obtained in examining the effects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso investigation revealed that a decrease in zzso inhibited protein zzso B zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso selectively decreased protein but not the zzso level of zzso and zzso We showed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso however, the zzso of zzso or zzso downstream of zzso attenuated zzso but not zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso could be induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed in human zzso arteries and zzso zzso as zzso by zzso zzso 

Through regulating zzso and zzso activity, zzso affects zzso and zzso expression and foam cell zzso The results suggest zzso as a potential target for zzso zzso
