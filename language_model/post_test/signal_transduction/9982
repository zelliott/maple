zzso zzso a common drug-related adverse event observed in cancer patients treated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso therapies is rarely seen with therapies targeting zzso This study reports the significance of the zzso and zzso zzso status in skin with regard to these zzso side zzso We demonstrate the differential effect of zzso therapies on the zzso driven zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso in normal human zzso zzso zzso therapies, such as zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso an zzso interfering with functional zzso zzso failed to block zzso zzso signaling in primary zzso Using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso are the zzso zzso zzso pair in normal primary zzso and in normal skin tissue from 16 patients with solid zzso The presence of zzso and zzso but the absence of zzso demonstrates productive signaling via zzso but not zzso in human zzso These data illustrate the importance of the zzso zzso partner in human skin and suggests that zzso of zzso zzso signaling rather than zzso zzso signaling maybe the key molecular event determining zzso toxicity discrepancies observed between zzso versus zzso zzso
