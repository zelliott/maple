In a previous work we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects on the zzso zzso cell zzso These actions are comparable to those sustained by nerve growth factor zzso and involve several overlapping zzso In this work, we describe some of the mechanisms recruited by zzso and zzso in maintaining zzso cell survival after serum zzso We show that both zzso and zzso zzso the expression of the zzso heat shock protein zzso and zzso whilst zzso protein zzso and zzso are not zzso In parallel with zzso zzso prevents the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso the release of zzso c from zzso into the zzso Finally, neither zzso nor zzso directly zzso the expression of zzso receptors in the induction of cell zzso Our data contribute to dissect the biological mechanisms activated by zzso zzso exerting zzso actions and to establish that survival and zzso outgrowth lie on different zzso zzso
