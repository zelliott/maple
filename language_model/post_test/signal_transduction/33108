zzso zzso zzso cells monitor the local density of other starving cells by simultaneously zzso and sensing zzso zzso regulates signal zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates a zzso G protein by stimulating G alpha 2 to release zzso and bind zzso We show here that the rate of zzso zzso zzso in zzso from cells exposed to zzso is roughly 4 times slower than in zzso from zzso cells, even though the rate of zzso binding is the zzso This zzso is abolished in cells lacking G alpha zzso Our data thus suggest that zzso regulates zzso signal zzso in part by zzso the lifetime of the G alpha zzso zzso
