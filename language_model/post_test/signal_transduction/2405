Mouse liver stem cell zzso zzso lines were investigated in order to determine the role which two families of growth and differentiation factors zzso zzso growth factor zzso family and transforming growth factor beta zzso family, play in liver zzso zzso family members, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor, and zzso were zzso for oval cell lines while zzso family members, including zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso and induced zzso in oval cell zzso Surprisingly, the combination of zzso family members and zzso family members resulted in neither proliferation nor zzso but instead in a novel cellular response, cellular scattering in tissue culture and zzso differentiation in zzso Analysis of the signal zzso pathways activated by exposure of oval cell lines to either zzso zzso or zzso indicated that novel combinations of zzso signals result following stimulation of the cells with the combination of zzso These data reveal that the dynamics of synergistic zzso action following tissue injury and zzso results in a new level of complexity not obvious from the study of individual zzso
