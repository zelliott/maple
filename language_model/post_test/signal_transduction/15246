zzso is a zzso protein whose role as an zzso zzso in inflammation and tissue zzso has also been zzso Given the importance of zzso in wound healing, we have studied the mechanism of action of zzso on zzso zzso during in zzso scratch wound zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that these cells express significant amounts of zzso that the protein is zzso localized in the nucleus, and that its release by cells is zzso Western zzso also showed that these cells express the zzso zzso zzso Cell exposure to zzso in the absence of serum resulted in a stimulation of cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso also accelerated the wound closure of scratch wounded cells and promoted cell migration, as evaluated by a zzso zzso The zzso increases of cell zzso cell migration, and wound closure were abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, data show that, although zzso is not released by zzso when applied zzso it can induce a marked increase of the wound repair of these zzso Data also suggest that zzso acts via the zzso zzso These results bring scientific support to the potential application of zzso in zzso zzso
