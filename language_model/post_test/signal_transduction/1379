zzso fusion genes are detected in a significant proportion of newly diagnosed cases, where genes zzso zzso factors are usually found at one of the zzso zzso fusion zzso such as zzso and zzso have been shown to inhibit cellular differentiation by recruitment of nuclear zzso complexes, which maintain local zzso zzso zzso in a variety of zzso zzso gene zzso This zzso zzso repression appears as a common zzso in the development of leukemia and could represent an important target for new therapeutic zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso shows high zzso zzso activity and zzso signal zzso pathways involved normally in both zzso and zzso This zzso activity is affected by signal zzso zzso zzso which block or prevent the zzso zzso In this review, we present a closer look at our understanding of both the zzso zzso repression controlled by zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso In addition, the application of low molecular weight drugs for human leukemia treatment based in this knowledge results in durable clinical zzso and acceptable risk of toxic effects that should increase the cure zzso We hope that this review will provide timely information to the zzso
