Rapid zzso transport is required for process growth and establishment of specialized structures during zzso zzso Furthermore, maintenance of mature zzso architecture and function depends on the proper delivery of materials to specialized zzso within zzso such as zzso of zzso and synaptic zzso zzso is the most abundant member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are responsible for zzso transport of an assortment of zzso zzso in all cell zzso zzso is enriched in zzso but relatively little is known about the zzso regulation of its zzso zzso and function in nervous zzso By examining zzso expression in developing brain and in cultures of cortical zzso we found that zzso is enriched in zzso zzso including their growing tips, the growth zzso To gain understanding of mechanisms that zzso the delivery of proteins to specific cellular zzso we focused on studying modifications on zzso that lead to its zzso from zzso Since zzso is a zzso in zzso we evaluated the correlation between zzso zzso and its membrane association and identified a number of zzso which zzso zzso and alter its zzso
