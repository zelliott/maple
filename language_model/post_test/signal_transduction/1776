Gap zzso zzso zzso allows cells to share low molecular weight zzso and second zzso thus zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gap junctions make their appearance very early in zzso development, during zzso in the eight-cell zzso Surprisingly, zzso mouse zzso lacking the gap junction protein zzso 43 develop normally and establish zzso zzso despite severely reduced gap zzso zzso It was suggested that this might be explained by the presence of at least five additional zzso known to be expressed in zzso In the present study, we set out to clarify the number of zzso present in zzso zzso zzso and the role of gap zzso zzso if any, in zzso zzso We provide evidence from reverse zzso chain reaction analysis that the genes zzso 3 additional zzso zzso 30 or zzso zzso 36 or zzso and zzso 57 or zzso are also transcribed in zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, we show that multiple zzso are expressed in rat zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso expression may be a common feature of early zzso zzso We could detect no zzso of any of 3 zzso zzso examined in mouse zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused either by the loss of zzso 43 or by treatment of cultured zzso with the gap zzso zzso blocker zzso acid zzso had no zzso effect on either zzso or zzso zzso parameters known to be affected by gap zzso zzso in other zzso These results, taken together with the reported inability of zzso to zzso zzso formation, imply that gap zzso zzso is not essential during this zzso zzso We propose that zzso expression and the assembly of multiple types of gap junction channels in zzso zzso zzso the diversification of communication pathways that will appear during zzso zzso New evidence of this diversification is presented using rat zzso zzso
