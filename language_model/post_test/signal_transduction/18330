The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso in addition to its well defined zzso channel properties, regulates other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso currents in many zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso of net zzso zzso has important implications in zzso fluid volume zzso and airway fluid volume and zzso we investigated whether this regulation was zzso by examining whether zzso regulates zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso expressing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso indicating an zzso of zzso following zzso zzso and it was blocked by zzso zzso zzso and was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed when either the zzso or zzso of zzso was zzso with zzso but this was not seen when zzso was zzso with the zzso of zzso Single zzso channel analyses showed that both zzso zzso channel open probability and the number of zzso zzso channels detected per patch increased when zzso was zzso with zzso We conclude that in addition to acting as a regulator of zzso zzso activity is regulated by zzso
