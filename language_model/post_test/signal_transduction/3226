To investigate the potential regulatory role played by the hormone zzso in zzso metabolism and expression of nuclear factor zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso during zzso zzso 

A zzso fatty liver disease zzso cell model was established by treating the normal human zzso cell line, zzso with zzso zzso Four research groups of zzso cells were zzso C group zzso no zzso acid zzso P group zzso model, treated with 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso group treated with 50 zzso zzso human zzso and zzso group zzso group treated with 50 zzso zzso human zzso All treatments were carried out for 72 zzso Oil red O zzso was used to detect the zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in culture zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso analysis, zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were higher in the zzso zzso and zzso groups than in the C zzso The zzso zzso level was also higher in the zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the C group, as was the zzso zzso level ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso level was lower ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso In addition, no significant difference in these zzso levels were found between the P group and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all, P more than zzso The detected protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso were consistent with the zzso zzso 

zzso can promote zzso in zzso cells through the zzso signaling pathway, thereby contributing to the zzso zzso zzso
