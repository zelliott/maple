zzso proteins mediate interactions between proteins involved in signal zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso of target proteins as well as zzso are important for zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso of a protein zzso from zzso brain that zzso zzso zzso on zzso This protein zzso has been identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso mapping analysis and zzso Among zzso zzso only zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso at the same position zzso and we show that this zzso is also zzso by zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso is exclusively zzso on zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso The zzso 233 is located within a region shown to be important for the association of zzso to target zzso We showed previously that, in zzso cells, only the zzso form of zzso zzso associates with the regulatory domain of zzso We have now shown that in zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso site zzso zzso regulates its binding to zzso and may be important in zzso signal zzso
