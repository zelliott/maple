Patients with acute zzso zzso or heart failure frequently have abnormalities of zzso metabolism and insulin resistance, both of which are associated with a poor zzso zzso are a class of zzso which play important roles in cellular biological processes including insulin resistance and zzso zzso 

This review examines the available evidence linking abnormalities in zzso zzso tolerance and insulin resistance to acute zzso zzso and heart zzso 

zzso and genetic zzso of zzso controlling key zzso zzso such as zzso increases insulin sensitivity in zzso and increases zzso tolerance to zzso Major projects are being realized to develop clinical strategies to manipulate zzso metabolism in this clinical settings, with the ultimate goal of increasing insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso tolerance to zzso Thus, a clear understanding of the zzso signaling in zzso heart disease is required to devise strategies to develop novel agents and technologies that directly target this signaling zzso
