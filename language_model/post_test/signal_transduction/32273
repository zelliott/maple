To zzso the molecular basis of early gastric cancer zzso the zzso expression pattern of cancer and normal zzso from 27 patients were analyzed by a zzso zzso Using an zzso systematic zzso approach, we classified the zzso expressed genes in zzso Interestingly, the more highly expressed genes in zzso exhibited the most significant correlation with cell migration and zzso This implies that, even at the early stage of gastric cancer, the molecular properties usually observed in late-stage cancer are already zzso Furthermore, we have found a novel association between the expression pattern and molecular pathways of zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer through zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the biological properties of zzso as well as yielding useful basic data for the study of molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
