The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel have been zzso zzso to be involved in zzso zzso zzso Our recent studies reveal that the levels of both zzso and zzso channel proteins in pregnant human zzso decrease by approximately 50% after the onset of zzso We present direct evidence in support of a structural and functional association between the zzso and the zzso channel in pregnant human zzso zzso of both proteins is predominantly zzso with zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso and zzso are structurally linked by direct zzso zzso zzso correlation was confirmed by experiments of human zzso zzso in which the zzso channel blocker, zzso significantly antagonized the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso These novel findings provide an insight into the zzso between the zzso and zzso channel and may have utility in the application of this signaling cascade for therapeutic potential in the management of zzso zzso
