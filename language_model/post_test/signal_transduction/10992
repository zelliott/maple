zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which is regulated by protein zzso However, its function is unknown and no zzso zzso for zzso have yet been zzso Here we demonstrate a specific interaction between zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso results in nuclear exclusion of both zzso and zzso and is accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso activity is significantly reduced by zzso zzso of zzso and also in zzso derived from zzso zzso Furthermore, increased levels of zzso protein detected during nerve growth zzso differentiation of zzso cells are accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion causes a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso zzso Our data identify the first zzso protein zzso for zzso and suggest a functional link between these zzso in which zzso is a downstream target of zzso while zzso acts as a zzso for zzso Our findings provide valuable tools to further dissect the regulation and biological roles of both zzso and zzso
