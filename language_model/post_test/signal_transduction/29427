zzso respond to signals by regulating gene zzso The relation between the level of input signals and the zzso rate of the gene is called the zzso input zzso Because most genes are regulated by more than one zzso the input functions are usually zzso To understand cellular responses, it is essential to know the shapes of these zzso Here, we map the two-dimensional input functions of 19 zzso genes at high resolution in living zzso coli zzso We find diverse, intricately shaped input functions, despite the similarity in the regulatory zzso of these zzso Surprisingly, some of the input functions are zzso zzso at intermediate signal zzso Furthermore, most of the input functions show separation of zzso in the sense that they can be described as the product of simple functions that depend on a single zzso This first broad survey of two-dimensional input functions can be extended to map the logic of gene regulation in other zzso
