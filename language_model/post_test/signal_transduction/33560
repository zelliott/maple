zzso are important cues for social insects such as zzso As a first step in zzso of zzso information processing mechanisms in the zzso zzso we investigated the zzso structure of the zzso zzso Using zzso imaging, labeling of zzso zzso zzso and reduced silver zzso zzso the zzso lobe was found to consist of five compartments that, each received input from a different zzso sensory zzso Two major tracts of projection zzso the zzso and lateral zzso tract zzso and zzso originated from a different region of the zzso zzso The zzso originated from the zzso part of the zzso lobe whereas the zzso originated from the anterior zzso These results demonstrate a spatial segregation of function within the zzso zzso
