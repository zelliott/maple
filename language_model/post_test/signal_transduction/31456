The neural crest is a zzso cell population that zzso from the zzso edge of the neural tube to various parts of the zzso where it zzso into a remarkable variety of different cell zzso zzso induction of neural crest is zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso model for neural crest induction suggests that zzso signaling zzso the competence to become neural zzso The second signal involves zzso acting through the zzso zzso and leads to expression of neural crest markers such as zzso zzso signals from the neural plate, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have all been suggested to play a role in neural crest zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso including early neural crest zzso and is a key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression is induced in response to a zzso zzso zzso and that zzso can induce neural crest specific genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in the animal cap zzso and in the whole zzso leading to a loss of neural crest derived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso as does activated zzso suggesting that zzso is signaling through the zzso zzso We therefore demonstrate that zzso is regulated by zzso antagonism and is required for neural crest induction by zzso in the developing zzso zzso
