One of the most important actions of insulin is the stimulation of the zzso of zzso into fat and muscle zzso zzso to this response is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the plasma zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso at the plasma membrane requires an interaction between zzso zzso membrane zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso in the plasma zzso In the zzso state, zzso is thought to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso this zzso Here, we have used zzso zzso correlation zzso in single living cells to show that zzso binds to zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso contains two binding sites for zzso one of which is disrupted by insulin, while the other is activated by zzso zzso repositioning of zzso on zzso in this way in turn allows zzso to adopt its zzso zzso and bind zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso zzso at the cell zzso The results also demonstrate the utility of using zzso in intact single living cells to zzso cell zzso zzso
