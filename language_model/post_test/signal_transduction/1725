zzso are cells of zzso origin that zzso bone zzso regulation of their differentiation is central to the understanding of the zzso and treatment of bone diseases such as zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also known as zzso is essential for the induction of zzso zzso and it must be strictly regulated to maintain bone zzso But it is not known whether zzso zzso to the cell interior is linked to any regulatory zzso Here we show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene in zzso precursor cells, and that zzso zzso the differentiation by interfering with the zzso expression of zzso an essential zzso factor for the formation of zzso This zzso gene induction mechanism is distinct from that induced by virus, and is dependent on zzso zzso Thus an zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso its own zzso The importance of this regulatory mechanism for bone zzso is emphasized by the observation that mice deficient in zzso zzso exhibit severe zzso zzso of bone zzso accompanied by enhanced zzso Our study places the zzso system in a new context, and may offer a molecular basis for the treatment of bone zzso
