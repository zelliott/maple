The molecular events occurring during zzso zzso and zzso are described with an emphasis on the changes of the zzso membrane potential zzso The low zzso values of the normal beating heart zzso zzso are explained by the zzso zzso of zzso c zzso zzso through feedback zzso by zzso at high zzso zzso During zzso the mechanism is zzso switched off by signaling through zzso oxygen species zzso At zzso high zzso values cause a burst of zzso production leading to zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso is suggested to cause additional zzso of zzso protecting the zzso from immediate zzso via zzso zzso
