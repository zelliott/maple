A pathological zzso cell zzso which forces zzso to transform into zzso cells with zzso properties and zzso to zzso presumably adds to neurodegenerative zzso We examined the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso and zzso regulation of such zzso zzso cell properties in culture and tested possibilities of zzso zzso A strengthening of the zzso as could be achieved by zzso zzso via a zzso action, favored the differentiation of zzso zzso and associated zzso properties zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso But potentially zzso properties of zzso cells were zzso zzso depressed their proliferation rate and transformation into zzso their particularly high formation of zzso oxygen zzso and the release of the zzso zzso Similar effects were obtained with zzso which acts as selective zzso zzso inhibitor and also increases the effective concentration of zzso by blocking its cellular zzso The recently observed induction of zzso zzso by elevated zzso zzso levels may further contribute to limit secondary nerve cell damage related to a pathological zzso cell zzso
