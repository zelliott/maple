In normal healthy zzso an equilibrium is established between cell death and zzso This equilibrium ensures that cells survive in the right zzso but undergo programmed cell death zzso when damaged, or when the environment is no longer zzso Diseases may occur with zzso in this zzso For example, cancer cells may survive in an environment in which they would not normally zzso This is accomplished by zzso in the expressions or functions of genes controlling both survival and zzso signaling zzso Survival signaling pathways involve the zzso of cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors as well as other zzso In breast and zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso is zzso and this contributes to the progression of these zzso in part by zzso zzso survival signaling zzso In contrast, zzso signal zzso pathways are often inhibited in zzso For example, zzso of zzso blocks zzso and this contributes to the zzso of cells in zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in these signaling pathways in cancer cells may lead to drug zzso Recent advances in molecular targeted therapies have taken advantage of zzso in survival and zzso signaling pathways in cancer to specifically target zzso regulated zzso For example, zzso trade mark zzso zzso function and zzso zzso against zzso reduce zzso zzso These agents can thus induce zzso in the specific cancer cell against which they have been zzso In this review, we will discuss zzso in survival and zzso signal zzso pathways in cancer and the development of novel zzso drugs to target these zzso
