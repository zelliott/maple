zzso zzso family zzso which inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso are involved in the survival of various zzso lineages and are often zzso in zzso zzso However, their involvement in the zzso lineage is not well zzso In the present paper, we describe the crucial zzso role of zzso and zzso in this lineage at zzso The zzso zzso deletion of both, in sharp contrast to only one of them, caused zzso loss of mature zzso in the fetal liver and systemic zzso leading to embryonic zzso zzso a zzso zzso only caused zzso in adult zzso mice, but further induced massive mature zzso zzso in the zzso knockout mice, leading to severe zzso zzso All these zzso were fully restored if zzso and zzso downstream zzso executioners, were also zzso zzso study revealed that the zzso zzso maintained zzso and zzso expression levels, preventing zzso cell zzso Similarly, both were involved in zzso zzso survival, whereas zzso survival was dependent on zzso due to rapid zzso degradation of zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso regulate the survival of the zzso zzso which is critically important for preventing lethal or severe zzso in both developing and adult zzso
