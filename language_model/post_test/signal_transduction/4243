The zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso with a relatively large zzso zzso The zzso of zzso wild type and 15 point and double zzso which zzso zzso of opposite charge to that of wild type, were zzso zzso into zzso zzso Human zzso zzso binding was determined, as was zzso zzso zzso Most of the replacements resulted in no substantive effect on the binding affinity of zzso to zzso or on zzso zzso production, although the zzso expressed at a lower level than zzso wild zzso The most interesting observation was noted with two point zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which bound zzso but failed to give increased zzso zzso Several of the zzso forms of zzso that expressed at low levels were further analyzed by soluble binding zzso and Western zzso There was no evidence of any significant degree of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The expected major zzso zzso and minor (78 zzso forms were found for zzso wild type and several of the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso exhibited primarily the lower zzso form, indicating that zzso processing was impaired or that the zzso higher zzso form was more rapidly zzso than zzso wild zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso which are located near the first zzso zzso are important in zzso zzso while other zzso zzso zzso of zzso appear important in cell surface expression or stability but not in binding or zzso
