The collagen zzso and zzso promoters have been used to drive zzso expression for generation of conditional transgenic zzso zzso Within the bone, zzso is expressed by zzso precursor cells and their downstream zzso while zzso is more zzso zzso Our generation of transgenic mice with zzso and zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso necessitated a thorough analysis of the zzso expression of these promoters in the central nervous zzso Both zzso and zzso were capable of forcing zzso zzso in the brain as demonstrated by zzso expression in zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso was limited to the central base of the brain near the third zzso In contrast, robust expression of zzso was noted throughout the brain, centering near the zzso third zzso third zzso and zzso We subsequently analyzed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was noted in zzso brain areas such as the zzso nucleus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, and lateral zzso zzso of zzso zzso knockout mice with zzso confirmed the presence of an intact zzso response that was dampened in the lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso This test was done to explore the contribution of neural zzso signaling to the bone zzso of the zzso zzso Our analysis indicates that neural zzso zzso while present, is likely not the sole driver of zzso changes through traditional sympathetic zzso
