zzso liver disease zzso features increased zzso exposure to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso and activates signaling pathways depending on zzso or zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso zzso in an zzso manner that involves zzso regulatory zzso zzso We fed alcohol or control diets to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, and to mice with selective zzso zzso in liver zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were protected from zzso liver injury, zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso or bone zzso zzso mice, zzso of zzso only in zzso cells aggravated zzso liver injury, associated with increased zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and lower Type I zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso primary zzso zzso with liver zzso cells zzso resulted in higher zzso zzso and zzso and lower tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso levels compared to zzso zzso Type I zzso was important because zzso of zzso with zzso from Type I zzso zzso zzso mice showed attenuated zzso levels compared to control zzso from zzso zzso We further identified that Type I zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited inflammatory zzso production in both zzso zzso and human zzso indicating preserved zzso zzso These findings suggest that liver zzso cells are the dominant source of Type I zzso in a zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso Type I zzso increase zzso and suppress zzso zzso production by zzso in zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso in zzso cells and resulting type I zzso have protective effects in zzso by way of zzso of inflammatory functions in zzso These results suggest potential therapeutic targets in zzso
