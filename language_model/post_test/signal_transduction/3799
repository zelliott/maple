To zzso the zzso role of human zzso zzso in tumor progression and/or wound healing, zzso growth zzso zzso zzso was analyzed as a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso generates two fragments of 16 and 9 zzso that react with zzso zzso zzso although they do not bind zzso growth zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequencing shows that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso bond located in the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso survival and proliferation of zzso cells, as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex with zzso restores zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso activity in these zzso zzso proliferation is significantly increased with the zzso zzso complex compared with that obtained using zzso zzso To produce this enhanced zzso zzso must bind to zzso before zzso zzso demonstrated using an zzso zzso that does not bind zzso zzso also zzso zzso proliferation of the zzso breast zzso and this zzso was not seen in zzso zzso zzso Such zzso may thus play a role in in zzso tumor zzso These results indicate that zzso may regulate zzso zzso by zzso zzso thus favoring cell survival and zzso
