The signaling pathways that control zzso zzso zzso in heart have not been fully zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso signaling has a role in the zzso pathways of zzso against zzso zzso 

zzso cultures of adult rat zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso by exposing the cells to 10 minutes of zzso followed by 30 minutes of zzso zzso and PC zzso were subjected to 90 minutes of zzso followed by 120 minutes of zzso zzso protected the zzso from subsequent zzso injury, as evidenced by decreased zzso and zzso release and increased cell zzso zzso zzso c release and zzso of zzso and -9 were blocked by zzso This protective effect was inhibited by treating the cells with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for 10 minutes before and during zzso PC also induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso in zzso were maintained in zzso zzso were infected with either a control zzso zzso zzso an zzso expressing zzso zzso or an zzso expressing zzso active zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso protected zzso from zzso induced by zzso compared with zzso zzso In contrast, dominant negative zzso zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso 

Our data demonstrated that in adult zzso the zzso effect of PC against zzso requires zzso signaling leading to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso c release, and prevention of zzso zzso
