zzso zzso 4 zzso a zzso zzso zzso in innate immune responses to zzso of zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso evidence have consolidated the notion that zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of cardiac zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso responsible for zzso cardiac dysfunction remain zzso To address the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso against zzso injury, in zzso regional zzso was induced by zzso of the left anterior descending coronary artery in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that blunted zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso occurred in zzso hearts versus zzso hearts, while zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso pathways were zzso during zzso in zzso hearts versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress was higher in zzso hearts than that in zzso as demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso hearts suffered more damage than those of zzso hearts during zzso Moreover, isolated zzso from zzso hearts showed resistance to zzso zzso dysfunction compared to those from zzso hearts, which are associated with greater hypoxic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso better zzso zzso handling in zzso versus zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso effects against zzso injury of hearts with zzso in zzso zzso may be zzso through modulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso
