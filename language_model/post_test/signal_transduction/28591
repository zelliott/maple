Known mainly for its role as a toxin zzso the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso complex is also involved in zzso regulation and differentiation processes and activated by zzso compounds like zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator not only in zzso but also in the cell cycle, and we show here that zzso is a new target gene for zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso both at protein and zzso levels in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso D experiments have shown that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and we have identified a functional zzso response element zzso at zzso in the upstream regulatory region of human zzso The zzso protein zzso expression of its own zzso and the zzso element zzso the zzso Our data indicate that zzso and the zzso complex compete for binding to the composite zzso zzso Also, we have previously shown that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression is correlated with suppression of cell zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso therefore increases cell zzso It is known that zzso exerts zzso action in breast tissue both in zzso and in zzso Our observation that both the zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways regulate zzso but with opposing effects, suggests the existence of a new zzso by which zzso zzso zzso
