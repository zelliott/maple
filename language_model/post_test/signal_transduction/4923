The release of zzso zzso cells zzso from bone zzso zzso is under tight zzso zzso Under stress conditions, zzso migrate from zzso and zzso into circulation to participate in immune response, wound repair, or tissue zzso zzso shock with resuscitation zzso resulting from severe trauma and major surgery, promotes zzso zzso from zzso which, in turn, affects zzso immune zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso zzso from zzso Using a mouse zzso model, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso group box 1 mediates zzso zzso zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso for advanced zzso end zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, in turn, zzso zzso zzso from zzso We also show that zzso of zzso receptors on zzso by zzso mediates the zzso release of zzso group box zzso These data indicate that zzso a global zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso through a series of interacting pathways that include neuroendocrine and innate immune systems, in which zzso play a central zzso
