zzso is a recently identified member of the zzso zzso zzso that plays a critical role in B cell zzso survival, and regulation of zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso is expressed in zzso and the expression and release of zzso are regulated by zzso The results showed that zzso was expressed and released in rat primary zzso as well as in zzso zzso Furthermore, its expression and release were increased by zzso stimulation and regulated by zzso especially the zzso and zzso signaling zzso It was of particular interest to observe that zzso and zzso specific zzso of zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso synthesis but inhibited the release of zzso in zzso cells by regulating zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso signaling pathways regulate the release but not the synthesis of zzso Moreover, zzso cells expressed zzso on their cell surface, and rat primary zzso expressed zzso and zzso on their cell zzso zzso increased the release of zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso in rat primary zzso as well as in zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso zzso by zzso may play important roles in zzso inflammation by regulating zzso as well as infiltrated B zzso
