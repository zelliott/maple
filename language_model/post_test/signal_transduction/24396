The gene for zzso (an zzso zzso regulatory zzso was shown earlier to be specialized for high zzso expression in adult zzso We show here that zzso zzso is required for proper zzso during zzso zzso of zzso expression by injecting zzso eggs with a specific zzso zzso resulted in a range of zzso zzso zzso including those lacking a brain and zzso These were rescued by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso (a known zzso zzso zzso or human zzso zzso Moreover, injection of zzso zzso or human zzso protein by itself zzso the developing zzso often resulting in axis zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso zzso a zzso marker downstream of bone zzso zzso whereas injection of zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso both zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso also zzso embryonic zzso pattern formation in zzso
