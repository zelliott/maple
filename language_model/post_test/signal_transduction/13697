zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins are zzso regulators of the zzso pathway, and zzso contributes to host immunity by regulating the intensity and duration of zzso signals and inflammatory zzso Mice with zzso deletion in zzso cells exhibit enhanced zzso zzso expansion of zzso and zzso cells, and develop severe experimental zzso zzso Interestingly, development of the unique zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that exhibit strong zzso activities and are associated with zzso of several zzso diseases has recently been shown to depend on zzso suppression of zzso zzso further suggesting involvement of zzso in zzso and tumor zzso In this study, we generated mice with zzso deletion in the zzso T cell compartment zzso knockout zzso to determine in zzso effects of the loss of zzso in the T zzso zzso disease, experimental zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso of experimental zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice, zzso mice were protected from acute and chronic zzso Protection from zzso correlated with enhanced expression of zzso and expansion of zzso regulatory T cells with zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso regulates zzso levels in T cells, providing a zzso explanation for the expansion of regulatory T cells in zzso during zzso zzso to in zzso zzso studies, zzso and zzso populations were markedly reduced in zzso suggesting that zzso promotes expansion of the zzso subset associated with development of severe zzso Thus, zzso is a potential therapeutic target in zzso and other zzso zzso
