zzso zzso is a large zzso complex involved in retrograde transport and the positioning of various zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso are zzso across zzso however, the molecular contribution of zzso to zzso function remains zzso One model suggests that zzso act as zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed to stabilize the intermediate chains zzso of the zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso function, we used zzso zzso in which the sole function of zzso is to position the zzso during zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso complex at zzso ends and interacts directly with the zzso zzso zzso We identify two zzso sites in zzso that exert differential effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elicit a partial zzso zzso and impair the recruitment of the zzso zzso complex, zzso Together these results indicate that the zzso function of zzso is via its interaction with the zzso zzso and that this interaction is important for the interaction of zzso and zzso In addition, these data provide the first direct evidence that zzso occupancy in the zzso motor complex is important for zzso
