zzso dependent protein zzso zzso is present in most branches of the animal kingdom, and is an example in the nervous system where a zzso zzso zzso the cellular effects of various zzso The recent development of zzso zzso such as zzso now allows the direct measurement of zzso zzso in living cells by simply measuring the ratio between the zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso This novel approach provides data with a zzso resolution of a few seconds at the cellular and even zzso level, opening a new avenue of understanding the integration processes in space and zzso Our protocol has been zzso to study zzso intact mature zzso and we describe how simple and cheap zzso imaging, as well as more elaborate zzso imaging, allows real-time monitoring of zzso zzso in zzso cortical zzso in zzso zzso brain zzso In addition, many practical details presented here also pertain to image analysis in other cellular zzso such as cultured zzso Finally, this protocol can also be applied to the various other zzso zzso zzso that are available for other zzso or other zzso zzso It is likely that this kind of approach will be generally zzso to a broad range of zzso in the near zzso
