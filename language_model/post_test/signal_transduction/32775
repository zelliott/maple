We have examined the role of Ras in zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso examined in stable zzso zzso expressing dominant active zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso showed a prominent reduction in all the zzso clones when compared to the parental zzso zzso This implies that zzso zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso When treated with zzso of the Ras downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso was zzso most significantly by zzso suggesting that among the downstream pathways of zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso With the application of blocking zzso to zzso zzso (2 - 2 zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso cells was enhanced to zzso zzso at 20 zzso These results suggest that migration of zzso cells could be modulated by zzso via zzso of the expression levels of zzso zzso
