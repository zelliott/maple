Human breast cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso can adapt to circumvent any reduced growth rate during long-term zzso zzso and this provides three model systems to investigate mechanisms of zzso resistance in breast zzso In this paper we report consistent differences in the effects of three growth zzso following long-term zzso deprivation in all three cell zzso zzso zzso deprivation of zzso zzso and zzso cells resulted in reduced growth zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a loss of dependence on zzso protein zzso pathways for zzso The growth inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth of both zzso and zzso cells with similar zzso zzso continued similar dependence on zzso zzso zzso pathways with no zzso after adaptation to zzso independent zzso However, by contrast, long-term zzso deprivation resulted in an increased sensitivity to growth zzso by zzso which was not reduced by zzso of zzso The enhanced zzso of long-term zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell growth by combining zzso with zzso at zzso where each alone had little effect, offers zzso support to the development of therapeutic combinations of zzso zzso with other zzso zzso in zzso breast zzso
