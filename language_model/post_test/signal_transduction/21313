The zzso signal zzso controlling the proliferation of zzso cells on a thin film of poorly zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso The zzso thin film was prepared on polystyrene culture dishes or cover glasses using zzso calcium zzso solution, which was made zzso by heating an zzso solution prepared at low zzso The zzso thin film was used for cell culture without additional surface zzso Several differences were found between the cells zzso on a cell culture dish and the cells cultured on the zzso zzso zzso into zzso of the cell cycle was markedly delayed and there was a low proliferation rate of zzso On the zzso thin film, the cells spread in a more slender zzso Also, the formation of focal zzso and stress zzso examined using zzso zzso was zzso weaker in the cells on zzso The zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso was low as zzso zzso of zzso D1 and E was also zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was zzso activated by stimulation with zzso These results demonstrate that the low cell proliferation on the zzso surface appears to be due to insufficient zzso of signaling that forces the cell cycle to progress and this may be due to weak zzso signaling in cells on that zzso
