zzso growth factor beta zzso is an important regulator of zzso in some cell types, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely zzso zzso signals through type I and type II receptors and downstream zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which associate with zzso and zzso to the nucleus, where they regulate gene zzso zzso zzso protein is induced by zzso and has been classified as an zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso of zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso signaling responses zzso zzso expression is increased in rat zzso zzso cells undergoing zzso as a result of zzso zzso Here we have shown that zzso treatment or zzso expression of zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was prevented by zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines or upon transient zzso with zzso zzso in several investigated cell zzso These findings provide evidence for a new zzso function for zzso in zzso zzso
