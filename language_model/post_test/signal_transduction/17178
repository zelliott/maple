zzso acids zzso are recently recognized key signaling molecules that control zzso metabolism and energy zzso zzso activate multiple signaling zzso including those of nuclear zzso primarily zzso X zzso zzso membrane BA zzso and zzso zzso to regulate the zzso zzso Small zzso partner zzso has been implicated as a key zzso of these BA signaling pathways by recruitment of zzso zzso zzso but the key question of how zzso zzso BA signaling into repressive zzso modifications at liver zzso genes remains zzso Here we show that protein zzso zzso zzso is activated by BA or zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and that zzso zzso is critical for the zzso coordinator functions of zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and both are recruited to zzso target genes after zzso acid or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are predominantly located in the nucleus after zzso zzso zzso at zzso is required for subsequent zzso at zzso a naturally occurring zzso site in zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso increases interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and their occupancy at selective zzso zzso This molecular cascade leads to repressive modifications of zzso at zzso target zzso and consequently, decreased BA pools and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso these zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study identifies zzso as a novel key upstream regulator of zzso zzso function, revealing the role of zzso zzso in zzso regulation of liver zzso
