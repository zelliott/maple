The bone zzso protein zzso family of signaling molecules and their zzso are involved in patterning of the body axis and numerous aspects of zzso Classical zzso zzso and protein sequencing of highly zzso zzso containing potent bone forming activity from bovine cartilage identified several zzso together with a number of other zzso One such protein was zzso zzso modular zzso zzso classified as belonging to the zzso family of modular zzso zzso Data regarding the biological function of zzso and closely related zzso remain zzso and their expression or function during zzso development is zzso We therefore isolated the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and explored its function in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso acted similarly to a zzso zzso However, in contrast to known zzso zzso zzso antagonists, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the presence of a zzso active zzso zzso indicating a mechanism of action downstream of the zzso We provide several lines of evidence to suggest that zzso acts downstream of the zzso zzso via zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies, using zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be essential for zzso zzso The catastrophic zzso failure observed following zzso zzso resembles that observed following simultaneous depletion of three zzso zzso zzso described in prior zzso These findings provide a direct link between the zzso zzso protein zzso and a signaling zzso of general importance in zzso patterning and cell or tissue fate zzso
