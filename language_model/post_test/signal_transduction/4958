When plants are under insect zzso attack defensive measures are activated not only locally, but also in distant and systemic zzso While insect zzso zzso abundant in the oral zzso of the attacking zzso are essential in the regulation of induced defenses, little is known about their effects on systemic defense signaling in zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was therefore to identify genetic markers that can be used to further characterize local and systemic signaling events induced by zzso or mechanical wounding zzso We selected genes for this study based on their putative involvement in signaling zzso oxide zzso regulation of gene expression zzso factor zzso and in direct defenses zzso zzso zzso and analyzed their expression in different sections of the treated leaf as well as in systemic parts of the same zzso We found the most significant transcript zzso of the selected genes after treatment with insect zzso in those parts with increased zzso zzso Additionally, treatment with zzso did also induce the zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso parts of the treated leaf and zzso zzso in contrast, did induce zzso and zzso only locally, but not zzso This local suppression of zzso was further studied by adding zzso zzso as an electron donor to zzso plants to zzso putative zzso zzso zzso which build up to significant levels around the damage zzso Indeed, zzso zzso plants accumulated zzso at the damage site and also produced more zzso suggesting a putative zzso element being involved in the suppression of zzso The results presented zzso provide evidence for the specific induction of distant signaling events triggered by zzso most likely through electric zzso Additionally, a putative role for zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of defense genes was zzso
