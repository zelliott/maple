zzso and other zzso proteins are crucial for zzso zzso trafficking, fusion, and zzso Previously, we isolated the zzso protein zzso zzso from tobacco in a screen for zzso zzso signaling zzso demonstrating its role in determining the zzso acid sensitivity of zzso and zzso channels in zzso guard zzso zzso is localized to the plasma membrane and is expressed normally throughout the plant, especially in root zzso suggesting that it might contribute to cellular zzso as well as to zzso To explore its functions in zzso further, we examined zzso transformed lines of tobacco that expressed various zzso of zzso including the full-length protein and a truncated fragment, zzso corresponding to the zzso domain shown previously to be active in suppressing zzso channel response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso high levels of protein zzso times the zzso zzso and was associated with a significant enhancement of root growth in zzso but not with any obvious zzso in mature, zzso zzso Similar transformations with zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso showed altered leaf zzso but gave only low levels of zzso fragment, suggesting a strong selective pressure against plants expressing this zzso High expression of the zzso zzso was achieved in stable zzso under the control of a zzso zzso zzso expression was correlated positively with altered cellular and tissue zzso in leaves and roots and with a zzso of growth in zzso zzso of the full-length zzso protein rescued the zzso zzso even in plants expressing high levels of the zzso fragment, supporting the idea that the zzso zzso zzso specifically with zzso function by competing with zzso for its binding zzso To explore zzso function in zzso we used a green fluorescent protein zzso section zzso When a zzso zzso marker was zzso with zzso in tobacco leaves, zzso zzso was retained in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in plants zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso alone, no zzso zzso accumulated within the zzso A new yellow fluorescent zzso zzso marker was used to show that the zzso structures labeled in the presence of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso These structures were not labeled in the presence of a dominant zzso zzso that inhibited transport from the zzso zzso to the zzso We propose that zzso functions as an element in zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma membrane and is required for cellular growth and zzso
