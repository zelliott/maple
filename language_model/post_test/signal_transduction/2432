We have studied zzso zzso channels of zzso zzso into an artificial zzso zzso zzso membrane from the point of view of electric signal zzso Signal zzso properties of these channels are highly sensitive to the external electric zzso Specifically, addition of zzso zzso noise of zzso zzso zzso to a small sine wave input signal increases the output signal by approximately zzso zzso zzso and even slightly zzso the zzso ratio at the system zzso We have developed a zzso zzso theory of zzso resonance for a zzso system of zzso zzso zzso This theory describes our main experimental findings giving good qualitative understanding of the underlying zzso It predicts the right value of the output zzso ratio and provides a reliable estimate for the noise intensity corresponding to its zzso Our results suggest that the zzso channel in a zzso zzso is a good model system for studies of mechanisms of primary electrical signal processing in biology showing an important feature of signal zzso improvement by a fluctuating zzso
