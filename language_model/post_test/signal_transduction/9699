zzso pulp stem cells zzso have been receiving more attentions recently as an important zzso for tissue zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in regulating zzso and differentiation of a variety of zzso The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of zzso zzso interference zzso on the proliferation and differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells in zzso 

In the present study, we performed gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso zzso Changes of proliferation in zzso were examined by cell cycle analysis, Cell viability zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso zzso zzso and the differentiation of cells was detected with zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso red S zzso calcium concentration zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and some of zzso displayed changes in zzso or zzso zzso The growth rate of zzso zzso was significantly suppressed as compared with wild type zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso capability of zzso into zzso is much higher than the two control zzso 

zzso zzso plays a crucial role in regulating zzso and differentiation in zzso The deficient zzso zzso zzso the zzso capacity of zzso and tends to induce zzso differentiation under zzso zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso might be zzso to stem cell therapies and tooth tissue zzso
