The zzso protein zzso is activated by zzso zzso in response to DNA damage and zzso cellular signaling pathways that facilitate cell survival and reduce zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso are required for the recruitment of previously activated zzso to the sites of DNA breaks after zzso zzso and that this recruitment is required for the zzso of zzso by zzso To explore the functional importance of zzso zzso zzso cells were generated, in which the two zzso zzso sites in zzso are zzso Although these cells demonstrate normal zzso and focus formation of zzso zzso and zzso proteins after zzso they exhibit a defective zzso checkpoint, decreased survival, and increased zzso aberrations after DNA zzso These observations suggest that many of the abnormal stress responses seen in cells lacking zzso zzso or zzso result from a failure of zzso migration to sites of DNA breaks and a zzso lack of zzso zzso
