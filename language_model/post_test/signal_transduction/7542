zzso insect societies display a remarkable zzso division of labor between a single fertile queen and thousands of largely sterile zzso In most species, however, the workers retain the capacity to zzso particularly in zzso colonies where typically many workers lay zzso As yet, the molecular zzso that initiate this shift in worker fertility are still poorly zzso By using zzso interference we here demonstrate that the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso a gene which was previously shown to be involved in zzso zzso zzso also zzso reproduction in worker zzso zzso zzso These data show that worker fertility and zzso zzso determination partly rely on the same gene regulatory networks, thereby providing a major breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular zzso of the social zzso spectacular zzso division of zzso
