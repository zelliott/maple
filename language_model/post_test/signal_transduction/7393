We were able to demonstrate zzso specific and zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso to immobilized zzso protein A zzso with an apparent zzso constant of 53 zzso at zzso zzso of a zzso zzso excess of the zzso associated zzso zzso prevented and zzso the binding of zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso had no zzso Using a zzso for zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were able to show that zzso in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso pathway, whereas zzso alone had no zzso Studies with structural zzso of the distinct zzso tail domain and head domain indicated that zzso activity of zzso resided in the head zzso No zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso In addition, we observed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso These results indicate that zzso may have a regulatory role in the zzso processes in the zzso
