zzso growth zzso zzso signal zzso is zzso via specific cell surface signaling zzso zzso most notably the type I zzso zzso and the type II zzso We evaluated zzso and zzso expression in 41 human pancreatic cancer tissue samples and correlated these findings with clinical data of the zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that, in comparison with the normal zzso pancreatic zzso exhibited zzso and zzso increases zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso zzso were highly expressed in the majority of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso revealed positive zzso in zzso and zzso of the tumors, zzso Both receptors were zzso present in zzso of the pancreatic cancer zzso The presence of zzso or zzso and the zzso presence of zzso and zzso in the cancer cells was associated with advanced tumor stage zzso zzso zzso These findings show that in many human pancreatic zzso increased levels of the two signaling zzso are zzso The presence of the signaling zzso in advanced tumor stages indicates a role in disease zzso
