zzso are zzso in origin and formed by zzso differentiation and fusion of zzso zzso zzso However, the signal zzso mechanisms involved in generation of zzso are not zzso We have used two well-known zzso zzso zzso to examine the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the number of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso cells in cultured mouse zzso bones and in mouse bone zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso toxin were compared with those of zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso increased the number of zzso zzso bone in zzso and zzso cultures of mouse zzso zzso In mouse bone zzso cultures, zzso or zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso or zzso toxin produced zzso stimulation of these cells at a range of zzso zzso with their effect on zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso binding and by the zzso activity of the zzso The sustained presence zzso zzso of zzso or zzso was required to obtain zzso formation of zzso However, the presence of zzso was required only for the last 3 d of culture for zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may stimulate zzso generation using the zzso zzso zzso system as a signal zzso zzso
