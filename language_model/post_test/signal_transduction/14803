Many marine zzso reproduce through a zzso zzso The settlement and metamorphosis of most of the species are zzso and induced by environmental organisms, mainly zzso The zzso zzso zzso has become a model zzso for metamorphosis of marine zzso In this species, bacteria, zzso zzso zzso are the natural zzso of zzso Like in other species of marine zzso metamorphosis can be induced artificially by zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we present systematic data that zzso both inducing compounds, the natural one from bacteria and the artificial one zzso indeed similar with respect to zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the primary induction signal in the zzso zzso the pattern of zzso cells occurring during the initial 10 h of metamorphosis and zzso the disappearance of zzso zzso signals in sensory zzso during this zzso However, a difference occurs during the development of the anterior end, zzso as zzso cells and settlement appear earlier in zzso induced with zzso Thus, basically, zzso may be used as an artificial zzso mimicking the natural zzso However, differences in the appearance of zzso cells and in settlement raise the question of how enormous zzso plasticity in zzso actually can be, and how this is related to the absence of zzso zzso in zzso
