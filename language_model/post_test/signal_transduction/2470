The stratum zzso of zzso is a major structural compartment that provides mechanical protection and prevents skin zzso The water barrier function of the stratum zzso was first reported in 1944, and this was shown later to be associated with multilayered zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso The major zzso components isolated from the zzso zzso layers are zzso which belong to the class of zzso cholesterol and free fatty zzso their zzso is in tight relationship with the zzso barrier zzso In studies in which the barrier is artificially zzso zzso zzso is found to be directly regulated by barrier zzso As mentioned above, the zzso involved in this process are located in the zzso spaces of the upper zzso zzso whereas zzso the most common zzso is an integral part of the zzso plasma membrane of the zzso During the last few years, however, increasing evidence has shown that zzso may also take part in cell zzso and the term zzso zzso has been coined to describe this novel zzso of signal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cycle are zzso as the products of an zzso zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso induce cell differentiation and/or zzso and reduce cell zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso which are complex partly zzso species containing zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso are not zzso and have zzso chain lengths of 16 and 18 carbon zzso We present here a review of our present knowledge on the zzso cycle as a possible signal zzso zzso in the human zzso We discuss the common origin of zzso zzso zzso the zzso barrier and of zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso and serving as second zzso A summary of zzso in zzso metabolism and zzso composition of the zzso in diseased skin is also given and the possible use of different zzso for therapy is zzso
