zzso signaling has emerged as a potent regulator of zzso synaptic function, although no evidence yet supports a critical role for zzso signaling in zzso zzso Here, we sought to determine whether zzso zzso zzso signaling is necessary for zzso memory zzso Immediately after training in a zzso object recognition task, mice received a zzso zzso zzso infusion of vehicle or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50, 100, or 200 zzso zzso hours later, mice receiving vehicle remembered the familiar object explored during zzso However, mice receiving zzso exhibited no memory for the training object, indicating that object recognition memory consolidation is dependent on zzso zzso zzso To determine how zzso affects zzso zzso zzso mice were infused with vehicle or 50 zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in the zzso zzso 5 zzso or 4 h zzso zzso produced a rapid increase in zzso protein levels and a decrease in zzso zzso levels, followed by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels 4 h zzso These data suggest that zzso in zzso signaling may zzso the memory zzso induced by zzso In a subsequent experiment, object training alone rapidly increased zzso zzso zzso and levels of zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso signaling is regulated by object learning and is necessary for zzso memory zzso
