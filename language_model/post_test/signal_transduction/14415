zzso melanoma is the most invasive and deadly form of skin cancer with no effective therapy to treat advanced disease, leading to poor survival zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso zzso in approximately zzso of zzso Thus, targeting zzso signaling in melanoma patients has significant therapeutic potential for zzso zzso but no zzso zzso agent zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso zzso can cause systemic toxicity or increase zzso zzso and targeting the zzso zzso that zzso zzso might circumvent these complications but would require demonstration of its functional importance in zzso normal zzso In this study, zzso was identified as an zzso zzso that zzso zzso to promote melanoma zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased during melanoma tumor progression zzso increasing zzso zzso Majority of zzso from patients with elevated zzso activity also had zzso higher levels of zzso zzso zzso or upstream zzso similarly reduced zzso growth in culture and inhibited tumor development in zzso zzso decreased zzso increased tumor cell zzso as well as sensitivity of melanoma cells to zzso agents, thereby decreasing zzso zzso these studies provide a solid zzso basis for targeting zzso to inhibit the zzso signaling cascade and thereby zzso melanoma zzso
