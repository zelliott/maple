The zzso signaling zzso is activated by many cellular zzso It regulates fundamental cellular functions, including transcription, translation, zzso growth and zzso It also closely interacts with many other key pathways such as zzso and, thus, is linked to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is associated with many human zzso We reviewed the available literature on zzso and zzso targeting drugs for zzso cell zzso 

zzso and the proceedings of the main zzso meetings were extensively searched to identify the available literature on the role of this zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso and on zzso and clinical activity of compounds specifically targeting this zzso Clinical data and perspectives on several compounds at different stages of development were also zzso 

zzso evidence links zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso cell zzso is an ideal setting in which to test compounds specifically targeting this zzso Several zzso zzso are currently under zzso and early clinical development as zzso agents but only zzso zzso zzso New York, New York) appears to be at a more advanced stage, having been tested with promising results alone or combined with other zzso targeted zzso 

The zzso zzso has a pivotal role in zzso cell zzso zzso and, thus, represents an ideal target for therapeutic zzso Of the several compounds in early zzso of development only zzso has already proved to be clinically zzso Thus, it should be considered an extremely interesting drug to be used alone or in zzso
