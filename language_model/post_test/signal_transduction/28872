The zzso zzso zzso is a major control factor for zzso zzso and zzso Our knowledge about the zzso is focused on its function as a zzso zzso However, cells do not always respond to steroids in the same way or develop zzso The mechanism underlying such a modified steroid response is not well zzso and may depend on the zzso of the cells or on the stage of their zzso zzso we studied the effect of cell density and inflammatory conditions on the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso function of the zzso in primary human lung zzso zzso In zzso cells the zzso was located zzso while in zzso cells it was zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso the level of zzso zzso and protein under all zzso In zzso cells zzso activated the nuclear zzso and DNA binding of the zzso zzso while in zzso cells its activity declined after 6 zzso In zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, the zzso zzso with a zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso which resulted in an zzso of zzso expression and suppression of zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced zzso expression via zzso zzso protein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not mediate the zzso effect of zzso but simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso unlocked contact zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate that cell density and serum exposure alter the zzso and function of the zzso
