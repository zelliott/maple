zzso (also known as zzso or zzso is a novel zzso that is highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso Through its interaction with various zzso zzso mediates the degradation of the tumor zzso proteins zzso and zzso Although zzso was reported to zzso zzso whether zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso remains zzso Here we report that both growth factors and Ras zzso zzso expression through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression subsequently enhanced the zzso activity of zzso This effect was observed in zzso cells, suggesting a zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso protein levels, leading to increased release of free zzso into the zzso from the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression of zzso resulted in elevated expression of the zzso zzso We also observed that both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso and a correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso in primary human zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso expression is regulated by a positive feedback loop involving zzso which may play a critical role in zzso and the progression of zzso
