zzso oxide zzso a highly zzso free zzso has been identified as a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous zzso NO zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for NO production from zzso and plays an important role in regulating the release of several zzso zzso In the zzso NO was found to increase growth hormone zzso zzso in several in zzso and in zzso However, its role in human zzso regulation is zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of NO on human zzso and zzso zzso using primary cell cultures of human fetal zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso of the human fetal zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso 1 zzso a NO zzso for 4 h resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso similar to the zzso effect evoked by growth zzso hormone zzso (10 zzso However, fetal zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso release was also zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso of the cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release was inhibited in both fetal and zzso cells by zzso a NO zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso the second zzso of multiple NO actions, enhanced fetal and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in normal zzso and zzso human zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of its functional expression using zzso (1 zzso yielded a zzso increase in zzso release from cultured zzso zzso This response was blocked by a zzso inhibitor with high selectivity for the zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, NO stimulates human zzso in cultured fetal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is probably involved in this hormonal zzso
