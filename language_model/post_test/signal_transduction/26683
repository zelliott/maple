A major therapeutic challenge is how to replace bone once it is zzso Bone loss is a characteristic of chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases such as zzso arthritis and zzso zzso and zzso of the immune system are known to regulate bone turnover by controlling the differentiation and activity of zzso the bone zzso zzso However, less is known about the regulation of zzso zzso the bone forming zzso This study aimed to investigate whether immune cells also regulate zzso zzso Using in zzso cell cultures of human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso it was shown that zzso zzso induced zzso differentiation into zzso This was evident by increased alkaline zzso zzso after 7 days and the formation of zzso bone zzso at 21 zzso This zzso zzso effect was zzso by cell contact with zzso leading to the production of soluble zzso by the zzso As a consequence of these interactions we observed a rapid zzso of zzso in the zzso Gene profiling of zzso zzso active zzso infected zzso using zzso whole human zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso were zzso whilst zzso was zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso also led to the zzso of the zzso M zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso that was produced by zzso activated zzso in zzso and zzso zzso to zzso reduced zzso by zzso These data indicate that zzso in conjunction with other zzso can drive zzso differentiation into zzso This study establishes a role for zzso as critical regulators of zzso differentiation via zzso production and the induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the local zzso of zzso in bone cells may be a valuable tool to increase bone formation in osteoporosis and arthritis, and in zzso bone zzso during fracture zzso
