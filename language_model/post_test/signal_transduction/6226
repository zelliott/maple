To identify functions of the fragile zzso zzso zzso zzso matched pairs of zzso and -positive human cancer cell zzso and normal cell lines established from zzso zzso and zzso mice, were stressed and examined for differences in cell cycle zzso and zzso A larger fraction of zzso human cancer cells and zzso kidney cells survived treatment with zzso C or zzso light compared to matched zzso zzso approximately zzso more colonies of zzso cells survived high zzso doses in zzso zzso The human cancer cells were zzso in zzso released into S and treated with zzso or zzso zzso At 18 h post zzso C treatment approximately zzso more zzso than zzso cells had died, and 18 h post zzso treatment zzso more zzso cells were zzso Similar results were obtained for the zzso zzso zzso After low zzso doses, the rate of DNA synthesis in zzso cells decreased more rapidly and steeply than in zzso cells, although the zzso zzso appeared intact in both cell zzso zzso surviving zzso zzso cells appear transformed and exhibit zzso increased zzso zzso This increased zzso burden could explain the zzso of zzso cells in zzso to zzso zzso
