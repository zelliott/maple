zzso flies with the zzso zzso exhibit impaired vision due to the lack of a specific zzso influx zzso in the zzso The identification of the zzso gene product as a zzso zzso channel and the search for zzso zzso in flies, worms and zzso has opened the way to the discovery of a whole zzso of zzso channels, baptized zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso or zzso channels, with whom they share their zzso architecture, zzso channels are not activated by zzso but by a variety of signals including zzso and zzso zzso zzso depletion and mechanical or zzso zzso Due to the zzso of these gating mechanisms, zzso channels are privileged candidates as primary sensing molecules for the recognition and integration of physical and chemical signals from the zzso In this review we discuss recent evidence that implicates members of the zzso zzso in sensory signal zzso
