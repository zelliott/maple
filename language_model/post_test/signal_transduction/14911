There is growing evidence that zzso involves the nuclear zzso factor zzso in conjunction with related zzso However, in the context of mechanical zzso forces, zzso target genes assigned to pathways of zzso and zzso have not been fully zzso To contribute to the identification of putative target zzso we used zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso pathways and zzso elevated gene expression in primary human zzso ligament zzso zzso after a 6 h application of mechanical zzso Among several identified genes (including several zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso displayed significantly higher expression on the zzso zzso whereas higher expression was obtained for zzso of cell death zzso member 6 of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso with death domain zzso on the zzso zzso Based on a defined zzso level of a more than zzso higher zzso this significance in elevated gene expression was zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Here, zzso zzso zzso revealed a more pronounced zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso after 6 h of stretch, when compared with 12 zzso Moreover, the zzso after 6 h as observed by zzso was zzso with quantitative zzso zzso zzso yielded levels of zzso higher relative gene expression for zzso beta and zzso for zzso whereas that zzso for BAD indicated a zzso for zzso a zzso and for zzso a zzso higher zzso The data obtained from the expression analysis thus indicate a zzso zzso zzso of genes assigned to the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso may render them target candidates for being addressed by mechanical zzso zzso
