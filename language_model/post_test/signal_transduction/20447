zzso oxygen species zzso the most prominent free zzso produced in cells, can have both beneficial and zzso effects on zzso Many genes are known to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 3 zzso or zzso was identified in an analysis of genes induced by zzso before the onset of zzso It is a widely zzso gene between many zzso Until now it has been shown to exert two disparate cellular zzso The first is that of zzso producer linked to zzso induced zzso In this context, it exhibits a zzso dependent zzso activity with zzso The second is that of a component of the DNA damage response zzso While it is considered as a zzso dependent zzso zzso it is rarely affected in zzso This data does not support an zzso zzso In the present review we present and discuss aspects on the regulation and function of this factor and how it is implicated in zzso We conclude by proposing that zzso may possibly have a role in cancer cell zzso
