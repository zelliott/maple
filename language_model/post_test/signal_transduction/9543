The novel zzso brain permeable iron, zzso zzso zzso was shown to possess zzso activities in zzso and in zzso against several insults zzso to various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and zzso lateral zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic chronic administration of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso factor zzso protein levels in various brain regions zzso cortex, zzso and zzso and spinal zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso induced zzso target zzso including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression levels of the growth factors, zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso treatment in a zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso induced a differential enhanced zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso iron zzso zzso can zzso a number of zzso mechanisms and zzso signaling pathways in the brain that might function as important therapeutic targets for the drug in the context of neurodegenerative disease zzso
