Mixed lineage zzso zzso is a 97 zzso zzso zzso with multiple interaction zzso including a zzso binding zzso but unknown zzso zzso and the related small zzso binding protein zzso can activate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may have a role in upstream regulation of these zzso In support of this role, we demonstrate that zzso can specifically activate the zzso and zzso zzso but has no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso at sites required for zzso suggesting direct regulation of these protein zzso Furthermore, interactions between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso of the zzso zzso by a newly identified zzso analog of zzso zzso center zzso but not by zzso suggesting that zzso functions to activate the zzso and zzso zzso in response to stimuli zzso by zzso zzso
