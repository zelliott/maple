zzso of zzso D activity is frequently observed during zzso zzso of zzso zzso but the cellular functions of this signaling zzso are not well zzso zzso zzso express zzso receptors for zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso of which stimulates zzso hormone zzso and transient expression of zzso In zzso cells and alpha zzso zzso zzso action was associated with both initial and sustained zzso zzso production, whereas zzso induced only a transient zzso zzso Also, zzso D activity, estimated by the production of zzso from zzso in the presence of ethanol, was zzso by zzso but not zzso Such formation of zzso at the expense of zzso acid zzso during zzso zzso of zzso D significantly reduced the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso also decreased zzso zzso production and, in contrast to ethanol, increased PA and zzso zzso zzso zzso The fall in zzso production caused by ethanol and zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso hormone release was not zzso In contrast to their zzso actions on zzso early gene zzso neither ethanol nor zzso affected zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso D zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso and indicate that zzso is the primary signal for this zzso
