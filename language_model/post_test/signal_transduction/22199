Although zzso is reportedly implicated in zzso and the progression of human zzso its precise mechanism has not been fully zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso regulates zzso growth factor zzso cancer progression in zzso colon cancer zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the migration of zzso colon cancer cells and the mechanism underlying the involvement of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso enhanced cell zzso zzso cells spontaneously release vascular zzso growth factor zzso however, zzso had little effect on its zzso While zzso which is generally zzso in zzso cells, was clearly suppressed by zzso zzso zzso did not affect its zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso caused a dramatic change in the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibitor restored the loss of zzso focal zzso formation induced by zzso We also observed similar effects for zzso on the migration and zzso of focal zzso components such as zzso in another colon cancer cell line, zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest that zzso zzso regulates the migration of colon cancer cells by altering focal zzso formation via the zzso zzso
