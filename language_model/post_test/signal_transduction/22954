Signaling by members of the zzso family of protein zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso is important in many biological responses, including gene transcription, zzso zzso and cell zzso and spreading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has been implicated in the progression of colon cancer and transformation of cultured cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, precise regulation of zzso activity is critical for normal cell zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso When zzso this zzso zzso mediates an zzso interaction that results in a zzso or inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that loss of zzso resulted in a reduction in the abundance of the zzso and zzso zzso which could be restored by reintroducing zzso active zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression was not due to an increase in zzso message, but to stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity also increased the level of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso and zzso of zzso increased the extent of zzso Thus, zzso degradation represents an additional mechanism by which active zzso can be zzso
