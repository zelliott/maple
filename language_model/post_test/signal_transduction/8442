Bone zzso proteins zzso induce zzso differentiation of zzso via binding to cell surface zzso zzso guidance molecules zzso have been identified as zzso zzso We report here that zzso a member of the zzso family, suppressed zzso signaling in zzso zzso via a novel zzso All zzso were expressed in zzso cells that were differentiated into zzso and zzso cells, but zzso was not detected in immature zzso In zzso cells, only zzso suppressed zzso and zzso promoter activities induced by zzso or by zzso activated zzso type I zzso This zzso by zzso was dependent on the zzso form of the von zzso factor type D zzso zzso even suppressed zzso signaling induced by zzso activated zzso zzso of zzso did not alter the zzso capacity of zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso may be an inhibitor of zzso signaling in zzso zzso We also suggest that a novel zzso expressed on the cell membrane may mediate the signal zzso of zzso in order to suppress zzso signaling in zzso zzso
