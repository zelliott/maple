Human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is regulated both at zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on human zzso expression was zzso In zzso human zzso zzso cells, both the zzso of zzso by a pharmacological inhibitor zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to a reduction of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso promoter activity was not affected by these zzso zzso zzso seems to regulate zzso expression through zzso mechanisms by stabilizing zzso zzso Our laboratory has shown recently that a zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso is a major positive regulator of human zzso expression by stabilizing zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso by zzso on zzso expression was zzso Both zzso and zzso targeted at zzso resulted in a reduction of zzso protein expression without affecting the amount of zzso zzso These data suggest a zzso control of zzso expression by zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso or zzso did not change zzso zzso In zzso the results suggest that zzso regulates human zzso expression by stabilizing zzso zzso possibly by a zzso zzso
