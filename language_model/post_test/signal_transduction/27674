Several studies have implicated zzso zzso in primary axis formation during zzso zzso yet no zzso protein has been shown to be essential for this zzso In the zzso primitive streak formation is the first overt zzso sign of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is expressed before zzso in the zzso zzso of the egg cylinder, then is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso and its associated visceral zzso and subsequently to the primitive streak and zzso zzso mice develop a normal egg cylinder but do not form a primitive streak, zzso or zzso The zzso continues to zzso in an zzso state that lacks zzso neural zzso but anterior visceral zzso markers are expressed and correctly zzso Our results suggest that regional patterning of the visceral zzso is independent of primitive streak formation, but the subsequent establishment of zzso neural pattern in the zzso is dependent on derivatives of the primitive zzso These studies provide genetic proof for the requirement of zzso in primary axis formation in the zzso
