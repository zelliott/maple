The emergence of resistance to zzso drugs calls for the search for new zzso molecules with different resistance zzso zzso compounds are found in various plants and have zzso and zzso zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso a zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso possesses zzso effects by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Real time zzso plaque zzso and zzso techniques were used to study the effects of zzso on proliferation of influenza zzso zzso zzso influenza virus proliferation by blocking attachment of the virus to zzso cells and by suppression of nuclear export of influenza virus zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with influenza virus leads to an increase in production of zzso oxygen species zzso and induction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by a dominant negative zzso of zzso or zzso zzso leads to zzso of influenza zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and enhances influenza proliferation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies suggest that the underlying mechanism for the zzso effect of zzso on influenza virus zzso nuclear export is blocking of zzso induction of zzso zzso
