zzso are zzso organisms that are exposed to a highly variable environment, concerning the availability of zzso temperature, zzso radiation, access to oxygen and, zzso water zzso Evolution has selected zzso to zzso to a certain extent, these environmental zzso High zzso pressure zzso exerts a broad effect upon zzso cells, interfering with the cell zzso cellular architecture and in processes zzso and zzso of zzso Gene expression patterns in response to zzso revealed a stress response zzso The majority of the zzso genes were involved in stress zzso and zzso metabolism while most of the zzso ones were in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis zzso In addition, in the present work it was seen that mild pressure induced cell cycle arrest and protection against severe zzso such as high temperature, high pressure and ultra cold zzso Nevertheless, this protection was only significant if the cells were incubated at atmospheric pressure after the zzso zzso zzso of genes that were zzso by zzso and are related to resistance to this stresses were also zzso and, for the majority of them, higher induction was attained after 15 zzso zzso Taken together, the results imply an zzso among zzso
