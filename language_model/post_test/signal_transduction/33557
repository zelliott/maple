zzso zzso of the zzso domain family 1, zzso A gene zzso is one of the most frequent events found in human zzso In this study we set out to test the hypothesis that loss of zzso can cooperate with zzso of the zzso zzso coli zzso gene to accelerate zzso zzso using the zzso zzso mouse model, as zzso or zzso zzso of zzso is a frequent early event in the genesis of zzso zzso Further, loss of zzso has also been reported to occur in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been implicated in an array of pivotal cellular zzso including regulation of the cell cycle, zzso zzso stability and most recently in the zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso specific zzso knockout mice with zzso mice, we showed that loss of zzso results in a significant increase in zzso of the small zzso and accelerated zzso zzso leading to the earlier death of zzso mice and decreased overall zzso Comparative zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso mice revealed no evidence of zzso or gross zzso instability (no difference to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed increased nuclear zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso mice, compared to those from zzso zzso mice, but no differences in proliferation marker zzso zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate cooperation between zzso of zzso and zzso resulting in accelerated zzso zzso with zzso showing increased nuclear zzso of zzso supporting a zzso link via loss of the known interaction of zzso with zzso that usually mediates degradation of zzso
