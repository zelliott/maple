The target of zzso complex 1 zzso is an essential zzso complex zzso from zzso to zzso Under favorable growth conditions, and in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso is active, and influences virtually all aspects of cell zzso Although two direct zzso of zzso zzso have been reported zzso a regulator of zzso zzso and zzso an zzso family zzso the signaling pathways that couple zzso to its zzso zzso were not well zzso To zzso these pathways we developed and employed a zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in various genetic backgrounds revealed both documented and novel zzso zzso and allowed us to partition zzso events between zzso and zzso zzso detailed characterization shows that zzso regulates zzso zzso I and III, the latter via zzso in addition to translation initiation and the expression of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso This demonstrates that zzso is a master regulator of protein zzso
