zzso factors of the zzso gene family are selectively activated by many hormones and zzso zzso originally was cloned as a zzso zzso zzso but is also activated by zzso zzso in many cell zzso The recent identification of two distinct zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso as well as several lower molecular weight zzso suggests additional complexity and zzso possibilities for zzso zzso We now report a zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso which was associated with: 1) rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso truncated zzso zzso form, zzso and zzso 2) rapid and selective formation of zzso zzso without involvement of zzso or zzso 3) marked zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and 4) the appearance of two zzso distinct zzso protein complexes, which zzso between zzso corresponding to the zzso response elements of the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso gene zzso zzso our analyses showed that zzso and zzso respond similarly to zzso zzso zzso but also suggested that the two genes have evolved unique properties that may contribute to the specificity of receptors that zzso zzso signaling zzso
