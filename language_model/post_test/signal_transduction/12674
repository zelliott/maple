Signaling pathways involving zzso and zzso have been implicated in several aspects of sympathetic zzso zzso Here, we used in zzso zzso approaches in both mouse and chick zzso to characterize the zzso role of zzso Whereas sympathetic zzso development proceeds normally in zzso mouse zzso a decrease in zzso differentiation zzso zzso was observed in chick sympathetic zzso in response to zzso a zzso zzso zzso which interferes with the function of all zzso family zzso In contrast, expression of the generic zzso marker zzso was not affected by zzso As the decrease in zzso gene expression is compensated at later stages of development and zzso expression in differentiated zzso is not zzso a transient role for zzso is proposed, accelerating zzso but not generic zzso differentiation of sympathetic zzso
