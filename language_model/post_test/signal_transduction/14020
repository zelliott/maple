Permanent zzso zzso zzso has largely remained incurable since the existing information for explaining precise mechanisms underlying zzso is not zzso zzso analysis offers a broader and unbiased approach to identify and predict new biological features of zzso By considering the unbalanced sample numbers in most zzso data of case - control, we designed an zzso principal component analysis zzso and applied it to zzso - analyze differential gene expression data of zzso patients and control samples for predicting new biological zzso Finally, we identified 51 zzso expressed genes using the proposed method, in which 42 zzso expressed genes are new findings compared with two related works on the same data and the existing zzso The enrichment analysis illustrated the reliability of identified zzso expressed zzso Moreover, we predicted three new zzso - related signaling pathways using the identified zzso expressed genes via the zzso zzso zzso Our analysis and the existing studies supported that the predicted signaling pathways may promote the zzso zzso The results above are worthy to do further experimental zzso This work provides some new insights into molecular features of zzso It has also the potentially important implications for improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso
