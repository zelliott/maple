The zzso at the anterior tip of the primitive streak serves as an initial generator of the zzso zzso axis in zzso zzso We now show that a small zzso in molecular signaling at the zzso is responsible for the zzso reversal of visceral zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso which encodes an inhibitor of zzso is zzso with the level of zzso expression being higher on the left side and that of zzso expression higher on the zzso In zzso zzso however, a localized reduction in the level of zzso expression results in zzso of the zzso signal and a zzso induction of zzso expression in the zzso The zzso expression of zzso delays the onset of zzso expression in the lateral plate zzso zzso asymmetry of zzso expression in the zzso also becomes reversed in a manner dependent on the zzso zzso zzso expression in the lateral plate zzso then appears on the right side, probably reflecting the balance between zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso of zzso expression by the zzso signal suggests a mechanism for amplification of the cue for zzso asymmetry provided by zzso flow and for stabilization of zzso gene expression around the zzso In zzso zzso this system may function in reverse as a result of zzso production of zzso which zzso the zzso signal on the left side in a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso
