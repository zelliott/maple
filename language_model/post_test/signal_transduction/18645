Members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family initiate zzso pathways that shape innate zzso zzso proteins have recently been implicated as evolutionary zzso scaffold proteins in zzso zzso leading to nuclear zzso and zzso activated protein zzso gene zzso We found that zzso proteins contain a new zzso zzso Because zzso motifs are a feature of a zzso of zzso that target specific proteins for zzso we suggest that zzso proteins are involved in zzso zzso not only as scaffold proteins but also as zzso zzso In support of this hypothesis we show that zzso proteins induce zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We further propose a model in which zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso
