The zzso function of zzso cells is regulated by a number of positive and negative zzso The receptors involved in the negative regulation of zzso cells are known since several years: they are represented by different families of zzso receptors characterized by zzso sequences in their zzso zzso In contrast, the surface molecules responsible for zzso cell zzso in the process of natural zzso and tumor cell zzso have remained elusive until zzso Three distinct zzso molecules termed zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been identified and zzso They play a complementary role in zzso zzso cell zzso in the interaction and zzso of most tumor zzso They are associated with different zzso zzso proteins zzso signal zzso zzso cloning revealed novel members of the zzso zzso displaying a limited zzso with known human zzso
