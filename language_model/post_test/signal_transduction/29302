We recently reported the presence of zzso zzso zzso in brain regions controlling cardiovascular zzso however, the role of zzso in blood pressure regulation remains unclear because of the lack of specific tools to investigate its zzso We hypothesized that zzso could play a pivotal role in the central regulation of cardiovascular function by regulating other zzso system zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated an zzso expressing the human zzso zzso upstream of an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso reporter gene zzso In zzso characterization shows that zzso cells infected with zzso (10 to 100 zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibit zzso zzso expression and zzso In addition, an active zzso form was detected in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso infection zzso zzso units zzso produced zzso expression and activity (with a peak at 7 zzso in the mouse zzso zzso More importantly, 7 days after virus infection, the zzso response to zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso mice compared with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced the zzso zzso drinking zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso II type 1 zzso expression both in zzso and in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso organ zzso zzso zzso zzso and drinking responses at least by zzso the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso plays a pivotal role in the central regulation of blood pressure and volume zzso offering a new target for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular zzso
