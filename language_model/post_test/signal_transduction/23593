zzso are zzso of tissue types with diverse zzso origins, and they rely on distinct stem and zzso cells to meet zzso demands for cellular production and zzso How diverse stem cell activity is coordinated within zzso is not well zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso common skeletal zzso zzso cartilage, zzso zzso zzso isolated from limb bones and bone zzso tissue of zzso zzso and adult zzso The zzso zzso produces zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and at least three zzso of zzso cells that exhibit differential expression of cell surface zzso including zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of differentiation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These three zzso zzso exhibit differential capacities to support zzso zzso stem and zzso zzso Although the zzso subset demonstrates functional stem cell niche activity by maintaining primitive zzso stem cell zzso renewal in zzso the other zzso populations promote zzso differentiation to more committed lines of zzso such as the zzso zzso Gene expression analysis and microscopic studies further reveal a zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso collaborate to provide zzso signaling to zzso and more committed zzso zzso As a result, within the context of bone as a zzso organ, the zzso plays a critical role in supporting zzso through its generation of diverse zzso and zzso zzso including zzso supportive zzso niche zzso
