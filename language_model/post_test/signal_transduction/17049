The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to play a role in the acquisition of resistance to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso However, its exact role in zzso resistance has so far remained zzso Here, we interrogated the hypothesis that the zzso may serve as a zzso for, and may play a role in, intrinsic resistance to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso expression levels were related to zzso sensitivity in 23 zzso cell zzso This sensitivity was re-evaluated after knocking down zzso expression and after zzso zzso through zzso IGF-1 zzso The utility of zzso expression as a zzso zzso was also evaluated by zzso zzso in 98 primary zzso samples from patients treated with zzso 

zzso of the cell lines tested were resistant to zzso whereas 3 cell lines were zzso The three remaining cell lines showed intermediate zzso Thirteen resistant cell lines were found to be positive for zzso zzso while all the sensitive cell lines were negative, resulting in a positive zzso value zzso of zzso for zzso to predict zzso Seven resistant cell lines exhibited high zzso levels, whereas all 3 sensitive cell lines were negative for zzso resulting in a zzso of zzso for zzso to predict zzso Neither a zzso of zzso expression nor an zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso IGF-1 expression affected zzso zzso In primary zzso zzso zzso expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with progressive disease, zzso showing zzso resistance, as compared to those with a complete or partial zzso 

zzso acts as a predictor for resistance to zzso in zzso cell lines and zzso patients, but does not seem to play a role in the intrinsic resistance to this zzso High zzso and zzso levels may predict such a zzso Since the underlying mechanism does not appear to be related to proliferation zzso alternative pathways should be zzso
