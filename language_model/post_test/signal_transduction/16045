Type 2 diabetes is often associated with high blood zzso Here, we investigated the effect of cholesterol loading on zzso cells derived from pancreatic zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso that removes cholesterol from plasma membrane prevented the cells from zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased after the cholesterol zzso suggesting that the zzso protein zzso signaling was zzso A specific zzso inhibitor rescued zzso cells from zzso zzso while zzso inhibitor failed, suggesting the importance of zzso of zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso The expression of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso stress zzso remained zzso indicating that the zzso stress may not be involved in the zzso of cholesterol on the zzso zzso The zzso concentration of zzso oxygen species measured by use of zzso zzso was significantly increased after cholesterol zzso demonstrating the induced zzso was zzso through zzso zzso zzso of reduced form of zzso in the medium rescued zzso cells from zzso induced by cholesterol zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that the free cholesterol loading can induce zzso of zzso cells zzso by zzso stress and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
