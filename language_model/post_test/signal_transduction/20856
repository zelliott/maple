The mechanism by which zzso regulate the growth and maintenance of cells in normal and disease states provides an important setting for studies addressing signal zzso events at the nuclear zzso With the identification of zzso as a nuclear target of IGF-1 action we are provided with a model system for pursuing the molecular mechanisms triggered by IGF-1 zzso
