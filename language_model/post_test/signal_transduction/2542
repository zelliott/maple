zzso sensory zzso in zzso develop from the zzso zzso the neural zzso or zzso Although much is known about the neural crest contribution to zzso zzso relatively little is known about how zzso cells form, zzso and migrate to their zzso Here, we identify zzso as a molecular marker for zzso cells that contribute to the zzso branch of the zzso zzso and use it, in conjunction with zzso labeling of the surface zzso to analyze some of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso is observed as early as the zzso stage in a narrow band of zzso zzso to the zzso neural zzso Its expression zzso to a patch of zzso adjacent to the zzso and the zzso zzso at the 8- to zzso zzso zzso of the first zzso cells begins at the zzso zzso zzso zzso continues through the zzso stage, by which time zzso of the zzso zzso has zzso To challenge the normal tissue interactions leading to zzso formation, we zzso the zzso neural crest cells or implanted barriers between the neural tube and the zzso Our results demonstrate that, although the presence of neural crest cells is not mandatory for zzso expression in the forming zzso a zzso signal from the zzso is required for induction and/or maintenance of the zzso zzso
