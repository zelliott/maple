The zzso leukemia zzso can selectively and zzso recruit a number of proteins including zzso to form a zzso zzso chamber named zzso In DNA damage response, zzso is recruited into zzso and modified by zzso and zzso which in turn zzso its zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells, the role of zzso in the zzso induced zzso zzso is not precisely zzso In this study, we have used the breast zzso cell line, zzso and zzso suppressed the expression of zzso zzso of zzso expression had no zzso effect on the expression of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso however, a significant decrease of zzso protein was zzso There was also an increase in the zzso complexes, which may facilitate zzso protein degradation by the zzso pathway, also in zzso treated zzso The zzso zzso activity was attenuated both in zzso and 10 zzso zzso treated zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells significantly reduced zzso downstream zzso cell cycle arrest gene zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso then zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a key regulator in the zzso activated zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso
