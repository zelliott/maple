The zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso that has been implicated in zzso a variety of biological zzso Studies show that high zzso activity in breast zzso is associated with a poor zzso as well as hormone and chemotherapy zzso Additionally, high zzso activity is associated with other features of poor zzso Thus, a zzso agent directed specifically toward tumors with high zzso activity could prove extremely potent in treating those breast tumors with the most aggressive zzso Several studies have demonstrated that zzso which zzso zzso target of zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso zzso certain resistant cancer cells to zzso zzso This study evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso breast zzso characterized by high zzso zzso We found that zzso breast cancer cell lines expressing a zzso active zzso are able to zzso under reduced zzso conditions and are resistant to the growth zzso effects of zzso both in zzso as well as in zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso or the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso inhibited zzso activity and restored sensitivity to zzso suggesting that zzso tamoxifen resistance is zzso in part by signaling through the zzso zzso Although the mechanism underlying the zzso remains to be zzso the results were associated with zzso ability to block zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso zzso as assessed by reporter gene zzso with zzso element zzso These data corroborate prior findings indicating that zzso zzso zzso resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer zzso zzso these data indicate a novel mechanism for tamoxifen resistance and suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso effectively restores the zzso of these cells to zzso These data may have implication for future clinical studies of zzso zzso in breast zzso
