zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is observed in numerous zzso and is particularly important in colon zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso can significantly increase the signaling activity of zzso in cells with inherent zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in colon cancer cells caused a marked zzso of zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso caused up to zzso induction from the zzso promoter, and this was dependent on the presence of stabilized zzso This induction was completely blocked by the expression of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso complex formation is required for zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso an important biological zzso target zzso is regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso only in its active zzso zzso Both cell zzso studies and zzso zzso indicate that zzso of zzso results in increased zzso and nuclear expression of zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso region of zzso which prevents its nuclear zzso also caused an appreciable decrease in nuclear zzso of zzso and effectively abolished its zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of zzso zzso regulation zzso zzso of zzso zzso the signaling activity of zzso zzso by promoting its zzso in the nucleus, and zzso with zzso to augment zzso gene zzso
