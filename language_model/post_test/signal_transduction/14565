The zzso zzso zzso clone zzso that encodes a putative zzso protein zzso was identified by restriction zzso differential zzso chain reaction zzso comparing zzso populations derived from zzso of primary leaves stressed with zzso for 48 h with zzso The full-length sequence codes for a protein with zzso zzso acids which includes characteristic zzso of zzso motif zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso two zzso zzso a zzso region, and a zzso zzso domain at the zzso zzso The expression of zzso is induced during exposure to different heavy metals and its transcript accumulates during leaf zzso zzso of the calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso In zzso zzso of zzso was zzso with zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso domain, the zzso of zzso could be confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with neutral zzso zzso zzso at zzso acids localized at the zzso zzso The involvement of zzso during heavy metal stress and leaf zzso is zzso
