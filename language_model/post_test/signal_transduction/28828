Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the United zzso By zzso the pathways that regulate zzso function, we can better understand the zzso of cardiac zzso Many zzso signaling pathways activate protein zzso zzso However, the role of specific protein zzso zzso zzso in these pathways is zzso 

Here, we show that mice with zzso deletion of zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly develop a compensated zzso zzso without an intervening zzso phase, with signs of cardiac dysfunction appearing by the second zzso zzso zzso primary zzso are defective in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in response to a variety of soluble zzso and pressure overload but show zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Treatment of primary zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that both abnormal zzso and zzso activities contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Our results identify zzso as the first zzso with a critical role in adult cardiac function, indicate that in the absence of zzso cardiac zzso does not occur in response to pressure overload, and demonstrate that the zzso role of zzso is zzso via control of both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
