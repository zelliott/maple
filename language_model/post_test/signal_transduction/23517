zzso zzso modification of cell signaling molecules has emerged as a critical mechanism by which cells respond to zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso is critical for zzso zzso in T cells, the regulation of its zzso is zzso We show that zzso which was previously reported to be important in regulating type I zzso signaling in innate zzso regulates T cell zzso and T helper 17 zzso cell differentiation by zzso the zzso zzso zzso T cells are defective in zzso differentiation and zzso mice are resistant to experimental zzso zzso zzso In response to T cell zzso engagement, zzso T cells exhibit zzso of zzso and zzso and produce increased levels of zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with and zzso the zzso complex, thereby restricting expression of zzso Our findings thus demonstrate a previously zzso negative regulation of zzso activity during zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be targeted to treat zzso zzso
