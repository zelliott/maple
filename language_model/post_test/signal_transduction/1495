The zzso zzso of zzso relies largely on the zzso synthesis of an array of potent zzso peptides by the fat zzso The zzso against zzso bacteria and natural zzso infections is zzso by the Toll zzso pathway, whereas zzso against zzso bacteria is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in either zzso reduce the resistance to corresponding zzso The link between microbial infections and zzso of these two pathways has remained zzso The Toll zzso is activated by zzso bacteria through a circulating zzso recognition protein zzso zzso appear to be highly zzso from insects to zzso and the zzso zzso contains 13 zzso Here we report a zzso in a gene coding for a putative zzso zzso zzso which reduces survival to zzso zzso but has no effect on the response to zzso bacteria or natural zzso zzso By genetic zzso we demonstrate that zzso acts upstream of the zzso zzso The data on zzso with respect to the response to zzso infections, together with the present report, indicate that the zzso family has a principal role in sensing microbial infections in zzso
