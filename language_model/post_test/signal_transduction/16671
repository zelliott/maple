We developed a machine learning system for determining gene functions from zzso sources of data sets using a zzso zzso zzso Network zzso The knowledge of gene functions is crucial for understanding many fundamental biological mechanisms such as regulatory zzso cell cycles and zzso Our major goal is to accurately zzso functions of putative genes or zzso zzso Reading zzso from existing databases using zzso zzso However, this task is zzso difficult since the underlying biological processes represent complex interactions of multiple zzso Therefore many functional links would be missing when only one or two source of data is used in the zzso Our hypothesis is that zzso evidence from multiple and complementary sources could significantly improve the prediction zzso In this paper, our experimental results not only suggest that the above hypothesis is zzso but also provide guidelines for using the zzso system for data collection, training and zzso The combined training data sets contain information from gene zzso gene expressions, zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso from public zzso The current system is trained and tested on the genes of budding zzso zzso zzso Our zzso model can also be used to analyze the contribution of each source of information toward the prediction performance through the weight training zzso The contribution analysis could potentially lead to significant scientific discovery by zzso the interpretation and understanding of the complex relationships between biological zzso
