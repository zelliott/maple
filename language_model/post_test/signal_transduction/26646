Memory zzso T cells must provide robust protection for an zzso while still maintaining zzso zzso reveal a memory zzso regulatory pathway, by which signaling through the zzso can lead to zzso tolerance zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso in zzso memory zzso T cells induced by the bacterial zzso zzso zzso B zzso Exposure to zzso results in impaired zzso signaling due to failed zzso complex zzso Further, signal zzso through the zzso remains similarly blocked when zzso memory cells are subsequently exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or genetic elimination of zzso zzso reverses memory cell zzso resulting in zzso cell zzso The mechanism underlying impaired zzso signaling and subsequent memory cell zzso must involve a zzso signaling zzso given that the suppression of zzso activity restores zzso complex formation and zzso zzso zzso
