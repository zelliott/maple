zzso of smooth muscle occurs through zzso of zzso light chain zzso zzso leading to an increase in the zzso activity zzso zzso is inhibited through zzso of its regulatory zzso zzso following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso delta or zzso Here, we explore the zzso between these two modes of zzso zzso in a smooth muscle of a natural zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso force which was relaxed by zzso or zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to induce zzso force, but were rescued by zzso zzso and were sensitive to zzso zzso In the presence, but not absence, of zzso zzso also significantly increased zzso There was no affect on zzso zzso at zzso however, zzso zzso increased in response to zzso zzso Together, these data suggest a role for zzso upstream of zzso zzso possibly through zzso of another zzso family member targeted by zzso
