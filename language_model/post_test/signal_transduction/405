zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso a zzso zzso plays a vital role in cell migration and zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso growth zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso leading to recruitment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Assembly of this signaling complex is required for optimal stimulation of both zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso The main aim of the present study was to identify novel proteins that zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso in response to zzso stimulation and define the role of these interactions in zzso specific biological zzso We performed a functional zzso screening to identify zzso binding partners using combination of zzso display and the tandem affinity zzso zzso zzso identified a number of proteins not previously known to interact with zzso zzso These novel zzso binding partners represent several functional categories including heat shock zzso protein zzso and zzso and proteins that regulate zzso or zzso In zzso and in zzso studies suggested that most of the proteins bound to zzso via binding to one of the four zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that directly bound to zzso Although the binding of most of these proteins to zzso was positively regulated by zzso a few were zzso zzso suggesting differential regulation of protein complexes assembled on zzso in response to zzso Further studies showed that zzso of zzso significantly impaired zzso zzso signal zzso and subsequent biological functions including cell survival, protein zzso protein zzso and prevention of zzso The results emphasize the importance of formation of zzso signaling complex induced by zzso and provide novel insights into our knowledge of the role of this molecular scaffold in regulation of zzso signal zzso and biological zzso
