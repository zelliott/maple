zzso is an zzso pattern recognition zzso that assembles with zzso protein zzso zzso in response to the presence of bacterial zzso zzso zzso in the host cell zzso thereby inducing signals leading to the production of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso signaling has been associated with various inflammatory disorders suggesting that zzso zzso of this signaling complex may have therapeutic zzso To identify zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, we zzso a zzso screening approach and identified a zzso zzso compound designated zzso that selectively inhibited an zzso zzso zzso response without directly zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso failed to inhibit zzso production in response to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and closely related zzso all of which share common downstream components with the zzso signaling zzso While the zzso blocked zzso zzso responses, they failed to block signaling induced by zzso zzso or single stranded zzso suggesting specificity for the zzso signaling complex and zzso differences in zzso zzso Investigation of zzso relationship allowed the identification of more potent zzso that maintained zzso zzso The largest boost in activity was achieved by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso signaling zzso is amenable to zzso by small molecules that do not target zzso zzso zzso The compounds we identified should prove useful tools to investigate the importance of zzso in various inflammatory processes and may have potential clinical zzso
