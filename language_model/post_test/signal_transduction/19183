zzso development proceeds with a cascade of intricate zzso events that operate in a zzso fashion to specify cardiac cell fate during early zzso In fact, conflicting reports exist regarding the role of zzso zzso during zzso Here, we describe a zzso and zzso effect of zzso zzso on in zzso zzso using embryonic stem cells zzso as a model zzso We could demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso during early stage of differentiation either through zzso or by zzso zzso helped in maintaining zzso and zzso expressions, and in zzso it promoted zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, it led to zzso in zzso that was reversed by moderate concentration of zzso but not soluble zzso However, higher zzso could also block zzso suggesting thereby governance of a particular zzso threshold underlying this zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso at early stage modulated zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso synchronized with zzso and zzso zzso at early stage, correlated well with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso and zzso zzso at late stage culminating in zzso zzso Our findings suggested the existence of precise regulatory machinery with zzso role of zzso for fine tuning zzso induction and its zzso through establishment of zzso zzso during zzso zzso Moreover, contrary to mere zzso a specific threshold of zzso and zzso and their zzso seemed necessary for providing the guiding cues in orchestrating zzso induction and subsequent zzso
