We have shown previously that the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 3 and zzso proteins zzso the zzso zzso promoter in zzso cells via a hormone response element that binds the nuclear zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso In the present study, we show that zzso and zzso but not zzso physically interact with zzso via their Mad zzso 1 zzso both in zzso and in zzso The synergistic zzso of target promoters by zzso and zzso was shown to depend on the specific promoter context and did not require an intact zzso binding domain of the zzso Using zzso zzso interaction zzso we established that two regions of zzso the zzso zzso function 1 zzso domain zzso zzso and the zzso F domain zzso zzso can mediate physical zzso interactions in zzso In zzso zzso and zzso proteins enhanced the zzso function of various zzso fusion proteins via the zzso and the adjacent DNA binding domain, whereas a single zzso to zzso substitution in zzso abolished zzso by zzso The findings suggest that the zzso cross talk between the zzso zzso and zzso is zzso by specific functional zzso in the two types of zzso zzso Furthermore, the specificity of this interaction for certain target promoters may play an important role in various zzso functions, which are regulated by zzso and the zzso
