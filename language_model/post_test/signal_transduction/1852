Root hairs provide a model system for the study of cell zzso We examined the possibility that one or more members of the distinct plant zzso of zzso zzso zzso termed zzso may function as molecular switches regulating root hair zzso zzso zzso are known to control polar growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a strong root hair zzso whereas zzso zzso appeared to inhibit root hair tip zzso zzso zzso from other zzso zzso of zzso did not give a root hair zzso We confirmed that zzso was expressed throughout hair zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso zzso zzso led to additional and misplaced hairs on the cell surface as well as longer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso root hair tip growth, whereas zzso zzso resulted in hairs with multiple zzso zzso negative zzso zzso reduced the number of zzso sites and led to shorter and zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso localized to the future site of hair formation well before swelling formation and to the tip throughout hair zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso acts as a positive regulatory switch in the earliest visible stage in hair development, swelling formation, and in tip zzso
