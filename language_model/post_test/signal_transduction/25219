All members of the low density zzso zzso zzso family contain at least one copy of the zzso sequence within their zzso zzso For the LDL zzso it has been demonstrated that the zzso motif serves as a signal for rapid zzso through coated zzso Thus, it is generally believed that the zzso sequences function as zzso signals for all the LDL zzso family zzso The primary aim of this study is to define the zzso zzso within the zzso tail of LDL zzso protein zzso By using zzso zzso which mimic the function and trafficking of full-length zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso but not the two zzso zzso serves as the dominant signal for zzso zzso We also found that the zzso zzso motif within the zzso tail contributes to its zzso and its function is independent of the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso motif and the zzso zzso motif each play a limited role in zzso zzso in the context of the full-length tail, these motifs were functional within the truncated zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso accumulate at the cell surface and are less efficient in delivery of zzso for zzso
