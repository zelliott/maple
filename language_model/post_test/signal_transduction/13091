The purpose of this work was to study whether exercise training zzso changes in the zzso profile of rat zzso and nervous system and in the in zzso intrinsic responsiveness of these zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The exercise program performed successfully produced the characteristic zzso zzso of the trained zzso Exercise training induced a large and significant increase in the levels of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, a decrease of zzso zzso and cholesterol levels was evoked by exercise zzso zzso increased zzso content only in sedentary zzso An zzso increase in zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso content was increased by zzso more noticeably in sedentary rats than in trained zzso In contrast, cerebral zzso was observed to be largely insensitive to both exercise training and zzso zzso It was concluded that exercise training zzso zzso changes in both vascular and zzso zzso profiles, the former being much more pronounced than the latter, and zzso diminishes the zzso and zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso
