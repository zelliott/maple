Using an in zzso zzso technique of isolated left rat adrenal zzso it has been demonstrated that zzso zzso increases DNA synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the effect of zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso C zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso evoked a partial reversal of zzso effect, and when added together to the zzso medium abolished zzso In contrast, the zzso C inhibitor zzso alone was able to induce a complete blockade of zzso zzso Neither the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso nor the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso affected zzso stimulation of DNA zzso thereby making unlikely the involvement of the zzso acid signaling zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso stimulates rat zzso cell proliferation acting via zzso receptors coupled with zzso C, which activates both zzso and zzso signaling zzso and zzso the zzso effect of zzso is partially zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
