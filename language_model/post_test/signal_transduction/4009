zzso channels are thought to participate in signal zzso and zzso regulation in higher plant zzso The regulation of zzso cell zzso is a situation in which these channels could play important roles because it involves zzso zzso that are implicated in zzso control and orchestrated by various zzso We have used a pharmacological approach to reveal the contribution of zzso channels in the regulation of the development of zzso by zzso zzso induce an zzso of zzso a disintegration of the cortical cell zzso and the formation of zzso roots on zzso zzso zzso grown in the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso which produce little or no stimulation of zzso zzso by themselves, are able to counteract the zzso and the disintegration induced by zzso with various zzso This interference appears to be specific for zzso and does not occur when zzso zzso is inhibited by other growth regulators such as zzso or zzso The putative involvement of zzso channels in zzso signal zzso is zzso
