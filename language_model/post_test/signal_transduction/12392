The brain is a specialized immune site representing a unique tumor zzso The availability of fresh brain tumor material for ex zzso analysis is often limited because large parts of many brain tumors are zzso using zzso zzso We analyzed zzso tumor zzso as a zzso to study immune zzso mechanisms in 83 human brain zzso zzso infiltrates in brain tumor zzso and zzso zzso were comparable with respect to zzso content and zzso zzso zzso zzso we detected massive zzso of zzso zzso regulatory T cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso 29) and zzso brain tumors zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso was observed in benign tumors such as zzso zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant zzso increase in blood was seen only in patients with zzso brain zzso zzso in high-grade tumors exhibited an activated zzso as indicated by decreased proliferation and elevated zzso and zzso expression relative to blood zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso efficiently suppressed zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso were localized in close proximity to zzso T cells, as zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso brain tumors expressed programmed death zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso was expressed on zzso zzso cells present in zzso of zzso In conclusion, using zzso tumor zzso as a zzso we identified zzso and the zzso zzso as immune zzso mechanisms in zzso but not benign human brain zzso
