The zzso zzso factor zzso multiple genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso effect of this protein on cell survival by blocking the repression of zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso decreases zzso zzso and increases zzso repression of zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso does not inhibit cell survival as effectively as in zzso expressing zzso Thus the zzso of gene control by zzso is in part responsible for the therapeutic effects of zzso
