The zzso and zzso domain zzso are signal zzso zzso found in all zzso of zzso The zzso zzso which contains both zzso zzso rapid zzso responses to oxygen zzso and other electron zzso guiding zzso coli to niches where it can generate optimal cellular zzso We used zzso zzso to investigate the signal zzso zzso from the zzso zzso domain to the zzso zzso These studies showed that the zzso domain of one zzso in the zzso zzso stabilized zzso binding to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso In contrast, the signal zzso zzso was zzso involving the zzso and zzso zzso from the same zzso The minimal requirements for zzso were investigated in zzso containing a full-length and truncated zzso Either the zzso or zzso zzso could be deleted from the zzso zzso of the zzso but removing 16 zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso abolished zzso Although both zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso was not disrupted by zzso zzso in the zzso domain from the zzso zzso zzso models for zzso signal zzso are zzso
