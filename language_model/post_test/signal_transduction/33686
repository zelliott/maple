During zzso eye development, cell differentiation is preceded by the formation of a zzso zzso which zzso across the zzso from zzso to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and shortened along their zzso zzso However, how these cell shape changes and, thus, the progression of the zzso zzso are controlled is not well zzso Here we show that cells simultaneously lacking zzso and zzso signal zzso fail to shorten and do not enter the zzso zzso Moreover, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in cells of the leading flank of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso or zzso signal zzso zzso results in elevated zzso zzso zzso simultaneous loss of both zzso and zzso signal zzso leads to decreased zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression of zzso in either zzso zzso discs or wing zzso discs results in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso signaling promote the zzso of cells within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression might be one mechanism through which zzso and zzso promote these cell shape zzso
