It has been established that zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso produced by zzso in response to zzso zzso or its zzso The mechanism by which zzso exerts this zzso effect is still zzso Recent findings indicate that zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins are induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in turn they can zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso Because it is known that zzso are induced by zzso and that zzso zzso and its zzso most likely interact via zzso or the zzso zzso and/or zzso we hypothesized that zzso are induced by zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso and that zzso may mediate the zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso We report here that mouse zzso zzso incubated with zzso and added zzso zzso zzso zzso live, or zzso or zzso outer surface protein A zzso zzso their zzso zzso and protein zzso with zzso being more zzso zzso a synthetic zzso also induced zzso expression under these conditions, but zzso zzso was zzso Neither zzso zzso nor the translation inhibitor zzso blocked zzso induction by zzso zzso and its zzso indicating that the expression of other genes is not zzso This temporally correlated with the zzso zzso of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso Our data are evidence to suggest that expression of zzso is part of the mechanism of zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso by zzso zzso and its zzso
