A B zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso is crucial for B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to various signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso through its well defined zzso Although functional significance of such interactions has been zzso zzso signal zzso mechanism is not fully zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have identified a novel protein that binds to a zzso zzso domain of zzso which we named zzso zzso N zzso associated protein zzso From its deduced zzso acid zzso zzso is presumed to contain four zzso zzso which are included in a central zzso domain, and to zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso as well as zzso and zzso from a zzso of mouse B cell zzso In the zzso cells, the zzso zzso was localized in a zzso structure in the zzso resembling that of zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in a manner dependent on its zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso is expressed zzso except for plasma zzso In chicken B cell line zzso zzso of zzso resulted in an enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso in a manner dependent on the dose of zzso Thus zzso may serve as a scaffold for signaling proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso and nuclear membrane and may facilitate zzso zzso by signaling from zzso zzso
