The mechanisms underlying early zzso graft failure are not entirely clear, but are thought to involve zzso injury due to delayed zzso We zzso that blood vessels play an active role in zzso communications supporting zzso survival and zzso To test this hypothesis and to zzso zzso cell zzso signaling stimuli from their nutritional and gas exchange functions, we developed three zzso zzso zzso vessel networks in engineered pancreatic zzso prepared from zzso zzso and zzso The zzso setup, seeded on highly porous zzso zzso scaffolds closely mimics the natural anatomical context of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso survival zzso with formation of functional zzso zzso vessels was zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso cultures promoted zzso structure formation, which further supported zzso survival as well as insulin zzso Gene expression profiles of zzso growth factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and differentiation markers were significantly different in zzso versus zzso culture systems and were further modified upon addition of zzso zzso of zzso zzso into diabetic mice promoted survival, integration and function of the zzso engineered zzso supporting the suggested role of zzso in zzso zzso These findings present potential strategies for preparation of zzso zzso with increased survival zzso
