In the present study, we investigated the involvement of prefrontal zzso zzso in the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso in a forced swimming test in mice treated with zzso zzso zzso for 14 zzso zzso which is regarded as an animal model for negative zzso A decrease in spontaneous zzso zzso release and increase in levels of the zzso zzso zzso were observed in the prefrontal zzso zzso of zzso mice, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso II zzso were markedly activated in the zzso of zzso mice, but not zzso mice, immediately after the forced swimming zzso The zzso of the function of zzso receptors by zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso partial zzso reversed the enhancement of zzso in the forced swimming test and impairment of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a potent blocker of zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso mice also had an attenuating zzso In addition, zzso of zzso cells and a decrease of zzso cell size were observed in the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that repeated zzso treatment zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes in the zzso and that such changes cause the emotional deficits exhibited in zzso zzso
