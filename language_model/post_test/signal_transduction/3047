To investigate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso in the zzso of women with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and its role in zzso zzso and zzso and the factors affecting the zzso of the zzso zzso 

From Jan 2007 to zzso 2008, 52 patients with zzso who underwent zzso and zzso were selected as experimental group matched with 32 zzso patients as control zzso zzso hormonal zzso zzso blood zzso and insulin, body mass index zzso and zzso pathology were measured and evaluated in all zzso The zzso patients were divided into insulin resistance and zzso resistance group according to zzso model zzso resistance index zzso Meanwhile, the zzso patients were grouped as normal, zzso zzso and zzso depending on outcome of zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined by western zzso 

zzso The expression of zzso was significantly higher in zzso group zzso zzso zzso than that in control zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was significantly higher in group of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared with those in normal zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the expression of zzso was significantly higher in group of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso compared with that in zzso resistance group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between the expression level of zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was over activated in zzso with zzso which may be associated with the formation of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso resistance and obesity may be high risk factors for zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso with zzso
