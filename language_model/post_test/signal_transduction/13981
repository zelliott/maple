zzso zzso are constantly challenged by zzso oxygen species derived zzso or encountered in their zzso Such adversity is particularly applied to zzso zzso under harsh industrial zzso One of the major zzso to challenge zzso zzso is zzso acid zzso zzso This study, which used zzso zzso analysis in conjunction with deletion zzso zzso uncovered the molecular pathways of zzso zzso that were altered by an arresting concentration of zzso (75 zzso The zzso stress response, iron zzso zzso through zzso transport and direct zzso zzso were evident through the induction of the genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso machinery zzso zzso Further, we discovered that zzso the dual zzso sensor and zzso is required for protection against zzso indicated by the sensitivity of zzso to a mild dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a greater sensitivity to zzso than the loss of its zzso partner zzso zzso of either of the iron zzso regulators zzso or zzso also resulted in sensitivity to zzso These novel findings for zzso zzso and zzso point to their distinct roles in response to the zzso zzso Finally, the expression of 89 previously zzso genes was significantly altered against zzso which will contribute to their eventual zzso
