We have previously shown that zzso a member of the zzso zzso cell cycle regulatory family, has a unique function in regulating the pool of neural precursor zzso As the pool of zzso is regulated by a limiting supply of zzso factors, we asked if the zzso zzso may control the size of the zzso population by regulating the levels of growth factors or their zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso growth factor 2 zzso is zzso zzso in the brains of animals lacking zzso family proteins and that the gene zzso the zzso zzso is directly regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso occupy zzso consensus sites on the zzso promoter in the context of native zzso To evaluate the zzso consequence of zzso deregulation in both zzso and zzso zzso we measured neural zzso responsiveness to growth zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are each zzso of zzso growth factor responsiveness in neural zzso zzso These results support a model zzso zzso regulates the pool of zzso zzso by directly regulating zzso gene expression in zzso By identifying novel roles for zzso in regulating genes outside of the classical cell cycle machinery targets, we uncover a new mechanism zzso zzso mediates proliferation through regulating growth factor zzso
