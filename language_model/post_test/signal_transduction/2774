To study the role of signal zzso via zzso receptors in the production of zzso by rabbit zzso zzso 

zzso primary rabbit zzso zzso zzso were incubated for 72 hours in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso zzso Media were analyzed for zzso zzso activity using a zzso zzso zzso and for zzso and zzso protein by Western zzso zzso activity was analyzed by gelatin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was used to determine the involvement of zzso in zzso the effects of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso analysis zzso was used to examine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso peptides induced zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso B, and increased synthesis of the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso Further studies focusing on zzso demonstrated that this zzso was concentration dependent and that zzso peptides zzso with zzso in inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso production was inhibited by the zzso in a zzso manner, indicating that induction by zzso requires binding of zzso to its zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso stimulation increased the expression of beta 1 and alpha v zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that signal zzso through zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso expression and that this is likely zzso through induction of zzso They also suggest that the binding of zzso molecules to their zzso zzso receptors reduces the amount of zzso required to induce zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso may play a role in the synergistic effects seen with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso Since elevated levels of both zzso and zzso molecules are present in zzso arthritis and zzso zzso fluid, our data suggest that this interaction may be important in zzso the cartilage destruction accompanying these zzso
