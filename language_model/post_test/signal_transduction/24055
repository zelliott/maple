zzso zzso zzso is a recently recognized mechanism for zzso signal zzso that involves zzso of zzso proteins within their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar, but zzso zzso of a zzso protein occurs at a site close to, but not zzso the zzso domain of the target zzso In both zzso and zzso a soluble domain of a zzso protein is released from its membrane zzso This domain can then transmit a signal either locally or at some distance from the site of zzso In certain signaling zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso on one side of the membrane results in secondary zzso which then releases a signaling domain from the zzso Whereas zzso zzso such as zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso three families of zzso membrane zzso zzso have now been shown to carry out zzso Recent studies of events zzso by zzso and zzso indicate that they regulate key cellular signaling events including pathways involved in zzso regulation, cell fate selection, and growth zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso have important roles in certain diseases such as Alzheimer's zzso Because some of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be selectivity zzso zzso targeting these zzso are likely to alter both zzso and zzso events triggered by zzso and zzso
