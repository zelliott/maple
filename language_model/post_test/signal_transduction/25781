zzso affects many aspects of cellular development, including those essential for zzso zzso This study examined the contribution of zzso A to zzso fetal zzso development, revealing contrasting outcomes of zzso actions on zzso cells and zzso Shortly after sex determination, from zzso Day zzso zzso through to birth zzso zzso the zzso A zzso transcript zzso level rises in zzso but not zzso followed closely by the zzso transcript zzso the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso transcript levels also change, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly higher and lower, respectively, at 0 zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso the signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher at 0 zzso compared with zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso in nearly all zzso cell zzso indicated widespread transforming growth factor beta zzso and/or zzso zzso signaling zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice have significantly smaller zzso at birth, attributable to a 50% lower zzso cell number and decreased zzso cell proliferation from zzso zzso zzso contained twice the normal zzso number at birth, with some appearing to bypass zzso zzso of widespread zzso in zzso cells indicates other zzso zzso zzso are active in fetal zzso zzso differences in zzso and cell cycle regulator transcript levels zzso to zzso gene dosage zzso to differences in zzso and germ cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified previously in fetal zzso was lower at zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was lower at birth, and zzso zzso zzso and protein were lower at zzso and 0 zzso Thus, zzso A dosage contributes to establishing the balance between zzso and germ cell number that is ultimately required for adult male zzso
