The B zzso of zzso zzso a protein which binds specifically to cell surface zzso zzso has been shown to have a zzso effect on DNA synthesis in Swiss zzso zzso The B zzso induced cellular proliferation of zzso and zzso cells while it inhibited the growth of the same cells when they were sparse and rapidly zzso The amount of cell surface zzso increased when the cells reached zzso To examine the hypothesis that the variation in levels of zzso was responsible for the zzso effect, we increased zzso levels in rapidly dividing cells by zzso of zzso zzso or by treatment of the cells with zzso to convert zzso to zzso Even after the level of zzso was increased to levels similar to those found in zzso cells, the B zzso still zzso rather than zzso their zzso zzso this result indicates that the zzso response to the B zzso is not solely a function of the concentration of cell surface zzso rather it is the growth stage that determines the fate of the signal zzso by the interaction of the B zzso and zzso zzso
