zzso zzso zzso in lens zzso cells plays an important role in cataract formation, and its prevention may be of therapeutic zzso This study was performed to investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of zzso on zzso zzso in human lens zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso before zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso suppresses zzso zzso cell zzso via interference with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might have a potential effect against cataract zzso
