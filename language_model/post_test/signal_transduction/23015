By taking advantage of the zzso zzso model, we recently confirmed the in zzso enhancing effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso activity when induced by insulin zzso We now investigated some zzso aspects of its zzso role upon the hormonal regulation of this zzso zzso The action of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measurable at early steps in the zzso zzso zzso the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly decreased in the presence of the zzso plus 50 zzso zzso (to about zzso of control vs zzso with zzso zzso The injection of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, led to a drastic reduction in zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso zzso failed to increase the activity of type 2 protein zzso whether zzso was present or zzso However, a specific inhibitor of type 1 zzso when zzso blocked both the hormonal effect on zzso and its zzso by zzso The salient feature of this study was that there was almost no zzso of zzso zzso in zzso less than zzso was found in the zzso of cells which had been exposed to zzso at a therapeutic dose (10 zzso for up to 16 zzso Moreover, a lack of zzso zzso zzso after a zzso incubation nevertheless correlated with its sustained action on zzso zzso zzso From these results, it could be zzso that the major site of zzso action may reside within some membrane components of a signaling complex most likely linked to the zzso but in any case located upstream of the branching of reactions which tightly control zzso zzso
