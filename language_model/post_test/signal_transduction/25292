The zzso proteins are a family of zzso regulatory molecules expressed in all zzso zzso A striking feature of the zzso proteins is their ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso This plethora of interacting proteins allows zzso to play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory zzso such as zzso signal zzso zzso cell death, and cell cycle zzso In this review, we examine the structural basis for zzso zzso proposed functions of zzso in various signaling zzso and emerging views of mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso
