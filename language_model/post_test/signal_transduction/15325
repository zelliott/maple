zzso zzso signaling is implicated in controlling smooth muscle cell proliferation and in maintaining smooth muscle cells in an zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso hypertension is characterized by excessive vascular resistance, smooth muscle cell proliferation in small pulmonary zzso leading to zzso of pulmonary vascular resistance, right zzso failure and zzso Here we show that human pulmonary hypertension is characterized by zzso of zzso in small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and that the severity of disease in humans and zzso zzso with the amount of zzso protein in the zzso We further show that mice with zzso deletion of zzso do not develop pulmonary hypertension in response to hypoxic stimulation and that pulmonary hypertension can be successfully treated in mice by administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor that blocks zzso of zzso in smooth muscle zzso We show a zzso link from zzso zzso signaling through the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein to smooth muscle cell proliferation and a shift to an zzso smooth muscle cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is crucial for the development of pulmonary zzso hypertension and provide a target zzso for therapeutic zzso
