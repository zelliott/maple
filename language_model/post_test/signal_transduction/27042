The type I zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso a signal resulting in promoter zzso in T zzso This signal zzso is dependent on the zzso domain, which consists of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the type I zzso the type II zzso has a small zzso tail, and it is not clear whether this zzso is a zzso or a regulatory zzso Here we report that the type II zzso does not mediate gene zzso in zzso zzso However, a hybrid zzso composed of the zzso and zzso regions of the human type II zzso fused to the zzso domain of the human type I zzso was capable of zzso a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene zzso identical to that zzso by the type I zzso Our results indicated that the zzso domain of the type II zzso was capable of functionally interacting with zzso and zzso the resulting signal to a zzso zzso zzso
