Most agents that damage DNA act through zzso modifications of zzso and activate its downstream zzso However, whether cellular responses to zzso zzso DNA damage also operate through zzso zzso modification has not been zzso In this study, the relationship between zzso zzso and its zzso modifications was investigated in the human cancer cell lines zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications through zzso of an zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathway, and zzso association of replication protein A with zzso is required for the binding of zzso to zzso Upon treatment with zzso zzso zzso is clearly associated with zzso zzso at zzso but not at zzso zzso or zzso This specific zzso zzso at zzso in turn results in zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso through zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso These zzso zzso modifications are directly responsible for zzso induced zzso expression because the binding activity of zzso zzso at zzso to the zzso promoter, as well as zzso expression itself are significantly increased after zzso zzso It is of interest that zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso mutually interact in the zzso induced zzso expression shown by zzso of artificially zzso zzso expression zzso including zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso These data taken together show for the first time that zzso activates the zzso signaling pathway, which elicits a specific zzso zzso cascade to induce zzso zzso
