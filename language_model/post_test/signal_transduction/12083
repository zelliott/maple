In zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso production activates a 46 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso also regulates the production of zzso However, the mechanism for the regulation of zzso production by zzso in zzso zzso remains to be zzso In this study, four zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were isolated and characterized in zzso zzso zzso treatment induced a zzso response zzso I and phase zzso in the expression of zzso and the activity of zzso zzso Phase II induced by zzso was blocked by zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso but phase I was not affected by these zzso or zzso Treatment with zzso alone also only induced phase II, and the induction was arrested by the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was partially zzso Using zzso corresponding to the sequences of internal zzso zzso the zzso gene was zzso Analysis of the zzso peptides and the zzso sequence indicate it is the known zzso zzso with zzso and zzso led to a significant increase in the activity of zzso although zzso treatment only induced a slight increase in the expression of zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of phase II in zzso zzso but not in phase zzso The results suggest that there is a positive feedback loop involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
