Treatment with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso is a commonly used model to induce zzso zzso Following zzso treatment zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso where zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is triggered by inflammatory stimuli and has been linked to the zzso regulation of zzso We evaluated whether pharmacological blockade of zzso by the specific inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we hypothesized that the tolerance to the zzso effect occurring after repeated zzso treatment is paralleled by a blunted zzso zzso in the zzso zzso treated with a subcutaneous injection of zzso (10 zzso showed an attenuated zzso zzso response relative to control rats receiving only zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso blockade attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso drop in energy zzso While single zzso treatment increased zzso zzso in the zzso rats treated repeatedly with zzso showed no zzso response and also no zzso zzso in the ARC after the second and third zzso injections, zzso zzso zzso signaling in the ARC might be part of the zzso zzso translating zzso stimuli into suppression of food zzso The current findings substantiate a role of zzso dependent NO formation in zzso zzso
