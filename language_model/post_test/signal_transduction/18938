zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that directly binds and targets for degradation a number of zzso zzso factors, including zzso and zzso to zzso light zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a protein structurally related to zzso also acts to repress zzso under various light zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso and reduced zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, we show that both zzso and zzso are each dependent on the presence of the other for their repressive effect on light zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that both the central zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso are necessary, and together these two zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso domain of zzso contributes to its full activity and promotes zzso of the zzso zzso Together, our results substantiate the notion that zzso and zzso act in concert to form a functional zzso zzso zzso complex and provide a molecular basis for understanding the zzso relationship of zzso
