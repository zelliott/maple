zzso is a differentiation zzso expressed by zzso zzso and neural cells which is linked to the membrane via a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells the zzso serves as a zzso for zzso and triggering with zzso specific zzso can activate zzso cell zzso in these zzso We report here that the zzso is specific for zzso and not seen with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso can block the zzso We studied zzso associated molecules that might be involved in signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced a rapid zzso of several cellular proteins in zzso cells which correlated with an elevated activity of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso Several zzso proteins were zzso with zzso zzso allowed the detection of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso as a zzso of the zzso zzso resistant zzso It is suggested that the zzso zzso are involved in the zzso of cell zzso
