zzso acid zzso previously as zzso was isolated from a marine brown zzso zzso zzso and has been found to possess a novel nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth promoting activity in zzso zzso In this study, we explored the zzso effects of zzso in terms of its survival zzso zzso and zzso activities under zzso deficient or deprived zzso zzso zzso did not only promote the zzso survival support on zzso zzso cells, but also significantly abated zzso zzso cell death even in the absence of zzso The pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso significantly suppressed the survival supporting activity of zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso A or zzso inhibitor zzso showed no zzso effect on zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso supports survival of zzso zzso cells in an zzso manner, and that zzso may be required for the zzso activity of zzso In addition, we have shown that zzso markedly enhanced zzso and protected zzso cells from hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso These pharmacological features suggest that zzso may be a potentially important zzso zzso
