The zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is active in different zzso and is involved in diverse processes such as patterning of the embryonic zzso growth and differentiation of zzso discs and cell zzso During zzso the zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso cells that surround individual zzso cell zzso In response to zzso signals, the zzso cells differentiate in a complex pattern, which in turn leads to the establishment of the egg zzso Two recent reports have shown that the strategies used to pattern zzso zzso cells are different from those used to pattern zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso activity is translated into an zzso response, zzso in zzso zzso cells, patterning mechanisms are initiated and refined by feedback that zzso zzso activity over zzso
