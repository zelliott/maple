A mechanism for cell shape control of zzso signal zzso zzso the average concentration of activated proteins in the zzso increases as the height of the cell zzso has been described zzso An important modification of this analysis is zzso recognizing that signaling proteins are not only activated at the plasma membrane but must first form complexes with signaling molecules that reside there, such as receptors and zzso With these more realistic boundary conditions, it is shown that the region of zzso space where cell shape zzso the average zzso activity is greatly zzso Moreover, this model allows for amplification of the activated protein bound at the zzso which is considered more relevant for certain, zzso driven signaling processes in cell zzso
