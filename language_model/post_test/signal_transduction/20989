zzso suppresses drug-induced zzso in zzso although in many cases, this results only in a delayed onset of cell zzso In zzso survival signals from the zzso environment may also contribute to drug resistance and may act with zzso to promote long-term cell zzso zzso of zzso on zzso in zzso centers zzso can suppress zzso induced by calcium zzso or zzso in zzso We asked whether a combination of zzso expression and the provision of a culture environment that zzso that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso could increase the ability of B zzso cells to resist drug-induced zzso A zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso with either human zzso zzso or control zzso zzso was used to examine the effects of zzso zzso on the cellular response and long-term survival after treatment with the zzso drug zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso and zzso Administration of 20 zzso zzso completely prevented cell zzso This was associated with an increase in zzso protein levels within 24 zzso without an zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of cell cycle distribution and of zzso B expression demonstrated that both cell lines arrested at zzso where they zzso Fifty % of zzso cells died within 2 days, whereas 50% cell death was not observed in the zzso cultures until 6 days had zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso elevated zzso protein levels by 3 h and also provided a delay in zzso zzso zzso h after the addition of 20 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells were zzso whereas zzso of zzso on zzso cells reduced the proportion of zzso cells to zzso zzso of zzso (in zzso zzso reduced zzso to zzso However, when the zzso cells were treated with zzso together with zzso of zzso zzso was reduced further to only zzso at 96 zzso The zzso delay in the execution of zzso zzso did not translate significantly to increased zzso In contrast, the provision of zzso cells with an ability to interact with the zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased zzso survival, and this was improved in zzso cells exposed to these zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso of drug-induced zzso can be modulated by zzso as well as by zzso vascular cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter possibly involving the function of zzso That these factors appear to act together to enhance zzso potential after DNA damage has important implications regarding the development of drug resistance in zzso zzso and future strategies for improved zzso
