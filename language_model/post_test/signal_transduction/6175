The zzso zzso zzso zzso a narrow compartment in the zzso zzso that bisects the zzso zzso expresses the zzso factor sonic zzso zzso Because genetic disruption of zzso in mouse causes severe early zzso zzso this strategy has not been useful in identifying a zzso role for this zzso To zzso zzso signaling in a zzso restricted manner, we carried out zzso and zzso experiments in chick zzso using in zzso zzso and found that zzso signaling is required for zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso the major zzso brain areas zzso the zzso We further show that differential competence of zzso and zzso zzso in responding to zzso signaling is regulated by the zzso factor zzso We show that, through the release of zzso the zzso functions as a local signaling center that regulates the acquisition of identity for these important zzso zzso
