One half million patients suffer from zzso cancer in zzso nations, yet this disease exhibits a low zzso in zzso zzso This geographic imbalance suggests an environmental contribution to the resistance of endemic populations to zzso zzso A common zzso characteristic of these colon zzso regions is the prevalence of zzso bacteria associated with zzso zzso Here, a bacterial zzso zzso was demonstrated to suppress colon cancer cell proliferation by a zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso suppressed proliferation by increasing zzso zzso an effect zzso by the zzso analog zzso The zzso effects of the zzso and zzso were reversed by zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso as well as by removal of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso In fact, both the zzso and zzso induced an zzso zzso promoting zzso influx and zzso of DNA synthesis in colon cancer zzso zzso of this previously zzso zzso signaling zzso by bacterial zzso could contribute to the resistance of endemic populations to zzso zzso and offers a paradigm for targeted prevention and therapy of primary and zzso zzso zzso
