Water extraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fiber zzso yielded a mixture of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso that were separated by zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies and fast atom zzso zzso experiments indicated that the two zzso have a common primary structure, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso as terminal reducing end, and a zzso acid at the zzso zzso However, the two zzso differ by an zzso group located at the zzso position of the internal zzso acid zzso These two zzso induce the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso within zzso
