zzso of T cell immunity by zzso has been suggested from recent zzso However, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the involved cells and zzso basis, are not well zzso In this study, the direct zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso and its function in T cell stimulation by zzso interaction and the involved signaling pathways were zzso We show that zzso from zzso mice and normal zzso treated with zzso zzso have zzso zzso characterized with increased zzso and decreased zzso production in response to zzso zzso lowered surface expression of zzso class II, zzso and consequently have reduced capacity to stimulate zzso T zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso DC zzso and its function in zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso mediates the zzso of zzso production and protein zzso A activity and is involved in zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acts directly on zzso expressed on zzso resulting in the cell zzso and subsequently enhances its capacity for zzso T cell zzso It also suggests that zzso signaling induced by zzso of zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso of zzso zzso following zzso stimulation may contribute to zzso of DC zzso
