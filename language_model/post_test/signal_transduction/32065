zzso zzso therapy remains important in improving the prognosis of patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso However, some patients do not achieve an effective response with zzso treatment, creating an obstacle to the zzso of zzso Identification of the underlying mechanisms responsible for steroid resistance can be zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso zzso our interest because of its zzso relationship with zzso In the present study, we investigated for the first time whether zzso correlated with steroid resistance in zzso and explored potential mechanisms of zzso 

zzso patients with zzso (40 steroid sensitive and 22 steroid zzso and 21 normal controls were zzso zzso levels of zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were determined by western zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso was assessed by zzso in nuclear zzso Gene zzso was applied to reduce expression of zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso patients were treated with zzso human zzso of different zzso 

zzso levels in serum and zzso were higher in zzso patients compared with zzso patients and zzso In contrast to the zzso group, zzso levels were significantly higher and zzso levels lower in zzso zzso After zzso gene zzso zzso levels in cells from zzso patients were zzso In zzso patients, a decrease in zzso levels and an increase in zzso expression from baseline were detected in zzso treated with a higher concentration of zzso human zzso Treatment with zzso human zzso did not regulate expression of zzso and zzso in zzso from patients treated with an zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicated that zzso may play a role in the formation of steroid resistance in zzso by affecting the zzso signaling zzso As a regulator of zzso sensitivity, zzso may be a potential target for steroid zzso
