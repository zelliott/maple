Sulphur mustard zzso is an zzso agent whose mechanism is not fully zzso To investigate the early action of zzso we examined the effect of zzso on contraction of vascular smooth zzso zzso zzso contraction was reduced by zzso but only marginally by 70 zzso zzso zzso Additional reduction was induced by zzso in zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso , contraction of arteries by zzso was reduced, which was fully recovered by addition of 2 zzso zzso zzso However, recovery was attenuated by zzso with zzso The effect of zzso on contraction by zzso was not influenced by zzso and zzso with zzso 12, zzso zzso zzso II zzso was implicated as being responsible for the action of zzso because the zzso mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle via both zzso zzso light chain zzso axis and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso axis were not related to the action of zzso zzso of zzso zzso level by zzso or zzso was attenuated by treatment of zzso on western zzso zzso may be a candidate target zzso of zzso in early stage contraction of vascular smooth zzso
