zzso inclusion body zzso zzso is a muscle disease with two separate zzso zzso zzso and zzso Typically, zzso zzso are zzso surrounded and invaded by zzso T cells and zzso Both attacked and zzso zzso express high levels of human zzso zzso class I zzso zzso a prerequisite for zzso presentation to zzso T zzso However, only a zzso of zzso zzso is attacked by immune zzso By using zzso we classified zzso from five patients with sporadic zzso as attacked zzso or zzso zzso and isolated the zzso contents of zzso separately by laser zzso For comparison, we isolated zzso from control persons zzso The samples were analyzed by zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso and zzso whereas zzso were negative for zzso In contrast, the zzso chain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso genes were zzso in zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso which positively correlated with the number of adjacent zzso T zzso Thus, the differential zzso of the zzso signaling cascade observed in the attacked fibers is related to local zzso whereas the ubiquitous zzso expression on zzso muscle fibers does not require zzso zzso
