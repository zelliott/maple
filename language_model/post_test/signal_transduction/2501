zzso development requires zzso interactions between the zzso bud and the zzso zzso Whereas survival of zzso and development of zzso from zzso cells depends on signals from the invading zzso zzso growth of the zzso bud depends on signals from the zzso This zzso makes it difficult to identify molecules expressed by the zzso bud that regulate zzso zzso To determine how the zzso bud signals the zzso we previously isolated zzso bud cell lines zzso zzso These cells zzso soluble factors which rescue the zzso from zzso We now report that four zzso binding factors mediate this growth zzso One of these is basic zzso growth factor zzso which is zzso by the zzso bud when penetrating the zzso zzso zzso three types of zzso found in the zzso precursors of zzso zzso precursors of zzso and cells that regulate growth of the zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso bud regulates the number of zzso and vascular precursors that generate zzso by zzso zzso and other soluble zzso
