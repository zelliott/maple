zzso a surface zzso of unrestricted zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso The zzso also performs as a zzso modulating zzso interactions and delivering zzso signals, despite showing a structural zzso to the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso induced signals leading to zzso of the zzso machinery of natural killer zzso cells from adults; similar signals could not be reproduced in zzso and zzso 2 zzso human zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso establishes a functional cooperation with professional signaling molecules of the zzso cell zzso The present work answers the question about the zzso exploited by zzso for signaling in zzso cells, using as a model zzso zzso lines genetically corrected for zzso zzso Our results indicate that a functional zzso zzso is a necessary and sufficient requisite for zzso to control an zzso pathway, which includes calcium zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and zzso experiments also showed a surface proximity between zzso and zzso These results were confirmed by using the zzso cell line, in which zzso and zzso zzso were obtained without genetic zzso Together, our findings show zzso to be a unique zzso zzso that cannot signal by itself but whose zzso function is rescued by functional and physical associations with a professional signaling structure that varies according to lineage and zzso This zzso is zzso in zzso zzso
