The zzso storage pathology in zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells of virtually all zzso However, it is the profound role of the neurological pathology that leads to morbidity and mortality in this disease, and has been the major challenge to developing zzso To date, zzso zzso zzso and therapeutic studies have focused predominantly on changes in the central nervous system zzso especially in the brain, and little is known about the disease pathology in the peripheral nervous system zzso This study demonstrates characteristic zzso storage pathology in zzso root zzso affecting zzso satellite cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso storage zzso were also observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso involving enteric zzso with enteric zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso mice developed progressive zzso in sensory functions, with significantly reduced response to pain stimulation that became zzso at 4-5 months of age as the disease zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso not only in the entire zzso but also the zzso likely affecting both zzso and zzso neural signal zzso This study also suggests that therapeutic development for zzso zzso may benefit from targeting the entire nervous zzso
