The zzso zzso dynamic changes during the cycle and these events are largely driven by zzso zzso However, in the presence of an zzso an additional series of changes that are not otherwise observed zzso The ability of the zzso to zzso the zzso environment is restricted to a specific time of the cycle which is termed the zzso of zzso Changes that occur within this window of zzso and immediately following zzso can be divided into three distinct zzso The first phase, regulated by zzso and zzso is characterized primarily by changes in both the zzso and zzso zzso cells in preparation for zzso zzso and zzso If the action of zzso is zzso these changes are inhibited and the zzso is maintained in a zzso zzso The second phase is in the further zzso of these steroids induced changes by embryonic zzso In the zzso infusion of zzso zzso in a manner that mimics zzso transit, results in the zzso and plaque formation in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso responds by increasing zzso and zzso modifications of zzso proteins and the zzso zzso initiate their differentiation process into a zzso zzso The final phase is associated with zzso invasion and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The most dramatic effect is on the zzso zzso which in response to embryonic zzso differentiate into zzso cells, the major cell type of the zzso zzso Thus, during the window of zzso signals from the zzso can dramatically alter the zzso and functional characteristics of the zzso zzso We suggest that these changes are critical to ensure prolonged maintenance of zzso function during gestation and facilitate zzso zzso
