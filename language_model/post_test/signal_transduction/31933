zzso receptors zzso are zzso pattern recognition receptors zzso that play a central role in host cell recognition and responses to virus infection, leading to the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso in order to establish an infection, viruses have to develop exclusively strategies to interfere with zzso zzso particularly some important zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suppress or escape zzso zzso immune zzso In this paper, we review the latest findings on the various strategies used by viruses to zzso zzso innate immune response, with special emphasis on immune evasion mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso By highlighting recent progress in these areas, we hope to convey a greater understanding of how viruses hamper zzso signaling and how to overcome viral zzso
