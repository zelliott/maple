zzso zzso is a rare zzso of unknown zzso zzso We previously reported the gene expression profile of zzso zzso was closely related to that of zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and the zzso growth factor zzso signal was one of the main growth signals in zzso zzso Here we further demonstrate the neural origin of zzso zzso using primary tumors and cell zzso The expression of neural zzso genes was confirmed in zzso zzso tumor zzso but the expression of some genes was absent in zzso zzso cell zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cell lines with zzso or zzso enhanced or restored the expression of neural zzso genes and induced a zzso zzso with positive zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acid also induced the expression of neural zzso genes in association with growth zzso which was not observed in other cell lines except a zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell zzso A zzso effect of zzso acid was also observed for zzso tumors in zzso zzso The simultaneous treatment with zzso signal zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso acid, suggesting the combination of growth signaling zzso and differentiation induction could be a potential molecular target for treating zzso zzso
