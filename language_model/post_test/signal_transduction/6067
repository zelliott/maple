zzso channels play an important role in many neurological disorders and also in prostate zzso zzso zzso a blocker of zzso sodium channels has been chiefly used as a molecular probe for the study and characterization of these zzso The regulation of gene expression in response for the exposure of zzso to zzso cells which are reported to be involved in neurodegenerative process is poorly zzso zzso the present study aims to develop a zzso of genes and map it on a few pivotal neurodegenerative pathways to speculate the effect of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have selected a subset of zzso zzso expressed zzso several of which zzso 4A zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta type, 8 zzso zzso zzso 7) zzso protein zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso 1 zzso These zzso which facilitate some of the neurodegenerative zzso such as zzso zzso inflammation and zzso were identified to be zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso Thus, the selected genes were further examined on zzso zzso inflammatory responses zzso as ample evidence for the role of zzso zzso inflammation in the neurodegenerative process are zzso In zzso our result provides a basic understanding of the zzso expressed genes along with one of the possible zzso which may have been modulated by the exposure of zzso
