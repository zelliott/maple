zzso zzso is zzso during embryonic development as serially repeated units termed zzso that give rise to zzso ribs, skeletal muscle and zzso Many theoretical models including the zzso and zzso model have been zzso There is compelling genetic evidence showing that zzso signaling is indispensable for zzso zzso zzso and its target zzso zzso zzso are known to be crucial for the ticking of the zzso zzso Through the work done in zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso operated by cyclical zzso zzso and delayed negative feedback regulation is emerging as the fundamental mechanism underlying the zzso zzso zzso protein degradation and probably other zzso regulations are also zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important in positioning zzso boundaries and, probably, in zzso tail growth and zzso The zzso clock is another zzso zzso which, similar to the zzso clock, is operated with a negative zzso feedback zzso While the zzso clock uses a more complicated network of pathways to achieve zzso it appears that the zzso clock exploits the zzso zzso to achieve both signal generation and zzso We also discuss mathematical modeling and future directions in the zzso
