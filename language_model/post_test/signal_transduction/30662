zzso play important roles in DNA zzso zzso and zzso We have previously shown that human zzso 1 zzso is zzso in response to agents zzso DNA replication and that zzso consequently zzso zzso and degradation in a zzso zzso In the present study, we have addressed the identity of the zzso zzso zzso signals to zzso Using chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines we have concluded that zzso zzso is zzso By means of mass zzso we have identified the sites of zzso in zzso in undamaged cells and in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso is zzso at nine zzso sites and three additional sites are induced by zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso to Ala of the three zzso sites of zzso partially rescued zzso degradation of zzso and additionally stabilized the protein in zzso zzso We have raised an zzso to zzso an zzso site of the zzso type, and we provide evidence that zzso is zzso upon zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso may be a useful tool to monitor signal zzso events triggered by stalled DNA zzso
