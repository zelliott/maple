The cycle zzso factors zzso produced by zzso bacteria isolated from zzso and zzso belong to a family of molecules called zzso that interfere with the zzso cell zzso zzso blocks the cell cycle at both the zzso and zzso transitions by inducing the stabilization of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso screens, we identified the zzso protein zzso as a target of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the host cell nucleus and induced zzso of zzso zzso This zzso occurred early after cell infection and correlated with that of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso through binding with the zzso forms of zzso 1, 2, 3, 4A and zzso zzso of zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso directly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso and the interaction of zzso with several zzso zzso we further observed that zzso zzso the cellular zzso of various zzso targets, which might contribute to the zzso potential of diverse zzso
