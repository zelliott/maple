Many reports have shown that zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in brain inflammation and zzso In our previous study, zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso expression via zzso and zzso in rat brain zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms and zzso roles underlying zzso zzso expression in zzso remain zzso Here we reported that BK induced zzso expression and promoted zzso cell migration, via a zzso BK zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and then activated a zzso factor zzso zzso bound to zzso promoter and thereby induced zzso of zzso The rat zzso promoter containing an zzso zzso site zzso zzso that located at zzso zzso to zzso was identified as a crucial domain linking to BK zzso Moreover, BK induced recruitment of zzso (as a zzso zzso to the zzso promoter, leading to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Taken together, these results suggested that in zzso cells, zzso of zzso by a zzso event zzso through zzso zzso is essential for zzso gene zzso and cell migration induced by zzso
