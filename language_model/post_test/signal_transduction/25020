zzso of the zzso function of the human insulin zzso zzso is one of the principle mechanisms which induce cellular insulin zzso It is speculated that zzso zzso in the insulin zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso either as zzso zzso sites or as part of zzso zzso which bind zzso proteins or zzso zzso As reported earlier we prepared 16 zzso to zzso point zzso of the zzso and found that zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed increased zzso zzso when expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso In this study we examined whether these zzso receptors have a different zzso to zzso by zzso zzso or an altered zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In an in zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso we could detect a higher intrinsic zzso zzso activity of both zzso zzso Additionally, a higher capacity to zzso the adapter protein zzso in intact cells was zzso To test the zzso by zzso zzso the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cells together with zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulation of these cells reduced zzso zzso zzso to 58 % or 55 % of the insulin simulated state, zzso This zzso effect was not observed with zzso and zzso although all other tested zzso zzso showed similar zzso induced by protein zzso zzso 

The data suggest that the zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is important for the zzso effect of protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso on insulin zzso zzso
