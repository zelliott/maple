zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso encodes a zzso viral zzso of human zzso zzso In contrast to human zzso zzso viral zzso zzso binds directly to, and zzso the shared human zzso signaling zzso zzso without the requirement for zzso to a specific zzso Here, we dissect the zzso and functional basis of zzso mimicry of zzso We find that, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso complex, the viral zzso can engage the human zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso complex with enhanced signaling zzso In contrast to the assembly sequence of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso can be decorated with zzso post facto, in a zzso zzso A detailed comparison of the viral and human zzso zzso indicates that zzso has evolved a unique molecular strategy to interact with zzso as revealed by an almost entirely divergent structural makeup of its zzso binding zzso zzso zzso appears to zzso an elegant combination of both zzso and unexpectedly zzso molecular strategies to zzso zzso and activate similar downstream signaling zzso as its human zzso
