Aging zzso muscle loss and slows the recovery of muscle mass and function after zzso In this study we investigated the potential that zzso zzso an abundant zzso in green tea, would reduce signaling for zzso and promote skeletal muscle recovery in the fast zzso muscle and the slow zzso muscle after zzso suspension zzso in zzso zzso Fischer 344 zzso Brown Norway zzso rats (age 34 zzso received either zzso zzso zzso body zzso or water daily by zzso One group of animals received zzso for 14 days and a second group of rats received 14 days of zzso then the zzso was removed and they recovered from this forced disuse for 2 zzso Animals that received zzso over the zzso followed by 14 days of recovery, had a zzso greater zzso muscle weight zzso as compared to the animals treated with the vehicle over this same zzso zzso fiber area was greater after recovery in zzso zzso zzso zzso vehicle treated animals zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso cells was improved with zzso over vehicle treatment zzso zzso zzso in the recovery zzso Compared to vehicle treatment, the zzso index was lower zzso zzso zzso and the abundance of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso was lower in zzso treated zzso muscles after zzso While zzso did not prevent zzso zzso it improved muscle recovery after the zzso stimulus in fast zzso zzso However, this effect was muscle specific because zzso had no major impact in reversing zzso zzso in the slow zzso muscle of old zzso
