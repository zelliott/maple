Nuclear zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso appeared as a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type O zzso was recently identified as a potential zzso of zzso which can in turn activate the zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to determine the change and function of zzso in zzso and zzso during zzso 

Clinical patients with benign liver condition undergoing liver surgery were recruited in our zzso Wild type zzso and zzso zzso mice were processed to construct zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso were treated with zzso or zzso in zzso 

In human and mouse zzso models, zzso level was decreased in the early phase but reversed in the late zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso mice and primary cells, we found that zzso zzso resulted in reduction of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and was correlated to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but zzso in zzso exacerbated zzso zzso 

zzso activates zzso in a positive feedback manner, and plays a dual role in zzso zzso zzso
