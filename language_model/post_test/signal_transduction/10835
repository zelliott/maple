zzso graft zzso and zzso zzso involve zzso zzso cells, and recruitment of vascular zzso zzso We sought to examine if the inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso affects vein graft zzso via its zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso artery zzso zzso was performed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso in early zzso vein zzso Six weeks zzso zzso and zzso areas were indistinguishable among all vein graft zzso However, zzso area was reduced in zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso placed in zzso recipients, and by zzso in zzso zzso placed in zzso recipients, compared with zzso zzso in zzso recipients zzso In zzso vein zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression by 50% to zzso and increased the extent of graft zzso In zzso zzso promoted zzso expression and zzso incorporation in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso from zzso but not from zzso zzso However, responses of zzso and zzso zzso to other growth factors were zzso 

Signaling via zzso in vein zzso cells, contributes to the zzso of vein graft zzso zzso
