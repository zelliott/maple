zzso syndrome zzso is a human genetic disease that zzso both cell migration and zzso zzso The zzso gene underlying the zzso form of zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates cell zzso and zzso growth and guidance in zzso We investigated the requirement for zzso and zzso the two zzso of the zzso gene in zzso in the journey of the zzso lateral line zzso zzso First, we established that while the zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts was restricted to the zzso region of the zzso zzso and newly deposited zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were accumulated in the zzso in differentiated zzso and in a thin strip extending along the trail path of the zzso We also show that zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso severely zzso zzso zzso However, while the zzso of zzso zzso displays highly abnormal zzso proper expression of the zzso gene suggests that zzso does not play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso transcripts are detected in the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso moderate depletion of both zzso and zzso markedly affects zzso migration providing strong evidence that zzso acts as an essential zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our findings, which zzso for the first time, an essential requirement for zzso in zzso migration, also strongly suggest that this protein plays a key role for proper zzso of the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
