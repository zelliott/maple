zzso one of the major zzso zzso is only partially zzso in response to most zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism of this event is zzso We show here that zzso exists in at least two different zzso one that is bound to the zzso zzso and the other bound to both zzso and zzso a zzso small G zzso zzso of cellular zzso enhances whereas excess zzso blocks induced zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in both zzso and zzso states, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso abrogate its ability to block degradation of zzso zzso also directly blocks the in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso These observations suggest that zzso in the zzso complex is resistant to degradation by most zzso We suggest that specific signals, in addition to those that activate only zzso are essential for the complete degradation of zzso
