zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to affect zzso on media containing a high salt zzso The zzso expression in zzso was zzso to verify that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso insert in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealed two zzso copies, the whole zzso zzso and the zzso marker gene inserted in the second zzso of the zzso zzso An almost identical zzso site was found in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso expression was shown to be regulated by several zzso compounds, most clearly by salicylic acid zzso but also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that the zzso of the zzso gene was abolished in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso plants had increased zzso to virulent zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tomato, and produced more zzso oxygen species when grown on media containing zzso or rose zzso Public zzso data suggest that the zzso expression was induced by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso and type III zzso zzso This was verified zzso for the zzso zzso with real-time zzso These results suggest that zzso is one of the zzso genes whose expression is reduced by virulent zzso by type III dependent zzso Our results suggest that zzso protects the plant against zzso and zzso zzso
