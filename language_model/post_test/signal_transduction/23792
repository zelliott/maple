zzso and zzso zzso located on zzso 10 zzso is one of the most frequently zzso tumor zzso in human cancer including in zzso Here, we show that zzso exerts unconventional zzso effects in zzso through a novel zzso zzso molecular and functional zzso Using a wide array of zzso zzso and functional approaches, we demonstrate that zzso enhances a zzso complex containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso cells and tumor zzso The zzso zzso complex zzso activates the zzso zzso and zzso leading to increased cell zzso survival, invasion, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso axis or zzso zzso complex reverses the zzso and zzso effects of zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso with these data, we find that zzso expression is associated with worse patient survival than zzso loss in tumors harboring zzso zzso and that a small zzso zzso of zzso exerts greater zzso effects in zzso cancer zzso Altogether, our study describes a new signaling zzso that mediates zzso zzso role of zzso The data also indicate that the combined zzso status of zzso and zzso influences cancer prognosis and zzso therapies that target zzso and zzso
