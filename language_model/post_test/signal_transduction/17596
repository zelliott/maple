A comparison of the effect of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso on zzso zzso stores was carried out in Swiss zzso cells loaded with zzso It was found that the tumor promoter zzso zzso almost completely inhibited both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso rise, indicating that the two zzso mobilize zzso from zzso zzso sensitive to the tumor zzso It was also found that zzso with zzso almost totally and persistently (up to at least 30 zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso rise in zzso whereas zzso with zzso had only a partial zzso effect on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso response, both in the absence and in the presence of external zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso which also stimulate zzso of zzso in these cells, did not affect the zzso response induced by the same zzso These results indicate that, despite the poor production of zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of totally discharging and maintaining discharged the zzso stores of zzso zzso regardless of whether zzso zzso was present in the zzso zzso only partially caused this zzso On the contrary, zzso and zzso after releasing zzso zzso allowed an almost total zzso of the zzso It is interesting to note that, at zzso with zzso and zzso neither zzso nor zzso are able to induce a zzso response in Swiss zzso zzso
