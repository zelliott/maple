We recently demonstrated in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso that two classes of zzso zzso antibiotics and zzso agents, rapidly decrease transport zzso by zzso resistance protein 2 zzso by causing zzso zzso release and signaling through an zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso In the present study, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso methotrexate, a fluorescent model zzso for zzso and zzso zzso to examine the effects of two heavy metal zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Three patterns of effects were zzso First, exposing zzso to 10 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso for 30 zzso reduced zzso zzso This reduction was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso neither of these pharmacological tools by itself affected zzso As with zzso antibiotics and zzso agents, the acute effects of 10 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso on transport were also blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso also initiated cadmium and mercury zzso Second, exposure to higher zzso of zzso and zzso appeared to be zzso Third, exposing zzso for 6 to 24 h to lower levels of zzso increased zzso transport and zzso zzso at the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that exposure of zzso zzso zzso to heavy metals initially leads to reduced zzso function but is followed by an induction in zzso transport after long-term zzso
