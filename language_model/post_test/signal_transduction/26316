zzso encodes a ubiquitous regulatory zzso zzso of zzso an zzso that generates zzso at the plasma zzso zzso zzso triggers cell survival and zzso We found that zzso expression is elevated in breast and colon zzso and that its increased expression zzso with zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso expression induced moderate zzso generation at the cell membrane and enhanced cell zzso In zzso genetic zzso of zzso expression levels modulated tumor progression in zzso Increased zzso expression thus represents a cellular strategy in cancer zzso
