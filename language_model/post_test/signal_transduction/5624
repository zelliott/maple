As a prerequisite for studies using zzso mice, we established a mouse model for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which testosterone zzso promotes muscle zzso Groups of six adult male mice zzso received one of the following zzso 1) vehicle zzso distilled zzso normal zzso and 2) zzso zzso with empty zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso filled zzso Mice were killed 2, 6, and 8 weeks after zzso T treatment for 8 weeks resulted in a significant zzso increase in fiber area of zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso of the zzso zzso Delta 1 and zzso of zzso zzso as evidenced by increase in activated forms of zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso with this, we also observed an increase in the number of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso in muscles of zzso mice, indicating that zzso of zzso signaling enhanced cell zzso T supplementation not only triggered zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso but also zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within 2 weeks of zzso zzso administration of zzso a zzso zzso zzso effectively blocked zzso zzso of zzso signaling and significantly zzso suppressed zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that T zzso muscle fiber zzso through zzso of zzso signaling and the zzso of zzso together with the zzso of zzso zzso may be critical for zzso zzso of zzso signaling and, as a consequence, muscle fiber zzso
