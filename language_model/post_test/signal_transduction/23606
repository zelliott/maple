zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso implicated in zzso processes with a broad range of zzso zzso several zzso signaling pathways in the zzso The authors investigated the association of variation in the zzso gene with a series of progressively more complex zzso of relevance to zzso a zzso disorder with strong genetic zzso zzso Based on computer predictions, the authors investigated in humans the association of zzso functional variation with 1) zzso zzso expression from zzso prefrontal cortex, 2) zzso and zzso protein expression from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso 3) prefrontal imaging zzso and 4) diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso with predictions, the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso from zzso prefrontal zzso Furthermore, this zzso was associated with zzso protein expression and zzso activity, as well as with downstream effects on zzso expression in zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was associated with attenuated functional zzso prefrontal activity, reduced prefrontal cortical zzso and diagnosis of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso variation is implicated in multiple zzso relevant to zzso
