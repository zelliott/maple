zzso zzso zzso represent a subset of zzso transient zzso connections that allow direct communication between distant zzso Recent studies have provided new insights into the existence of zzso in zzso and this novel mechanism of zzso communication is implicated in various essential zzso such as development, zzso tissue zzso and transmission of electrical zzso zzso are versatile structures known to facilitate the transfer of various zzso such as zzso plasma membrane zzso pathogens and zzso Recently, a new function of zzso in the long-range transfer of electrical signals that involves gap junctions has been zzso This indicates that different types of zzso might exist, and supports the notion that zzso might not be just passive open zzso but rather are regulated by gating zzso Furthermore, zzso have been found in different cell lines and are characterized by their diversity in terms of zzso Here we discuss these novel findings in the context of the two models that have been proposed for TNT formation, and focus on putative proteins that could represent TNT specific zzso We also shed some light on the molecular mechanisms used by zzso to transfer zzso as well as chemical and electrical zzso
