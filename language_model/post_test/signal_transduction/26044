Many zzso studies have shown the potential of zzso cancer gene zzso However, successful translation of these promising results into the clinic has not yet been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by abundant zzso zzso and zzso cell interactions play a critical role in tumor zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso interactions reduce the efficacy of zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on zzso gene therapy using zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells cultured with or without zzso culture zzso then infected with zzso After 48 zzso the cells were stained for zzso The results showed that the number of zzso cells was significantly reduced after culture with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso interactions we next investigated the involvement of this zzso in zzso interactions leading to the decreased efficacy of zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured with or without zzso (a zzso zzso and/or zzso culture zzso then infected with zzso After 48 zzso zzso cells were zzso The number of zzso cells in cultures containing zzso zzso plus zzso was significantly greater than in cultures without zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso cells in zzso reduce the efficacy of zzso therapy through a mechanism involving the zzso zzso Control of such zzso interactions may lead to improvements in zzso gene therapy for zzso
