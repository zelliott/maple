zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are key zzso in zzso cell surface zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso to downstream signaling events affecting diverse biological zzso There is therefore tremendous interest in the development of pharmacological zzso targeting the zzso axis for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and zzso zzso A good zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that measures zzso events, is warranted for evaluation of such zzso In zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso Here, we report the development of a novel zzso that uses the zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso of zzso C zzso zzso a direct zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso was validated using zzso or zzso zzso and generated zzso correlated with those from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso showed good stability and uniformity over a period of 24 h in different zzso Interestingly, compound zzso values using blood from patients with zzso arthritis were slightly higher compared with those produced using samples from healthy zzso This novel zzso zzso zzso zzso should serve as a promising zzso zzso for zzso and clinical development of zzso targeting the zzso zzso
