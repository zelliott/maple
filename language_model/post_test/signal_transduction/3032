The zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso is a strong modifier of zzso zzso longevity and zzso As aging is the greatest risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases such as zzso zzso zzso zzso we were interested in determining if zzso signaling zzso disease pathology in zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression demonstrate significantly impaired locomotion as compared to zzso zzso expressing controls and they develop zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso either through a zzso zzso or zzso targeted zzso decreases the abundance of zzso zzso and results in improved locomotion in a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that manipulation of the zzso zzso signaling zzso may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
