zzso and zzso properties of zzso proteins or zzso derived from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems of zzso coli and zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and of truncated zzso and zzso derived zzso proteins containing the receiver and zzso containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso only the zzso zzso were characterized by native gel zzso gel zzso experiments and zzso zzso The results obtained by the different methods are consistent with zzso zzso and zzso proteins being zzso in solution with a zzso constant significantly below 1 zzso In contrast, all sensor derived zzso of zzso and zzso were observed to be zzso in zzso No indications for a zzso induced stimulation of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be zzso In agreement with these data, surface zzso resonance studies revealed a zzso zzso in the interaction of zzso with the immobilized zzso zzso domain and an affinity constant of zzso zzso zzso
