zzso zzso zzso drugs protect against excessive zzso bone zzso After binding to bone zzso they are taken up selectively by the zzso and inhibit the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit also growth of zzso of zzso zzso in which their target is again zzso A fusion protein between zzso and zzso zzso fluorescent zzso was found, in zzso zzso to zzso to zzso and to zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso was also directed to zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso This contains a sequence of nine zzso acids that closely resembles the zzso zzso zzso targeting signal zzso there is only a single zzso acid mismatch between the two zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso zzso directs zzso into zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso zzso zzso fusion protein in strains of zzso zzso defective in zzso protein import demonstrated that import of zzso into zzso was blocked in a strain lacking the zzso import zzso The zzso location of zzso in zzso zzso indicates that zzso have to cross the zzso membrane before they can bind to their zzso
