The zzso Signaling zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of multiple zzso zzso zzso may primarily be zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso while a subset may be zzso In this study zzso primary tumors were used to identify correlations between multiple zzso thought to be involved in the zzso and the clinical outcomes of patients with zzso Identification of such correlations could be used to aid in zzso treatment and predicting patient zzso 

A tissue zzso representing 248 clinically zzso stage zzso zzso cases was stained using zzso zzso and scored for zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as, zzso a putative cancer stem cell zzso Data was analyzed for correlation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and clinical characteristics including zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso 

In zzso there were significant correlations of zzso expression between zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso while zzso correlated with zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso zzso significantly correlated with zzso protein expression zzso After multiple testing zzso there was no significant correlation between any of the six markers and zzso or zzso 

Key downstream components of the zzso show correlation with sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is more prevalent in primary zzso zzso Surprisingly, in zzso zzso there were no significant correlations between zzso proteins or zzso and zzso or zzso
