A dynamic zzso interaction is crucial for a rapid cellular response to changes in the zzso zzso cell behavior in response to the changing wound environment is required for efficient wound zzso However, the way in which wound zzso modify the wound environment to coordinate with such cellular responses remains less zzso We demonstrated that zzso 4 zzso produced by wound zzso coordinates zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in the wound bed, delaying their zzso degradation by zzso This interaction does not interfere with zzso protein recognition and directly affects zzso communication by altering the availability of intact zzso zzso These interactions stimulate zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways essential for effective wound zzso The zzso of zzso in mice delays wound zzso Further analysis revealed that cell migration was impaired in the zzso zzso Altogether, the findings provide molecular insight into a novel control of wound healing via zzso regulation of zzso zzso Given the known role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso it is a prime therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetic zzso It also underscores the importance of zzso communication during zzso and cancer zzso
