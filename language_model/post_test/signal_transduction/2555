In this study, zzso by big zzso (big zzso and a role for the zzso zzso converting zzso in this zzso was investigated in smooth muscle cells cultured from bovine pulmonary zzso In whole cells, both zzso and big zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso significantly inhibited stimulation by zzso (10 zzso or big zzso zzso zzso When cells were zzso with 100 zzso zzso the stimulation by big zzso but not zzso was zzso In separate experiments, when cells were incubated with zzso big zzso a zzso zzso conversion to zzso was detected by zzso These results are consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso converting zzso on the surface of bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which may play a role in regulating zzso by circulating big zzso
