We describe a molecular switch based on the controlled zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso proteins zzso The zzso zzso site is localized to an zzso zzso that is essential for stabilizing the structure of the zzso domain, which mediates zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso blocks zzso zzso by disabling the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso Thus, zzso functions as a zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso via its zzso activity while acting as a zzso for nuclear zzso These results provide strong in zzso and in zzso evidence that zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso gene zzso and define zzso zzso as a new regulatory mechanism in hormone zzso
