The zzso target of zzso zzso plays a central role in cellular growth and zzso zzso forms two distinct protein complexes, zzso and zzso Much is known about the regulation and functions of zzso due to availability of a natural compound, zzso that zzso this zzso Studies that define zzso cellular functions and signaling have lagged zzso The development of pharmacological zzso that block zzso zzso activity, and thereby inhibit both zzso complexes, along with availability of mice with genetic zzso in zzso complex components have now provided new insights on zzso function and zzso Since prolonged effects of zzso can also disrupt zzso it is worth re-evaluating the contribution of this zzso zzso complex in cancer, zzso disorders and zzso In this review, we focus on recent developments on zzso zzso signaling mechanisms and its cellular and zzso zzso
