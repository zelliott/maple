The zzso zzso zzso was chosen as a model genetic zzso because its zzso chiefly its zzso lifestyle and rapid generation time, make it suitable for the isolation and characterization of genetic zzso The most important challenge for the zzso is to design a genetic screen that will identify zzso that specifically disrupt the biological process of zzso Since 1974, when Sydney Brenner published his pioneering genetic screen, researchers have developed increasingly powerful methods for identifying genes and genetic pathways in zzso zzso
