Several groups have shown that detection of microbial components by zzso on zzso stem and zzso cells zzso instructs zzso cell generation, raising interest in the possibility of targeting zzso on zzso to boost zzso However, although zzso cells exhibit zzso cell characteristics zzso zzso production, zzso zzso it is not clear whether they are functionally equivalent to zzso derived in the absence of zzso zzso Our in zzso and in zzso studies show that zzso derived from mouse and human zzso zzso (including stem zzso exposed to a zzso zzso prior to or during zzso differentiation produce lower levels of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso oxygen zzso This is in contrast to prior exposure of differentiated zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which suppresses inflammatory zzso production, but zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso factors produced following exposure of zzso to a zzso zzso can also act in a zzso manner to influence the function of zzso derived from zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso function can be influenced by zzso signaling in the zzso from which they are zzso and that this may impact the clinical utility of targeting zzso on zzso to boost zzso
