The regulation of zzso zzso zzso levels by different zzso hormones and zzso factors was examined in zzso cell cultures derived from zzso immature zzso zzso zzso from cell cultures was prepared by zzso and equal amounts of zzso from all samples were zzso with a zzso zzso using a zzso zzso probe corresponding to a part of zzso 5 together with a part of the zzso end of zzso 6 of the rat zzso zzso In addition, a specific zzso probe for zzso was used as an internal zzso The results show that 5 zzso zzso for 24 to 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, reaching levels zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso had only minor effects on zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso did not show any significant zzso zzso raised zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso levels up to zzso and twofold above controls respectively, whereas zzso growth factor was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso levels in a zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso levels in zzso cells are regulated by zzso rather than zzso and that the stimulation by zzso can be inhibited by zzso growth factor but enhanced by zzso zzso alone was also capable of stimulating zzso zzso
