The zzso system of zzso coli is sensitive to small relative changes in ambient zzso zzso over a broad zzso zzso among receptors are crucial to this sensitivity, as is precise adaptation, the return of zzso activity to zzso levels in a constant zzso environment through zzso and zzso of zzso Signal integration and zzso have been attributed to strongly zzso mixed teams of zzso but receptors become individually zzso according to their zzso occupancy zzso Here, we present a model of dynamic signaling teams that zzso strong zzso among receptors with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso couple to form a honeycomb zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso within which the boundaries of signaling teams change zzso Our model helps explain the zzso increase in signaling team size with zzso zzso and indicates that active zzso couple more strongly than inactive zzso
