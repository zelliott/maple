In the present study, we have examined the effect of increased zzso zzso zzso levels on the zzso action of zzso II zzso zzso on protein zzso Treatment with zzso agents zzso inhibited zzso zzso protein synthesis in rat zzso smooth muscle cells and in rat zzso expressing the human zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and was observed at all zzso of the zzso To explore the mechanism of zzso action, we have analyzed the effects of zzso and zzso on various zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter the binding properties of the zzso zzso and did not interfere with the zzso of zzso C or the induction of early growth response genes by zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso In contrast, we found that increased concentration of zzso strongly inhibited the zzso effect of zzso II on protein zzso zzso Specifically, zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of the focal zzso protein zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso These results identify a novel mechanism by which the zzso signaling system may exert zzso effects in specific cell zzso
