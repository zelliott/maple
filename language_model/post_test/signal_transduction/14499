zzso formed primarily via zzso of zzso has been historically dubbed a zzso zzso due to enhanced local release and beneficial actions during zzso zzso From a cardiovascular perspective, evidence indicates the zzso system is essential in mediation of intrinsic protection zzso zzso and zzso and determining zzso resistance to zzso zzso of zzso and its receptors thus remains a promising, though as yet not zzso approach to zzso of injury in zzso zzso zzso exerts effects through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are all expressed in zzso and vascular cells, and couple to G proteins to trigger a range of responses zzso but not always, zzso zzso can also enhance tolerance to zzso stimuli via zzso zzso zzso Given zzso contribution to zzso it is no surprise that zzso signaling typically mimics that associated with zzso This involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with ultimate effects at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso channel and/or the zzso zzso transition pore zzso Nonetheless, differences in zzso signaling and actions of the different zzso zzso zzso have been recently zzso Our understanding of zzso zzso continues to evolve, with roles for the zzso zzso emerging, together with evidence of essential zzso zzso in mediation of zzso This review focuses on current research into zzso zzso highlighting recent findings which, together with a wealth of prior knowledge, may ultimately facilitate zzso approaches to clinical cardiac zzso
