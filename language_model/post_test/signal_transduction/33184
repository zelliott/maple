zzso potency increases at lower zzso In contrast, the transfer zzso of volatile zzso from water to zzso is usually zzso The transfer decreases at lower zzso It was proposed that a few selective proteins bind volatile zzso with negative delta zzso and these proteins are involved in signal zzso There has been no report on direct zzso of binding delta H of zzso to zzso This study used zzso zzso zzso to analyze zzso binding to bovine serum zzso The zzso measured delta H zzso was zzso zzso Thus the negative delta H of zzso binding is not limited to signal zzso zzso The binding was zzso following zzso statistics and is characterized by the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso The zzso association constant, K, was zzso zzso 132 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the maximum binding number, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso K was 189 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso potency is a function of the activity of zzso zzso not the zzso Because the sign of delta H determines the temperature dependence of distribution of zzso zzso it is irrelevant to the temperature dependence of zzso zzso
