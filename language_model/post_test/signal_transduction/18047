zzso We used large zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity as a probe to characterize the zzso G protein zzso zzso pathways in intact cells from pregnant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso enhanced the outward current zzso in PM cells and inhibited zzso in zzso zzso Additional application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso further enhanced the zzso zzso in PM cells but partially antagonized zzso in zzso zzso zzso alone did not affect zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (1 zzso abolished the effects of zzso and zzso The specific zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso by approximately 80 zzso the residual current was insensitive to zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by either zzso toxin or the zzso zzso protein zzso abolished zzso as well as zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso a scavenger of zzso zzso zzso converted the zzso action of zzso on zzso into an zzso zzso Free zzso enhanced both the zzso and the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso channel activity is a sensitive probe to follow zzso zzso zzso in zzso smooth muscle zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso stimulation can occur in the same cell, irrespective of zzso It is speculated that the zzso between zzso and zzso proteins is more efficient during pregnancy and that zzso at high levels simply override the zzso action of zzso zzso
