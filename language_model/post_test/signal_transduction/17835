The open reading frame zzso 74 of zzso encodes a G zzso zzso which is highly zzso in members of this zzso and is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The viral G zzso zzso has been implicated in viral zzso However, the advantage of such zzso zzso zzso to the virus is currently zzso To address this, we constructed zzso deletion zzso of a mouse zzso zzso and examined the effect of the deletion on viral growth and zzso from zzso Growth of the zzso viruses in zzso zzso cells was similar to that of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 2, significantly increased viral replication of the zzso but not the zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 10, a zzso zzso lacking an zzso zzso was able to reverse the effect of zzso on viral zzso The zzso viruses also showed significantly reduced zzso from zzso infected mouse zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso virus restored the zzso zzso zzso a viral zzso zzso to enhance replication and zzso from zzso represents a novel mechanism by which zzso can zzso the immune zzso
