zzso is a promising zzso agent against cancer that zzso tumor progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting zzso cell zzso Recently, the zzso signaling zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso where its abnormal zzso is associated with the development of breast zzso Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the biological activities of zzso against zzso cancer cells, and to determine whether zzso could regulate the zzso signaling zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of cell growth and induced zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of 20 zzso zzso suppressed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso signaling zzso was confirmed by the reduced stabilization of the zzso zzso Among various zzso screened for the zzso signaling pathway, the expression of zzso 2 and 3 was induced after treatment with 20 zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed zzso cell growth of zzso cancer cells instead of zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso or zzso along with zzso both zzso for the zzso signaling zzso were able to restore the suppressed cell viability by zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso exerts its zzso activity through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso These results indicate for the first time that zzso decreases cell viability and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells, which is possibly zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that zzso has great potential value as zzso agent for cancer treatment, especially in breast cancer controlled by zzso signaling zzso
