The zzso factor zzso which regulates expression of zzso in response to various zzso signals is a zzso complex composed of members of the zzso and zzso zzso To examine the biological role of the various components in signal zzso we analyzed the expression of two of them zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso While all three genes are induced by zzso zzso and zzso only zzso is induced by zzso In contrast expression of zzso and zzso is reduced by zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso In addition zzso is not an efficient zzso of the zzso and zzso promoters although both zzso and zzso exhibit similar DNA binding properties, indicating that the differences in biological activity is due to differences in their zzso zzso Our results imply that enhanced expression of zzso (and zzso depends on the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is inhibited under certain conditions of high levels of zzso This suggests a negative regulatory function of zzso which greatly expands the potential of the zzso protein family in changing the zzso of specific genes involved in triggering complex biological zzso
