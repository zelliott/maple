zzso the hallmark zzso of the zzso population, mediates immunity to zzso pathogens and promotes zzso zzso The signaling mechanisms triggered by the zzso zzso zzso and related receptors are zzso different from other zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso that engages zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso Although the zzso is critical for zzso the molecular details of the functional zzso within zzso remain poorly zzso Here, we provide a detailed zzso analysis zzso the zzso boundary of the zzso region of zzso We show that functionality of this domain requires a large extension to the previously identified zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso this extension is not zzso among zzso family zzso Surprisingly, zzso recruitment is not sufficient for downstream signaling zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso tightly with functional zzso We further demonstrate that zzso exhibits signaling properties that are zzso with other zzso family zzso Finally, we report that zzso signals zzso with zzso using the same signaling motifs within zzso These studies provide new insight into the zzso relationships of zzso and reveal distinct signaling differences among zzso family zzso
