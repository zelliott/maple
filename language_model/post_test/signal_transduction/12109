While biological systems have often been compared with digital systems, they differ by the strong effect of zzso between signals due to zzso in the zzso reaction zzso and zzso Memory elements have allowed the creation of autonomous digital systems and although biological systems have similar properties of zzso equivalent memory mechanisms remain zzso Any such equivalent memory system, however, must silence the effect of zzso to maintain memory zzso 

Here, we present a system of zzso reactions that behaves like an zzso latch (a simple memory element in digital zzso Using both a zzso molecular simulator and ordinary differential equation simulator, we showed that zzso between two zzso operating in the same spatial zzso zzso the memory zzso of both zzso zzso was reduced or silenced when simple reaction zzso were replaced with multiple step or zzso zzso showing that zzso signaling pathways are less susceptible to zzso 

Thus, the common biological theme of zzso signaling pathways is advantageous for maintaining the zzso of a memory latch in the presence of zzso The experimental zzso of such a latch system will lead to novel approaches to cell control using synthetic proteins and will contribute to our understanding of why cells behave differently even when given the same zzso
