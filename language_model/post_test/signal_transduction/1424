Using zzso zzso of the human beta zzso zzso and continuous expression in zzso cells, the role of 3 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso in the third zzso domain in zzso function was zzso zzso was replaced with zzso in each zzso zzso as this zzso acid is similar to zzso in size but it cannot form zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso 77 and zzso in the second and seventh zzso zzso respectively, had no effect on zzso binding or the ability of the zzso to mediate zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the sixth zzso domain of the zzso produced a zzso zzso with normal zzso properties but a significantly attenuated ability to mediate stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 190 and zzso in the third zzso loop of the beta 2 zzso had zzso similar effects on zzso binding and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Replacement of either of these zzso with zzso produced zzso receptors that displayed a marked loss in affinity for both zzso zzso and zzso Replacement of both zzso 190 and 191 with zzso had an even greater effect on the ability of the zzso to bind zzso zzso with the loss of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso affinity for zzso was a corresponding shift to the right in the zzso curve for zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells expressing the zzso zzso These data zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human beta zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso and also suggest that zzso zzso zzso in an zzso domain of the zzso may be involved in zzso zzso
