zzso alpha and zzso containing protein zzso a highly zzso and structurally unique member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in innate immunity signaling and zzso Its exact mechanism of zzso action remains zzso zzso is an ancient and ubiquitous process of programmed cell death that results in disruption of the nuclear zzso and, ultimately, dismantling of the zzso In addition to supporting the nuclear zzso zzso serve important roles in zzso organization, zzso regulation, transcription, nuclear zzso and zzso zzso and other damage that destabilize nuclear zzso zzso zzso a number of intractable human zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso to the nucleus of human embryonic kidney cells by using its zzso zzso repeat zzso Within the nucleus, zzso forms a previously zzso lattice akin to the nuclear zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso protects zzso from zzso degradation and reduces zzso DNA fragmentation in response to signaling induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso These findings indicate an important link between the innate immunity zzso zzso and stabilization of nuclear zzso during zzso zzso in human zzso
