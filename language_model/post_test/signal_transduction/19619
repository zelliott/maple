zzso is a G zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in the zzso of primary zzso disorders and zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso of zzso are associated with zzso zzso infections, and zzso zzso syndrome, a primary zzso disorder characterized by zzso and zzso zzso Recent progress has implicated zzso zzso zzso factor 1) signaling in regulating zzso zzso but the precise role of zzso interactions in regulating zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso Here, we use the optical transparency of zzso to zzso zzso trafficking in zzso in a zzso model of zzso zzso We demonstrate that expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso retention in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wound zzso The zzso retention signal induced by zzso zzso zzso is zzso dependent, because depletion of zzso with the use of zzso zzso restores zzso zzso to zzso Moreover, localized zzso of a genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to direct migration of zzso that express the zzso zzso The findings suggest that this transgenic zzso model of zzso syndrome may provide a valuable tool to screen for agents that modify zzso retention zzso
