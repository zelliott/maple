Under normal circumstances, zzso adult skeletal muscle is a stable tissue with very little turnover of zzso However, upon injury, skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to initiate a rapid and extensive repair process preventing the loss of muscle zzso zzso muscle repair is a highly synchronized process involving the zzso of various cellular zzso The initial phase of muscle repair is characterized by necrosis of the damaged tissue and zzso of an inflammatory zzso This phase is rapidly followed by zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso and fuse leading to new zzso formation and zzso of a functional zzso zzso zzso of adult muscle satellite cells is a key element in this zzso Muscle satellite cell zzso resembles embryonic zzso in several ways including the de zzso induction of the zzso regulatory zzso Signaling factors released during the zzso process have been identified, but their functions remain to be fully zzso In addition, recent evidence supports the possible contribution of adult stem cells in the muscle zzso zzso In particular, bone zzso and zzso stem cells contribute to new zzso formation and to the satellite cell pool after zzso
