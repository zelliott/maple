zzso provide structural and functional support for zzso as well as display zzso or zzso zzso depending upon the presence of an immune or inflammatory zzso This study was undertaken to characterize multiple zzso of activated zzso and to investigate the regulatory mechanisms zzso We report that activated zzso in culture exhibit two functional zzso with respect to zzso or zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso or zzso zzso The two distinct functional zzso of zzso were also demonstrated in a mouse zzso model, which showed zzso or zzso gene expression in zzso following challenge with classical or alternative zzso zzso similar results were obtained in the absence of zzso zzso studies involving zzso zzso zzso protein treatment or zzso mice indicated that the zzso or zzso functionally polarized zzso of zzso and their zzso signaling zzso were critically regulated by zzso under in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted classical zzso zzso of zzso but inhibited zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in alternative zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso of the functional polarization of zzso in the presence of immune or inflammatory stimuli and that zzso could be targeted zzso to dampen zzso zzso zzso and related zzso in the zzso
