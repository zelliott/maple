Following various types of nerve injury, zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso are universally and chronically zzso in injured nerves and contribute to the genesis of zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso likely exert chronic effects on zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that injured zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso following partial zzso nerve zzso In zzso adult rats, zzso was expressed in only a few small size zzso zzso which all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso increased and shifted zzso expression from small to medium and large size damaged zzso zzso zzso injection of a selective zzso 2 inhibitor or a selective zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso in zzso suggesting that injured nerve derived zzso contributes to the de zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso through zzso zzso In cultured sensory zzso zzso a stabilized zzso analog increased zzso zzso and protein levels through the zzso of zzso protein zzso A, protein zzso C, zzso regulated protein zzso zzso response element binding protein and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso the de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso in injured medium and large size zzso zzso is a novel mechanism underlying the role of injured nerve derived zzso in the genesis of zzso zzso
