zzso can trigger the zzso zzso zzso by releasing zzso Here we report that a zzso protein zzso from rat liver zzso possesses a long standing potent Bid zzso activity at neutral zzso and the truncated Bid can in turn induce rapid zzso release of zzso zzso This zzso was revealed as zzso B by zzso and mass zzso zzso Although it was long recognized as a zzso zzso exclusively zzso by the zzso zzso our data support that it also expresses and zzso resides in rat liver zzso zzso of zzso zzso B into zzso was triggered by zzso stimuli such as tumor necrosis zzso and zzso delivery of zzso B protein induced zzso cell death with a potency comparable with zzso B, suggestive of a zzso zzso to zzso regulated by zzso B following its zzso zzso either zzso of zzso B expression by zzso interference or zzso with zzso B inhibitor zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced tumor necrosis zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso B is not only restricted to the zzso but can function zzso as a zzso zzso
