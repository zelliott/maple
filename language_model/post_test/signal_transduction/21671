Recent studies have highlighted zzso between zzso cells and zzso bystander cells and have uncovered zzso zzso of zzso instability in the progeny of zzso cells that cannot be solely explained by zzso zzso It is difficult to explain these zzso and zzso phenomena using the current paradigm of radiation zzso zzso bystander effect is a type of zzso response to radiation that illustrates that the unit of function in zzso organisms is neither the zzso nor the zzso Cell function in complex three-dimensional zzso is coordinated by soluble signaling peptides and by small molecules within the context of zzso scaffolding provided by the zzso zzso zzso response and zzso zzso instability could thus result from persistent signaling zzso following radiation zzso A model of radiation response based on the systems biology principles of network interconnectivity and spatial organization should reconcile the apparent contradiction of these cellular zzso within the higher order structure of zzso and zzso
