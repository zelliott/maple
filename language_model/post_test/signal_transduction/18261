The zzso zzso zzso zzso controls responses to zzso shock such as production of the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso can be zzso by addition of zzso This stimulation was strongly diminished in cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso channel, presumably because zzso rapidly zzso across the plasma zzso zzso which passes the plasma membrane readily and causes water stress by disturbing the zzso of zzso did not activate the zzso zzso These observations suggest that stimulation of the zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso change and not by water stress per zzso
