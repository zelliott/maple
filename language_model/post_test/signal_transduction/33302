The zzso family of zzso proteins serves as receptors for zzso and zzso The family is composed of a zzso zzso zzso as well as several alternatively spliced zzso zzso with identical zzso zzso zzso but very small zzso zzso The two zzso truncated zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso of only 23 and 21 zzso zzso zzso Although it is known that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of initiating zzso and zzso signal zzso the functional role or roles of the truncated receptors remain zzso At the same time, the potential importance of the truncated receptors in the development, zzso and zzso of the nervous system has been highlighted by recent zzso and injury paradigm zzso Here we have used zzso zzso zzso cell lines to demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are capable of zzso zzso signal zzso More specifically, zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso increases the rate of zzso zzso release from the cell, a common zzso consequence of many signaling zzso Further, these zzso and zzso zzso changes occur with zzso distinct from changes zzso by zzso suggesting the participation of at least some unique zzso component or zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso sequences within the zzso zzso of each zzso are essential for signaling zzso Finally, inhibitor studies suggest that zzso are likely to be involved in the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
