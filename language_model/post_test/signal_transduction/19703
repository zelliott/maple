In zzso zzso regulatory systems have been demonstrated to regulate zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we describe a method implementing preparation of a protein extract under zzso conditions, followed by Western analysis using zzso zzso that can be used to observe the effects of components of zzso signaling pathways or other proteins on the zzso status of zzso The protein extraction method presented may also be used to concentrate cellular proteins for additional applications, such as zzso labeling or analysis of other zzso zzso
