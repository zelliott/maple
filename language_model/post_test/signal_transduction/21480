zzso signaling has been extensively implicated in zzso determination along the development of the immune zzso However, a role for zzso signaling in fully differentiated immune cells has not been clearly zzso We have analyzed the expression of zzso protein family members during zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso After treatment with zzso and/or zzso we observed a zzso zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso To study the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso we forced the transient expression of zzso active zzso zzso zzso proteins in Raw zzso cells and analyzed their effects on the activity of zzso factors involved in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso Furthermore, Raw zzso zzso stable zzso increased zzso zzso in response to zzso leading to higher expression of zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso class II zzso This effect was independent from an increase of zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso NO zzso expression and NO production decreased under the same zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and subsequent signaling following zzso zzso zzso gene expression patterns known to affect the function of mature zzso
