zzso is heavily influenced by zzso and its family of zzso particularly zzso zzso 2 zzso Like most cell surface zzso zzso is zzso although the function of zzso with respect to its zzso pattern is poorly zzso zzso a zzso binding zzso interacts with the zzso and zzso zzso retaining them on the plasma membrane and altering their signal zzso Because zzso is zzso and both zzso and zzso are involved with zzso we hypothesized that zzso binds zzso and zzso its signal zzso as zzso zzso a Western zzso analysis approach, we found that zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso A direct interaction on the plasma membrane was detected between zzso and zzso and this interaction was dependent on the expression of zzso Using zzso and cell surface zzso we found an increase in the level of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso retains the zzso on the plasma zzso Finally, we observed reduced zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, like its role with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso contributes to the plasma membrane retention and zzso function of zzso
