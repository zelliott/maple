zzso restriction zzso and chemical agents, such as zzso and zzso that partially mimic the zzso effect, can delay morbidity and mortality across a broad range of zzso In humans, however, the effects of zzso or other zzso agents have not yet been investigated zzso Human zzso lifespan is already substantially greater compared to that of closely related zzso zzso It is therefore possible that humans have acquired genetic zzso that mimic the zzso zzso Here, we tested this notion by comparing zzso differences between humans and other zzso with the zzso changes observed in mice subjected to zzso We show that the human zzso state, relative to other zzso zzso does not match that of the zzso mice or mice treated with zzso but resembles the zzso state of ad zzso fed zzso At the same time, the zzso changes induced by zzso in mice are enriched among genes showing age-related changes in zzso concentrated in specific expression patterns, and can be linked with specific functional zzso including insulin zzso cancer, and the immune zzso These findings indicate that the evolution of human longevity was likely independent of zzso lifespan extension zzso zzso application of zzso or zzso agents may yet offer a promising direction for the extension of healthy human zzso
