A consolidated map of the zzso pathways that function in the formation of zzso and long-term cellular memory could be considered the ultimate means of defining the molecular basis of zzso Research has established that zzso zzso of these complex cellular zzso leads to many changes in the composition and functioning of a zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of its synaptic strength and zzso However, although generally accepted that synaptic plasticity is the mechanism zzso memories are stored in the brain, there is much controversy over whether the site of this zzso memory expression is predominantly zzso or zzso Much of the early research into the zzso mechanisms of memory performed using the model zzso the marine snail zzso has focused on the associated zzso zzso Recently however, zzso mechanisms have been shown to contribute definitively to long term memory zzso and are in fact critical for persistent zzso synaptic zzso In this review, in which we aimed to integrate many of the early and recent advances concerning coordinated zzso signaling in both the zzso and zzso zzso we have provided a detailed account of the diverse cellular events that lead to modifications in synaptic zzso Thus, a comprehensive synaptic model is presented that could explain a few of the shortcomings that arise when the zzso and zzso changes are considered zzso Although it is clear that there is still much to be zzso and that the exact nature of many of the zzso zzso and their components are yet to be fully zzso this still incomplete but integrated illustrative map of the cellular pathways involved provides an overview which expands understanding of the zzso mechanisms of learning and zzso
