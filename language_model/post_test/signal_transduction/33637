zzso signaling pathways hold the keys to unlocking the promise of adult tissue zzso and to zzso zzso Patients with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene are at increased risk of developing zzso an zzso form of liver cancer, suggesting that zzso affects zzso zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso loss and enhanced zzso activity in liver development, we examined zzso zzso and zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso developed enlarged zzso through biased induction of zzso gene programs and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso formed no zzso zzso zzso determined that the effects of zzso loss were cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso confirmed zzso consequences of zzso zzso zzso pattern formation and gene expression required suppression of zzso signaling in early zzso later, increased zzso activity altered zzso fate by enhancing liver growth at the expense of zzso zzso these effects persisted into the zzso zzso In adult zzso zzso increased zzso activity significantly accelerated liver zzso after partial zzso Similarly, liver zzso was significantly enhanced in zzso mice, indicating the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso across zzso zzso These studies reveal an important and zzso role for zzso signaling during liver development and zzso
