The purpose of this study was to determine if zzso elicits different zzso and zzso responses in systemic zzso smooth muscle cells incubated under conditions that do or do not result in cellular zzso depletion and whether these effects are relevant to vascular zzso in zzso Gene expression profiling was used to identify potential regulatory zzso In human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso incubated at zzso zzso proliferation and progression through the zzso zzso are zzso zzso at zzso zzso reduced zzso delayed zzso transition, increased zzso cell death, and is associated with zzso membrane zzso and reduced cellular zzso zzso In zzso and zzso artery from rats exposed to zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso both proliferation and zzso are increased, as are zzso nuclear density and smooth muscle cell zzso Although nuclear levels of zzso factor zzso zzso are increased to a similar extent in zzso incubated at 1 and zzso zzso expression of tumor protein zzso its zzso target zzso as well as their regulatory factors and downstream zzso are zzso affected under these two conditions, suggesting that the zzso effects of zzso are zzso by this zzso We conclude that zzso zzso a state of enhanced cell turnover through increased rates of both smooth muscle cell proliferation and zzso This zzso the ability to zzso the zzso in response to changing tissue zzso needs while avoiding the zzso of zzso that may lead to zzso transformation or the formation of abnormal vascular zzso
