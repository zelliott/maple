zzso the many stimuli zzso the growth of plant roots, of critical importance are the touch signals generated as roots explore the mechanically complex soil zzso However, the molecular mechanisms behind these sensory events remain poorly zzso We report an impaired zzso response of roots in zzso lacking a zzso zzso zzso avoidance may zzso a zzso release of zzso to the zzso zzso While sequential touch stimulation revealed a strong zzso period for zzso release in response to zzso in zzso plants, the zzso period in zzso was zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as an zzso signal released by zzso and that the zzso complex is needed for zzso this zzso
