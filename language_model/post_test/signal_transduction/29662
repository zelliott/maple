zzso zzso is a zzso that is involved in the growth and survival of cardiac zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that treatment of zzso bodies grown from zzso zzso embryonic stem zzso cells with zzso significantly zzso zzso and increased nuclear expression of the proliferation marker zzso The increase in zzso expression was inhibited upon zzso with the free radical scavenger vitamin zzso indicating a role for zzso oxygen species zzso in the signaling zzso zzso treatment of cardiac cells raised zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were presumably generated by an zzso since zzso generation was zzso upon zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso activated nuclear zzso zzso and induced zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso the free radical scavenger vitamin zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso as well as by zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and the zzso signaling cascade interact on a level downstream of zzso It is concluded that zzso stimulates the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso by signaling pathways that involve zzso as signaling molecules in the signal zzso zzso
