zzso of various types release small membrane zzso called zzso zzso on their zzso as well as during the process of zzso The properties and roles of zzso generated in different contexts are diverse and are determined by their parent cell and the zzso of their generation, which affects their zzso zzso are involved in multiple cellular functions, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are able to deliver molecular signals in the form of zzso zzso zzso zzso or functional zzso proteins from the parent cell to zzso located zzso In this review, we zzso some of the current knowledge regarding zzso and their functional roles in transfer of zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso between cells of different origins in different zzso We will focus on the ability of zzso to mediate zzso signals and their effect on cell zzso The investigation of zzso could zzso new cellular communication pathways and may lead to better understanding of zzso zzso From a clinical point of view, zzso may serve as zzso for disease status and may be found useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting zzso zzso
