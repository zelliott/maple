The term zzso zzso describes a process that results in the specific degradation of an zzso zzso In plants, silenced zzso can initiate the spreading of the process into zzso regions by a mobile signal that can be transmitted over long zzso In the present work, we made use of a modified zzso approach to zzso the driving force behind long-distance transport of the zzso zzso We made zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso lines, the zzso line zzso zzso and the silenced line zzso zzso We show that the direction of systemic spread of zzso from zzso to sensor can be manipulated by altering zzso relations in the zzso Using radioactive zzso as a zzso zzso we demonstrated that plants that transmitted zzso from silenced scion to zzso rootstock had developed a zzso zzso flow from scion to zzso These data provide experimental proof of what has been hypothesized so far, that the zzso signal travels via zzso from source to zzso We present here evidence that the appearance of systemic zzso is not an accidental zzso process, but can be predicted on the basis of the direction of zzso zzso
