We have investigated the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the response of the liver to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are activated but the duration and magnitude of the increase in their activities appear to be zzso zzso zzso is more marked but shorter than that of zzso The increase observed in the zzso content of the 52 zzso zzso zzso accompanied by an increased amount of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso provide evidence of the involvement of a zzso pathway, with a time course that is similar to that of zzso zzso The treatment of rats with zzso zzso zzso modified all of the described effects, suggesting that zzso plays a role in the response of the liver to zzso
