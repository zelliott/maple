zzso zzso in zzso root zzso zzso are highly zzso in terms of cell size, protein zzso and signaling zzso To analyze their zzso zzso methods are commonly used, which often yield highly variable results due to the zzso of the individual zzso In this work, we introduce a zzso analysis approach for sparse and highly zzso zzso obtained from cultures of sensory zzso This approach is based on population estimates and completely free of zzso zzso With a quantitative automated microscope we measured the signaling state of single zzso zzso by zzso labeling zzso zzso activated zzso The population density of sensory zzso with and without zzso nerve growth factor zzso treatment was estimated using a kernel density zzso zzso By zzso of both zzso and integration of the positive part, a robust estimate for the size of the responsive zzso was zzso To assure sufficiently large zzso we determined the number of cells required for reliable estimates using a zzso zzso The proposed methods were employed to analyze response zzso and response zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso We thereby determined the portion of zzso responsive cells on a true population zzso The analysis of the dose dependent zzso response unraveled a zzso behavior, while the study of its time dependence showed a rapid response, which approached a steady state after less than five zzso zzso two zzso zzso we found that not only the number of responsive zzso zzso exceeds the number of responsive zzso zzso is commonly reported and could be explained by the excess of zzso zzso also the probability that zzso cells respond to zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso showed a larger response zzso in their mean zzso zzso
