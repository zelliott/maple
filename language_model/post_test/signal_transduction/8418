It is unclear if the rat zzso zzso the same rapid reductions in protein content that are classically observed in zzso skeletal muscle during zzso 

To investigate this further, and to determine if there is any divergence in the response of skeletal muscle and zzso in the mechanisms that are thought to be largely responsible for zzso changes in protein content, Sprague zzso rats were implanted with vascular zzso and administered zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 2 zzso 6 h or 24 h zzso administered control animals were also zzso after which the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were removed under terminal zzso The zzso ratio, a marker of protein content, was significantly reduced in the zzso following 24 h zzso administration zzso zzso but was no different from controls in the zzso At the same time point, a significant increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso controls, zzso zzso in addition to protein levels of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were observed in zzso but not zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with an zzso in translation zzso were seen exclusively in the zzso of zzso zzso 

In zzso these findings suggest that the zzso does not undergo the same zzso response as skeletal muscle during early zzso partly due to the absence of zzso and zzso events in the zzso typically associated with increased muscle zzso and the suppression of protein zzso
