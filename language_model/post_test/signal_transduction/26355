zzso proteins can have multiple effects on host cell zzso Human respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a good example of zzso During the virus life cycle, zzso can act as an zzso of host type I and III zzso production and zzso inhibit zzso suppress zzso cell zzso control protein stability, and regulate zzso of host cell zzso among other zzso It is likely that zzso performs these different roles through interactions with multiple host cell zzso To investigate this and identify cellular proteins that could interact with zzso we used quantitative zzso in combination with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis identified 221 proteins that were potentially part of complexes that could interact with zzso with many of these associated with zzso regulation as part of the zzso complex, cell cycle regulation, and other functions previously assigned to zzso zzso zzso using the zzso trap was used to confirm the ability of selected cellular proteins to interact individually with zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso viruses deficient in the expression of zzso and zzso analysis both demonstrated that zzso was necessary and sufficient for the enrichment of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso
