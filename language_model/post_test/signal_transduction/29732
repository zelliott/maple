Exposure of pregnant mice to zzso zzso zzso a spectrum of tumors, including zzso zzso zzso in their adult offspring similar to that induced by exposing adult mice to zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso exposure in zzso causes altered zzso zzso we examined expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 (an zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso genes (with sexually zzso liver expression zzso in zzso from adult male mice with in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction was used to evaluate gene expression in zzso of adult male mice that had zzso exposed zzso zzso zzso 8) or had not zzso control zzso zzso zzso 5) been exposed to zzso in zzso DNA zzso status of portions of the zzso and zzso D1 gene promoters in liver tissue was measured using zzso zzso chain zzso zzso tests were zzso 

zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso higher in zzso of exposed mice than in those of control mice, and zzso D1 levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso mice showed a zzso expression pattern of several zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso genes at zzso and zzso times, respectively, the level in control mice and expressing the zzso zzso at approximately zzso the level in control zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited reduced (by approximately zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter in liver DNA as compared with control zzso the zzso D1 gene promoter was not zzso in either exposed or control zzso 

zzso zzso signaling may play a role in induction of zzso by zzso exposure in zzso Specifically, zzso of zzso potentially through promoter region zzso in zzso of such mice may be linked to the zzso of zzso
