Heart valve zzso are one of the most common types of birth zzso illustrating the complex nature of valve zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling is one zzso implicated in valve formation, however its specific spatial and zzso roles remain poorly zzso To decipher these contributions, we use two zzso dominant negative approaches in mice to disrupt zzso signaling at different stages of zzso At an early step in valve development, zzso signals are required for the full transformation of zzso cells to zzso cells zzso at the zzso tract zzso but not zzso canal zzso zzso zzso This role likely involves signaling zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso which is highly expressed in early cushion zzso before becoming zzso after zzso In contrast, zzso does not exhibit robust cushion zzso expression until after zzso is zzso At this point, zzso signaling acts through zzso to direct the zzso of the zzso cushions into mature, zzso valve zzso This latter role of zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso roles in the developing valves are zzso transitioning from a differentiation role directed by zzso in the zzso to a zzso role through zzso primarily in the zzso zzso
