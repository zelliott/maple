Recent studies demonstrate that zzso oxygen species zzso are important zzso of acute zzso whether induced zzso or in zzso zzso in zzso however, the cellular processes involved remain zzso zzso protein zzso plays a central role for convergence of cellular signals from different zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein complexes, raising the possibility it can be important in the zzso cell responses to zzso zzso our aim was to investigate whether zzso signaling is involved in the biological response of rat pancreatic zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of isolated rat pancreatic zzso with zzso rapidly stimulates zzso zzso measured as zzso mobility shift and by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso the higher zzso state, demonstrating that it occurs mainly in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso showing zzso effect with 3 zzso zzso at 5 zzso The zzso pathways induced by zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso do not involve zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso generation clearly promotes the formation of protein complex zzso In conclusion, zzso clearly affect the key adapter protein zzso signaling by two ways: stimulation of zzso zzso and a functional zzso formation of zzso zzso Because of its central role in zzso more zzso zzso zzso might likely play an important role in the ability of zzso to induce pancreatic cellular injury and zzso
