Two zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso specifically targeted to the zzso zzso zzso were used in parallel to investigate free zzso zzso in the zzso of this zzso Here we show that, although zzso and zzso distributed in the zzso system, as revealed by both zzso and functional evidence, the two zzso measured apparently very different zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso Our data demonstrate that this contradiction is due to the zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Because of the characteristics of the zzso procedure used to convert zzso zzso into zzso zzso the zzso values obtained at steady state zzso in fact, to reflect not the average zzso values, but those of one or more zzso with lower zzso These zzso are not generated zzso during the experiments, as revealed by the dynamic analysis of the zzso structure in living cells carried out by means of an zzso green fluorescent zzso When the problem of zzso zzso was taken into account (and when zzso was used as a zzso zzso the bulk of the zzso was shown to accumulate free zzso up to a steady state in the zzso zzso A theoretical model, based on the existence of multiple zzso zzso of high and low zzso that closely mimics the experimental data obtained in zzso cells during zzso of either zzso or zzso is zzso Moreover, a few other key problems concerning the zzso zzso zzso have been addressed with the following zzso zzso the changes induced in the zzso zzso by zzso generation of zzso vary depending on their initial zzso In the bulk of the system there is a rapid release whereas in the small zzso with low zzso the zzso is simultaneously zzso zzso stimulation of zzso release by zzso zzso is inhibited when the zzso level is below a zzso suggesting a regulation by zzso of the zzso zzso activity (such a phenomenon had already been reported, however, but only in zzso zzso analyzed in zzso and zzso the maintenance of a relatively constant level of zzso zzso observed when the cells are incubated in zzso zzso depends on the continuous release of the zzso from the zzso with ensuing zzso in the plasma membrane of the channels thereby regulated zzso zzso
