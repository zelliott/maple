zzso zzso around the time of conception is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance in zzso We determined the effect of maternal zzso in the zzso period zzso zzso 60 days prior to 6 days after zzso and the zzso period zzso zzso zzso days after zzso on zzso expression and protein abundance of key zzso molecules as well as the global zzso expression in zzso muscle of singleton and twin fetal sheep in late zzso In singleton zzso exposure to zzso resulted in lower protein abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle compared to zzso In zzso zzso there was a higher protein abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso In zzso zzso resulted in higher protein abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso also resulted in higher protein abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in fetal muscle compared to zzso There were specific patterns of the types and direction of changes in the expression of 22 zzso in skeletal muscle after exposure to zzso or zzso and clear differences in these patterns between singleton and twin zzso These findings provide evidence that maternal zzso around the time of conception zzso changes in the expression of zzso which may play a role in altering the abundance of the key zzso molecules in skeletal muscle and in the association between zzso zzso and insulin resistance in adult zzso
