Transport of zzso and zzso of zzso across vascular zzso are regulated by a tight molecular zzso but the mechanisms by which these two inflammatory events are zzso controlled in time and magnitude during zzso zzso wounding remain zzso A real-time zzso imaging technique was developed to simultaneously track influx of Alexa zzso zzso and genetically zzso enhanced green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso within the wound zzso zzso zzso increased approximately zzso more rapidly than the rate of zzso influx, reaching a maximum at 12 zzso on the order of approximately zzso per minute versus approximately zzso per minute for zzso influx, which peaked at 18 zzso zzso depletion of zzso with zzso blocked their zzso to the wound but did not alter the increase in vascular zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso zzso decreased zzso by zzso and zzso influx by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso at 24 h zzso was completely inhibited by blocking zzso zzso whereas less zzso was observed at 1 h and zzso influx was not zzso These data suggest that in zzso wounds, the zzso maintains a tight zzso barrier to protein leakage that is independent of zzso zzso partially dependent on circulating zzso and associated with zzso zzso
