Liver wound healing is an integrated process in which zzso zzso cells play a major zzso We hypothesized that the zzso signaling protein zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso signals from the zzso zzso to zzso cells and thus plays a critical role in zzso cell zzso and zzso during liver zzso Liver injury and subsequent zzso cell zzso led to a zzso increase in zzso expression and increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso in isolated zzso cells led to enhanced zzso and zzso as well as increases in smooth muscle zzso and type I collagen zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso were zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso led to increases in type I zzso smooth muscle zzso transforming growth zzso and extra domain A zzso zzso zzso (by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, p zzso zzso for each versus the zzso whereas zzso of zzso in zzso led to significant reductions in these zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso led to a zzso increase in liver collagen content zzso zzso 8, p zzso zzso versus the zzso in contrast zzso zzso in zzso led to a significant reduction in zzso We conclude that zzso plays an important zzso role in zzso in liver wound zzso
