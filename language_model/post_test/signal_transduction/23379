zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso to plasma membrane zzso and zzso zzso Here, we examined zzso control of zzso zzso and zzso Wild type and zzso active zzso decreased zzso PM levels while increasing its zzso zzso zzso however, did not appreciably affect the PM zzso or function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso compartments suggesting zzso zzso through PM recycling or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity promoted zzso association, whereas zzso zzso trapped zzso in late zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to zzso with an zzso pool marked by zzso the protein that mediates zzso of proteins to the zzso The zzso zzso in zzso appeared important for its zzso trafficking to the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso PM levels and increased the number of zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity decreased zzso function as an inhibitor of zzso activity without affecting zzso and function of the zzso signaling zzso Thus, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso function in a manner that is independent from their effects on the zzso and function of the zzso signaling zzso This is the first study to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso trafficking of an zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be novel molecular targets for the selective regulation of zzso signaling via their specific effects on zzso trafficking and zzso
