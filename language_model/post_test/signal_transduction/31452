zzso zzso signals have been implicated in multiple events during early zzso including primary axis formation, neural crest zzso and zzso patterning of the neural zzso The mechanisms by which zzso signals can direct distinct fates in cell types that are closely linked both temporally and zzso remains poorly zzso However, recent work has suggested that the downstream zzso zzso of this pathway, zzso family DNA binding zzso may zzso distinct outcomes on these signals in some cellular zzso In this study, we first examined whether zzso zzso of zzso and zzso might block distinct zzso signaling events during the diversification of cell fates in the early embryonic zzso We found that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocks neural crest formation, whereas an analogous zzso of zzso does not, and that the difference in activity mapped to the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso also blocked expression of markers of zzso cell types, including cement zzso and sensory zzso indicating that zzso signals are required for zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso we also found that blocking zzso zzso signals in the zzso using the zzso zzso zzso or by other means, dramatically expanded the size of the neural plate, as evidenced by the increased expression of early zzso markers such as zzso and zzso zzso we find that zzso of zzso zzso signals interferes with the induction of the neural plate, and this activity can be separated zzso from zzso neural crest zzso Together these findings provide important and novel insights into the role of zzso zzso signals during the patterning of zzso zzso and indicate that zzso zzso plays a central role in the process of neural zzso
