We have evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso generation plays a role in the burst of hormone zzso caused by zzso zzso in zzso and normal zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso However, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of the medium partially blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso generation and completely blocked stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso High levels of zzso in medium inhibited zzso zzso generation, while zzso hormone zzso enhanced zzso Our results indicate that in both zzso and normal zzso cells, zzso is not a regulatory factor for hormone zzso induced by zzso
