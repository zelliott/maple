In many zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso are closely distributed on the zzso zzso However, the functional significance of the close distribution of the two types of zzso receptors has not been fully zzso In this study, we examined the functional interaction between zzso and zzso at parallel fiber zzso zzso cell zzso in the generation of zzso zzso zzso a key second zzso that regulates many important cellular zzso We zzso local zzso dynamics in zzso cells using the green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso domain zzso as a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso laser scanning zzso zzso of zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso attributable to an increase in zzso concentration was observed on zzso stimulation in fine zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso zzso production was blocked not only by the group I zzso zzso but also by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso production was blocked by either the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso by zzso These results show that zzso production is zzso zzso by group I zzso and zzso through zzso zzso and zzso influx at zzso zzso cell zzso identifying the robust cross talk between zzso and zzso for the generation of zzso zzso
