The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to activate natural zzso zzso responses by enhancing the capability of cells to cope with various zzso zzso It exerts its effect in zzso with low levels of stress to induce the synthesis of members of major stress protein zzso We show here that the presence of zzso does not influence protein zzso in the zzso zzso and its derivatives selectively interact with zzso lipids and zzso their zzso and dynamic zzso zzso acts as a membrane zzso at normal temperature, but it is a highly efficient membrane zzso zzso the zzso phase transitions during severe heat zzso We suggest that zzso and the related compounds modify those zzso of membrane lipids where the zzso or chemically induced zzso of zzso phase is sensed and zzso into a cellular zzso leading to enhanced zzso of heat shock zzso zzso may be a zzso for clinically safe zzso drug candidates that rebalance the level and composition of heat shock zzso
