zzso zzso is a zzso hormone that zzso insulin zzso in zzso by zzso its zzso zzso Our previous work indicated that a zzso of zzso coupled to SS receptors can activate zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) zzso zzso 67, zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated the presence of zzso factor zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also determined that the zzso of zzso was zzso through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppression of zzso levels using zzso both abolished zzso zzso zzso while zzso of wild type zzso further enhanced this zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso failed to reduce zzso zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso but not zzso or zzso mediates the effect of zzso We further determined the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso a zzso previously thought to be found predominantly in the brain, in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Using Northern and Western zzso zzso both zzso and protein of zzso were found in these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and suppression of zzso levels using zzso both abolished zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso failed to reduce zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso another zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that SS signals through zzso to activate zzso zzso
