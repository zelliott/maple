It has been suggested that zzso protein zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso To exert their zzso effects, zzso must recruit immune zzso mechanisms such as zzso of the complement zzso Mouse models of zzso have shown that, surprisingly, zzso zzso activate the alternative zzso of complement rather than the expected classical zzso This study was undertaken to investigate whether human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activate the complement system in zzso and, if so, which pathways of complement zzso are zzso 

We set up novel zzso to analyze complement zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso plates, specific zzso and normal and zzso zzso as a source of zzso 

zzso zzso activated complement in a zzso manner via the classical zzso of complement, and, surprisingly, via the alternative zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was not activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso proceeded in zzso up to the formation of the membrane attack complex, indicating that all zzso steps, including the release of zzso took zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso activate the complement system in zzso via the classical and alternative pathways but not via the zzso zzso These findings are relevant for the design of interventions aimed at zzso of zzso damage in zzso
