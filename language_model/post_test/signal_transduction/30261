zzso of the zzso zzso requires zzso signaling between the nerve and zzso Although much is known on zzso signals onto the muscle, less is known of signals important for zzso maturation of the nerve zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a signal in motor zzso zzso that contribute to motor zzso survival and zzso maturation at zzso zzso zzso is localized specifically to the zzso membrane with its zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in skeletal muscle zzso Lack of zzso zzso in zzso motor zzso results in a zzso deficit of maturation and specialization of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso adult zzso motor zzso is zzso but despite contact with the unaffected zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal maturation is severely compromised in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso a signal in motor nerve terminals that participate in the organization and maturation of zzso zzso during development and during zzso in the zzso
