G zzso zzso signaling is zzso regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms, which rapidly zzso signals zzso by zzso zzso causing zzso The individual contributions of these mechanisms, however, are poorly zzso Here, we use an improved fluorescent zzso for zzso to measure second zzso dynamics zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in living zzso zzso stimulation with zzso results in a transient pulse of zzso reaching a zzso concentration of approximately 10 zzso and zzso for less than 5 zzso We investigated the contributions of zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the regulation of zzso signal zzso by using small zzso zzso small interfering zzso and mouse embryonic zzso We found that the zzso response is restricted in duration by two distinct mechanisms in zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induction of zzso metabolism by zzso A mathematical model of zzso signal zzso fit to these data, revealed that direct zzso zzso by zzso zzso is insignificant but that zzso zzso is rapid and profound, occurring with a zzso of 70 zzso This quantitative system analysis represents an important advance toward zzso mechanisms contributing to the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
