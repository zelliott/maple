The longevity regulator zzso is an zzso catalyzing the zzso of protein zzso in turn modulating their biological zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso evokes cellular zzso In aged zzso zzso expression and activity is zzso which contributes to the development of zzso and abnormal vascular zzso A recent study suggests that zzso zzso 5 zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso at the zzso 47 zzso This modification blocks the zzso activity of zzso and plays a critical role in the zzso function during vascular zzso Thus, by zzso zzso zzso function can be improved, in turn preventing the development of zzso and slowing down the process of vascular zzso
