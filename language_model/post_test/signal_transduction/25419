The zzso states of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control the mechanisms behind nearly all cellular zzso zzso not surprisingly, recent findings have shown that zzso in these zzso pathways play a central role in the development and progression of many disease zzso This review provides a brief summary of the function and activity of various zzso mechanisms, outlines some of the major zzso signaling zzso and describes the role of these zzso mechanisms in intensive care zzso 

This article will comprise a comprehensive review of the literature in the context of intensive care zzso Specifically, we will discuss the involvement of zzso in the zzso diagnosis, and treatment of heart failure, zzso zzso stroke, respiratory failure, zzso lung injury, traumatic brain injury, acute organ failure, systemic zzso and zzso 

zzso mechanisms clearly play an important role in many zzso and treatment strategies of intensive care and therefore further understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel therapies and improved patient zzso
