Bone zzso protein zzso signaling zzso plays important roles in urinary tract development although the detailed regulation of its activity in this process remains zzso Here we report that zzso 1 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in developing zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Mouse zzso carrying disrupted zzso gene displayed prominent zzso arising from zzso segment and zzso junction zzso These defects were associated with significant reduction in zzso zzso cell proliferation at zzso and zzso as well as absence of zzso zzso zzso cells in the urinary tract at zzso and zzso At the molecular level, increased zzso signaling was found in zzso deficient zzso indicated by elevated zzso zzso In zzso study also indicated that zzso can directly bind to zzso which is specifically expressed in zzso zzso cells in developing zzso Furthermore, Sonic zzso zzso zzso which is crucial for differentiation of zzso zzso cell zzso was also impaired in zzso zzso Altogether, our data suggest that zzso is essential in maintaining normal zzso development by zzso zzso zzso
