Here, we investigated the possible involvement of zzso acid B1 zzso zzso in zzso the protective effects of black soybean zzso against zzso zzso in prenatal zzso zzso because zzso are known to play an important role in the development of central nervous zzso zzso were performed on primary cultures of prenatal rat zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso small interfering zzso zzso The results showed that, when ethanol treatment was followed by zzso treatment, cellular levels of zzso proteins such as zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were zzso and the cellular level of the zzso protein zzso was increased compared to treatment with ethanol zzso Furthermore, the effects of ethanol on cellular levels of zzso and its downstream signaling molecules such as protein zzso A, zzso protein zzso II zzso and zzso zzso response element binding protein were diminished or reversed by zzso zzso The ability of zzso to reverse the effects of ethanol on cellular levels of zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in cells zzso with zzso zzso In a zzso manner, zzso also inhibited the ability of ethanol to elevate zzso free zzso level and increase the proportion of cells with low zzso membrane potential in the zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso studies also confirmed the zzso effect of zzso against ethanol via zzso Our data suggest that zzso plays an important role in the zzso effects of zzso against zzso
