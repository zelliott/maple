The neural cell zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the development of the nervous system, promoting zzso differentiation via zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling has been shown to affect and be dependent on the zzso zzso concentration zzso However, the molecular basis of this remains zzso In this study, we determined zzso regulating mechanisms involved in zzso signaling induced by zzso To mimic the effect of zzso zzso interaction on zzso in zzso we used a zzso derived from a zzso binding site of zzso termed zzso which triggers signaling zzso similar to those activated by zzso zzso We found that zzso increased zzso in primary zzso zzso This effect depended on two signaling zzso The first zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and production of zzso and the second zzso involved zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso entry required zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These channels, together with the zzso zzso were also involved in zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, unanticipated mechanisms of zzso zzso are shown to be activated by zzso and to contribute to zzso zzso
