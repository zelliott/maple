We investigated the ability of testosterone zzso to restore differentiation in multiple population doubled zzso zzso zzso previously shown to have a reduced differentiation in zzso and zzso skeletal muscle cultures zzso their parental controls zzso zzso et zzso 2011, 2012 zzso zzso were exposed to low serum conditions in the presence or absence of T zzso inhibitor zzso for zzso and 7 days zzso and late muscle differentiation zzso zzso analyses were performed to determine zzso number, diameter zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of differentiation and zzso zzso Changes in gene expression for zzso zzso and myostatin were also zzso zzso diameter in zzso and zzso cells increased from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso respectively after zzso of T zzso The increase was comparable in both zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso suggesting a similar intrinsic ability to respond to zzso T zzso T treatment also significantly increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressing zzso zzso in both cell types after 7 days exposure zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso in the presence of T attenuated these effects in zzso zzso (in both cell zzso suggesting a role for the zzso zzso in T zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso showed reduced responsiveness to T zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso cells and T also reduced myostatin expression in zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates testosterone administration improves zzso in zzso that zzso display impaired differentiation and zzso capacity zzso their parental controls, the action of testosterone in this model was zzso by zzso zzso
