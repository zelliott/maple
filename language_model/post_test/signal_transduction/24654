zzso zzso C zzso has been shown to be involved in the zzso response and in zzso cell transformation in many experimental zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso in both highly zzso zzso T cells freshly isolated from adult zzso leukemia zzso patients and control T zzso obtained from healthy zzso zzso activity was decreased in the ATL cells as compared with the control T zzso zzso zzso activity in the ATL cells was remarkably zzso whereas particulate membrane zzso activity was similar to the control zzso The percentage of zzso activity in the particulate fraction was zzso in the ATL cells and zzso in the control zzso Regarding the altered zzso zzso of zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was inhibited in some ATL zzso zzso to the decrease in zzso activity, there was a decrease in the expression of the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso in ATL zzso These results suggest impaired regulation of zzso expression in ATL as well as in many experimental zzso
