An unresolved question regarding the zzso of zzso C virus zzso infection is the remarkable efficiency with which host defenses are neutralized to establish chronic zzso zzso of an zzso response is one strategy used by viruses to escape immune zzso We previously showed that zzso proteins zzso expression of zzso zzso interacting domain zzso in zzso of zzso transgenic zzso As a consequence, cells acquire resistance to zzso zzso which in turn leads to increased persistence of experimental viral infections in zzso This mechanism might participate in the establishment of chronic infections and the resulting zzso including zzso zzso We now report that Bid is also zzso in patients in the context of zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso viral protein zzso is sufficient to activate a zzso zzso zzso leading to degradation of zzso Moreover, pharmacological zzso of zzso restore both the zzso levels of Bid and the sensitivity of cells toward a death zzso zzso zzso Finally, human zzso tumors and zzso from zzso transgenic mice that display low Bid expression contain activated zzso 

zzso activated by zzso proteins degrade Bid and thus dampen zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could lead to an improved efficiency of zzso elimination of zzso zzso
