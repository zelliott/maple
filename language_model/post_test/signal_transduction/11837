The zzso zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in the zzso defense against zzso During the last two decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the components and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathway, including the means of bacterial sensing and signal zzso While these findings have contributed to the understanding of the immune signaling in insects, they have also provided new insights in studying the zzso zzso signaling zzso Here, we zzso the current view of the zzso zzso focusing on how it regulates the zzso immune response of zzso
