To assess the role of insulin action and inaction in the liver, immortalized zzso cell lines have been generated from insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using this model, we have recently demonstrated that the lack of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in insulin zzso In the current study, we show that immortalized zzso zzso undergo zzso on serum withdrawal, with zzso zzso and DNA zzso occurring earlier in the absence of zzso zzso rescued zzso zzso from serum zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation in a zzso manner, but it failed to rescue zzso lacking zzso In zzso cells, insulin failed to zzso zzso Furthermore, in these cells, insulin was unable to zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso infection of zzso cells with zzso active zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso activities, zzso gene zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso negative zzso regulated the whole zzso in an opposite zzso zzso insulin treatment (24 zzso increased expression of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and nuclear zzso and decreased zzso activity in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restored zzso and zzso gene zzso and decreased zzso activity in response to insulin, thereby blocking zzso In conclusion, zzso signaling is specifically required through zzso generation to mediate the survival effects of zzso zzso growth factor, via zzso zzso was able to rescue zzso zzso from serum zzso zzso modulating zzso and zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso
