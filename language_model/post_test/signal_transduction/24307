zzso are a class of intrinsic membrane receptors for zzso zzso zzso In the central nervous system, zzso and their zzso influence zzso growth and synaptic function, but relatively little is known about their potential to regulate intrinsic zzso To explore this area, we examined the effects of zzso components on zzso currents in developing mouse zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso We tested the effects of three zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso in late embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured in zzso medium were exposed to zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso for zzso days, and zzso zzso currents were recorded from zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the three zzso zzso only zzso affected zzso zzso selectively increasing the zzso of the zzso zzso current zzso or zzso by about 75 % over control levels, and its density zzso per unit zzso by about 40 % zzso after 3 day zzso from embryonic day zzso Other zzso currents were zzso except to the extent that membrane area was zzso The actions of zzso were sensitive to zzso zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso as zzso zzso The kinetic properties of zzso including the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso rate and the rate of recovery from zzso were minimally affected by zzso and were consistent with enhanced functional expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also suggested a preferential increase in zzso levels, with lesser effects on zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can selectively regulate zzso and together with other observations suggest that zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and their zzso occurs zzso
