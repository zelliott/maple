The zzso zzso of low molecular weight zzso is made of five major families zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso highly zzso across zzso This is in keeping with their roles in basic cellular functions zzso zzso trafficking, zzso trafficking, cell zzso proliferation and zzso gene regulation, zzso zzso whose zzso are associated with various types of diseases, in particular cancer, zzso zzso and infectious zzso For these reasons, zzso pathways are of great potential in zzso and identifying zzso that decrease signaling activity is under intense zzso Along this line, zzso exchange factors zzso represent attractive zzso zzso are proteins that promote the active zzso state of zzso and represent the major entry points zzso zzso cues are converted into zzso zzso We previously developed the zzso exchange zzso zzso an experimental setup in the zzso in which activity of a zzso zzso can be monitored by zzso and color reporter zzso This zzso was further engineered for zzso screening of zzso zzso which can readily select for zzso and specific zzso We report here on the successful identification of zzso against zzso and zzso members, zzso for zzso zzso and on the experimental setup to screen for zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso We also discuss on zzso developed using virtual screening zzso which target the zzso interface with high efficacy and zzso We propose that using VS and zzso in combination may represent a method of choice for identifying specific and zzso zzso zzso
