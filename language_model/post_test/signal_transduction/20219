zzso vascular cell zzso is a seminal early event in diabetic zzso zzso zzso is known to increase zzso zzso free calcium zzso in retinal vascular zzso cells zzso suggesting that zzso is a critical trigger for zzso zzso This study aims to zzso zzso signaling mechanisms that mediate zzso zzso in zzso 

A cultured zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso was incubated in normal zzso zzso zzso plus the zzso entry blocker zzso zzso zzso high zzso zzso or zzso plus either zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso protein zzso II zzso inhibitor zzso Changes in zzso evoked by zzso zzso zzso were measured in zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso The zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso were assessed by flow zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the death zzso zzso and zzso c were detected by western zzso zzso 

zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso entry as well as zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and both responses were partially blocked by zzso and zzso while the zzso inhibitor zzso partially reduced zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso and triggered the release of zzso zzso zzso These early signs of zzso zzso were partially reversed by zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso cells depends on zzso entry and zzso zzso leading to the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso of zzso
