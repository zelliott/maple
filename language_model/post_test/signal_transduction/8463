zzso genes are zzso factors that control zzso zzso and zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso genes play a role in zzso cancer zzso however few studies have defined functional roles and mechanisms of zzso We showed previously that zzso expression is increased in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso suppressed cell migration suggesting that elevated zzso expression in invasive tumors constitutes a zzso zzso In the present study, we used zzso and zzso in multiple cell lines to define the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased migration, but not zzso invasion, of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased cell spreading on plastic or zzso reduced zzso zzso and increased zzso in two- and three-dimensional zzso These changes were not associated with significant changes in zzso or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso However, zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso protein levels within cell colonies and cell zzso but not of single, zzso zzso It had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells suppressed zzso migration and increased zzso zzso protein zzso Our results confirm that zzso zzso cell zzso show that it suppresses cell spreading and zzso formation while enhancing zzso zzso and suggest a role for zzso zzso in zzso these zzso These observations support the hypothesis that zzso of zzso in invasive zzso tumors is a zzso zzso zzso
