To structurally characterize the activated state of the zzso zzso signal zzso protein zzso we have constructed an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso point zzso and determined its three-dimensional structure at zzso A zzso We have also characterized this analogue with high-resolution zzso and studied its binding to a zzso derived from zzso zzso target component of the zzso zzso The chemically modified zzso zzso exhibits many of the chemical properties of zzso zzso zzso except that it is indefinitely zzso zzso density for the zzso substitution is clear and readily zzso omit refinement density at the zzso atom is greater than zzso The zzso shows a number of localized zzso changes that are believed to constitute the zzso zzso zzso The most obvious of these changes include movement of the side chain of the active site base, zzso zzso and a predominately buried zzso of the side chain of zzso zzso In addition, there are a number of more subtle changes more distant from the active site involving the zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with our previous structural interpretations of other zzso zzso zzso and with our earlier hypotheses concerning zzso zzso through propagation of structural changes away from the active zzso
