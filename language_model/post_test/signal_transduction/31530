In tissue development, zzso signaling often zzso across cells, carrying and delivering zzso and spatial information for cells to make correct zzso zzso complex and accurate tissue patterning indicates that signaling propagation via zzso interactions is precisely zzso It is important and interesting to reveal the possible control zzso The zzso of signaling in cells, which is a common issue for all zzso signaling zzso is a critical zzso To understand the propagation of zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells in the zzso a novel method is used to build a zzso model to simulate zzso zzso zzso reveals that the transient block of zzso by zzso induced zzso and the delayed removal of the block by another zzso induced protein zzso may explain the observed zzso propagation of zzso signaling in these zzso Both zzso in and zzso of zzso cause the same signaling profile in the zzso due to the inappropriate timing of zzso signaling block by zzso The reverse zzso signaling quickly develops into zzso signaling among cells, causing irregular expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in cells would change their response to the zzso information provided by the zzso zzso resulting in zzso and irregular zzso zzso As zzso signaling is highly zzso we zzso that the mechanism of controlling zzso propagation of signaling in cells by transient zzso block may exist in other zzso and in other zzso Our simulation results also suggest that zzso clock and zzso propagation may be inherently coupled in zzso zzso
