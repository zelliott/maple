In the present study we tested whether the forced expression of the zzso chain within zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso will result in a zzso activated zzso in human T zzso To this aim, a zzso zzso protein zzso containing the zzso part of human zzso chain fused to zzso zzso motif zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso human T zzso cell line and its zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain indeed predominantly targeted the zzso protein into zzso In zzso derived from zzso zzso cells, but not in those derived from the zzso zzso the zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso of a major zzso cell zzso zzso was diminished in the zzso However, the zzso did not exhibit any features of zzso activated T cells, and their responses to zzso treatment were very similar to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso expression of this form of zzso chain in zzso is not sufficient for zzso an activated state in the zzso zzso
