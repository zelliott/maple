The induction of zzso via surface zzso zzso in immature B cells requires de zzso zzso To investigate the regulation of zzso cell death zzso in B cells we used a cell line model consisting of an zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso which is highly sensitive, and a zzso which is resistant to zzso zzso zzso Resistance in this cell line was not due to zzso of zzso or functional impairment in signal zzso of the surface zzso zzso The zinc finger zzso factor zzso has been implicated to play an important role in zzso zzso in zzso T zzso We were able to demonstrate that surface zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso cells is associated with a zzso induction of zzso the human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and DNA binding activity in the nucleus could be readily observed by means of Northern zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso In contrast, the resistant clone zzso did not show any zzso expression upon zzso This suggests a role for zzso in zzso zzso of immature B zzso
