The guidance of zzso to their correct targets is a critical step in zzso The zzso zzso zzso presents an attractive system to study zzso zzso in the context of a developing zzso The zzso zzso contains relatively few cells and cell types, but each cell has a known lineage and stereotyped zzso zzso We found that extension of the zzso zzso zzso which spans the entire length of the zzso occurs in two distinct zzso The first zzso phase does not require genes that function in zzso extension zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the second zzso phase does use these genes and is guided in part by the adjacent zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso had incompletely zzso defects and appeared to act in conjunction with the zzso cell for zzso zzso Only zzso showed fully zzso defects for the zzso zzso zzso affecting classical zzso guidance cues zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso molecules zzso zzso had, at best, weak effects on the zzso zzso None of the zzso we tested affected the zzso phase of zzso zzso In a forward genetic screen, we isolated nine zzso in five zzso three of which are novel, showing defects in zzso including zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso One of these zzso appeared to affect the generation or differentiation of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso extension is a robust process that is not completely dependent on any single guidance zzso
