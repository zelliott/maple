zzso plays important roles in normal brain function and many zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are positively coupled to G zzso signaling to regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso of 32 zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, emerging evidence indicates that under zzso conditions, the protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling cascade may mediate zzso actions via zzso zzso This zzso signaling zzso involves the regulation of downstream synaptic targets, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus synaptic zzso Here we provide an overview of how this novel signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, particularly zzso zzso We discuss the relevance of the zzso signaling cascade for the expression of zzso behaviors and the drug actions associated with zzso zzso
