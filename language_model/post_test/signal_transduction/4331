The effects of ethanol on zzso zzso zzso in washed human zzso were studied in the presence and absence of sodium zzso zzso zzso oxide donor which stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso After 1 zzso exposure to 100 zzso zzso the level of zzso was approximately zzso that in zzso zzso Alcohol had no effect on zzso zzso but inhibited zzso zzso zzso at 17, 85 and 170 zzso In further experiments, zzso were incubated for 0, zzso 1 2 or 5 zzso with 10 zzso zzso with or without 100 zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso inhibitor and 85 zzso zzso In the presence of zzso but not alcohol, zzso levels rose zzso to zzso the zzso level at 5 zzso Without zzso zzso levels were lower and reached a plateau by 2 zzso zzso of zzso was attenuated by alcohol 2 and 5 zzso after zzso addition, both in zzso zzso and those without zzso Thus, alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso oxide zzso Its mechanism probably does not involve a major effect on zzso because the zzso was observed in the presence or absence of zzso We zzso that alcohol zzso zzso zzso contributing to its complex functional effects in zzso
