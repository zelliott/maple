The Rev protein is essential for the replication of zzso Rev is a shuttling protein that zzso zzso and partially spliced zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso via the zzso To transport these zzso the human zzso virus type 1 zzso Rev uses the zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso proteins that interact with the Rev nuclear zzso signal zzso and nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso Recently, we reported the presence of new types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso in the bovine zzso virus zzso Rev zzso Here we report the characterization of the nuclear import and export pathways of zzso zzso By using an in zzso nuclear import zzso we showed that zzso Rev is transported into the nucleus by a zzso and zzso zzso zzso classical zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that showed the binding of zzso Rev with zzso zzso and zzso were in agreement with those from the nuclear import zzso We also identified a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which indicates that the protein is exported via zzso like zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso Rev zzso maps between zzso acids 109 to 121 of the zzso zzso the zzso Rev zzso was found to be of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso type instead of the zzso Rev zzso In zzso our data showed that the nuclear import mechanism of zzso Rev is novel among Rev proteins characterized so far in zzso
