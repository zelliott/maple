Common variable zzso zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso poor zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the molecular cause of zzso we carried out zzso sequence analysis of a family diagnosed with zzso and identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso affecting the C zzso of zzso (also known as zzso or zzso zzso screening of zzso in 33 unrelated zzso individuals uncovered a second zzso nonsense zzso zzso zzso in one zzso zzso zzso individuals in both families presented with an unusual combination of zzso zzso with zzso infections, zzso features, and adrenal zzso zzso is the principal protein involved in the zzso zzso pathway, is zzso zzso and functions in peripheral zzso organ development, B cell development, and zzso zzso In addition, zzso mouse models demonstrate a zzso zzso with zzso and poor zzso response to zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso of transformed B cells from affected individuals show that the zzso zzso affect zzso and zzso processing of zzso and, ultimately, zzso nuclear zzso These findings describe zzso zzso in zzso and establish the zzso zzso signaling zzso as a genetic zzso for this primary zzso zzso
