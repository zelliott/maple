zzso zzso are key zzso involved in cell energy zzso zzso organisms have the largest number of zzso found in a single cell, zzso a major difference with the zzso zzso In this work we study an zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso protein harboring the putative zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso fused to zzso showed a strong zzso in the zzso The same result was obtained when the zzso zzso was added at the zzso of the zzso demonstrating that this signal is necessary and sufficient for targeting proteins to zzso When this zzso was removed from the zzso fusion zzso the zzso was zzso in the zzso The zzso signal could be used for targeting foreign proteins to the zzso This model also provides a useful tool to study zzso zzso zzso or number in living zzso in any stage of the life zzso
