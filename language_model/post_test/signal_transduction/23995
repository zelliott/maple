It is well known that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays major roles in the maintenance of zzso status and defense of zzso zzso zzso a small zzso zzso may send zzso message to the nucleus through downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings led us to investigate the effects of zzso and zzso a zzso scavenger, on zzso growth signal zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso increases the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso including zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso cell zzso On the contrary, zzso significantly suppresses zzso cell growth by zzso the increase of zzso and zzso Moreover, severe zzso of this transformed cell line occurred when the cell zzso balance between zzso and zzso was dramatically changed in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso That zzso cell zzso needs Ras to increase the zzso level was demonstrated by the zzso scavenger zzso It effectively blocked cell zzso but cell growth was also slowed without affecting Ras zzso Based on our studies, two approaches can be applied to treating zzso zzso One is utilizing zzso to suppress cancer cell zzso and the other is utilizing zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer cells with zzso and zzso stops cell growth as well as zzso Whether these cancer cells will undergo further zzso or become zzso merits zzso
