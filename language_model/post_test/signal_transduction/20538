zzso the mechanism of treatment failure of zzso signaling zzso for zzso zzso patients would provide insight into approaches to overcome therapeutic zzso In this study, we demonstrate that human zzso tumors failing zzso have an increase in the mean percentage of zzso cells compared to samples taken from patients failing zzso therapy containing zzso Likewise, in zzso zzso models of glioblastoma, the mean percentage of zzso cells in the zzso resistant to zzso therapy was markedly elevated relative to zzso Administration of the zzso inhibitor zzso alone and in combination with zzso reduced tumor zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the combination of zzso with zzso markedly reduced tumor volume, and zzso density, indicating that up regulation of the zzso zzso can mediate resistance to zzso therapy and zzso approaches may delay or overcome zzso
