The zzso drugs zzso and zzso A have an identical spectrum of activities with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from mast cells and T cell zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest a common step in zzso signal zzso leading to zzso and zzso and imply that zzso drugs target specific signal zzso zzso rather than specific cell zzso This hypothesis is supported by studies on the effect of zzso on zzso dependent proliferation of the zzso mast cell line zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells, achieving a plateau of zzso zzso at 1 zzso This zzso is prevented in a competitive manner by zzso a structural analogue of zzso zzso of rat zzso leukemia cells and zzso cells was also zzso at doses comparable to those shown previously to inhibit zzso proliferation of zzso T zzso line zzso zzso In contrast, proliferation of zzso cells, a zzso cell line, was not affected by zzso DNA zzso indicate that complexes formed between the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso It is concluded that zzso complexes may inhibit zzso signals emanating from zzso zzso resulting in growth arrest of zzso zzso zzso
