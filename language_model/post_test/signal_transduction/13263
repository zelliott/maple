When primary root zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso with 120 zzso diameter, strong zzso of root zzso and zzso were observed at the root zzso zzso of the cells that become the lower part of the root cap after zzso showed strong zzso of root zzso whereas zzso of the cells that become the upper part of the root cap after zzso did not show severe damage in either root zzso or root zzso Further analysis using smaller area zzso with 40 zzso diameter indicated that the greatest zzso of zzso occurred at the root tip and the next greatest zzso occurred in the cells in the lower part of the root zzso These results indicate not only that the root tip and zzso cells are the most sensitive sites for root gravity, but also that zzso of root gravity would go through the lower part of the cap cells after zzso
