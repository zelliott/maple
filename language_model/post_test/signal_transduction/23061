The zzso zzso zzso hormone stimulates zzso of two discrete pools of calcium in zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso A multidisciplinary approach was implemented to investigate the effects of discrete calcium fluctuations on the signaling pathways linking the zzso hormone zzso to zzso of zzso protein zzso and immediate early zzso zzso of calcium influx through zzso zzso calcium channels reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso was also observed in rat zzso cells in primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso calcium channels with the zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and induction of zzso However, simple zzso channel zzso did not produce a sufficient calcium zzso since zzso with 35 zzso zzso failed to induce zzso of zzso zzso of zzso calcium stores with zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of protein zzso C decreased calcium influx through zzso calcium channels and zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C did not block zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that calcium influx through zzso channels is required for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and that the influence of calcium lies downstream of protein zzso zzso
