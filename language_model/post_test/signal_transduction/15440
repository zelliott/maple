zzso is a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso and exerts certain effects on differentiation and zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso 

We used zzso cell line zzso zzso signal zzso of zzso was investigated with zzso zzso study, and zzso reporter zzso The effect of zzso on cell growth was examined with zzso cell viability zzso To determine the effect of zzso on zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso study of zzso zzso were zzso The effect of zzso on cell differentiation was examined with zzso and Western zzso 

zzso signal zzso of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso induced the expression of neural zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and protein zzso 

zzso is a specific gene in rod zzso development and is a gene indispensable to differentiation into rod zzso so the present results suggest that zzso affects the differentiation of zzso cells into rod zzso zzso
