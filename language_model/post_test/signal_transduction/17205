Besides focusing zzso zzso zzso activity on the cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso is able to bind zzso via a direct binding zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with other cell surface zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso triggering zzso pathways that promote tumor zzso The ability of zzso to coordinate binding and degradation of zzso zzso zzso and cell signaling makes it an attractive therapeutic target in zzso We used zzso virtual screening zzso to search for small molecules targeting the zzso site for zzso zzso compounds were identified and tested on zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso using the parental cell line zzso with the empty zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso 6 and 37 selectively inhibited zzso cell zzso to zzso and the resulting changes in cell zzso and signal zzso without exerting any effect on zzso zzso zzso 6 and 37 inhibited zzso cell binding to zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 and 37 targeted zzso and zzso key zzso for zzso binding to zzso but also for zzso interaction with the zzso family of zzso receptors zzso As a consequence, compounds 6 and 37 impaired zzso cell migration toward fetal calf serum zzso zzso and zzso likely by zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso the high affinity zzso Both compounds blocked in zzso zzso invasion of several cancer cell types, thus representing new promising leads for pharmaceuticals in zzso
