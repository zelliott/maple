Cellular transformation occurs only in cells that express both zzso and zzso zzso but not in cells expressing only one or the other of these zzso However, when both receptors are zzso and zzso they interact with virtually the same zzso proteins as when expressed zzso To reveal the underlying regulatory mechanism of the zzso network in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were evaluated in the presence of several zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso acid showed zzso zzso profiles for zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso isolated only from zzso cells could induce in zzso zzso for zzso this zzso zzso activity was abolished by zzso of the cells with zzso zzso Our study further showed that the zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso gamma and subsequent zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso which was specifically activated in the cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso total zzso activity within the cell and, therefore, can induce cellular zzso
