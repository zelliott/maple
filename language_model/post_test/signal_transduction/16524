Ras proteins are zzso zzso that couple cell surface receptors to zzso signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and zzso both in lower and higher zzso They act as molecular switches by cycling between active zzso and inactive zzso states, through the action of two classes of regulatory zzso a) zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and b) zzso zzso proteins zzso Genome wide analysis of the lower zzso zzso zzso revealed a surprisingly large number of Ras zzso zzso Exchange zzso zzso zzso promote the zzso of Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of zzso for zzso thus zzso to zzso the role of main zzso of Ras zzso Up to date only four zzso which are all zzso either for growth or development, have been characterized in zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a fifth zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso protein containing six zzso stretches, a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed during growth and zzso zzso of the gene results in cells that form small, flat zzso and fail to develop zzso zzso of genes required for zzso is zzso zzso towards zzso is impaired in the zzso due to inability to inhibit lateral zzso zzso zzso accumulates during early development to a much lower extent than in wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso is strongly reduced, by contrast zzso zzso is zzso to higher levels than in the wild zzso The zzso zzso response to zzso is also altered in the zzso zzso zzso pulsing for several hours partially zzso the zzso In zzso experiments suggest that zzso acts downstream of the zzso zzso but upstream of the G zzso 

The data indicate that zzso is involved in the establishment of the zzso relay zzso We propose that zzso is a component of a Ras regulated pathway, which integrate signals acting as positive regulator for zzso zzso and negative regulator for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with defective regulation of zzso zzso results in altered zzso
