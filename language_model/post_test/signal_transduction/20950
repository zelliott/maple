Members of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family signal largely through interactions with death domain proteins and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a novel zzso family member zzso Human and mouse zzso contain 283 and 276 zzso zzso respectively, making them the shortest known members of the zzso zzso The zzso is expressed mainly in zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and small zzso The zzso zzso of human and mouse zzso share only zzso identity, yet both interact with zzso and zzso This zzso interaction domain resides at the zzso 20 zzso zzso Like most other zzso zzso zzso of zzso activates the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso with zzso but not zzso results in synergistic zzso of zzso suggesting potentially different roles for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
