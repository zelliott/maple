The upstream zzso zzso element zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso expression through binding of zzso and its zzso partners defined in this zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso expression accompanied by decreased zzso binding to the zzso By contrast, stable zzso expression in zzso cells increased zzso zzso which was reduced by zzso zzso Moreover, a similar effect of zzso on zzso expression was observed in primary zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were subjected to mass zzso zzso major binding partners included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso demonstrated interaction of these proteins with zzso and in zzso zzso binding in zzso cells undergoing zzso differentiation which was correlated with zzso expression during zzso These results suggest zzso between zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein complex and expression of zzso during zzso zzso studies in zzso cells support zzso plays diverse roles in zzso and zzso zzso
