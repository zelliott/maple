The zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10) tumor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that plays a crucial role in regulating many cellular processes by zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso Although able to metabolize soluble zzso zzso in zzso the question of their significance as zzso zzso is zzso We show that zzso zzso are not regulated by wild type zzso but that a synthetic zzso zzso zzso previously thought to be inactive toward zzso can selectively regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso lowered zzso levels by zzso without zzso effect on zzso Although zzso zzso is a zzso levels of zzso zzso were not increased, whereas zzso zzso levels increased by zzso We have used zzso zzso to study the zzso function of zzso and have found that zzso does not zzso zzso zzso nor does it regulate zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent lowering of zzso are associated with reduced zzso colony formation and zzso proliferation in zzso zzso Our results, together with previously published data, suggest that zzso has a role in zzso
