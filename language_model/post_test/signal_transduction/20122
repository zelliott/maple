zzso is one of the most critical cellular signal zzso pathways known to malfunction in zzso cancer zzso As a target gene of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso can be quickly induced by zzso zzso stimulation but it then strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso functioning as a negative feedback regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or reduced expression of zzso are strongly correlated with zzso which therefore becomes a promising target for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso Huang zzso is a well-known traditional Chinese formula that was first prescribed by a royal physician 450 years ago in the zzso zzso It has been used in China and Southeast Asia for centuries as a folk remedy for various types of cancer including zzso However, the precise mechanism of its zzso activity remains largely zzso In the present study, we found that zzso could significantly and zzso inhibit zzso increase of zzso zzso levels and zzso activity in the human colon zzso zzso cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of zzso In addition, zzso treatment profoundly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso D1 and zzso two key target genes of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment increased the expression of zzso These results suggest that zzso could effectively inhibit proliferation and promote zzso of human colon zzso cells via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and its target zzso
