The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso cell zzso and zzso Pulmonary hypertension zzso is associated with reduced zzso zzso and zzso exposure regimens that cause zzso reduce zzso zzso This study examines mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and protein levels, zzso activity, and the expression of zzso genes in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso exposed to zzso oxygen for 72 zzso Similarly, exposure of mice to zzso zzso zzso for 3 weeks reduced zzso zzso and protein in mouse zzso zzso zzso with zzso or treatment with zzso directed against either zzso zzso or zzso attenuated hypoxic reductions in zzso expression and zzso Furthermore, degradation of zzso using zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting sustained zzso signaling and zzso expression in this zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso bind directly to each other in a mutually repressive zzso We conclude from these results that hypoxic regimens that promote zzso zzso and zzso proliferation reduce zzso expression and activity through zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms by which zzso stimuli such as zzso cause loss of zzso activity and pulmonary vascular cell zzso pulmonary vascular zzso and zzso These results also indicate that restoration of zzso activity with pharmacological zzso may provide a novel therapeutic approach in selected forms of zzso
