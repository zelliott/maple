The requirement of calcium zzso zzso entry for zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation is clearly zzso However, its role in the signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso is still zzso zzso zzso causes an increase in zzso activity and has been shown to directly zzso zzso channels unrelated to the well-known zzso zzso entry zzso zzso In our study, we have investigated the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells to further characterize second signals involved in the regulation of zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso entry, a phenomenon that was not restored by protein zzso C zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a rapid decrease of zzso zzso zzso concentration induced by zzso Both results suggest that zzso has an zzso effect, independent of zzso and zzso on the regulation of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso Our data establish that both zzso exert their effects through the regulation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso and led to a discernible activity of zzso upon zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that an additional zzso and/or zzso signal may act in zzso with zzso influx to trigger zzso zzso
