zzso stress and a high-fat diet are well-documented risk factors associated with the zzso system in the development of breast zzso The zzso II type 1 zzso zzso is a novel component of the zzso zzso Several recent studies have focused on the function of zzso in cell proliferation during cancer zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso II zzso zzso can promote proliferation of breast cancer via activated zzso the zzso of zzso may play an important role in promoting breast cancer growth, and zzso blocker zzso may suppress the promotional effect on proliferation by zzso zzso The expression level of zzso was found to be significantly zzso in breast cancer cells by zzso but no correlation between zzso expression and zzso expression was zzso The zzso cell line exhibited high expression of zzso zzso and we generated the zzso cell line using zzso zzso zzso and in particular zzso effectively inhibited the effects of zzso II on cell zzso cell cycle development and downstream zzso signaling events, including the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso also significantly altered zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso which was also influenced by activated zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be useful as a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy for treating breast zzso
