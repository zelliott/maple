Virtually all biological zzso on earth share the basic structure of a two-dimensional zzso Such zzso and zzso are comparable to those of the double zzso structure of DNA, strongly suggesting the possibility that the fundamental mechanisms for the various functions of the plasma membrane could essentially be understood by a set of simple organizing principles, developed during the course of zzso As an initial effort toward the development of such understanding, in this review, we present the concept of the cooperative action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso compartments zzso zzso zzso raft zzso zzso zzso and zzso dynamic protein complex zzso zzso Special attention is paid to the concept of zzso zzso where both zzso fluctuations and weak zzso play critical roles, and the zzso of the raft zzso to the zzso compartments as well as dynamic protein zzso The zzso zzso architecture of the plasma membrane provides an excellent perspective for understanding the membrane mechanisms of signal zzso
