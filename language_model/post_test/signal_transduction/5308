zzso of group I zzso zzso receptors zzso by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso normal zzso activity into prolonged zzso zzso The conversion is long lasting in that zzso zzso persist after zzso of the inducing zzso and serves as a model of zzso The group I zzso model of zzso took on special significance because zzso associated with fragile X syndrome zzso may be caused by excessive group I zzso zzso At present, the plasticity mechanism underlying the group I zzso zzso is zzso zzso a zzso zzso current activated by group I zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in the zzso is a possible zzso zzso zzso is associated with group I zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso to play a role in zzso long-term zzso of the current must occur after group I zzso zzso exposure or synaptic zzso We observed that zzso once induced by group I zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso cells, remained undiminished for hours after zzso zzso In slices prepared from zzso model mice, repeated stimulation of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced long-lasting zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similar to group I zzso prolonged zzso zzso persistent zzso was no longer observed in preparations zzso with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2, or of zzso protein zzso The results indicate that zzso is an intrinsic plasticity mechanism associated with group I zzso zzso
