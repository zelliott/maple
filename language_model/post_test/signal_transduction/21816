Work in zzso zzso produced the first molecular explanation for neural zzso the default model, where zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells changes fates from zzso to zzso This review covers the present status of our understanding of neural zzso with emphasis on zzso but including relevant facts in other model zzso While recent experiments have increased the complexity of the molecular picture, they have also provided additional support for the default model and the central position of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso between accumulated knowledge and technical progress will maintain zzso at the forefront of research in neural zzso
