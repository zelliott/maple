The pharmacological activity of zzso is primarily due to its zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the zzso involved in zzso zzso was presumably through zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the growth factor zzso bound zzso zzso son of zzso zzso Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the generation of zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso There is a negative feedback loop between zzso oxygen species zzso induction and zzso Then, we investigated the role of zzso in protecting cells against zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso and zzso generation activated zzso and zzso signaling zzso which were suppressed by zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso and zzso scavenger zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso evoked cell resistance to zzso via zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso generation in zzso zzso
