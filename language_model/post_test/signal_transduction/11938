Nuclear envelope links to inherited disease gave the conundrum of how zzso in zzso proteins can yield many distinct zzso each focused in different zzso One zzso hypothesis is that zzso partner proteins mediate these zzso Such partner proteins may have now been identified with recent zzso studies determining nuclear envelope composition in different zzso These studies revealed that the majority of the total nuclear envelope proteins are tissue restricted in their zzso Moreover, functions have been found for a number these zzso nuclear envelope proteins that fit with mechanisms proposed to explain how the nuclear envelope could mediate disease, including defects in mechanical stability, cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso organization, gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso The wide range of functions to which these proteins contribute is consistent with not only their involvement in zzso nuclear envelope disease zzso but also tissue zzso
