zzso acid zzso has been shown to regulate cellular growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including cells of the zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso cell line zzso which zzso to zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the regulation by zzso of genes in the scavenger zzso type B family zzso in human zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and flow zzso demonstrated that, like zzso and the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso gene expression in these zzso Moreover, zzso plus zzso further enhanced zzso protein and zzso levels over that seen with the zzso or zzso compounds zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to block completely zzso induction of zzso gene zzso but had little effect on the action of zzso Our data indicated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were each alone able to increase zzso zzso and surface protein zzso By using zzso C, a specific protein zzso C zzso zzso we demonstrated that induction of zzso by zzso as well as by zzso and zzso zzso were dependent upon zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso was not affected by zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso can zzso zzso expression in human zzso This regulation appears to be predominantly zzso through the zzso zzso of action and, unlike previously described methods of zzso zzso is independent of zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests a possible role for zzso in zzso processes involving the scavenger zzso function in cells of the zzso zzso
