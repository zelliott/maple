The regulation of zzso gene expression during T cell zzso and proliferation has been investigated in primary cultures of zzso human peripheral blood T zzso Prior results indicated that stimulation of T cells by zzso zzso plus zzso could induce zzso expression and T cell proliferation that was entirely resistant to zzso The present studies examined whether zzso zzso zzso expression by a unique zzso or merely acts at a point common to zzso proliferation but zzso to the effects of zzso The induction of zzso zzso gene expression required three signals provided by zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cells by optimal amounts of calcium zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso that was completely suppressed by zzso The addition of zzso to T cells zzso with zzso plus calcium zzso induced a zzso to zzso increase in zzso gene expression and zzso that was resistant to zzso The zzso signal was able to increase steady state zzso zzso levels even in cells treated with zzso tolerated amounts of calcium zzso and zzso The zzso requirement did not reflect differential regulation of zzso gene expression between the zzso and zzso T cell zzso or differences in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The signal provided by zzso is distinct from that of zzso because although zzso plus zzso proliferation is resistant to zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso expression is zzso Thus, these studies show that three zzso distinct signals are required for zzso zzso gene zzso Furthermore, these studies suggest that zzso production in T cells is not controlled by an zzso switch, but rather, that zzso regulates a distinct zzso zzso which zzso the level of zzso production on a per cell zzso The observation that zzso stimulation results in zzso zzso that exceed 1000 zzso in tissue culture zzso suggests that a role in zzso for zzso might be to amplify immune responses initiated by the zzso cell zzso zzso Finally, the observation that zzso interacts with the signals provided by zzso and calcium zzso shows that the function of zzso is not merely to act as a scaffold to stabilize or enhance zzso through the zzso zzso
