zzso zzso has shown zzso effects in animal models of stroke and has passed clinical trials as a therapeutic drug for stroke in zzso zzso as a potential clinical treatment for stroke, understanding the zzso of action of zzso is zzso This investigation aimed to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanism of zzso protection in zzso cultures and in the zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso attenuated serum zzso zzso zzso and the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in cortical zzso zzso Adult male zzso mice were subjected to permanent zzso of the middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso before or 1 zzso after zzso reduced zzso zzso formation, attenuated zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso release of zzso c and zzso factor zzso in the zzso region were reduced by zzso The zzso signaling zzso by zzso and zzso expression was zzso by zzso treatment in zzso and in zzso It is suggested that zzso protects against zzso damage via multiple mechanisms including zzso associated zzso and zzso zzso zzso Previous and current studies and recent clinical trials encourage exploration of zzso as a zzso drug for the treatment of zzso zzso
