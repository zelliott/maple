We evaluated the zzso effect of zzso zzso on cerebral zzso zzso injury and deeply investigated the relationship between this zzso effect and zzso zzso zzso underwent focal cerebral zzso injured by zzso method and received the in zzso therapeutic efficacy of zzso at points of zzso and zzso after the zzso We found that the zzso treatment significantly zzso improved neurological deficit and cerebral zzso Furthermore, zzso profoundly activated zzso signaling resulted in the zzso of cerebral cell zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the protein level and the expression of zzso at the zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso inhibitor zzso compromised zzso zzso effects and reduced the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggested that the zzso zzso played a critical role in zzso the zzso effects of zzso treatment at points of zzso and zzso after the zzso zzso
