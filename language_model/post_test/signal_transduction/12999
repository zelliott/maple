zzso signaling drives T cell development at the expense of B cell development from a common zzso an effect that is dependent on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso initially identified as a positive zzso of zzso function in a genetic screen in zzso is poorly zzso We now demonstrate that, in contrast to zzso enforced expression of zzso in zzso zzso results in B cell development at the expense of T cell development in fetal zzso organ culture and in zzso zzso with these effects, zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso reporter zzso by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that a balance of zzso zzso signals and zzso signals zzso through zzso and other zzso regulate zzso lineage zzso
