Human neurodegenerative maladies share two common key features: a zzso link to the zzso and deposition of zzso zzso proteins and late zzso These similarities among otherwise unrelated disorders suggest that the aging process plays an active role in enabling the emergence of these diseases late in zzso zzso studies have shown that the manipulation of aging by the reduction of the zzso signaling zzso a prominent aging regulatory pathway, protects model organisms from zzso toxic protein zzso Recent studies have also indicated that the counter zzso effect of zzso reduction is zzso from worms to mice as reduced IGF-1 signaling protected zzso mice from the zzso behavioral zzso pathological zzso and premature death typical to these model zzso In this article I review the current knowledge on the protective mechanisms that are suppressed by the zzso and discuss the future therapeutic potential of zzso reduction as a treatment for neurodegenerative zzso
