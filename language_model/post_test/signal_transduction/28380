zzso zzso is a key mechanism for the control of zzso events in zzso zzso In animal cells, zzso protein zzso and zzso are implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular zzso However, little is known on the functions of zzso protein zzso and zzso in zzso signaling in zzso From an zzso expression library, we isolated zzso zzso a dual specificity protein zzso 1, which is capable of zzso both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Using a gel overlay zzso we identified two zzso zzso binding zzso zzso in the N zzso and zzso in the C zzso zzso binding of zzso to two zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso a gel mobility shift zzso and a competition zzso using a zzso zzso At increasing zzso of zzso the zzso activity of dual specificity protein zzso 1 on the zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased, whereas activity on the zzso of zzso basic protein zzso was zzso Our results collectively indicate that zzso zzso regulates the activity of protein zzso dependent on the zzso Based on these findings, we propose that the zzso signaling zzso is zzso by zzso zzso with a protein zzso signal zzso in plants via protein zzso
