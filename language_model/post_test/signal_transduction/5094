zzso diseases in humans and animals comprise a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the formation of a zzso protein zzso designated zzso and infectious particles zzso zzso The cellular prion protein zzso has a central role in the zzso of prion zzso First, it is the precursor of zzso and infectious zzso and second, its expression on zzso cells is required to mediate toxic effects of zzso To specifically study the role of zzso as a zzso of toxic zzso we have developed novel cell culture models, including primary zzso prepared from zzso zzso Using these approaches we have been able to show that zzso can interact with and mediate toxic signaling of various zzso zzso of different origins, including zzso zzso suggesting a zzso role of the prion protein beyond prion zzso
