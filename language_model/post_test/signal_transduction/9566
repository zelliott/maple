Our understanding of the role that host genetic factors play in the initiation and severity of infections caused by zzso bacteria is zzso To identify novel regulators of the host response to zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso strains were challenged with zzso zzso In addition to two strains lacking functional zzso zzso and zzso three zzso strains with functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be relatively resistant to systemic zzso challenge; the other six strains were classified as zzso zzso from zzso liver, and zzso tissue was zzso on zzso zzso to determine if unique transcripts differentiate susceptible and resistant zzso Gene expression analysis identified the zzso signaling zzso and a number of zzso factors zzso involved in the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found to diminish zzso and zzso production by zzso zzso Mouse lines with targeted zzso were used to verify the involvement of two novel genes in innate zzso Compared with zzso control mice, mice deficient in the zzso zzso factor were found to have a reduced inflammatory response to systemic zzso and mice zzso for zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso were found to be more responsive to systemic zzso Our analysis of gene expression data identified novel pathways and zzso factors that regulate the host response to systemic zzso Our results provide potential zzso zzso and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in human zzso
