The role of classical zzso in the transfer and processing of zzso information is well established in many zzso zzso action, however, is largely unexplored in any peripheral zzso zzso A zzso of local zzso zzso in the zzso zzso lobe is zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso zzso express the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso applied to the zzso lobe suppresses zzso calcium and synaptic transmission in the zzso Furthermore, reduction of zzso expression in zzso by targeted zzso interference eliminates zzso suppression and alters zzso zzso We detect opposite behavioral zzso after reduction and over expression of zzso in zzso Our findings suggest a zzso zzso feedback to zzso from zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
