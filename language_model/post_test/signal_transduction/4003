zzso signal zzso initiated by binding of insulin to its zzso at the plasma zzso activates the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso and leads to zzso of the activated zzso complex into zzso This study addresses the role played by the activated insulin zzso within zzso zzso and provides evidence for its central role in zzso events in zzso zzso were treated with zzso an zzso agent that has been shown previously to inhibit zzso insulin degradation, and then with zzso zzso were removed and zzso by density zzso zzso to obtain zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso treatment increased the amount of zzso insulin in zzso at 2 zzso after insulin injection by zzso as determined by exclusion from zzso columns and by zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also increased the insulin zzso content of zzso after insulin injection zzso over zzso zzso by zzso when compared with controls zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso increased both insulin zzso zzso content and its zzso zzso zzso activity after insulin injection zzso p zzso zzso and zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment was without any zzso effect on insulin binding to plasma membrane insulin zzso nor did it augment zzso zzso zzso or zzso activity in the plasma zzso zzso with its effects on zzso insulin zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso zzso and subsequent degradation zzso the zzso of the active zzso zzso and zzso insulin signaling from this zzso
