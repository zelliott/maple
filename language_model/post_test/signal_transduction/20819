To determine whether the zzso zzso second messenger, zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso display zzso coordinate regulation, zzso content and zzso characteristics were investigated in zzso particulate zzso prepared from male Fischer 344 rats at 3, 12 and 25 months of zzso zzso zzso content was significantly increased in zzso rats compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly reduced at 12 and 25 months of age but zzso affinity was significantly decreased only in the zzso zzso The present data strongly suggest that zzso of the zzso second zzso system may contribute to impaired zzso responsiveness associated with the aging process in the zzso
