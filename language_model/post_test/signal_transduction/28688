The tumor zzso function of zzso is linked to its ability to repress gene zzso but the mechanisms of specific gene repression are poorly zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the Ras zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso are less efficient zzso zzso zzso by preventing zzso of Net by zzso zzso Loss of zzso in zzso leads to increased Net zzso in response to wound healing and zzso zzso of zzso Our results show that zzso can repress specific gene expression by zzso zzso a factor implicated in cell cycle zzso
