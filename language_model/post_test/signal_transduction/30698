zzso center zzso responses to zzso zzso require effective collaboration between zzso cells, activated B cells, and zzso zzso cells within a highly organized zzso Studies using zzso mice have highlighted zzso molecules that are key for initiating and maintaining the zzso zzso including the molecules of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signaling through zzso has multiple consequences, including zzso production, expression of zzso on zzso cells, and differentiation into zzso zzso zzso cells, all of which are important in the zzso zzso We have therefore taken advantage of zzso mice to dissect which downstream elements are required to initiate the formation of zzso In the context of a zzso immune response, we found that zzso B cells from zzso mice express lower levels of zzso compared with zzso zzso B cells in zzso and stimulation of zzso on T cells zzso zzso on B cells in zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to restore the zzso response in zzso mice, suggesting that additional input from another zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso zzso zzso in zzso recovered zzso networks and restored zzso expression on zzso B cells in zzso mice, and this effect was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the zzso of zzso on zzso B cells in zzso and provide a model for cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso pathways in the context of the zzso zzso
