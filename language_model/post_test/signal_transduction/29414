zzso is a zzso for nuclear receptors as well as other zzso zzso Recent studies have established zzso as an essential zzso for many important biological zzso but its exact mechanism of action is not fully zzso To identify novel proteins that can associate with zzso we used a zzso zzso system to screen zzso libraries and identified the zzso zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso response zzso and zzso as direct interacting zzso We show that the interaction between zzso and zzso is dependent upon the second zzso interaction motif in zzso and the zzso domain in zzso and zzso Mouse embryonic zzso lacking zzso have reduced expression of the zzso target gene zzso after stimulation by zzso when compared with wild type zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate a zzso between zzso and liver X receptors zzso signaling pathways and show that stimulation of cells with zzso and zzso zzso have a synergistic effect on the expression of the zzso target gene zzso Our data identify zzso as a new zzso in the zzso signaling zzso that binds zzso and zzso Our data also suggest that the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso constitutes an important bridging mechanism linking zzso and zzso signaling zzso
