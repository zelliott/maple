Expansion of the mouse zzso complex zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso molecules are prime candidates for the zzso zzso factors zzso and we have recently determined that growth differentiation factor 9 zzso alone is not the zzso The aim of this study was to examine zzso zzso factors and their signaling pathways that regulate mouse zzso zzso Using zzso zzso were found to express the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso A and zzso B both enabled zzso zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso neutralized zzso expansion but had no effect on zzso zzso The type I receptors for zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso respectively, both of which activate the same zzso 2/3 signaling zzso We examined the requirement for this signaling system using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso also antagonized zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso Using real-time zzso zzso also attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso 2, tumor necrosis factor zzso protein 6, zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso This study provides evidence that the zzso is composed of zzso zzso molecules that signal through zzso 2/3 to enable the initiation of mouse zzso zzso
