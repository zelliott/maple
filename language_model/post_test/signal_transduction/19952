An attractive strategy to overcome zzso resistance in cancer chemotherapy is to suppress zzso zzso which is a pump zzso in cancer cells to remove zzso drugs from zzso In the present study, a zzso channel zzso was found to be zzso together with zzso in zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso induction and caused a remarkable reversal of zzso resistance in zzso In an zzso nude mouse model of zzso human breast zzso suppressing zzso decreased the growth of tumor zzso Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso zzso was the zzso factor that links the zzso activity to zzso zzso Together, we demonstrated an essential role of zzso signaling cascade in zzso induction in drug-resistant cancer zzso
