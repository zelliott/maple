Several zzso of growth hormone zzso are found in the zzso and zzso of the chick zzso where they appear to act as cell survival factors, having zzso effects on retinal zzso cells zzso Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the zzso effect of zzso in cultured zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso in these cells, which is an zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso was detected in both nucleus and zzso of zzso by zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso was located primarily in the zzso of both normal and zzso cells, although levels were markedly lower in the zzso It was found that zzso treatment of zzso reduced zzso levels, while zzso raising zzso levels, consistent with a role for zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso This was substantiated using zzso which, like zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and initiated zzso The addition of zzso to zzso cultures simultaneously with zzso significantly reduced the zzso effect of zzso The induction of zzso by zzso zzso was clearly accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which were significantly reduced in the presence of the broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso which itself had a dramatic zzso effect on cultured zzso zzso zzso appeared to be a major zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso inhibitor III zzso zzso was able to reduce zzso zzso and abrogate the zzso effect of zzso zzso The results support the view that zzso and zzso zzso are major zzso agents for zzso and that pathways that activate both zzso and zzso are important for the zzso actions of zzso in these zzso
