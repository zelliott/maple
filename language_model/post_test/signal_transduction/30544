zzso zzso processes are implicated in many aspects of zzso function in the green zzso zzso In this study, we examine the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso zzso in single zzso cells during the process of zzso zzso using zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in parallel with a single transient zzso in zzso zzso which was absent in the acid zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be induced by elevated external zzso zzso which promoted very rapid zzso of zzso across the whole cell and in the zzso We also detected very rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso events with an approximate duration of 500 zzso zzso per cent of zzso events coincided with a rapid zzso in zzso in the zzso region of the cell, either in the form of a whole cell or an zzso zzso increase, indicating that zzso zzso in the zzso region play an underlying role in zzso Our data indicate that elevated zzso acts to disrupt zzso zzso which zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also results in further zzso zzso after the main period of whole cell zzso which are very strongly associated with zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso zzso and are largely absent in the zzso zzso We propose that these later zzso may act as specific signals for zzso
