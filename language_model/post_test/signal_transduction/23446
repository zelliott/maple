The application of systems biology approaches has greatly facilitated the process of deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf zzso zzso of the leaf zzso zzso have identified some of the major zzso events during zzso including protein degradation and zzso zzso zzso studies have confirmed these findings and have suggested zzso energy metabolism during leaf zzso which might be important for cell viability zzso As a critical part of systems biology, studies involving zzso regulation networking and zzso signaling have zzso our understanding on the molecular regulation of leaf zzso The important next steps towards a systems biological understanding of leaf zzso will be zzso
