Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum zzso levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone zzso and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal zzso zzso The causes are only beginning to be zzso but are likely a combination of zzso zzso zzso and cell autonomous zzso We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining zzso and zzso to define a zzso zzso zzso signaling network in zzso as well as primary human and mouse zzso zzso zzso We identified a rapid zzso response zzso by elevated zzso that results in the induction of immediate early genes including zzso The mechanism of zzso requires zzso zzso signaling followed by stimulation of zzso and zzso of zzso and serum response zzso A distinct long-term response also requires zzso zzso signaling and results in zzso zzso and expression of genes and zzso of proteins involved in zzso regulation, zzso and zzso The late response is zzso enhanced by addition of zzso zzso The intermediate phase results in increased zzso zzso and zzso production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the zzso zzso the results define elevated zzso as a zzso and define specific mechanisms by which zzso stimulates proliferation and zzso zzso Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated zzso zzso functionally connecting temporally coordinated zzso zzso and zzso events with changes in long-term cell zzso
