This study investigated the actions of zzso growth factor zzso a novel member of the zzso family, on zzso zzso and zzso and compared them with those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of cultured mouse primary zzso zzso zzso cells, primary zzso and zzso zzso cells, although it inhibited the differentiation and zzso synthesis of these zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso only in zzso zzso zzso actions were blocked by a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and by a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso With regard to the action of zzso on bone zzso zzso not only induced zzso formation through zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso function to form zzso pits on a zzso slice in the mouse zzso zzso All these effects of zzso bore a close resemblance to those of zzso whereas zzso affects none of these zzso zzso may therefore compensate for the action of zzso on bone and zzso
