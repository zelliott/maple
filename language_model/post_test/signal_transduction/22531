The broad spectrum zzso zzso is widely used in agriculture zzso There has been ongoing controversy regarding the possible adverse effects of zzso on the environment and on human zzso Reports of neural defects and zzso zzso from regions where zzso zzso zzso are used led us to undertake an zzso approach to explore the effects of low doses of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso of a commercial zzso The treated zzso were highly abnormal with marked zzso in zzso and neural crest development and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on neural crest markers were later correlated with zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso injected with pure zzso showed very similar zzso Moreover, zzso produced similar effects in chicken zzso showing a gradual loss of zzso zzso reduction of the zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso itself was responsible for the zzso observed, rather than a zzso or other component of the commercial zzso A reporter gene zzso revealed that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso acid zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso rescued the zzso effects of the zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso produced by zzso are mainly a consequence of the increase of zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with the decrease of Sonic zzso zzso signaling from the embryonic zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso expression and with the disruption of zzso neural crest zzso The direct effect of zzso on early mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to zzso in agricultural zzso
