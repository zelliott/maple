zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso are widely distributed in zzso zzso Here, we report on the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso B zzso By zzso we demonstrated the exclusive expression of the zzso zzso zzso 2A zzso in B zzso zzso of zzso rapidly increased the zzso free calcium concentration zzso zzso by about 200 zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased binding of zzso zzso by 50% above zzso These effects were partly inhibited by zzso toxin zzso which indicates the involvement of zzso G zzso We provide further evidence that zzso a zzso G protein confined to zzso cells, is involved in the otherwise unusual zzso of zzso to zzso C zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso regulated zzso and induced a zzso stimulation of DNA synthesis and a zzso stimulation of B zzso zzso which was accompanied by an enhanced zzso zzso Thus zzso exerts a growth zzso activity on human B zzso
