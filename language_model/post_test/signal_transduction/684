zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso highly expressed in a variety of zzso as well as zzso zzso Several zzso mechanisms for zzso have been proposed, one of the best characterized being its capacity to act as a zzso zzso To identify novel downstream target zzso we have established cell lines with zzso expression of zzso and a differential display approach to analyze gene expression changes after zzso zzso We identified zzso (also known as zzso as one of the most abundantly expressed zzso zzso zzso is known to participate in several differentiation zzso including zzso adrenal zzso development, and wound zzso zzso is also highly expressed in neuroendocrine zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and that this effect is accomplished by promoting the stability and zzso of zzso zzso supporting a role for zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso genes show zzso expression in fetal liver and zzso as well as in zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are involved in cell differentiation and zzso
