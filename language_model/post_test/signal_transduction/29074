The zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways form a network that play a central role in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes code 3 partners of this network and have been found to be activated by zzso in zzso zzso these zzso lead to unrestricted cell zzso We evaluated the zzso features and the prognosis of patients with zzso colon zzso in a zzso zzso A total of zzso colon zzso were evaluated using sequencing for zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso discrimination for zzso of zzso zzso characteristics were correlated to the risk of bearing a zzso of the network using zzso zzso zzso survival rates were compared with the zzso rank zzso A zzso survival analysis using the Cox model was zzso After adjustment for age and zzso instability, zzso of the network by zzso of at least 1 of the 3 genes was significantly associated with female sex zzso zzso zzso and zzso location zzso zzso zzso Lower levels of zzso survival were associated with zzso of the network by zzso of at least 1 of the 3 genes zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso These results remained significant in a zzso analysis adjusted for sex, age, location, stage and zzso instability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study is the first report to underline the potential role of zzso zzso zzso network zzso on survival in colon zzso Because of the role of this signaling network on zzso agents, the evaluation of its zzso could have clinical zzso
