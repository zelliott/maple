Six zzso zzso families function in Nature to mediate zzso signal zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first three catalyze zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid, respectively, while the last three all have a different zzso zzso For many of these zzso zzso (many zzso the details of the conversion of the zzso change in zzso of their zzso into a signaling state and eventually a biological response have been zzso Some members of the zzso the zzso and the zzso are so well characterized that they function as model systems to study zzso protein dynamics and zzso
