The aim of this article is to describe the relative roles of hormone sensitive zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human fat cell zzso 

Until recently, only hormone sensitive zzso was considered important for the regulation of zzso within fat zzso Recent zzso studies have suggested that zzso zzso zzso may, however, be more zzso The few human zzso zzso zzso studies that have been published point to species differences between humans and zzso Selective zzso of hormone sensitive zzso in human fat cells completely zzso zzso zzso though there is a considerable zzso residual zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso by a zzso termed zzso In the absence of zzso zzso activity in fat cells is much higher for hormone sensitive zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitive zzso expression is regulated by obesity and body weight reduction zzso and increased, respectively), but this is not the case for zzso zzso zzso A role of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso is suggested by studies of gene zzso 

Two zzso the zzso hormone sensitive zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are of importance for the regulation of zzso in zzso fat zzso In humans, zzso zzso zzso seems essential for maintaining zzso zzso activity, while hormone sensitive zzso is the zzso most responsive to zzso zzso
