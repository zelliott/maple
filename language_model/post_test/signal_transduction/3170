zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso precursor protein zzso plays a central role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso We previously reported that the scaffolding protein zzso is markedly increased in zzso brains and promotes zzso generation by scaffolding zzso complexes together and accelerating zzso zzso Because zzso zzso and zzso all physically interact with zzso we investigated whether zzso alters zzso cell zzso and focal zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso cell attachment and spreading in zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso with strongly decreased zzso signaling and zzso zzso in focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso robustly promotes cell attachment, zzso and focal zzso signaling and zzso Cell surface zzso and zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduces and increases surface zzso and zzso by accelerating and zzso their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso mice also demonstrate severely reduced levels of surface zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso simultaneously zzso zzso processes and enhances zzso generation by accelerating zzso zzso and zzso zzso
