zzso signaling refers to processes in which zzso signals are produced by different, but closely zzso zzso It allows enhanced discrimination and more accurate behavioral zzso We explored opponent signaling in the zzso zzso zzso system by measuring frequency response functions between zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso Random fluctuations in concentration of two zzso and two aromatic fruit zzso were used to zzso action zzso from zzso zzso zzso We separated action zzso by two-dimensional cluster analysis using zzso and zzso with a median zzso zzso zzso response functions were fitted with either zzso or zzso zzso functions and then divided into two polarity groups, zzso and zzso by fitting the frequency response zzso zzso analysis gave two, three, or four action potential clusters for each zzso zzso zzso were then grouped by the patterns of response zzso of the individual zzso into four zzso types, one with four zzso and three with two zzso All four zzso compounds produced a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso responses in different zzso zzso analysis of frequency response parameters for individual zzso gave only weak correlation between dynamics and some zzso types, even when comparing the dynamics of zzso and zzso responses to the same zzso However, response dynamics were significantly different between zzso and aromatic compounds, and between the two zzso zzso Each zzso caused opposing zzso and zzso signals to be sent to the zzso lobe along at least two pairs of zzso zzso
