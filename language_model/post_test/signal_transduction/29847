Gap junctions zzso are the only known cellular structures that allow a direct transfer of signaling molecules from zzso by forming zzso channels that bridge the opposing zzso of neighboring zzso The crucial role of zzso zzso communication zzso for coordination of development, tissue function, and cell zzso is now well zzso In addition, recent findings have fueled the novel concepts that zzso although zzso have unique and specific functions, that zzso may play a significant role in zzso transient zzso zzso and that zzso zzso by themselves may function in zzso zzso Assembly of these channels is a complicated, highly regulated process that includes zzso of the zzso zzso proteins on zzso zzso zzso zzso of compatible zzso into zzso zzso zzso delivery of the zzso to the plasma zzso head-on zzso of compatible zzso in the zzso space at distinct locations, arrangement of channels into zzso zzso and temporally organized zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and coordinated removal of channels into the zzso followed by their zzso Here we review the current knowledge of the processes that lead to zzso zzso and degradation, draw comparisons to other membrane zzso highlight novel findings, point out contradictory zzso and provide some provocative suggestive zzso
