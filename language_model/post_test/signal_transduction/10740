zzso elevated calcium zzso zzso product zzso zzso zzso and calcium burden, major causes of vascular zzso are correlated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis zzso 

To address the underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings, we have zzso an in zzso human smooth muscle cell zzso model of vascular zzso Previous studies using this system demonstrated enhanced zzso of zzso cultures treated with zzso levels in the zzso range, and implicated a zzso zzso zzso mechanism in this zzso In the present study, we examine the effect of increasing calcium zzso on zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso calcium to levels observed in zzso individuals increased zzso of zzso cultures under normal zzso zzso zzso at these total calcium zzso zzso calcium levels increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso consistent with levels observed zzso in zzso and zzso individuals, zzso Furthermore, increasing both calcium and zzso levels led to accelerated and increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the function of a zzso zzso zzso since it was inhibited by zzso acid zzso While elevated calcium did not affect short-term zzso transport zzso long-term elevated calcium treatment of zzso induced expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These studies suggest that elevated calcium may stimulate zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso P product and enhancing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously observed in zzso
