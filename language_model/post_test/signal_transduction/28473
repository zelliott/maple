zzso zzso zzso channel zzso by an zzso zzso zzso was investigated by the zzso zzso method in zzso zzso cells zzso with the functional rabbit zzso calcium zzso zzso The current responses zzso to zzso zzso steps were depressed by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso toxin into the zzso solution as well as a strongly zzso zzso abolished the zzso action of zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso zzso zzso responsible for this effect, several preferential zzso and zzso were zzso Whereas the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso indicated a higher potency of these zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were considerably less zzso The effect of zzso was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso acid, zzso or zzso zzso zzso Using reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction, zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso and zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso and to a minor extent that of zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso zzso it is tempting to speculate that zzso receptors may inhibit zzso zzso channels via the zzso zzso of the activated zzso zzso
