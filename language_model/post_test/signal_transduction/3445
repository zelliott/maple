The mortality of severe malaria zzso malaria zzso severe malaria anemia zzso acute lung injury zzso and acute respiratory distress syndrome zzso remains high despite the availability associated with adequate zzso Recent studies in our laboratory and others have revealed a zzso unknown correlation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cerebral malaria severity and zzso Although zzso and zzso interactions are directly involved in the zzso of CM and fatal disease, the mechanism dictating how zzso and zzso are expressed and regulated under these conditions is still zzso We therefore tested the hypothesis that these factors share common signaling pathways and may be mutually zzso 

We first clarified the roles of zzso zzso and zzso in CM zzso utilizing a well established experimental cerebral malaria mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Then, we further determined the mechanisms how zzso regulates zzso and zzso as well as mutual regulation among them in zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso infection in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production through zzso pathway, and regulates zzso at the zzso level in zzso zzso zzso zzso is positively regulated by zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso zzso and zzso molecules as well as related signaling pathways play very important roles in the zzso of severe zzso We conclude that these factors are mutually regulated and provide new opportunities to develop potential novel therapeutic targets that could be used to supplement traditional zzso and treatments for malaria and improve clinical outcomes while reducing malaria zzso Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapies targeting zzso or zzso biological signaling molecules associated with development of fatal zzso
