zzso oxide zzso plays a zzso role on cell growth and zzso biological processes that occur under the control of various signal zzso mechanisms, including those triggered by zzso of membrane receptors for zzso growth zzso The increases in zzso zzso concentration zzso by the zzso of these receptors are sustained by release of the zzso from zzso stores and by stimulation of this influx from the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells zzso the human zzso growth factor zzso we investigated both of these processes zzso by the administration of zzso and zzso growth factors as the zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses carried out on zzso cells showed that zzso influx zzso by both growth factors is the zzso of two distinct zzso with the major zzso dependent on and the minor zzso independent of store zzso Exposure of the cells to either No donors or NO zzso zzso induced increase and zzso respectively, of the two components of zzso zzso When zzso release was investigated, the above drugs were also active but in the opposite zzso The effects of NO were zzso by the zzso analogue zzso and abolished by two zzso protein zzso I zzso whereas the zzso analogue zzso and two protein zzso A zzso had no appreciable zzso In addition, growth factors induced an increase in zzso formation, an effect that was prevented by NO zzso zzso In conclusion, NO appears to exert a feedback zzso control on zzso responses to growth factor zzso Such a control might contribute to the zzso effect of NO on growth previously reported with various cell zzso
