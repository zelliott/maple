The zzso factors of the zzso family play an important role in immunity to infection in animal zzso Three human primary zzso associated with impaired zzso signaling were recently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso is caused by a zzso zzso in the gene zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso is caused by zzso in the gene zzso zzso a zzso acting upstream from the zzso complex in the zzso signaling zzso The description of the infectious zzso associated with these genetic defects has initiated the forward genetic dissection of zzso immunity in zzso
