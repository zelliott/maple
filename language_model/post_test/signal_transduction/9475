zzso must make appropriate fate decisions within a complex and dynamic zzso In zzso studies indicate that the zzso acts as an zzso platform for this environmental zzso External signals regulate zzso dynamics and the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso However, in zzso studies linking zzso interactions to embryonic cell fate zzso remain zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso heart zzso cell zzso Our studies focus on differential induction of heart fate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that differential induction does not simply reflect differential exposure to the zzso zzso Instead, zzso cells employ zzso invasive zzso to zzso their response to an zzso zzso Through targeted manipulation of the zzso regulator zzso we are able to zzso zzso activity and generate uniform heart zzso fate zzso Furthermore, we are able to restore differential induction by zzso zzso zzso These findings illustrate how zzso interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso can influence embryonic zzso In particular, these studies highlight the potential for dynamic zzso changes to refine cell fate zzso in response to crude signal zzso
