zzso stem cells zzso in zzso are descendants of primordial germ cells zzso specified during zzso The precise timing of zzso establishment in the zzso has not been determined, nor is it known whether mechanisms that control zzso maintenance in the adult are involved in zzso zzso Here, we determine that zzso in the developing male zzso first become zzso at the zzso to zzso zzso This zzso with formation of the embryonic zzso the critical signaling center that regulates adult zzso behavior within the stem cell zzso zzso We find that the zzso signaling zzso is activated in a subset of zzso that associate with the zzso embryonic zzso These zzso express zzso markers and function like zzso while zzso that do not associate with the hub begin to zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the hub fail to exhibit the characteristics of zzso while zzso zzso of the zzso zzso prevents zzso These findings show that stem cell formation is closely linked to development of the stem cell zzso and suggest that zzso signaling is required for initial establishment of the zzso population in developing zzso
