zzso induce acute zzso injury in zzso basement membrane zzso zzso This operates, in part, via zzso of the zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso signaling zzso However, it is unknown whether zzso of zzso signaling is effective once the zzso response is established in the injured zzso This study examined whether blockade of zzso signaling could halt disease zzso including zzso formation, in a model of severe zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso with sheep zzso and then injected with sheep zzso serum zzso zzso Animals were treated with the zzso zzso zzso vehicle alone, or no treatment from day 7 until being killed on day 24 of zzso zzso animals at day 7 showed significant zzso focal zzso zzso marked zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups displayed severe zzso at day 24 with zzso impairment and worsening zzso These animals had severe zzso zzso with zzso of zzso exhibiting zzso zzso in association with increased zzso and zzso zzso (including zzso giant zzso and a further increase in zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso treatment prevented zzso zzso suppressed zzso and prevented severe zzso and zzso zzso including zzso formation and zzso zzso These protective effects were independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of the zzso immune zzso zzso treatment inhibited expression of both zzso and zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso and zzso production by cultured zzso was found to be zzso zzso In conclusion, blockade of zzso signaling provides substantial protection against the progression of zzso zzso zzso which may be, in part, due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
