Previously, we reported that the zzso transition of collagen I zzso plays, along with differentiation zzso a regulatory role in determination of differentiation lineage of bone zzso zzso sells via distinct signaling pathways specific for the structural state of the zzso The present study addresses mechanisms underlying differential structural zzso effects of collagen zzso on differentiation into diverse zzso The results obtained suggest that the pivotal player in the observed zzso zzso regulation is a differential cellular stress response zzso by the exposure to native but not to zzso collagen I zzso The stress causing such a response appears to be generated by zzso contraction and zzso by zzso zzso engaged on native but not on zzso collagen I zzso The principal facet of the observed phenomenon is not the nature of a stress but general stress response: when cells on zzso collagen I zzso are subjected to zzso stress, zzso zzso shifts to that seen on native collagen I zzso zzso cellular stress response might be commonly involved in determination of differentiation zzso Indeed, distinct components of cellular stress response machinery appear to regulate differentiation into diverse zzso Thus, zzso of zzso levels enables the operation of efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways hence zzso osteogenesis and suppressing zzso whereas zzso of satellite stem cells appears to be promoted by native collagen I zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of another stress response zzso zzso shown to be essential for skeletal zzso and zzso may involve zzso zzso of yet another stress response zzso zzso shown to be an interactive partner of the zzso zzso factor zzso The proposed concept of the integral role of cellular stress response in tissue generation and maintenance suggests new therapeutic approaches and indicates novel tissue engineering zzso
