zzso introduced by signal carriers, zzso mechanisms and zzso zzso are fundamental for shaping the signals used by the brain to build up zzso zzso This review analyses some of these constraints in the zzso system of pulse zzso First, it describes the characteristics and differences of zzso and zzso zzso Second, it analyses the role of zzso and zzso zzso of the fish body in the generation and conditioning of these zzso Two zzso mechanisms are zzso zzso the funneling of currents to the zzso region and zzso a zzso profile involved in edge zzso Finally, some characteristics of the zzso structure and the sensory mosaic are zzso We conclude that there is an zzso zzso at the zzso region where a large density and variety of receptors is zzso by zzso and zzso currents funneled there by non zzso zzso zzso in carrier zzso may be used to distinguish between zzso and communication zzso
