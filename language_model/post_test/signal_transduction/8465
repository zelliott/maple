This study was designed to evaluate the expression of zzso receptors as a marker of sensitivity to the humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso In a recent clinical trial, low levels of zzso zzso have been shown to associate with zzso response when combined with zzso We sought to define how zzso modulated zzso expression levels in zzso cancer using cell line models to better understand differential and dynamic zzso expression in therapeutic zzso Changes in zzso zzso expression were also assessed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso were zzso after stimulation both with zzso and zzso growth factor in a range of zzso cancer cell lines either growth sensitive or growth resistant to zzso zzso reversed this zzso and the magnitude of the reversal correlated with zzso zzso The change in zzso zzso expression correlated zzso to how much the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways were zzso activated with zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso was found in cancer zzso treated with zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is zzso by both zzso and zzso growth factor zzso This suggests that in some tumors, low zzso zzso expression is driven by, or dependent on, growth zzso zzso zzso expression is effectively reversed in zzso zzso These data are consistent with low zzso zzso identifying a zzso zzso
