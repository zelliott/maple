Bone zzso proteins zzso and their roles during early zzso patterning of the zzso zzso are well zzso The role and regulation of a more distant member of this family, the zzso zzso protein zzso however, are less zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso is exclusively expressed on the zzso zzso zzso starts at zzso stages in the region of the zzso giving rise to anterior zzso and zzso zzso During the course of zzso both the zzso and the zzso zzso transcripts zzso in an zzso zzso The maintenance of zzso expression is positively influenced by zzso signaling and by zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein acting as a zzso of early zzso zzso Despite the positive effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso have rather opposite effects on zzso zzso as revealed in zzso and zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso has zzso activities causing a smaller organizer and enhanced zzso zzso very similar to the zzso caused by the loss of zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other side, leads to an enlarged organizer and impaired zzso and zzso development, as observed in zzso after zzso zzso This finding indicates that zzso is required for the development of embryonic structures normally suppressed by organizer zzso The seeming zzso between the zzso and functional relationship of zzso and zzso is discussed, and models are proposed according to which zzso might be part of a negative feedback loop to pattern and zzso the organizer zzso
