zzso communication by zzso signaling plays a key role in the development of the nervous system, from cell fate determination through zzso guidance to zzso Interestingly, several zzso signaling systems exhibit an zzso interaction between receptors and zzso in the same cell, termed zzso zzso These include the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Here we review the role of zzso zzso in these signaling systems in the development of the nervous zzso We compare and contrast zzso zzso mechanisms and discuss their potential cellular function as a zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso suggests that these interactions and their functional regulatory roles may serve as a general design principle for zzso zzso processes during and beyond zzso
