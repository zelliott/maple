In view of its multiple zzso effects, transforming growth factor zzso zzso is recognized as critical negative regulator of skeletal muscle zzso zzso of skeletal muscle precursor cells driven by zzso contributes to the negative role exerted by the zzso in tissue repair, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still zzso zzso we report the identification of a new signaling pathway, relying on zzso zzso zzso subsequent to zzso zzso zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso that accounts for zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso gene zzso reduced by almost 50% zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, the selective zzso zzso zzso also reduced the zzso zzso zzso By employing pharmacological and molecular biological approaches, the involvement of zzso and zzso in the transmission of the zzso zzso action was also zzso These results reinforce the notion that the zzso axis plays a fundamental role in zzso mode of action in skeletal muscle cells and, by disclosing a novel mechanism by which zzso exerts its harmful action, pinpoint new molecular targets that in principle could be beneficial in the treatment of several skeletal muscle disorders or zzso muscle zzso
