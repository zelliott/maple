zzso U zzso originally isolated from zzso spinal zzso and later from other species, is a novel zzso that zzso contracts smooth zzso zzso interacts with two G zzso receptors designated as zzso and zzso This study demonstrates a potential zzso role for zzso In a mouse zzso cell line zzso a single class of high affinity zzso binding sites for zzso zzso zzso 364 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified, and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso Competition binding analysis revealed zzso high affinity binding of zzso zzso to zzso prepared from zzso zzso Exposure of these cells to zzso zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso for human zzso In addition, zzso also significantly increased the synthesis and release of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Studies using pharmacological zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso release required functional zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest a role for zzso in inflammation by stimulating zzso production by T zzso
