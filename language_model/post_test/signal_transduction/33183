zzso affects normal bone growth but the mechanisms of zzso toxicity are not fully zzso zzso is an integral component of bone growth and a second zzso necessary for the actions of zzso zzso zzso activates protein zzso C zzso and zzso is a zzso of zzso and zzso of collagen synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a possible zzso of zzso effects on zzso metabolism and zzso zzso This work was conducted to determine the effect of zzso on zzso free zzso zzso levels, characterize the zzso and/or zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso and measure the effect of zzso on collagen synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated for 120 zzso with zzso zzso to 30 zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso was 132 zzso and the zzso increase to 268 zzso occurred in the presence of 5 zzso zzso Treatment with 1 or 5 zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso at 40 zzso with return to zzso levels at 120 zzso of zzso zzso (24 zzso with zzso zzso zzso C zzso a zzso zzso produced no change in zzso and prevented any rise in zzso in response to zzso Free zzso activates zzso with an zzso constant of zzso X zzso M, while zzso activates zzso with an zzso constant of zzso X zzso zzso zzso also caused a zzso decrease in collagen zzso a zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso affects zzso metabolism and zzso processes via zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso of collagen zzso
