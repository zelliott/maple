The zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit cardiac zzso however, the mechanism remains zzso zzso models of cardiac zzso were created with zzso zzso zzso to investigate the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses indicated that zzso marker genes zzso and zzso expression were zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We also observed that the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its target zzso zzso zzso zzso I, Ukrainian zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the fatty acid zzso was decreased in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso animals with zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body zzso a specific zzso of zzso inhibited cardiac zzso in zzso and reversed zzso zzso and zzso expression and fatty acid zzso Similar observations were made in zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso C, a specific zzso zzso showed an effect opposite to that of zzso The effect of zzso on cardiac zzso was blocked after zzso was silenced by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso activity zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of cardiac zzso by zzso the zzso signaling zzso
