The role of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso gene expression was investigated in a human zzso cell line, zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was increased zzso by 250 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity, via expression of a zzso zzso zzso or treatment with zzso resulted in decreased levels of zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso Two members of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso and zzso were also found to affect zzso zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso or zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso promoter zzso In addition, when zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso both zzso promoter activity and protein levels zzso These results demonstrate that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required in the zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso induction of zzso is in part zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso cell zzso By identifying the multiple signaling pathways that are induced by zzso and contribute to the induction of zzso zzso more drug targets may be identified to aid attempts to prevent and treat skin zzso
