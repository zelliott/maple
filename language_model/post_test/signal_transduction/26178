To determine the role of zzso growth factor zzso on zzso survival in zzso conditions in zzso and in response to zzso in zzso 

We generated zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and characterized their response to diabetes induced by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso We also analyzed the effect of zzso signaling in zzso on zzso zzso death in mouse and human zzso specifically examining the role of nuclear factor zzso 

zzso exposed in zzso to zzso or from zzso mice displayed significantly increased zzso and zzso levels, suggesting a potential role for zzso in zzso survival against zzso zzso Adult zzso zzso mice displayed normal zzso and zzso zzso indicating that pancreatic zzso loss is not zzso for zzso growth and function under zzso zzso However, zzso zzso mice were more susceptible to zzso zzso They displayed higher blood zzso levels, marked zzso and reduced zzso mass compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso production, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso cell death in zzso an effect zzso by zzso zzso and NO zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso and fully protected mouse and, more important, human zzso against zzso 

These results show that zzso is critical for zzso survival by attenuating zzso signaling and suggest that zzso of the zzso signaling zzso represents a novel strategy for enhancing zzso zzso
