Recent evidence suggests that zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling contributes to liver cell zzso as well as to zzso liver cell death, and represents an important regulator of zzso zzso This article summarizes recent findings on the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso cell proliferation and zzso The emphasis is on the interplay between zzso and zzso zzso zzso death zzso which is determined by the signaling context and liver cell type zzso
