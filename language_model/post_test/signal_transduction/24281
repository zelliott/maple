We have reviewed studies on cadmium zzso toxicity in laboratory animals and cultured cells with special attention to the disruption in cellular signal zzso involvement in zzso of zzso the cellular transport system for zzso and roles of zzso as a protective factor against zzso zzso affects cellular functions by zzso signal zzso such as protein zzso C, zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso but how the disruption of these pathways by zzso leads to the manifestation of toxicity in zzso is largely zzso Exposure to cadmium at relatively high and low levels causes necrosis and zzso respectively, which suggests that the mode of cell death by cadmium is dependent upon its exposure zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso channels, zzso zzso metal zzso 1) and a novel transport system having zzso for zzso and zzso were found to act as zzso transport systems via the cellular zzso zzso mice are highly susceptible to zzso zzso zzso bone injury, zzso and zzso caused by chronic zzso zzso Thus, zzso plays an important role in zzso of zzso zzso
