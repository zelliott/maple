Most zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso medium at 37 degrees C grow in zzso form in zzso conditions, but they grow in zzso form in zzso zzso The zzso growth of zzso zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso acid, an inhibitor of zzso zzso enhanced the zzso proliferation of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso signal was derived from the zzso system and the signal was transmitted to the electron transfer system via the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the signal transmission between complex II and Co zzso significantly inhibited the zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of complex III, IV, and zzso respectively, did not inhibit the zzso growth of zzso zzso The production of zzso for the zzso formation signal was completely inhibited in zzso zzso These results indicate that the electron transfer system functions upstream of the zzso signal zzso and activates the expression of the zzso formation zzso Since the electron transfer system is zzso in zzso conditions, zzso zzso grew in zzso form in this zzso
