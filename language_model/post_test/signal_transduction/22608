We previously described the promotion of type 1 zzso responses by the zzso zzso zzso in human T cells in zzso In this study, we examined whether type 1 zzso polarization by zzso in zzso could promote contact hypersensitivity zzso responses to zzso a type 1 zzso immune zzso zzso although type 1 zzso responses were enhanced following zzso treatment in zzso and in zzso the magnitude of zzso responses in zzso and zzso mice was influenced more by a second zzso zzso The key regulatory zzso in this zzso was zzso zzso suppression of zzso in zzso mice was associated with increased zzso expression and enhanced zzso responses, whereas enhanced zzso levels, following zzso administration, led to increased zzso expression and impaired zzso responses in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the expression of B7 molecules and on zzso responses was neutralized by zzso administration in zzso and by zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso controlled zzso responses directly through the zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso outcome was dictated by the preferential expression of either zzso an inappropriate zzso zzso in zzso or zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso we showed that the zzso zzso could function independent of zzso zzso Altogether, these data showed that, although zzso treatment induced a type 1 zzso bias in contact zzso zzso and zzso mice, in zzso zzso responses were dependent on zzso regulation of both zzso and preferential zzso zzso
