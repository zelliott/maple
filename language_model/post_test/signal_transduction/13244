The zzso zzso acid zzso plays an essential role in zzso stress zzso The hormone zzso among others, the expression of numerous zzso zzso From various promoter zzso zzso elements zzso have been determined and a number of zzso binding factors have been isolated, although their in zzso roles are not zzso Here we report that the zzso binding factors zzso and zzso function in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso resulted in zzso hypersensitivity and other zzso zzso In addition, the transgenic plants exhibited reduced zzso and enhanced drought zzso At the molecular level, altered expression of zzso genes was zzso Furthermore, the zzso and spatial expression patterns of zzso and zzso were consistent with their suggested zzso Thus, our results provide strong in zzso evidence that zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso
