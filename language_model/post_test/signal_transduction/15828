We have determined the zzso and affinity of binding of zzso to the zzso zzso lipids using an optical zzso technique in a zzso zzso The use of dual polarization zzso to probe supported zzso zzso zzso of different compositions allowed determination of accurate affinity zzso and a layer structure of the zzso binding to the model membrane zzso In addition, the platform enabled us to monitor the detailed zzso zzso characterized by a strong initial zzso attraction of the zzso to the zzso surface followed by zzso and loss of possibly clustered peptides upon specific binding to the zzso zzso These zzso differed substantially from zzso zzso for zzso binding to similarly charged control zzso
