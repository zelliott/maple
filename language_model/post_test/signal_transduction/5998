To study the effect of zzso on signaling zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in primary zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells, and to explore the clinical significance of zzso in the treatment of primary zzso cells, the cells were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal control group, zzso cells group, and zzso zzso the cellular proliferation was zzso by zzso zzso the expression of cellular zzso zzso in zzso cells was detected by zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso cell was detected by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso The results showed that the cellular proliferation of zzso group zzso value zzso zzso zzso was zzso as compared with that of the zzso cells group zzso value zzso zzso zzso P zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso in zzso cells group zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly greater than that in the normal control group zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso group zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased as compared with that in the zzso cells group zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was significantly increased in zzso cells group zzso value zzso zzso zzso as compared with that in the normal control group zzso value zzso zzso zzso P zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso group zzso value zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased as compared with that of zzso cells group zzso zzso It is concluded that the cellular proliferation and the expression of zzso zzso are increased in the primary zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in primary zzso cells is markedly zzso zzso signaling zzso may be involved in the proliferation of primary zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the cellular proliferation and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso may be used in treatment of zzso
