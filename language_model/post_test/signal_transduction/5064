The zzso zzso system is integral to the host response against zzso and many viruses have developed strategies to overcome its zzso zzso The effects of zzso E virus zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso on zzso signaling have not been investigated primarily because of the zzso of an efficient in zzso culture system or small animal models of zzso We report here the generation of zzso cell lines persistently infected with zzso 3 zzso designated as zzso cells and the effects zzso has on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso 500, and 1000 zzso of zzso for 72 hours showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes coding for the zzso proteins zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso infection also prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was specific, as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso by zzso was zzso Additionally, zzso levels were markedly increased in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, binding of zzso open reading frame zzso protein to zzso in zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso protein alone inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance zzso 

zzso zzso zzso signaling through the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings have implications for the development of new strategies against zzso zzso
