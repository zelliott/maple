Several studies have shown that organ size, and the proliferation of tumor zzso may be regulated by negative feedback zzso in which zzso zzso factors called zzso inhibit zzso However, very little is known about zzso and how cells sense zzso We previously identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which act as zzso in zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso zzso faster than zzso cells, and adding zzso zzso or zzso to cells slows their zzso 

We show here that cells lacking the G protein components zzso zzso and zzso zzso faster than zzso cells despite zzso normal or high levels of zzso and zzso Compared with zzso cells, the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso cells are only zzso inhibited by zzso zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso and zzso inhibit cell proliferation but not cell growth (the rate of increase in mass and protein per zzso whereas zzso zzso both proliferation and zzso zzso cells show normal zzso binding of zzso whereas zzso and zzso cells have fewer zzso zzso binding sites, suggesting that zzso and zzso regulate the synthesis or processing of the zzso zzso Like other zzso that activate G zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso Both zzso zzso binding and the zzso zzso of zzso binding require zzso and zzso but not zzso Like zzso cells, zzso cells have reduced spore zzso 

This study shows that zzso and zzso are part of the signal zzso zzso used by zzso to inhibit proliferation but not growth in zzso whereas zzso is part of a zzso zzso that regulates both proliferation and growth, and that a zzso signal zzso zzso uses G zzso
