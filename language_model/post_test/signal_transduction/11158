To isolate novel molecular targets for treatment of zzso germ cell tumor zzso we performed zzso expression profile analysis of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso We here report identification of zzso zzso repeat and zzso containing 7 zzso ), that was significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and northern zzso analyses confirmed an approximately zzso transcript that was expressed exclusively in zzso although the expression level of this gene in normal zzso was much lower than in tumor cells, suggesting an important role of this gene in zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso detected the zzso zzso protein in the zzso of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of small interfering zzso zzso for zzso significantly reduced the zzso expression and resulted in growth suppression of zzso zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso may play a crucial role in cell zzso as well as zzso zzso and it appears to be a promising candidate for development of targeted therapy for zzso
