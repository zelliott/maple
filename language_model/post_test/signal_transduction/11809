The rat zzso cell line zzso offers a powerful in zzso model to study the mechanism of growth zzso differentiation and zzso Within minutes of addition, agents such as nerve growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly activate cellular immediate early genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a member of the immediate early gene family, follows a distinctly later time course of induction than zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may zzso the action of genes induced zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells results in pronounced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso to a varying extent whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso was not affected in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into these stable zzso zzso cells revealed that repression of zzso and zzso was exerted at the promoter zzso Thus zzso zzso expression may inhibit zzso cell differentiation by altering the patterns of immediate early gene zzso
