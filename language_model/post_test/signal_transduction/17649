Generation of functional zzso proteins requires efficient and undisturbed functioning of the zzso zzso zzso in host zzso In large-scale production, where target proteins are highly zzso this zzso can be easily congested with unfolded or zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that, in addition to responsibility for protein processing, zzso is also an important signaling compartment and a sensor of cellular zzso Two zzso responses have been described to arise from the zzso of zzso unfolded protein response zzso and zzso overload response zzso zzso and zzso employ various mechanisms at the zzso and the zzso levels to deal efficiently and appropriately with encountered zzso This review will outline the molecular bases of zzso functioning and stress response, highlight the relevance of zzso signaling to the large-scale cell culture productivity and discuss possible approaches to the improvement of the zzso capacities of zzso zzso
