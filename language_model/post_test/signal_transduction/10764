zzso family zzso particularly zzso and zzso are key regulators of cell polarization and directional zzso zzso zzso coli zzso is also thought to play a pivotal role in polarized cell zzso We have found that zzso an zzso of zzso and zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the leading edge in zzso zzso cells, and activated zzso form a zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and polarized zzso zzso of zzso or zzso also zzso zzso of zzso a zzso protein that interacts with zzso Taken together, these results suggest a model in which zzso of zzso and zzso in response to migration signals leads to recruitment of zzso and zzso which, together with zzso form a complex that links the zzso zzso and zzso dynamics during cell polarization and directional zzso
