zzso peptides have great potential as zzso agents zzso to their ease of rational design and target zzso However, their utility in zzso is limited by low stability and poor tumor zzso 

The authors review the development of zzso zzso with potential for cancer zzso zzso that inhibit signal zzso zzso are zzso 

The authors searched zzso for articles concerning the development of therapeutic peptides and their zzso 

Given our current knowledge of protein zzso structures and interaction zzso therapeutic peptides that inhibit interactions of interest are easily zzso These peptides are advantageous because they are highly specific for the interaction of interest, and they are much more easily developed than small zzso zzso of the same zzso The main hurdle to application of peptides for cancer therapy is their poor zzso and zzso zzso zzso successful development of zzso delivery zzso could potentially make possible the use of this new and very promising class of zzso zzso
