The zzso and signal zzso of zzso zzso production were studied after a zzso stretch of zzso rat zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso production was increased by zzso above control after zzso s of cellular stretch but returned to control after 120 s of zzso The increase in zzso was zzso in high zzso medium and was inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting the existence of a zzso zzso G protein in signal zzso zzso zzso analysis of cell extracts stretched for 20 s showed an increase in both zzso zzso mostly zzso zzso with a weak increase in zzso zzso whereas 120 s stretch induced an increase in zzso zzso above zzso associated with a decrease of zzso zzso as compared with 20 s zzso It is concluded that the progressive increase in zzso production associated with an early rise in zzso after stretching zzso cells may be a factor inducing the zzso zzso of cardiac muscle through a zzso of zzso free calcium zzso
