An important aspect of the innate immune response to pathogens is the production of zzso peptides such as zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso In this study, mechanisms regulating zzso of zzso gene expression in mast cells were zzso zzso and zzso pathways were the focus of zzso 

Mouse bone zzso mast cells were grown in culture and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were inhibited using zzso or a pharmacological zzso zzso of the zzso component of zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of I zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso by zzso The effects of all of these treatments on zzso gene expression were monitored by zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso had little discernible effect on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso or zzso likewise had little zzso However, zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso An important role for zzso in zzso gene expression was confirmed by zzso of I zzso zzso which reduced both zzso and induced levels of zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso plays an important role in zzso induction of zzso gene in mast zzso zzso which inhibit zzso activity may increase zzso to bacterial and viral pathogens which are sensitive to zzso
