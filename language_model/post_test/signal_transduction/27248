The killer cell zzso receptors zzso of human natural killer zzso cells recognize human zzso zzso class I molecules and inhibit zzso cell zzso through their interaction with protein zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso recognition of class I zzso zzso zzso signaling events and ultimately zzso cell zzso by blocking the association of an zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso can serve as a zzso in zzso for the zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso and that recognition of class I partially zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso providing evidence for zzso zzso zzso
