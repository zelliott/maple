It is widely assumed that G zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso specific zzso of G zzso receptors zzso response involves zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso binding and subsequent zzso from the zzso G zzso It has recently become evident that zzso zzso regulation also involves zzso zzso In the present study we investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso known to be zzso by zzso needs to be zzso for its zzso and/or zzso and zzso For this purpose we evaluated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso signaling in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that although this zzso functioned as dominant negative concerning zzso zzso and zzso it zzso zzso signaling in the same degree as the zzso wild zzso To identify the zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso with constructions zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso or the zzso domain fused to the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso was sufficient to zzso the zzso Moreover, disruption of zzso functions by the use of zzso double zzso although zzso with the zzso reversed zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso through a zzso and zzso mechanism and extends the zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso beyond zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso activity proved to be necessary for zzso zzso and the resulting zzso
