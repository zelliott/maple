During zzso zzso a complex zzso the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and class I zzso zzso zzso is recruited to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso polarity zzso and tumor zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso is also targeted to zzso junctions by zzso where zzso strengthens zzso zzso zzso Although a role for the zzso signaling complex in promoting membrane zzso at wound edges has been zzso a function for this complex at zzso junctions remains zzso 

Here, we establish that zzso targets zzso and zzso to zzso junctions where a zzso complex counterbalances zzso stimuli zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that this signaling zzso regulates cell survival in response to zzso zzso Finally, we determine that in suspension cultures, the zzso complex functions to regulate zzso zzso by zzso engagement, with zzso zzso the zzso complex suppressing zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that the zzso signaling complex functions as an essential zzso of cell survival when localized to zzso junctions of polarized zzso The activity of this complex at zzso junctions is thereby essential for normal zzso zzso and tolerance of zzso zzso Furthermore, when localized to zzso zzso the zzso signaling complex serves as a key zzso of zzso sensitivity, a pivotal mechanism in tumor zzso Thus, this work also reveals the need to expand the definition of zzso to include a central role for zzso zzso
