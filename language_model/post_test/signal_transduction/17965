A major component of the cortical regulation of the zzso zzso zzso system is known to occur via zzso of zzso zzso systems projecting to the zzso zzso The potential zzso role of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso in modulating the zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity was examined using zzso recordings of zzso zzso performed zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso The response of zzso zzso recorded in the zzso zzso to zzso artificial zzso fluid zzso or drug infusion was examined in terms of mean firing rate, percent of spikes fired in zzso zzso and response to electrical stimulation of the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso and zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso with intermittent periods of zzso and cortical stimulation increased the mean zzso cell population firing rate as compared with zzso zzso This effect was reproduced via zzso infusion of a NO zzso zzso of either a zzso inhibitor or NO zzso via reverse zzso did not affect zzso firing rate but increased the percentage of zzso zzso responding to zzso stimulation with an initial zzso followed by a rebound zzso zzso zzso from 40 to zzso NO scavenger infusion also markedly decreased the stimulation intensity required to elicit an zzso response to electrical stimulation of the zzso In single zzso in which the effects of electrical stimulation were observed before and after drug delivery, NO zzso infusion was observed to decrease the onset zzso and extend the duration of the initial zzso phase induced by either zzso or zzso zzso This is the first report showing that zzso NO tone regulates the zzso activity and responsiveness of zzso zzso to cortical and zzso zzso These studies also indicate that zzso NO signaling may play an important role in the integration of information transmitted to zzso zzso output centers via zzso and zzso zzso zzso
