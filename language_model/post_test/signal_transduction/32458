In many cases, zzso modifications constitute indirect markers of zzso zzso The correlation between stability of zzso systems and zzso modifications suggests that they may act as a signal in patterning zzso However, a crucial question remains as to how the repertoire of distinctly modified zzso is zzso We propose here an ubiquitous mechanism of spatial and zzso differentiation of zzso In this model, the diversity of zzso modifications results from a zzso zzso separation which is ensured by zzso switches between zzso mechanisms of zzso Thus, it does not require any hypothetical zzso zzso of zzso activities responsible for the various zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to experimental zzso for a zzso and spatial regulation of zzso zzso
