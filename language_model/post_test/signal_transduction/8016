The assumption that zzso noise during zzso force production controls the stabilization of voluntary zzso force is zzso To verify the assumption the trajectory of zzso force is zzso into voluntary and zzso components and the mathematical model describing the relationship between them is zzso It is shown that the integral of an zzso component zzso zzso plays the role of the controlling zzso realizing the stabilization of a voluntary zzso The stabilization is carried out both in the absence and in the presence of visual zzso Changes of experimental conditions are accompanied by essential changes in the zzso of the zzso component zzso
