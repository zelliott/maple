Complete lack of function of the zzso zzso zzso in humans results in a severe zzso characterized by a lack of mature zzso T cells and zzso zzso T zzso We report zzso an zzso with an inherited zzso zzso of zzso due to a single zzso substitution in a zzso zzso This zzso introduces a new zzso zzso site and allows low levels of normal alternative zzso and of zzso zzso zzso This partial zzso results in a compromised zzso signaling that was totally restored by increased expression of zzso demonstrating that defective zzso of the patient T cells was indeed caused by the low level of zzso zzso This partial zzso zzso was associated with an attenuated clinical and zzso zzso as compared with complete zzso zzso zzso helper zzso populations including, zzso helper T cells, zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso Finally, the patient had no manifestation of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso functions were not compromised, in contrast to what has been observed in mice carrying zzso zzso of zzso This report extends the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso with a residual function of zzso
