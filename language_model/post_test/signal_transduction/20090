zzso zzso proteins are zzso factors that provide intrinsic immunity against infections by viruses like zzso and mouse zzso tumor zzso A3 proteins are zzso by inflammatory zzso such as zzso and zzso via mechanisms that are not fully zzso Using genetic and pharmacological studies on zzso mice and cells, we show that zzso and zzso induce A3 via different zzso independently of each zzso zzso positively regulates mouse zzso zzso zzso expression through zzso and zzso regulates zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso shows some variation in its regulatory zzso Although zzso positive regulation of zzso zzso occurs through zzso it zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso Additional studies on human peripheral blood zzso cells reveal that zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso induction of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso we identified important signaling targets downstream of zzso and zzso that mediate A3 zzso induction by both zzso and zzso Our results provide new insights into the signaling targets that could be manipulated to enhance the zzso store of A3 and potentially enhance A3 zzso function in the zzso
