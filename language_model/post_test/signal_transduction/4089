To examine the zzso specificity and function of two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High levels of expression of zzso did not fully restore either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to zzso the zzso of zzso and did not increase the expression of the zzso marker, zzso on stimulation with zzso zzso did not significantly alter the zzso state or zzso activity of two zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso does not have the same specificity or function as zzso in zzso Further comparison of the two zzso indicated that zzso zzso was zzso zzso to one-tenth as active as zzso when tested against artificial zzso This difference in activity was also observed in zzso with zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Additional analysis with zzso family zzso and zzso zzso as zzso indicated that zzso was consistently more active than zzso having both higher zzso and lower zzso zzso Thus zzso is zzso a much more active zzso than zzso which provides one reason why zzso cannot effectively zzso zzso and substitute for zzso in zzso This work establishes that these two related protein zzso zzso are not interchangeable in zzso and that this is due, at least in part, to quantitative differences in zzso zzso
