We hypothesized that the third complement component zzso zzso fragments zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso and investigated their potential role in zzso zzso induced by zzso We found that zzso counts are lower in zzso mice in response to excessive bleeding as compared to normal zzso and that zzso and zzso enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, zzso and zzso zzso At the molecular level, zzso stimulates in zzso zzso zzso and enhances incorporation of zzso into membrane zzso zzso increasing the responsiveness of zzso to zzso We found that zzso of zzso raft formation by statins decreases zzso zzso production in zzso and in an in zzso model statins ameliorated zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso raft formation could find potential clinical application as a means of zzso some forms of zzso
