We have previously identified zzso as an arthritis severity and zzso damage quantitative trait zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso to analyze the expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 310 genes had significantly different zzso The genes zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso included zzso zzso and zzso as well as genes implicated in zzso responses such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of immune responses zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso stress were zzso in zzso There was an zzso of genes implicated in cancer and zzso zzso such as tumor growth and invasion among the zzso expressed zzso zzso genes like zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in increased levels in zzso whereas zzso of cancer zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were increased in zzso These results suggest that zzso may control arthritis severity, zzso zzso and joint damage via the regulation of the expression of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso zzso These new findings have the potential to generate new targets for therapies aimed at reducing arthritis severity and joint damage in zzso zzso
