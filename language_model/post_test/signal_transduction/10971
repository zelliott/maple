zzso zzso initially also described as zzso zzso are scaffolding zzso that have been previously shown to integrate neurotransmitter receptors into the cortical zzso at zzso zzso We show here that zzso proteins are also crucial in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was found to represent a novel interaction partner of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds specifically to a zzso motif present in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cells to form zzso zzso structures in three-dimensional cultures in a zzso zzso zzso but not zzso has been previously shown to be required for kidney zzso zzso protein mediates sustained zzso and zzso zzso which is crucial for zzso formation, through recruitment of the zzso protein zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein can mediate cellular zzso and provide a molecular mechanism for the biological divergence between the zzso and zzso zzso
