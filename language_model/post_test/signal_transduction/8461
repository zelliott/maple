zzso and efficient cell zzso is vital for the survival of zzso Over the years various components have been identified and zzso as crucial for the zzso of signals in zzso Many of the mechanisms allow for a relatively rapid switching of signals, on or off, with common examples being the G proteins and protein zzso However, recently it has become apparent that other modifications of zzso acids are also important, and this includes reactions with zzso oxide, for example zzso and of particular relevance here, zzso of zzso zzso Such zzso will be dependent on the zzso status of the zzso environment in which that protein zzso and this will in turn be dictated by the presence of zzso and zzso Here, the chemistry of zzso modification of zzso acids is introduced, and a general overview of the role of zzso in zzso signal zzso is zzso
