zzso zzso of 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso border of the zzso and in the lateral zzso project to areas rich in its zzso the zzso hormone 2 zzso zzso These areas include many involved in processing zzso zzso Here we examined the potential role of zzso signaling in zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and mice with deletion of zzso coding sequence or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion of zzso significantly inhibited zzso responses in zzso and zzso tests and attenuated the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had increased response zzso in the zzso zzso test and reduced responses in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso test was not affected in either zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice was zzso reversed by systemic administration of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso which did not affect zzso in zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso in zzso mice at a dose effective in zzso zzso mice administered zzso zzso and both zzso had significantly increased zzso analgesia zzso zzso blocked the increased zzso in zzso zzso or after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased and increased, respectively, in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling zzso zzso very likely by zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso We zzso a new central mechanism for zzso regulation, via zzso acting on the zzso in discrete brain zzso
