In this study, zzso level was found to be zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso level with zzso status was demonstrated in breast cancer tissue zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso release were detected in zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso and involvement of zzso signaling were zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso and excessive zzso of zzso cause zzso zzso release from breast cancer cells, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso The data also showed that zzso prominently zzso zzso zzso expression and promoter zzso The zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso triggered by zzso were zzso zzso binding activities of zzso to the zzso promoter after zzso stimulation were zzso Using zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso expression was further zzso The data support a model where zzso and zzso comprise a positive feedback loop in human breast cancer zzso
