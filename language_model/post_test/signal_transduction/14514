New evidence has demonstrated that the expression of major zzso termed zzso controls the zzso zzso zzso The present work aimed to study the impact of insulin and zzso acids on the expression of one of these zzso the zzso zzso zzso Muscle zzso F box zzso also called zzso in quail muscle zzso zzso First, we characterized zzso in zzso cells and demonstrated the insulin sensitivity of these zzso Second, we showed that insulin reduced zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso B zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression also depended on the availability of an individual zzso acid, zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso reduction of zzso was inhibited by zzso indicating the involvement of the zzso zzso in such zzso In conclusion, expression of the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by both insulin and zzso acids through the zzso zzso
