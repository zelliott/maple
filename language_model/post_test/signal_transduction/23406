zzso fatty liver disease zzso is considered the zzso expression of the zzso syndrome, and its prevalence is zzso The factors that influence the development of fatty liver and its progression to zzso and zzso are not well zzso The zzso hormone, zzso has been associated with an increased risk of zzso in humans and zzso zzso is known to have diverse effects on zzso metabolism including decreasing body fat in zzso presumably through stimulation of zzso via an undefined zzso Previously we described mice with zzso deletion of the zzso signaling mediator, zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso animals have elevated serum zzso reduced body fat, high liver zzso content, and increased serum markers of zzso injury zzso zzso and zzso zzso We aimed to determine whether the zzso of zzso in zzso mice contributed to fatty liver by promoting zzso directly in zzso We generated mice with zzso disruption of zzso zzso and found that zzso resistance in zzso reduced zzso and increased body zzso zzso mice were then crossed to zzso mice, and the zzso zzso animals had increased body fat and decreased zzso despite elevated circulating zzso Furthermore, the increased zzso content, serum zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso observed in zzso mice were nearly zzso with the additional disruption of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results offer novel zzso insights into the zzso effects of zzso on zzso flux and suggest that zzso signaling may play an important regulatory role in the development of zzso
