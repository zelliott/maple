In order to clarify the role of zzso second zzso systems in the cortisol zzso from bovine zzso zzso cells, the cells were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with various zzso When the zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso of zzso a prompt cortisol zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso As the cells were zzso with zzso and zzso slow but persistent cortisol zzso was zzso but in the case of 4 zzso no such effect was zzso The zzso cortisol zzso was inhibited by simultaneous applications of zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso but no significant zzso was zzso by protein zzso A (A zzso zzso The results seem to indicate that in the zzso cortisol zzso zzso may stimulate the initial stage, while C zzso may be involved mainly in the late phase of the zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was also effective in zzso cortisol zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso cortisol zzso was suppressed by an A zzso inhibitor but not affected by zzso or C zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were added simultaneously at zzso lower than those required to induce the cortisol zzso zzso a marked cortisol zzso was zzso suggesting that a zzso action exists between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cortisol zzso was suppressed by zzso red, an inhibitor of zzso transport in the zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso only a transient cortisol zzso simultaneous addition of zzso with zzso or zzso caused a potent and sustained cortisol zzso The zzso due to zzso on the zzso (or zzso cortisol zzso was inhibited by the addition of a zzso inhibitor or a C zzso zzso but not such effect was caused by A zzso zzso From the present investigation, it was concluded that the zzso zzso signal zzso may simulate the cortisol synthesis systems in the zzso of zzso zzso
