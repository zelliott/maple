This study examines the role of the unconventional gaseous signaling zzso zzso oxide zzso on the regulation of heart rate in the Vietnamese stick zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and Western zzso with an zzso against NO zzso zzso we identified the presence of zzso in zzso present throughout the zzso of the zzso zzso We propose that NO is delivered to heart muscle tissue via zzso circulating within the zzso In the present study, stimulation of NO levels by the application of the NO donor zzso and zzso led to a zzso decrease in heart zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso led to a recovery of heart rate, without zzso heart rate on its zzso Finally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar zzso effects on stick insect heart rate as did the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is most likely the second zzso in the stick insect NO signaling zzso zzso to the zzso effect of NO on other insect hearts, we have found that NO zzso stick insect heart rate independently from any nervous system zzso in a similar zzso fashion as that of zzso zzso
