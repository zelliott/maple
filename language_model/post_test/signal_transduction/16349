zzso treatment exerts a protective effect on experimental zzso zzso zzso and is under clinical trial for multiple sclerosis zzso zzso have been suspected to protect from zzso zzso through their capacity to exert zzso as well as zzso zzso Despite the obvious impacts of zzso on the zzso of multiple sclerosis and zzso the dominant cellular target that zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso in zzso is still ill zzso Using conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and bone zzso zzso experiments, we show that expression of zzso is critical in zzso cells but not in zzso ones to mediate the zzso zzso effect on zzso and zzso cell zzso resulting in zzso zzso Furthermore, using newly created cell zzso zzso mice, we demonstrate that zzso is required in T zzso but neither in zzso nor zzso cells, for zzso zzso of zzso cell differentiation and protection from zzso Lastly, in absence of zzso in host zzso zzso we further show that zzso signaling in T cells is necessary and sufficient to mediate the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso These data uncover T zzso as a major and zzso cellular target responsible for the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
