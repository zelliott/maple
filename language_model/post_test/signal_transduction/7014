The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can promote the growth of several plant zzso The model plant zzso zzso was chosen as host plant to gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern this zzso The determination of differential gene expression in zzso roots after zzso with either zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso was achieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso increases the number of lateral roots and root zzso and zzso the internal zzso concentration in the zzso The zzso root zzso zzso extensive changes on zzso zzso and the effects are more pronounced at later time zzso The zzso bacterial strain zzso changes in zzso and zzso zzso as well as in plant cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, does not elicit these zzso changes to the same zzso There are qualitative and quantitative differences between zzso responses to the zzso zzso strain and the zzso zzso zzso strain, based on both zzso and zzso zzso This illustrates the major role played by zzso in the zzso interaction, and possibly also in other zzso zzso
