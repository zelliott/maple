zzso zzso zzso zzso is among the most aggressive zzso known and is characterized with rapid growth, early invasion, and complete zzso to current zzso Here we report that zzso a small zzso from a Chinese zzso could zzso inhibit proliferation in zzso zzso in zzso and invasion in a zzso model in human zzso cell line zzso cells at zzso zzso We further zzso that zzso zzso the nuclear zzso zzso zzso activity via blocking the association of zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso in the early stage and via decreasing the protein level of zzso in the late zzso zzso of the zzso targeting genes zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso zzso zzso is significantly reduced by zzso in both zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines, which are well known to be critical for zzso zzso and invasion in solid zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may function as a small zzso inhibitor of tumor zzso and invasion and may provide novel zzso insights into the potential therapy for human zzso
