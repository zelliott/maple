zzso primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are related zzso of neural crest origin with primitive neural zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso is a critical zzso zzso for primitive neural crest zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso affects biological characteristics such as growth and zzso while in zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell line can be induced to differentiate upon treatment with nerve growth factor zzso indicating the integrity of the cellular machinery necessary for zzso The present study zzso whether zzso can induce differentiation in zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso receptors zzso and treatment with zzso induced zzso of zzso together with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso biological effects were growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso and these changes were associated with increased expression of zzso reduction of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly inhibited the effects of zzso on growth, zzso and zzso while an inhibitor of zzso reduced zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso pathways are critical components of zzso effects in zzso zzso Additional comparative analyses of zzso effects in two zzso cell lines zzso zzso and a zzso cell line zzso showed pronounced differentiation in zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso can induce zzso differentiation of zzso including zzso zzso These findings clearly indicate that the zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in controlling the major properties of zzso cells and may provide a potential therapeutic target for zzso
