zzso growth factor 2 zzso and its main zzso zzso have been shown to promote zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso However, scant information is available on the zzso activity of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a selective zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso proliferation and zzso zzso We demonstrated that rat primary zzso zzso significant amounts of zzso and its zzso zzso of zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso by measuring the expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso and the production of type I collagen using zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso in zzso strongly suppressed zzso growth induced by zzso (10 zzso and zzso This effect correlated with the suppression of zzso zzso zzso activity and its downstream targets zzso D1 and zzso In addition, PO zzso (20 zzso administration significantly decreased zzso collagen deposition and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso these studies suggest that selective blocking of the zzso zzso could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso zzso
