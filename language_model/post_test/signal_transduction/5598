zzso growth zzso zzso regulates a variety of cellular responses that are dependent on the zzso stage and on the origins of the cell or the zzso In mature zzso and especially in zzso of zzso origin, zzso is generally considered to be a growth inhibitor that may also promote zzso The zzso cells of the zzso organ zzso are adjacent to and responsible for the developing zzso layer on zzso zzso Once the zzso layer reaches its full zzso the tall zzso zzso zzso zzso and a portion of these zzso zzso become zzso Here we investigate whether zzso plays a role in zzso of the zzso zzso We demonstrate in zzso that zzso lineage cells are highly susceptible to zzso growth arrest and are prone to zzso cell zzso We also demonstrate in zzso that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso organ at significantly higher levels than in the earlier zzso zzso zzso This increased expression of zzso zzso with an increase in expression of the zzso organ zzso zzso gene and with a decrease in the zzso zzso : zzso expression zzso We conclude that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso during the maturation stage of zzso zzso
