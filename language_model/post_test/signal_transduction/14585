As zzso traverse the female tract from zzso to zzso they experience a steroid zzso which due to zzso zzso they can only respond to via zzso zzso This environment mediates events including zzso changes in zzso patterns, zzso and zzso zzso Current knowledge of the events, calcium signaling zzso and potential identity of receptors involved is reviewed in light of recent data, with a context for further work in the field, and emphasizing the importance of steroids as a mixed zzso zzso zzso candidates are considered in light of recent findings, including novel classes of receptors such as a zzso membrane zzso zzso or zzso complex with zzso zzso binding zzso the best candidate so far for zzso activity in human zzso Given the number of other alternative candidates and the apparent diversity of the signaling pathways zzso the presence of multiple species of zzso receptors should not be zzso Given that zzso dysfunction is the most common defined cause of infertility, advances in our currently limited knowledge of these pathways and events are crucial to not only create better therapies but also improve rational zzso
