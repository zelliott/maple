We have investigated by zzso the appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the zzso development of the zzso of the pigmented zzso We show that a sudden increase in zzso takes place during zzso day five zzso when rod outer segments begin to zzso zzso develops rapidly in the following zzso zzso is restricted to the developing zzso outer zzso sparing other retinal cells, as confirmed by electron zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso follows a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It appears that zzso is expressed when the zzso zzso compartments are already formed, and represents a specific marker of late zzso zzso The appearance of zzso during development is temporally correlated with the appearance of other proteins of the zzso zzso
