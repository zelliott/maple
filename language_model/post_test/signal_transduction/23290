zzso zzso plays the critical role in the cardiac zzso of various origin, development of chambers zzso and progression of heart zzso zzso of zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso regulation, zzso and zzso zzso of quantitative expression profiling study of main zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of right atrium zzso of patients with a coronary heart disease, exposed to various types of surgical treatments depending on weight of a clinical finding zzso reconstruction of the geometry of left zzso zzso zzso zzso or coronary artery bypass zzso in case of zzso zzso of zzso are zzso In patients with sizable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression level of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso times lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to patients with zzso shape of the heart zzso zzso zzso zzso level of zzso gene zzso zzso regulatory zzso B and zzso and zzso genes for zzso factors did not differ in studied zzso of zzso Thus, lower expression of zzso and zzso genes in atrium zzso can be related to expressed zzso zzso zzso Further studies of relation quantitative expression profiling of zzso zzso genes with the level of damage of zzso is essential what may have important outcome for the prevention of adverse events of zzso treatments in patients with zzso zzso
