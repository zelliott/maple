zzso zzso in peripheral zzso such as the retinal compartment of the eye, are critical to anticipating changing zzso zzso zzso shedding of retinal zzso cell discs with subsequent zzso by the neighboring retinal pigmented zzso zzso is essential for removal of toxic zzso and lifelong survival of these zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso can lead to severe retinal pathology, but the zzso mechanisms remain poorly zzso By first documenting a zzso burst of zzso zzso events in the mouse eye in the morning compared with the afternoon by serial block face imaging, we established time points to assess zzso zzso by zzso sequencing zzso We identified 365 zzso zzso transcripts that implicated the zzso zzso signaling network zzso the discrete steps of zzso zzso Moreover, examination of overlapping zzso sites by core clock zzso factors and promoter elements of these zzso genes provided a functional basis for the zzso cycling of these zzso zzso also revealed zzso expression of 16 long zzso zzso zzso and key zzso zzso zzso critical for zzso gene zzso Our zzso and zzso characterization reveals a complex global landscape of overlapping and temporally controlled networks driving the essential zzso process in the zzso
