zzso stress is a common point in neurodegenerative diseases, widely connected with zzso zzso In this study, we screened seven natural products from zzso sources against hydrogen zzso insult in primary cortical zzso an zzso stress in zzso zzso We showed the ability of these compounds to inhibit zzso zzso and to reduce zzso release after 12 h zzso Among the tested compounds, the zzso zzso and the red zzso zzso zzso stand zzso These two compounds displayed the most complete protection against zzso stress with zzso function improvement, zzso production zzso and increase of zzso zzso levels, zzso and zzso Further investigations confirmed that zzso acts over the zzso pathway, as a zzso nuclear zzso zzso and is able to strongly inhibit the effect of the zzso zzso zzso over zzso zzso pointing to zzso as a cellular target for this zzso In addition, both compounds were able to reduce zzso activity induced by the zzso zzso zzso but zzso failed to inhibit zzso effects and it did not act over the zzso zzso as was the case for zzso These results show that zzso zzso could be useful for the development of new drugs for prevention of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and cerebral zzso
