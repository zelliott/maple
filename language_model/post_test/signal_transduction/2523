We have recently reported zzso that two naturally occurring zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), both found in patients with inherited severe insulin resistance, markedly impaired zzso zzso zzso with both zzso receptors being unable to mediate the stimulation of zzso synthesis or zzso by insulin when expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso However, these zzso did not fully prevent zzso zzso in response to insulin in these cells, suggesting that zzso alone may not be sufficient to mediate zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we have demonstrated that these zzso also impair the ability of the insulin zzso to activate the zzso factor zzso and promote zzso zzso to the plasma zzso Although at low zzso of insulin, the zzso receptors were impaired in their ability to stimulate the zzso zzso of zzso at higher insulin zzso we confirmed that the cells expressing the zzso receptors showed significantly increased zzso zzso of zzso compared with parental zzso zzso In addition, at comparable insulin zzso the association of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso activity of zzso zzso were significantly enhanced in cells expressing the zzso zzso In contrast, no significant stimulation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso loading of zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso was seen in cell lines expressing these zzso zzso Thus, no zzso of any measurable zzso or zzso response was zzso despite significant zzso zzso of zzso and its association with zzso in cells zzso expressing the zzso insulin zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso alone may be insufficient to mediate a wide range of the zzso and zzso effects of zzso Additionally, the data provide support for the notion that insulin zzso of Ras is more closely linked with zzso and not zzso zzso
