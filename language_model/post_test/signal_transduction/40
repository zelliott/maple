In zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso activity stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso analogous to reduced zzso load in zzso This study investigated in contracting zzso the role of zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso arrest of zzso resulted in low zzso localized zzso levels relative to contracting zzso In arrested zzso ROCK activity was decreased zzso and paralleled a loss in zzso zzso zzso ROCK zzso in contracting zzso increased zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso This stimulation was zzso as evident from zzso with the zzso zzso A zzso effect of zzso treatment on the promoter activity of zzso zzso factor was zzso zzso zzso was not altered by zzso of the zzso serum response factor zzso alone or in combination with zzso Furthermore, zzso another zzso zzso factor, induced rather than zzso zzso zzso This study shows that zzso activity suppresses zzso gene expression via zzso zzso zzso This zzso is likely to be accomplished by a zzso factor other than zzso zzso or zzso
