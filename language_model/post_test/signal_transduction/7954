zzso can be converted to its zzso zzso homocysteine zzso zzso properties of these zzso zzso have been attributed to protein zzso increased zzso stress, DNA damage and zzso This study used pancreatic zzso zzso to examine functional defects caused by acute and long-term exposure to homocysteine zzso in comparison with zzso Acute and long-term exposure to both agents caused zzso inhibitions of zzso insulin zzso while zzso the zzso responses to zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso and zzso Acute zzso also caused significant reduction in the zzso of zzso membrane zzso but no effects on changes of zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso Cellular insulin content and DNA damage were not altered following culture, however, there were early signs of zzso consistent with impaired cellular zzso In conclusion, exposure to homocysteine zzso like homocysteine, induced zzso dysfunction and demise by mechanisms independent of changes in membrane potential and zzso
