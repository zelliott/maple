The zzso zzso produced during zzso has been reported to participate in the development of cardiovascular disease associated with zzso zzso The present study was designed to test a hypothesis that zzso causes coronary zzso dysfunction through zzso trafficking and fusion to cell zzso membrane raft zzso zzso and formation of zzso zzso 

By using zzso zzso it was found that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in MR clusters and zzso zzso to these MR clusters in bovine coronary zzso zzso cells zzso leading to zzso of zzso with a zzso increase in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was found to be enriched in such membrane zzso complexes of zzso zzso fluorescent dye zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso induced the fusion of zzso to cell zzso and incorporation of acid zzso and its product, zzso in such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso in small coronary arteries (by zzso which was blocked by zzso function inhibitor and MR zzso 

These results suggest that zzso molecular trafficking and zzso zzso zzso in cell membrane may mediate the assembly of zzso zzso and their zzso in response to zzso zzso in zzso thereby producing zzso dysfunction in coronary zzso
