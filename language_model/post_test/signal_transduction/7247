zzso emerge as crucial cells for proper zzso functioning in the developing and adult zzso zzso and zzso are zzso generated from the same pool of neural stem cells zzso Tight regulation of the zzso switch is critical for zzso the generation of a balanced number of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso circuit formation, since newborn zzso regulate zzso zzso This review focuses on signaling pathways that instruct zzso incorporating recently discovered intrinsic and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is inhibited during zzso to prevent premature zzso zzso At the onset of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes like zzso zzso zzso protein to change zzso zzso In turn, zzso is initiated by signals received from newborn zzso We highlight how key molecular pathways like zzso and zzso are integrated in a complex network of environmental signals and zzso and zzso regulators to determine zzso zzso It is essential to understand zzso differentiation in respect to future zzso therapies for brain diseases, as transplanted zzso zzso become zzso As emphasized in this review, many clues in this respect can be learned from zzso
