zzso available zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso which inhibit both soluble zzso and zzso forms zzso of zzso eliminating all zzso zzso have successfully treated zzso diseases including zzso These have potentially serious side effects such as zzso of zzso zzso tuberculosis and, therefore, more specific zzso of zzso zzso pathways may maintain clinical efficacy while reducing adverse zzso To determine the effects of specific pharmacological zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and migration, we used a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that selective zzso of zzso is sufficient to suppress zzso by limiting inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso T cell migration into the zzso However, zzso of both zzso and zzso is required to inhibit zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso major zzso complex class II and zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso via zzso is sufficient to mediate tissue zzso In confirmation, zzso zzso of zzso alone did not suppress disease, and inflammatory cells that migrated into the eye were zzso generating zzso thus causing structural damage to the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso and therefore zzso We conclude that zzso is required for inflammatory cell zzso into target zzso but at the tissue site zzso of both zzso and zzso is required to inhibit zzso zzso and to protect from tissue zzso
