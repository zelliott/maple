zzso zzso in mice causes a dramatic loss of zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso This early disruption of the zzso zzso in zzso mice is characterized by increased spontaneous zzso activity levels during the habitual sleep phase of these zzso These findings are reminiscent of the spontaneous zzso in mice zzso zzso with zzso which is caused by an extensive zzso zzso of the zzso The present study investigated whether an imbalance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by increased zzso zzso binding specifically in the zzso zzso of adult zzso mice, indicating zzso in zzso zzso levels that correlated to zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso In addition, zzso release of zzso and zzso indicated an altered balance between these zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso To determine whether the increased zzso zzso was involved in the spontaneous zzso during the light phase observed in zzso zzso we treated zzso and control mice with the selective irreversible zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to decrease zzso zzso Reduction of zzso levels in zzso mice decreased their locomotor activity to normal levels, whereas the same treatment increased the locomotor activity levels of control zzso Taken together, our results indicate zzso in zzso zzso in zzso mice that zzso their spontaneous zzso
