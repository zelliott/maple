Mice that lack either zzso zzso on B zzso or zzso zzso zzso on activated T zzso are able neither to make zzso zzso or zzso zzso responses, nor to generate zzso zzso (the sites of formation of memory B zzso It has been assumed that these zzso were the result of an absence of signals to B cells through zzso Here we show that the failure to signal T cells through zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso Administration of soluble zzso in zzso to zzso knockout mice, restoring the missing signal through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, T cells primed in the absence of zzso (in zzso knockout zzso are unable to help normal B cells to class switch or to form zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of T cells through zzso zzso causes their differentiation into cells that help B cells to make mature zzso responses and to generate memory zzso
