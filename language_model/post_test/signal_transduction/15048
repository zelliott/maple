Total zzso of zzso zzso zzso main constituents extracted from zzso zzso a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, have been shown to be an effective agent on zzso 

To investigate the effect and mechanism underlying in which zzso promote human zzso zzso stem and zzso cells to differentiate into zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells derived from zzso zzso blood zzso was determined by zzso zzso system and zzso for zzso zzso The changes of zzso expression in zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells were detected with Western zzso and flow zzso respectively, and observed under laser scanning zzso microscope zzso zzso was performed to examine zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso 

The addition of zzso zzso zzso increased the colony formation rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso alone used significantly increased the zzso content, the addition of zzso evidently reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso on the surface membrane of zzso cells but did not change the expression of zzso in total zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso may enhance the zzso differentiation of zzso stem and zzso cells via zzso zzso signaling zzso
