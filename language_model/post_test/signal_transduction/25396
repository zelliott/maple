zzso an zzso belonging to the zzso family, is widely expressed in zzso zzso including the zzso Here, it may serve two different functions, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso and the formation of the zzso zzso In order to identify the cellular sources of zzso expression in the brain, we generated a zzso zzso zzso against zzso rat zzso With zzso selected areas of rat and human brain were zzso Clearly, in both species zzso zzso was predominantly detected in distinct populations of zzso especially cortical zzso Also, principal zzso in zzso regions like the zzso and in the zzso robustly expressed zzso zzso When comparing the overall zzso expression with zzso data available for zzso and zzso zzso zzso the observed pattern may argue in favor of an zzso zzso function rather than fueling the alternative zzso of zzso zzso The putative neurotransmitter zzso is seemingly involved with mental zzso zzso zzso may be similarly important for zzso The normal expression profile of the protein as described here may therefore be altered under pathological zzso
