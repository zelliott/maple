zzso plants to hypoxic conditions greatly improves their zzso stress tolerance by enhancing the activities of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso may also be involved in these zzso responses because its synthesis is increased in roots under hypoxic zzso Here it is reported that zzso of wheat zzso with an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso enhanced zzso of zzso in the roots of wheat zzso and enhanced their tolerance of zzso conditions through increasing the expression of genes zzso ethanol zzso zzso alcohol zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso formation in root was induced by zzso zzso and was further induced by growth under zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of three genes zzso respiratory burst zzso zzso (a plant zzso of zzso in zzso zzso which has a role in the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in roots of zzso zzso with zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso partly suppressed the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in adaptation of wheat zzso to zzso conditions through controlling zzso zzso formation and the expression of genes zzso ethanol zzso zzso
