In zzso zzso integral tight junction zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso -5 and zzso are detected and play crucial roles in the barrier to keep zzso in zzso zzso away from the blood zzso zzso shows a zzso zzso increasing from zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are expressed in the whole liver zzso Although zzso expression zzso zzso channels in tight junctions of zzso cells, the zzso functions and regulation of zzso in zzso remain zzso zzso M zzso is a zzso zzso implicated in the differentiation of zzso that zzso formation of zzso zzso junctions in fetal zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso could induce expression and function of zzso in zzso zzso immortalized mouse and primary cultured zzso rat zzso In the immortalized mouse and primary cultured zzso rat zzso treatment with zzso markedly increased zzso and protein of zzso together with formation of developed networks of zzso zzso The increase of zzso enhanced the zzso barrier function which depended on molecular zzso The increase of zzso expression induced by zzso in zzso zzso was regulated through distinct signaling pathways including zzso These results suggest that expression of zzso in zzso zzso may play a specific role as controlling the size of zzso zzso in the barrier to keep zzso in zzso zzso
