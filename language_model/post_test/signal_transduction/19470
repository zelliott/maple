zzso zzso spontaneously arises in the zzso skeleton of large breed dogs and shares many zzso and molecular biological characteristics with human zzso The standard treatment for zzso in both species is zzso or zzso surgery, followed by zzso Unfortunately, zzso is an aggressive cancer with a high zzso zzso zzso of zzso with regard to its zzso potential and zzso resistance will improve both zzso capabilities and treatment zzso 

We analyzed zzso primary zzso tissue from dogs treated with limb zzso followed by zzso or zzso drug zzso zzso were selected from two groups: dogs with disease free intervals zzso of less than 100 days zzso zzso 8) and greater than 300 days zzso zzso zzso Gene expression was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed with a zzso zzso A subset of genes was confirmed using zzso and used in zzso analysis to predict zzso zzso gene zzso analysis was conducted on genes selected using a standard zzso zzso The genes identified using this approach were converted to their human zzso and assigned to functional pathways using the zzso zzso zzso 

Potential zzso were identified using gene expression zzso analysis and 11 zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso genes were validated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models using the zzso profiles predicted patient outcomes with zzso accuracy in the training set and up to zzso accuracy upon zzso cross zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso in pathways associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso immune responses, zzso zzso and focal zzso 

This profiling study has identified potential new zzso to predict patient outcome in zzso and new pathways that may be targeted for therapeutic zzso
