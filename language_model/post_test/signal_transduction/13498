We reported previously that zzso is expressed in normal and transformed zzso We show here that the expression of both zzso zzso proteins is induced rapidly and zzso in chicken zzso bone zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso in response to chicken zzso growth factor zzso an avian zzso growth factor required for survival, zzso and colony formation of avian zzso zzso zzso expression is also rapidly induced in chicken bone zzso zzso human zzso and mouse zzso zzso in response to zzso and/or zzso zzso The rapid induction of zzso after treatment of chicken bone zzso zzso by zzso is blunted after zzso or zzso of zzso suggesting a role of zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso Because zzso is localized in the nucleus of zzso and binds to DNA in zzso the zzso of its expression suggest a role for zzso in the zzso within the nucleus of specific signals received at the cell membrane and involved in securing the survival and/or the development of functional competence of these zzso
