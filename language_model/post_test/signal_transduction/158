The zzso zzso transforming growth zzso 1 zzso has attracted much attention for its potential role in the zzso of idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a novel zzso zzso extracted from zzso can bind zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether zzso is capable of combating zzso pulmonary zzso events both in zzso and in zzso and to investigate the possible underlying zzso 

Surface zzso resonance was used to uncover the binding profiles between the compound and zzso zzso zzso flow zzso Western zzso analysis, zzso protein zzso and zzso gelatin zzso were used to probe the zzso mechanisms of zzso The in zzso zzso efficacy was evaluated in a zzso zzso rat zzso 

We report that zzso a new kind of zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso in zzso and zzso pulmonary zzso in zzso Our results indicated that zzso competitively inhibited zzso interaction through its high binding affinity for zzso Moreover, zzso arrested zzso human zzso pulmonary zzso zzso cell zzso collagen deposition and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso was also a potent zzso of zzso rat pulmonary zzso in zzso as evidenced by improved pathological settings and decreased lung collagen zzso 

zzso in particular, and perhaps zzso in general, offer better pharmacological profiles with appreciably few side effects and represent a promising class of drug candidates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso published online 22 June zzso
