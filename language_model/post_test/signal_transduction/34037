We have previously reported that there is an increase in zzso zzso activity secondary to increase in zzso in zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso B zzso is recruited to the plasma membrane by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso play critical roles in signal zzso and zzso of zzso In the present investigation, we have studied the effect of zzso modification of the activity of zzso We have examined eight patients and eight controls and obtained results showing that zzso activity of zzso is increased in zzso of zzso from patients with zzso compared to normal volunteer zzso We have obtained results showing that there is no correlation of zzso of zzso on its zzso activity although Western blots show the zzso has increased zzso These results suggest that zzso modification by zzso does not control zzso in zzso zzso We concluded that the enhanced activity of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso from patients with zzso is zzso by different zzso
