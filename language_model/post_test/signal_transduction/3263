zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso plays critical roles in the spatial control of protein zzso However, optical limitations of studying zzso transport in zzso mean that there is little zzso insight into how transcripts are packaged and linked to motors, and how the movement of zzso complexes on the zzso is zzso Here, we have zzso transport of zzso containing specific zzso in zzso We show directly that zzso that are either zzso localized or zzso in zzso zzso associate with the zzso motor and move zzso on individual zzso with zzso zzso exhibiting a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso signals increase the average number of zzso and zzso components recruited to individual zzso We find that, surprisingly, individual zzso molecules are present in zzso zzso in zzso and provide evidence that this is also the case in zzso Thus, zzso zzso is not obligatory for zzso Our findings lead to a model in which zzso zzso signals produce highly polarized zzso of transcript populations through modest changes in motor copy number on single zzso zzso
