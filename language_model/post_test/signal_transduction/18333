The second zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in a host of cellular processes including growth arrest and zzso zzso has been reported to have effects on both protein zzso and zzso and may constitute an important component of stress response in various zzso We have examined in detail the relationship between zzso signaling and the zzso of an important signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso and its downstream target, protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso was observed following stimulation of cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso caused a partial loss zzso of zzso zzso This reduction was not a result of decreased zzso or zzso generation by zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso 308 and zzso zzso require zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently reduced by treatment with zzso whereas zzso 308 zzso remained zzso In further experiments, zzso appeared to accelerate zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso of a zzso zzso with this, the reduction in zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso 308 zzso was abolished in cells treated with these zzso revealing a novel mechanism of regulation of zzso 308 zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is the principal target of a zzso zzso
