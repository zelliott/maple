zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso generating a new zzso zzso that functions as a zzso zzso by binding to sites on the zzso We prepared zzso zzso directed against specific zzso zzso to study the zzso zzso interactions required for signaling the increase in zzso zzso to zzso We used zzso zzso directed against the zzso sequences corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by measuring changes in zzso zzso concentration zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso loaded with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso clearance rate (a measure of zzso zzso was determined across the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the entire zzso zzso extension, inhibited the zzso increases in zzso and the zzso zzso clearance rate zzso zzso reduction in both zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against a sequence within the zzso extension, inhibited zzso of the zzso increase in zzso and zzso of the increased zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited these responses by 70 and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso had no effect on either zzso We conclude that zzso extension and loop 2 are critical sites for zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and thus lead to increased zzso and zzso zzso to zzso
