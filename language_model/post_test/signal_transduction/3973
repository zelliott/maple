Positive selection is an obligatory step during zzso T cell zzso It is associated with rescue of short-lived, self major zzso complex zzso zzso from programmed cell death, zzso T cell lineage commitment, and induction of zzso differentiation zzso T cell zzso zzso signaling during positive selection can be closely zzso by targeting zzso on immature zzso to cortical zzso cells in zzso via hybrid zzso We show that selection of zzso T cell lineage cells in mice deficient for zzso class I and zzso class II expression can be zzso in zzso by two zzso T cell zzso signaling steps, whereas a single zzso signal leads only to induction of short-lived zzso zzso These zzso remain susceptible to a second zzso signal for zzso h providing an estimate for the duration of positive selection in zzso While both zzso signals induce differentiation steps, only the second one zzso long-term survival on immature zzso In further support of the zzso model of positive selection we provide evidence that zzso T cell lineage cells rescued by a single hybrid zzso pulse in zzso class zzso mice are zzso by zzso class zzso
