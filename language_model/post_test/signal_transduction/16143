Increased numbers of T regulatory cells zzso key zzso of immune zzso were reported in human and zzso malaria and it is current opinion that these cells play a role in balancing protective immunity and zzso during zzso However, the mechanisms governing their expansion during malaria infection are not completely zzso In this article we show that soluble extracts of zzso zzso zzso but not equivalent preparation of zzso zzso induce the differentiation of zzso activated zzso cells in zzso endowed with strong zzso zzso zzso activate zzso zzso bound on the membrane of zzso cells, thus allowing the zzso interaction with zzso zzso and inducing zzso gene expression and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso is significantly reduced by a zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso activity, and completely inhibited by the combined action of such inhibitor and zzso to a zzso zzso zzso adhesive protein zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso molecules are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso bound on the membrane of activated zzso cells and suggest that, in malaria infection, this mechanism could contribute to the expansion of zzso with different zzso zzso
