The exposure to particulate matter with a mean aerodynamic diameter zzso zzso zzso from urban zones is considered to be a risk factor in the development of zzso The aim of this work was to determine if zzso exposure zzso factors related to the acquisition of a zzso zzso such as zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso of zzso an increase in zzso activity and changes in cell zzso To test our hypothesis, zzso from an industrial zone zzso and a commercial zone zzso were collected, and human zzso lung cell cultures zzso were exposed to a zzso zzso concentration (10 zzso for 24 h and 48 zzso The results showed that zzso exposure induced an increase in zzso stress fibers and caused the zzso stabilization of zzso via zzso at zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso on zzso Changes in the cell cycle or zzso were not observed, but an increase in zzso activity was zzso The zzso from zzso caused more dramatic effects in lung zzso We conclude that zzso exposure induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the acquisition of a zzso zzso in lung zzso These zzso could have zzso implications regarding the zzso potential of zzso
