Cellular calcium is an important second zzso for growth zzso We sought to identify potentially important receptors on prostate tumor cells by screening over 20 zzso for their ability to increase zzso free calcium zzso in several human prostate tumor cell zzso 

zzso calcium zzso was detected using zzso 

We found zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso in the advanced tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to elevate zzso in an immortalized human prostate cell zzso zzso of potency studies suggested the presence of zzso zzso receptors for zzso on prostate zzso zzso zzso studies also revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B at zzso zzso in responding tumor zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso independent prostate tumor cell lines express multiple receptors capable of zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso receptors may be selectively expressed and/or coupled to calcium signaling during prostate tumor zzso zzso sensitive cellular events may therefore contribute to the progression of prostate zzso
