zzso raised against the zzso zzso of the zzso of the retinal zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The same zzso also reacted with a 100 zzso protein zzso found in rat liver zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso was specifically inhibited by the zzso zzso with similar zzso zzso causing 50% zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso This similarity in zzso profiles implies that zzso contains within its structure the zzso sequence shared by both alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso distribution studies demonstrated that zzso was particularly enriched in the liver and zzso but was also present in other rat zzso as well as in a number of cell lines zzso In the liver, zzso was found in both the soluble and membrane zzso The zzso form of zzso was specifically localized to an zzso fraction zzso zzso previously shown to be a zzso but zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that both the zzso and zzso forms of zzso occurred as a series of 100 zzso zzso with considerable charge zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso of both alpha zzso and alpha i facilitate their association with their respective zzso this region has been functionally assigned as the zzso binding zzso Therefore the presence of an zzso similar region within zzso together with its zzso to the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso may be a zzso binding protein involved in zzso zzso
