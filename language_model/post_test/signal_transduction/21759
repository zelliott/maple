The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Area 24) is implicated in the zzso of schizophrenia due to its normal functions and connectivity together with reports of zzso zzso and neurotransmitter aberrations within this brain area in the disease zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was employed to scan and compare the zzso gray matter zzso between schizophrenia zzso zzso 10) and control zzso zzso 10) zzso human zzso This zzso approach has detected 42 protein spots with altered levels in the schizophrenia zzso which to our knowledge is the first zzso analysis of the zzso in zzso Thirty nine of these proteins were subsequently identified using mass zzso and functionally classified into metabolism and zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso zzso Some of the identified proteins have previously been implicated in the disease zzso and some offer new insights into zzso zzso these zzso the genes zzso these zzso their functions and interactions may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso symptoms characteristic of zzso
