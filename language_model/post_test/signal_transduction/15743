zzso is a cell surface zzso important in the zzso of zzso cells during immune zzso In zzso and zzso cells, engagement of zzso by its zzso zzso provides signals critical for zzso and T zzso immune responses, zzso In B cells, zzso signaling has a major role in regulating cell zzso zzso production, and memory B cell zzso zzso engagement results in the formation of a zzso complex that mediates zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and other signaling zzso However, the mechanisms that link zzso to these signaling events have been only partially zzso Known components of the zzso signaling complex include members of the zzso zzso factor zzso family of zzso We previously showed that the zzso family member zzso mediates recruitment of zzso protein zzso to the zzso domain of zzso suggesting that zzso has a role in the zzso signaling zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso we used zzso cell gene targeting to generate mouse B cell lines deficient in zzso We found that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were defective in zzso zzso We also found that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins to the zzso signaling complex was zzso in zzso cells, potentially explaining the zzso in zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression reversed the defects in cellular zzso and zzso These results reveal zzso as a key component of the zzso signaling zzso
