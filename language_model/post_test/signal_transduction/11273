zzso zzso a zzso member of the tumor necrosis zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso formation and bone zzso zzso hormone zzso a potent zzso of zzso formation, suppresses zzso zzso expression in zzso and in zzso To determine the molecular basis of this zzso we analyzed the effects of zzso on the human zzso promoter zzso to zzso fused with zzso reporter gene in stable and transient zzso into rat zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso promoter expression was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso activity of the zzso promoter zzso at 8 h followed by a gradual decrease with zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso To ascertain the signal zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso gene zzso we compared the effects of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which stimulate the zzso pathway, and other zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso a similar zzso response on zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that do not stimulate zzso production, had no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso while zzso and calcium zzso zzso which increase zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso of zzso promoter zzso To delineate the promoter sequences that mediate the zzso effects of zzso on zzso transcription, we analyzed systematic deletions of the zzso promoter for responsiveness in transient zzso zzso The major zzso effects of zzso were localized to 391 zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the promoter region led to a complete loss of zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso are zzso at the zzso level through zzso elements in the zzso zzso The similar zzso response of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso regulates zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso signal zzso zzso
