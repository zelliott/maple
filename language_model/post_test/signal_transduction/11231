zzso zzso zzso signals play a decisive role in regulating the growth and differentiation of both normal and zzso prostate cells by triggering the regulation of target zzso in a process in which zzso zzso have critical zzso Because of the highly zzso expression pattern of zzso we studied the role of this zzso protein in prostate zzso zzso of zzso was limited to zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner, and suppression was specific to zzso with which zzso physically zzso zzso of zzso further zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso and suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso suppressed growth of zzso prostate cancer cells, which could be zzso by additional zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso cells was not affected by zzso These results suggest that zzso functions as an zzso zzso to zzso the complex zzso signaling and subsequent growth regulation of prostate cancer zzso In addition to the loss of zzso zzso maintaining zzso may be an important step for prostate cancer cells to tolerate the zzso function of zzso Altogether, our data present a novel mechanism for the zzso repression of zzso zzso which can be interpreted to a zzso zzso
