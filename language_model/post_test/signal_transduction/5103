We investigated the relative important role of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso pig zzso smooth muscle zzso following zzso outlet obstruction zzso 

zzso outlet obstruction was created by placement of a silver zzso jump rings loosely round the zzso junction of zzso zzso zzso operated zzso pig underwent a similar protocol without application of the ring and served as zzso zzso zzso zzso strips from control zzso pigs and those subjected to zzso weeks of zzso were mounted zzso for zzso force recording in zzso relaxing solution on zzso zzso The effect of zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso zzso was studied during sustained zzso zzso zzso strips were also zzso by cumulative increase of zzso concentration compared to that in control in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso was greater in zzso compared to zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso or zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was greater while the zzso effect of zzso zzso was smaller in zzso compared to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly increased zzso sensitivity in controls but not in zzso 

Our findings provide the first evidence that zzso enhances the zzso zzso and diminishes the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in contraction of zzso zzso pig zzso and suggest that zzso of zzso might potentially relieve zzso dysfunction related to zzso
