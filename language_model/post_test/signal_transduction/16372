zzso is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease zzso but the underlying molecular mechanism remains zzso Here, we present evidence that reveals a crucial role of zzso signaling in this zzso We showed that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso mouse brain, and that zzso zzso zzso a major constituent of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in primary cortical cultures; these observations indicate that zzso signaling could be zzso activated during zzso zzso In support of such a possibility, we observed that zzso of zzso signaling attenuated while zzso of zzso signaling enhanced zzso zzso suggesting a role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso Furthermore, we also demonstrated that zzso zzso depends on inflammatory zzso and that zzso of zzso signaling zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso signaling attenuated the zzso expression of the zzso in cortical zzso Our findings collectively suggest that zzso zzso zzso signaling is a crucial pathological step that contributes to zzso zzso by regulating zzso
