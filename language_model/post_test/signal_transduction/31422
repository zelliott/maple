The zzso complex, composed of four zzso bound zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso zzso and several other type I zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso releases the zzso zzso which form the zzso plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso of zzso releases an zzso zzso zzso that is critical for numerous zzso zzso zzso a type I membrane zzso is the only protein within the complex that is zzso The importance of these zzso sites is not fully zzso Here, we have observed that zzso zzso zzso zzso specific interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to investigate the role played by zzso zzso of each site was zzso All zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso indicating that the association was not zzso by any single zzso zzso Moreover, the interaction with zzso still occurred in zzso double knockout cells as detected in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso studies, which indicated that zzso zzso with zzso prior to its association with the active zzso zzso
