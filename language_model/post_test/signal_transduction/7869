We investigated the role of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso recruitment by zzso zzso cells zzso We demonstrated that inflammatory zzso induced the expression of the zzso on zzso both in zzso and in zzso and that recruitment of zzso depended on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso to activated zzso both in zzso and in zzso indicating that a functional zzso on zzso is zzso We also demonstrate that zzso was the downstream zzso regulating cell zzso A potential role of the zzso interaction in pathological settings is sustained by the expression of the zzso on zzso lining zzso zzso Thus, our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying zzso recruitment and the bases for novel strategies to hinder pathological zzso
