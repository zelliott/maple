The zzso of zzso zzso cells in the zzso phase of the zzso cycle is an essential prerequisite for the zzso of a zzso This profound differentiation process is accompanied by sustained elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell cultures of zzso zzso cells zzso by treatment with zzso agents in zzso Our previous findings indicated that the zzso activities of zzso zzso and signaling of the zzso hormone zzso are coupled in human zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have chosen a pharmacological approach to test whether zzso binding and zzso zzso cooperate to induce zzso zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso in the presence of diverse zzso zzso identified zzso and zzso as the principal zzso zzso involved in human zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was most effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso to achieve zzso in zzso zzso as determined by measurement of the expression of the zzso marker genes for zzso and zzso zzso and measurement of zzso zzso Gene expression for zzso and zzso was significantly zzso during in zzso zzso Treatment of cell cultures with the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso revealed a minor role for protein zzso zzso positive feedback control of zzso activity in human zzso zzso cells, consistent with sustained elevated zzso essential for zzso in zzso These findings introduce the new idea of clinically applying the combination of a specific zzso inhibitor with an zzso such as zzso thereby offering an alternative zzso zzso phase support for the zzso to encourage zzso development and zzso in zzso women undergoing assisted zzso technology zzso
