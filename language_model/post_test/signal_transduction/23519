zzso stress plays an important role in cancer development and zzso Recent data zzso the tumor zzso zzso in regulating zzso stress, but the molecular mechanism and the impact in zzso zzso remain zzso Here, we show that zzso regulates zzso zzso signaling by physically interacting with zzso and promoting its stability and zzso zzso mouse primary zzso zzso cells show low expression of zzso zzso zzso and accumulate zzso oxygen species zzso that impair survival in zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso survival and zzso levels in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso which has been shown to alleviate several defects associated with zzso loss, zzso survival of zzso cells without restoring zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso treatment partially restores zzso levels in the absence of zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso response plays a crucial role in controlling survival downstream of zzso zzso The ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso an involvement of an zzso connection in zzso tumor zzso Lastly, zzso tumors retain a defective zzso response that increases the sensitivity to zzso zzso In conclusion, the role of zzso in regulating zzso activity suggests important implications for both the zzso and treatment of zzso zzso
