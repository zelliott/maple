Mechanical loading of bone generates fluid flow within the zzso zzso that exerts fluid zzso stress zzso on zzso We examined effects of zzso on zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso a critical factor for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso (5 zzso 10 zzso for 1 h and then returned to zzso culture for varying times zzso zzso levels were measured by Western analysis and zzso by Northern analysis, zzso and quantitative zzso There were zzso to zzso increases in zzso zzso at 2-4 h zzso zzso protein was induced by 2 h zzso and remained elevated for at least 8 zzso zzso were independent of zzso zzso Small increases (up to zzso in zzso of the decoy zzso for zzso zzso were zzso Five zzso of zzso followed by zzso culture, was as effective in stimulating zzso zzso as 4 h of continuous zzso zzso induced zzso activity, and zzso a protein zzso A zzso zzso blocked the zzso induction of zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso pathway, but specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso an inhibitor of the zzso pathway, inhibited the zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso Thus, brief exposure to zzso resulted in sustained induction of zzso expression after stopping zzso and this induction was dependent on zzso and zzso signaling zzso Increased zzso after mechanical loading may play a role in initiating bone zzso
