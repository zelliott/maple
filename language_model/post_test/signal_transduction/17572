We previously reported the cloning of two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although both zzso and zzso bound zzso specifically and with high zzso neither was coupled to zzso zzso a major cellular zzso of zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a third member of the zzso zzso Human zzso is a protein of zzso zzso acids and has zzso and zzso identity with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso could be readily detected in brain and pancreatic zzso The pharmacological properties of human zzso were characterized by zzso expressing the human zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso from cells expressing human zzso bound the zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically and with high zzso with a rank order of potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies using cells zzso zzso the human zzso D1 zzso and human zzso showed that zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso formation in a zzso manner, indicating that zzso was functionally coupled to zzso zzso These results indicate that the diverse biological effects of zzso are zzso by a family of zzso with zzso but zzso tissue zzso unique pharmacological properties, and potentially different zzso
