zzso of zzso receptors is implicated in colon cancer zzso zzso of either of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso types zzso zzso is now implicated in zzso especially gastrointestinal zzso 

We generated transgenic mice, called zzso or zzso of which the dominant negative zzso of the zzso type II zzso was expressed under the control of zzso zzso the zzso promoter for stomach and zzso for zzso They were either infected with zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso and zzso or administered with zzso to determine the significance of loss of zzso zzso in gastrointestinal zzso 

zzso zzso developed in zzso mice, whereas only chronic active zzso was noted in zzso zzso after 36 weeks of zzso zzso Mice lacking in zzso zzso specifically in the stomach showed a significantly higher proliferation cell nuclear zzso index when infected with zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Development of zzso zzso zzso zzso was provoked in mice by zzso injections of zzso and zzso mice showed significantly higher zzso of zzso and colon zzso than zzso zzso 

Maintaining normal zzso zzso in the gastrointestinal tract seems to be important either for preventing abnormal zzso zzso or for suppressing or zzso zzso
