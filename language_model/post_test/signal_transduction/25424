The human zzso resistance protein 1 zzso is a key zzso of the zzso zzso response against a wide range of zzso zzso expression is tightly regulated by type I and type III zzso requires signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso and is not zzso directly by viruses or other zzso zzso shares many properties with the zzso zzso of large zzso It consists of 3 zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain that binds and zzso zzso a middle domain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso has the ability to zzso into highly ordered zzso and to form zzso structures around zzso inducing zzso zzso The structural details of zzso zzso have recently been zzso providing new insights into the zzso mechanism of this zzso zzso The structural and functional data suggest that zzso targets the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso may form zzso rings around zzso zzso structures, thereby zzso their zzso and zzso zzso Here we briefly review the most salient features of zzso expression and zzso zzso
