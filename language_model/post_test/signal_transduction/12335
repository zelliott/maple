The zzso signaling pathways affect lifespan in several model organisms, including zzso flies and zzso To investigate whether common genetic variation in this zzso influences lifespan in humans, we zzso zzso common zzso in 30 genes zzso proteins in the zzso signaling zzso in a cohort of elderly Caucasian women selected from the Study of zzso zzso zzso The cohort included zzso zzso cases zzso zzso or zzso 92 years zzso mean zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso controls zzso zzso or zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected for zzso using a zzso zzso We found a modest excess of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso significant zzso were then zzso in two additional Caucasian zzso including both males and zzso the zzso Health Study and zzso Jewish zzso An zzso single zzso zzso in zzso zzso was significantly associated with lifespan in a zzso across the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted P zzso zzso two zzso single zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated a significant lifespan association among women only zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted P zzso zzso These results demonstrate that common zzso in several genes in the zzso zzso are associated with human zzso
