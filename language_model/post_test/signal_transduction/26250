A quantitative trait locus zzso affecting zzso in a way opposite to expectations based on breed means was mapped to zzso zzso 7 zzso using crosses between Large White zzso and zzso zzso zzso Defining the molecular zzso trait more explicitly would allow zzso zzso candidate zzso for which expression differences must be zzso in experimental zzso First, zzso levels of genes representing sequential steps in zzso or involved in zzso metabolism were studied in zzso of pigs having zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and considered at two zzso zzso level of zzso expressed in zzso was greater in zzso pigs than in zzso pigs at 28 zzso zzso zzso of zzso involved in zzso the zzso zzso gene and the zzso marker zzso were lower in zzso pigs compared with zzso pigs at 150 zzso Because these results suggest a lag time in terminal differentiation associated with the zzso zzso seven genes in the zzso zzso were deduced as promising candidates for the zzso effect by zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso had lower expression levels in zzso pigs at both zzso zzso differences were observed in zzso levels of zzso target genes involved in cell differentiation zzso or fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso at 150 zzso These results re-evaluate the potential of zzso to explain part of variation in pig zzso
