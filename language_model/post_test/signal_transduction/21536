zzso between signal zzso pathways is a central feature of the tightly regulated plant defense signaling zzso The potential zzso or antagonism between defense pathways is determined by recognition of the type of pathogen or zzso zzso Our studies have identified zzso as a zzso of convergence for zzso salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso signaling events during plant response to bacterial zzso Here, we challenged transgenic plants altered in zzso expression as well as zzso knockout zzso of zzso with the zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso the role of zzso in modulating the balance between distinct defense zzso zzso or loss of zzso function causes opposite effects on zzso resistance to zzso zzso and the zzso resistance to zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso caused enhanced resistance to zzso zzso it compromised plant resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso impaired plant resistance to zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the suppression of several zzso responses including expression of a subset of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that this zzso suppression of zzso is partly executed by zzso The results indicate that zzso has a pivotal role in determining the balance between zzso and zzso defense zzso
