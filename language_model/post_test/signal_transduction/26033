zzso nerve injury causes serious problems in orthopedic and plastic zzso Cell zzso molecules such as zzso zzso provoke cell binding and signaling pathways within zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso signaling pathways and the zzso microscopic structure were assessed to investigate the long-term dynamic changes in zzso rat skeletal zzso 

A zzso rat skeletal muscle model was established by severing the zzso nerve for 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 26 zzso zzso expressions were investigated by zzso and Western zzso The structural zzso were detected by zzso scanning electron zzso and transmission electron zzso 

The zzso muscle zzso presented the following dynamic molecular zzso an initial increase around zzso in week zzso 8 and then a subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso downstream signaling zzso zzso or zzso or, zzso zzso zzso zzso fast zzso heavy chain zzso beta zzso and zzso We demonstrated that the expressions of multiple signaling molecules were highly zzso at zzso 8 zzso zzso electron zzso findings of the surface textures of zzso showed more severe damage at zzso 8 and subsequently became zzso Inner structures of zzso separated with zzso on transmission electron zzso zzso 

Our novel finding showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling molecules and surface zzso in the long-term zzso rat skeletal muscle are zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso muscle may zzso if zzso or other treatment was zzso
