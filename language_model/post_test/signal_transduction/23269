zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso zzso zzso in humans and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Using tandem mass zzso zzso was identified as a new binding partner and negative regulator of zzso in both zzso lines and primary B zzso The activated zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso on two sites prior to zzso zzso The interaction sites were mapped to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso replacement zzso failed to bind zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso caused enhanced zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A newly characterized zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso as did the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Interestingly, in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso suggesting that zzso also regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso elevated nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited intense zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and degradation, likely contributing to the termination of zzso zzso zzso this suggests that zzso could become an important new candidate for the general study of zzso zzso
