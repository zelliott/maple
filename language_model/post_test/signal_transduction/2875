To determine the role in zzso signaling of the zzso zzso of the first zzso region of the zzso zzso it was subjected to extensive zzso zzso changes did not alter the zzso ability of the zzso to zzso zzso Thus the zzso N zzso of the first zzso region does not play an essential role in zzso zzso and the entire signal that is transmitted to the zzso domain must be sent through the second zzso zzso This eliminates the models requiring an interaction of this zzso zzso with the remaining zzso portion of the zzso
