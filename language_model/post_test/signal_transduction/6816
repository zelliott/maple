zzso zzso regulates phase transition and floral patterning in zzso by zzso targets that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso repression of the zzso gene restricts zzso zzso zzso In addition, most zzso targets, including zzso zzso act as floral zzso and the zzso of the target genes causes delayed zzso However, how zzso targets other than zzso regulate both of the zzso processes remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso repression of the TARGET OF EAT 3 zzso gene is critical for floral patterning in zzso zzso plants that zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso exhibit indeterminate flowers with numerous zzso and zzso zzso which is consistent with previous observations in transgenic plants that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the second zzso of the AG zzso zzso AG expression is significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso also interacts with zzso in the zzso Given the major role of zzso in floral zzso zzso likely regulates zzso in floral zzso at least in part via zzso In addition, a zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 directly activates zzso zzso revealing a novel signaling interaction between zzso and zzso in floral zzso
