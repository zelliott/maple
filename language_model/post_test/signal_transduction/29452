The analysis of zzso gene expression data sets derived from zzso experiments still is a field of extensive zzso Although new approaches and zzso are published zzso mostly conventional methods like zzso zzso zzso or zzso analysis tools are zzso Here we take a closer look at independent component analysis zzso which is already discussed widely as a new analysis zzso However, deep exploration of its zzso and relevance to concrete biological problems is still zzso In this study, we investigate the relevance of zzso in gaining new insights into well characterized regulatory mechanisms of zzso dependent zzso zzso 

zzso independent gene expression modes zzso were extracted from observed gene expression signatures zzso through zzso of different zzso zzso From each zzso we deduced a group of zzso henceforth called zzso These zzso were further analyzed with different database query and literature mining tools and then combined to form so called zzso With them we performed a zzso zzso analysis and reconstructed a well known signal zzso 

We show that zzso is an appropriate tool to uncover underlying biological mechanisms from zzso zzso Most of the well known pathways of zzso dependent zzso to zzso differentiation can be identified by this zzso zzso data zzso Moreover, recent research results like the involvement of proliferation associated cellular mechanisms during zzso differentiation can be zzso
