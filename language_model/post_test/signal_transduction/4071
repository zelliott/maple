zzso act through their zzso receptors to promote the differentiation and/or survival of zzso zzso cells, immature zzso and other zzso Here, we examined the effects of nerve growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso or zzso on the survival of a common childhood brain zzso zzso zzso a tumor that resembles zzso zzso zzso zzso To do this, we engineered two human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso to express human zzso using a zzso expression zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grown in the presence or absence of serum underwent massive zzso but similar treatment did not induce zzso in zzso zzso cells, cells expressing an empty zzso or cells expressing the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells engineered to express the human zzso zzso zzso zzso also did not undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells can be inhibited by zzso zzso and by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by high zzso of zzso Because zzso treatment primarily eliminated zzso cells from the S phase of the cell cycle, this form of zzso zzso is cell zzso These findings suggest that a zzso signal zzso zzso could activate zzso cell death programs in zzso zzso zzso cells and in childhood brain zzso
