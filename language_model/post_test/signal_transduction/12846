zzso plants contain pharmacological substances including zzso and their extracts have been zzso administered for cancer therapy in zzso and in zzso We investigated the efficacy of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso on tumor invasion in zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of human zzso zzso cells in the zzso model, whereas a similar zzso was observed upon zzso adding tissue zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The gene expression and production of zzso zzso 9 zzso B and zzso zzso were specifically suppressed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the gene expression and production of zzso but not zzso were enhanced by zzso We also demonstrated that zzso suppressed the zzso zzso binding activity of zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to mimic the different actions of zzso on the production of zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso tumor cell invasive activity not only by suppressing the expression of zzso but also zzso zzso production in tumor cells, and that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding activity is at least partly involved in the suppression of zzso zzso Furthermore, we suggest a possible mechanism by which zzso may interfere in the zzso zzso pathway, which zzso regulates the production of zzso and zzso
