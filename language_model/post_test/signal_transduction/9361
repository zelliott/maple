zzso zzso zzso is the fifth most common cancer zzso It is more prevalent in men than zzso Related to this, recent genetic studies have revealed a zzso role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso but the underlying molecular mechanism remains zzso Here, we used zzso location and functional analyses to identify a critical zzso of zzso signaling - cell zzso zzso zzso - that drives zzso via a signaling zzso dependent on zzso and T cell factor zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and protein expression via direct binding to the zzso element of the zzso promoter in human zzso cell zzso In zzso analyses showed that zzso was critical in human cell lines for zzso cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in immortalized human liver cells activated zzso signaling to stimulate cell cycle progression and to induce tumor formation, as shown in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso cell growth, and this could be rescued by zzso active zzso or zzso In primary human zzso tissue samples, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in the tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso correlated with the tumor staging and poor overall survival of zzso Our results reveal a direct zzso zzso target, zzso that promotes zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso
