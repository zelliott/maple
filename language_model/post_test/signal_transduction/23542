The construction of a network of zzso contacts makes it possible to characterize the patterns and spatial organization of zzso Such networks are highly zzso depending on the changes of the tissue architecture caused by cell division, death and zzso Local competitive and cooperative zzso interactions influence the choices cells zzso We review the literature on quantitative data of zzso tissue zzso and present a zzso network model that can be used to explore the evolutionary dynamics of a two zzso tissue architecture with arbitrary zzso zzso In particular, we show that various forms of zzso observed types of interactions can be zzso using game zzso We discuss a model of cooperative and zzso zzso communication that can capture the interplay between cellular competition and tissue zzso We conclude with an outlook on the possible uses of this approach in zzso zzso and tissue zzso
