zzso zzso basic biological phenomena, such as cell division, zzso cancer zzso and zzso So far biologists identified two necessary conditions for zzso positive feedback and zzso 

Biological systems are based upon elementary zzso and zzso chemical zzso In order to definitely clarify all necessary conditions for zzso we here present the corresponding minimal zzso According to our definition, it contains the minimal number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations zzso importance from zzso The minimal zzso system contains two zzso and four irreversible reactions (three zzso one zzso discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for zzso two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable zzso state, and the fourth reaction prevents zzso We argue that prevention of explosion is a third general necessary condition for zzso which is so far lacking discussion in the zzso in addition to proving that in zzso systems three steady states are necessary for zzso (five for zzso zzso we also present a simple general method to design such zzso one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms (one production, five zzso for zzso zzso This helps zzso zzso systems and it is important for corresponding synthetic biology zzso 

The presented minimal zzso system finally zzso the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for zzso The three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent zzso This is important for zzso zzso with simple systems and for zzso designing new zzso zzso Our simple model system is also well suited for corresponding teaching zzso
