zzso play a critical role in the development of the male zzso system, including the positioning of the zzso It is not clear, however, which zzso processes are influenced by zzso and what are the target zzso and cells zzso zzso signaling during zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we have produced male mice zzso with conditional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso ligament connecting the zzso to the zzso abdominal zzso The zzso males had normal testosterone levels but developed zzso with the zzso located in a zzso zzso Although initially zzso the zzso males became sterile with zzso We have shown that during development, the zzso zzso failed to undergo zzso a process giving rise to the zzso zzso a zzso zzso inside the zzso As a result, the zzso zzso did not form properly, and the zzso remained in the low abdominal zzso zzso development of the zzso muscles in the zzso males suggested the participation of zzso in zzso zzso however, males with conditional zzso zzso in the zzso or smooth muscle cells had a normal zzso zzso Gene expression analysis showed that zzso zzso in zzso males led to the zzso of genes involved in muscle zzso cell zzso and zzso space zzso We therefore conclude that zzso signaling in zzso cells is required for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso mice provide a valuable model of isolated zzso one of the most common birth defects in newborn zzso
