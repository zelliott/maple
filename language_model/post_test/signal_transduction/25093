The zzso of protein zzso zzso that contain an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain is represented by three zzso in zzso T cells, zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are located at the zzso face of the plasma membrane and may be involved in regulation of the membrane zzso signal zzso or zzso Here we report that expression of zzso in zzso T cells reduced the zzso zzso of reporter genes encompassing parts of the zzso gene promoter and driven by nuclear factor of activated T cells plus zzso zzso zzso had a weaker zzso effect, while zzso had zzso The zzso inactive zzso zzso and zzso lacked effects on gene zzso zzso of active zzso also reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso its upstream zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The effect of zzso was reduced by deletion of its zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso T cell zzso by zzso zzso targets involved in zzso zzso
