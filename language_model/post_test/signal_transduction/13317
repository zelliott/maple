In some neurological disorders, excessive zzso oxide zzso nitrogen zzso produced by zzso and/or zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso is able to combine with zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso which can then induce zzso neural zzso In the present study, experiments using zzso zzso mice primary neural cells revealed that zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso triggered zzso while zzso activity was effectively suppressed in the absence of zzso zzso This shows that zzso was able to induce zzso zzso in zzso primary neural zzso The mechanism responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso molecules was then zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso caused by zzso did not require zzso zzso whereas zzso treatment triggered zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the neural cells with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso greatly inhibited the zzso of zzso induced by zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses revealed that primary neural cells treated with zzso had increased levels of zzso alternate reading frame zzso zzso and zzso which is induced by zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Our findings clearly show that the zzso zzso has an essential role in zzso zzso triggered by zzso in neural zzso
