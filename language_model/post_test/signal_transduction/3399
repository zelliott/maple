zzso zzso growth zzso zzso has long been recognized as the key regulator of vascular development and function in health and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors on the plasma zzso inducing their zzso zzso and assembly of a zzso signaling zzso Recent studies have revealed that many key events of zzso signaling occur inside the zzso cell and are regulated by zzso zzso zzso Plasma membrane zzso interacting zzso including vascular guidance receptors zzso and zzso also regulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling is increasingly recognized for its roles outside of the vascular system, notably during neural development, and blood vessels regulate zzso branching zzso We review here recent advances in our understanding of zzso signaling and its biological zzso
