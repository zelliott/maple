Ethanol suppresses innate resistance to a variety of zzso and findings of studies from both our laboratory and other laboratories indicate suppression of responses is zzso through two zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso In this article, we review recent findings from studies in our laboratory, indicating that ethanol also suppresses responses zzso through other zzso Considering the importance of zzso responses in innate zzso this supports the possibility that suppression of these responses may constitute a major mechanism by which ethanol suppresses innate zzso In addition, zzso changes in cellular signaling and in patterns of gene expression induced through zzso were examined in mouse zzso zzso and these results are reviewed in this zzso Signaling through zzso was zzso and results of DNA zzso analysis supported the notion that zzso of an zzso amplification loop might be responsible for suppression of gene expression for several zzso molecules of innate immunity and inflammation not previously known to be altered by zzso Thus, ethanol alters responses through most or all mouse zzso and this suppresses expression of a wide range of innate immune zzso
