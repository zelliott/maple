The functions of nerve growth factor zzso in skeletal muscles physiology and pathology are not clear and call for an updated zzso To achieve this goal we sought to investigate zzso zzso zzso and its role in the zzso skeletal muscle zzso and zzso zzso and western zzso experiments demonstrated expression of zzso zzso zzso and its regulator zzso but not zzso in the cells, as also found in zzso and zzso mice zzso Both zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso a process blocked by zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with relative selectivity towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the inactive control zzso backbone zzso Upon treatment for 4 days with either zzso zzso or zzso or zzso the proliferation of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicative of zzso effect of zzso which was zzso released by the zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso insult in the presence of zzso added either zzso before zzso or zzso with zzso zzso resulted with about zzso and zzso zzso an effect antagonized by zzso and zzso further supporting the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the present findings propose that zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells by functional cooperation between zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in zzso effects of zzso released zzso Furthermore, the present study establishes an important zzso role of zzso in zzso signaling in skeletal muscle model, resembling the role of zzso in zzso Future molecular characterization of the interactions between zzso receptors in the skeletal muscle will contribute to the understanding of zzso mechanism of action and may provide novel therapeutic zzso
