Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso is crucial for zzso processes that include zzso liver metabolism and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso continual activity of zzso has been zzso linked to human zzso and solid tumor zzso As a regulated zzso factor, precise cellular zzso of zzso is zzso Conventional nuclear zzso signals consist of short stretches of basic zzso zzso In this study, we provide evidence that zzso nuclear import is dependent on an unconventional nuclear zzso signal that functions within the zzso of an extensive zzso zzso Both in zzso binding and in zzso functional zzso reveal that zzso nuclear import is zzso by the zzso system independently of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The integrity of the zzso domain is essential for zzso zzso induction of the zzso gene following zzso stimulation as well as its ability to zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus in response to zzso and this nuclear import is dependent on zzso nuclear zzso zzso continually zzso in and out of the nucleus and live cell imaging demonstrates that zzso nuclear export is zzso by both zzso region maintenance 1 zzso and zzso zzso A zzso nuclear export signal was identified within the zzso zzso These findings provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms that regulate zzso nuclear trafficking and cooperation with the zzso zzso and provide a basis for clinical intervention of zzso function in zzso
