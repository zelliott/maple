zzso zzso instability 1 zzso has been identified as a novel energy zzso zzso While recent studies have suggested that change in zzso expression levels in zzso tissue may affect the body's energy balance, no reports have identified the mechanism behind this expression zzso In the present study, we found that zzso expression increased on differentiation of zzso zzso to zzso In addition, zzso stimulation induced zzso expression to approximately eight times the baseline zzso Further, zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso using zzso suppressed this zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso expression may be regulated by zzso at least in part, via zzso zzso
