zzso arising from zzso cells represent the most prevalent zzso in humans, and zzso is the major cause for the death of zzso zzso The breakdown of zzso cell zzso leading to aggressive cancer progression has been correlated with the loss of zzso characteristics and the acquisition of a migratory zzso This phenomenon, referred to as zzso to zzso transition zzso is considered as a crucial event in late stage zzso Here we zzso the multitude of zzso models derived from different zzso and review the diversity of molecular mechanisms contributing to the plasticity of zzso zzso In particular, the zzso between zzso of zzso provided by the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in inducing zzso of various zzso cell zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso molecules are thought to fundamentally contribute to the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso cells, and provide the basis for a broad repertoire of zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor models, which represent in zzso zzso to local invasion and zzso in zzso facilitate the identification of diagnostic markers for a more accurate and faithful clinical and pathological assessment of zzso zzso In addition, the analysis of molecular mechanisms involved in zzso might yield novel therapeutic targets for the specific treatment of aggressive zzso
