Recent evidence suggests that zzso oxide zzso acts as an intermediate of zzso signal zzso for zzso zzso However, zzso effect on zzso opening is poorly understood even though both opening and closing activities determine zzso zzso Here we show that NO zzso zzso opening specific to blue light, thereby stimulating zzso zzso NO inhibited blue zzso zzso opening but not red zzso zzso NO inhibited both blue zzso zzso pumping and zzso zzso The NO scavenger zzso zzso restored all these zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso inhibited all of these blue zzso responses in a manner similar to zzso zzso partially restored the zzso zzso of all of these opening responses but did not restore zzso of the responses by zzso zzso zzso and NO had slight zzso effects on the zzso of zzso which are blue light receptors in guard zzso NO inhibited neither zzso zzso pumping in guard cells nor zzso transport by zzso in the isolated zzso From these results, we conclude that both NO and zzso inhibit blue zzso zzso of zzso by zzso the zzso between zzso and zzso in guard cells and stimulate zzso closure by zzso
