zzso is a highly zzso zzso disorder, yet the genetic zzso of the disorder are largely zzso zzso brain overgrowth is a zzso observation in the zzso zzso but association, linkage, and expression studies have not identified genetic factors that explain this zzso Few studies have had sufficient statistical power to investigate zzso gene expression and zzso variation in the zzso brain, especially in regions that display the greatest growth zzso Previous functional zzso studies have identified possible zzso in transcript levels of genes related to zzso and immune zzso Thus, there is a need for genetic studies involving key brain regions to replicate these findings and solidify the role of particular functional pathways in zzso zzso We therefore sought to identify abnormal brain gene expression patterns via zzso analysis of zzso levels and copy number variations zzso in zzso and control zzso brain zzso We focused on prefrontal zzso tissue where excess zzso numbers and cortical overgrowth are pronounced in the majority of zzso zzso We found evidence for zzso in pathways governing cell number, cortical zzso and differentiation in young zzso prefrontal zzso In contrast, adult zzso prefrontal zzso showed zzso of signaling and repair zzso Genes regulating cell cycle also exhibited zzso zzso in DNA derived from prefrontal cortex, and these genes were significantly associated with zzso in zzso association study zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso gene expression changes in zzso may reflect distinct pathological processes in the developing versus the mature zzso prefrontal zzso Our results raise the hypothesis that genetic zzso in the developing brain leads to abnormal regional zzso excess prefrontal zzso cortical zzso and neural dysfunction in zzso
