B cell zzso zzso signaling is zzso through zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso are redundant in their ability to support early B cell development, but their roles in mature B cells have not been zzso To examine the function of zzso in mature B cells in zzso we exchanged the zzso domain of zzso for the zzso domain of zzso by gene targeting zzso zzso zzso B cells had lower levels of surface zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso than zzso B zzso The zzso B cells were able to complete all stages of development and were long lived, but failed to differentiate into zzso zzso In addition, zzso B cells showed decreased zzso and zzso responses to zzso stimulation in zzso and were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
