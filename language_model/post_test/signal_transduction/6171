zzso and zzso originate from a common committed zzso zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso lineage is triggered by specific zzso signals involving zzso or nuclear zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and 1 zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso effect of 1 zzso zzso on the production of zzso colonies zzso is accompanied by a repression of zzso colony zzso zzso We further demonstrate that in zzso zzso zzso cells as in zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells, the 1 zzso zzso zzso differentiation is zzso with a direct zzso of the zzso zzso Indeed, a zzso of the zzso beta zzso gene promoter via formation of a nuclear complex involving zzso was identified in zzso and in zzso The fact that binding of zzso on zzso is not observed suggests that contrary to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso differentiation requires positive and negative zzso controls both likely zzso by the zzso zzso These novel findings zzso that 1 zzso zzso exerts a dominant negative effect on the zzso zzso commitment of human bone zzso cells via repression of the zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso response to zzso and 1 zzso zzso in zzso cells depends on a complex zzso pattern of interaction among different nuclear receptors with zzso
