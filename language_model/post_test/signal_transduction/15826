zzso are zzso zzso zzso that zzso the signaling of multiple growth factors active during animal development, and loss of zzso function is associated with widespread zzso zzso zzso consist of a zzso approximately zzso zzso protein core region followed by a stalk region that is zzso to the cell membrane by a zzso zzso The stalk regions are predicted to be random zzso but contain a variable number of attachment sites for zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso protein core and the zzso zzso attachments are important for zzso zzso We report here the zzso crystal structure of the zzso protein core region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This structure reveals an zzso zzso fold for zzso core regions that does not appear zzso to any known zzso The zzso core protein is required for normal responsiveness to zzso zzso signals, and we identify a localized region on the zzso surface important for zzso its function in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein core does not, however, interact appreciably with either zzso or an zzso zzso
