We define an optimal signal in zzso zzso models on the basis of zzso zzso data and rate coding zzso Under the classical approach the optimal signal is located where the frequency transfer function is zzso Its position zzso with the inflection point of this zzso This concept is extended here by using Fisher information which is the inverse zzso zzso of the best zzso and its dependence on the zzso value indicates accuracy of zzso We compare the signal producing zzso Fisher information with the inflection point of the zzso frequency transfer zzso
