The zzso and zzso function of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its zzso in several human zzso have provided a rationale for targeting this signaling network with novel treatment zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is a selective target for zzso cancer because it is activated in many tumor cells, yet is strictly controlled in normal zzso The zzso zzso diverse signal zzso pathways in tumor cells that have a profound effect on their zzso zzso of the zzso provides signals that drive zzso zzso invasion and zzso zzso and enhanced cell zzso zzso the zzso is a promising drug target for many types of solid tumors, and its zzso has potential in both the treatment and prevention of these zzso Based on the structure and function of the zzso two zzso therapeutic strategies have been zzso The first strategy uses humanized zzso zzso generated against the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso block binding of zzso zzso and, in some cases, can induce zzso zzso and zzso The second approach uses small molecules that compete with zzso zzso for binding to the zzso zzso pocket, thus blocking zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Early clinical studies suggest that both of these approaches, either alone or in combination with standard zzso therapies, are well tolerated and can induce clinical responses and tumor stabilization in a variety of common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilmington, zzso is the zzso inhibitor furthest along in clinical development, and it is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors, including zzso lung zzso
