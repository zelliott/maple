Novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently cloned zzso zzso acting through the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of zzso in zzso cell function and further characterize zzso signaling zzso Using zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso and zzso could be demonstrated in zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with 10 zzso zzso human zzso rapidly induced zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at 5 and 10 zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso of zzso signaling zzso promoter activity were significantly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison with zzso control, zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso at 24 and 48 h zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso above zzso In comparison with zzso cells, stable zzso of zzso in zzso cells abolished zzso zzso and zzso zzso and almost completely inhibited zzso zzso promoter and zzso promoter zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso at 48 h was significantly attenuated by zzso zzso In zzso we have shown that zzso is a zzso of zzso cell function, which is zzso regulated by zzso Our data indicate that the zzso of the zzso cascade is essential for zzso zzso zzso Further studies will have to investigate the possible in zzso role of zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso axis stress zzso
