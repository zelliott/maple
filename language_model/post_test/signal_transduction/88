zzso sorting of zzso by zzso transport is zzso yet very little is known at the molecular level about how specific transcripts are linked to motor zzso In zzso zzso transport of zzso important transcripts by the zzso motor is zzso by seemingly divergent zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that direct recognition of these zzso zzso signals is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are the only proteins from embryonic extracts that are abundantly and specifically enriched on zzso zzso signals from transcripts of zzso hairy, zzso and the I factor zzso In zzso zzso show that, despite lacking a zzso zzso zzso zzso directly recognizes active zzso zzso We also reveal a physical interaction between zzso and a zzso domain for cargo recruitment in zzso and present data suggesting that zzso zzso selectively in zzso transport of zzso in zzso Our work leads to the first working model for a complete connection between zzso zzso zzso signals and zzso and reveals molecular strategies that are likely to be of general relevance for cargo transport by zzso
