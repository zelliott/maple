In the last few years, evidence has been found to suggest that some synaptic contacts become silent but can be functionally recruited before they completely retract during zzso zzso elimination in zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso zzso elimination may be better understood by studying this zzso zzso This zzso collects previously published data and new results to propose a molecular mechanism for zzso zzso The mechanism is based on protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity may be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and by calcium inflow though zzso and zzso zzso calcium zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso activity may oppose the zzso zzso release zzso Thus, a balance between zzso and zzso pathways may contribute to the final functional suppression of some zzso zzso during zzso
