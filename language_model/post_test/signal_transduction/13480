Most of the knowledge concerning the zzso mechanisms involved in cell locomotion have been obtained from in zzso studies of cells in zzso Many of the concepts derived from these studies have been partially confirmed in in zzso systems but numerous questions regarding the zzso control of cell migration remain to be zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso represents an in zzso model system to study the genetic control of cell zzso We review what is known about zzso development and regulation of zzso cell zzso We try to link these in zzso studies and the movement of cells over two zzso zzso and elaborate on important questions which remain to be addressed in the zzso
