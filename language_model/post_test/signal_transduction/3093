zzso syndrome zzso characterized by the presence of more than one zzso in men, is a major genetic cause of male zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso patients is thought to be the consequences of zzso of some genes on the zzso However, the identity of these genes and the underlying mechanisms remain zzso zzso 11 zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is expressed most abundantly in zzso and early zzso in the zzso In our search for zzso partners using the zzso zzso system, we identified zzso zzso cell leukemia zzso zzso protein zzso which anchors zzso receptors zzso to the zzso and zzso their zzso We found that mouse zzso stem cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso In cultured cells, zzso zzso with zzso for binding to zzso Upon treatment with zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted the nuclear zzso of zzso and enhanced its zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso suppressed the zzso activities of zzso in the zzso as indicated by reduced zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso zzso and zzso cells suppressed the cell proliferation and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso that were zzso by zzso or zzso and elevated the expression level of the zzso zzso zzso The negative effect of zzso on cell proliferation suggests that increased expression of zzso in the germ cells may partially contribute to the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso
