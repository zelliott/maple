Natural killer zzso cells extend important immune resistance in zzso by zzso infected and tumor zzso A fine balance between opposing signals generated by a diverse set of zzso and zzso zzso receptors determines the fate of target cells interacting with the zzso zzso We have developed a mathematical model involving membrane zzso initial signaling events that provides novel zzso insights into how zzso of zzso cells is modulated by the zzso of zzso interaction and zzso zzso We show that strong zzso zzso produce digital zzso whereas weaker zzso zzso can mediate zzso by strengthening the signals generated by zzso zzso as indicated in experiments in knockout zzso We find under certain conditions, zzso zzso receptors can help mediate zzso instead of zzso zzso insights gained from zzso signaling can facilitate understanding of complex signaling responses that occur due to cross talk between dueling signaling pathways in other cell zzso
