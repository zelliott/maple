zzso transfer protein zzso and the zzso zzso transfer protein zzso zzso with zzso carrier protein 2) belong to the large and diverse family of zzso zzso zzso Although these two proteins may express a comparable zzso transfer activity in zzso recent studies in zzso and zzso cells have indicated that they serve completely different zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso flow both in the budding reaction from the zzso network and in the fusion reaction with the plasma zzso In zzso zzso budding is linked to zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso with the apparent purpose of maintaining an optimal zzso ratio of the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso flow appears to be dependent on zzso stimulating zzso zzso zzso zzso This latter process may also be linked to the ability of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso C zzso The zzso is a zzso protein which, by its ability to bind fatty zzso is most likely involved in the zzso of fatty acids in this zzso This protein constitutes the zzso of the 58 zzso protein which is one of the zzso zzso zzso Further studies on these and other known zzso transfer proteins are bound to reveal new insights in their important role as zzso between zzso metabolism and cell zzso
