The zzso zzso acid zzso has been shown to improve insulin action in high-fat zzso animal models, yet little is known about its underlying mechanisms of zzso We zzso that LA acts by inducing heat shock proteins zzso which then inhibit stress zzso known to interfere with insulin signaling zzso Male zzso rats were fed a zzso diet zzso calories from zzso for 6 zzso while controls received a zzso diet zzso calories from zzso zzso of the rats in each group received daily LA injections (30 zzso body zzso In rats fed a zzso diet, LA increased expression of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso muscle, but it had no effect on zzso in muscle from zzso zzso LA treatment reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity zzso protein zzso in rats fed a zzso diet and effectively restored insulin zzso as seen by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso LA also induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso proteins previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso In addition, acute LA treatment induced zzso in zzso in zzso muscle cells and prevented the zzso of zzso and zzso with stimulants such as zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest chronic LA treatment results in stress zzso zzso and improved insulin signaling through a zzso zzso
