zzso of most zzso and laboratory studies suggest an inverse relationship between regular exercise and the risk of certain zzso such as zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso skin, zzso zzso and prostate zzso However, physical activity can have different influence on zzso depending on energy supply and the age of the subject as well as strength, frequency, and length of zzso The zzso and molecular basis of the interaction between zzso physical activity and zzso processes remains poorly zzso Physical activity may generate zzso oxygen species zzso to a different zzso zzso zzso stress caused by moderate physical activity can activate cellular stress response signaling and zzso cellular zzso defense zzso However, zzso of relatively large amounts of zzso as a consequence of exhaustive exercise can either directly damage DNA, causing zzso or promote zzso by zzso zzso zzso This review highlights the effects of physical activity on various zzso in the context of zzso status modulated during zzso
