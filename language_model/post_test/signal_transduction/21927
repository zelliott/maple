The zzso role of novel zzso zzso signaling peptides termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is a subject of intense zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso activates the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso and programmed cell death, and that the level of zzso was found to be zzso several fold in the zzso skin of patients with zzso In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that human zzso and oral zzso zzso zzso We cloned human zzso and produced the mouse zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso in the zzso of normal human zzso and oral zzso grown in zzso In zzso zzso was found predominantly in the zzso zzso whereas in the attached zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for binding to zzso showing a higher affinity to the zzso than zzso zzso Treatment with zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso increased the number of zzso in culture and their resistance to zzso which could be abolished by zzso more efficiently than zzso By real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression of the differentiation markers zzso zzso and zzso 1 and 10, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 which were elevated by high zzso zzso and zzso also abolished zzso of zzso 3 and 8 caused by zzso These results indicated that zzso competes with zzso predominantly at the zzso zzso and that zzso zzso with zzso delays zzso differentiation and prevents zzso Thus, the different effects observed for zzso and zzso can be explained by their differential binding to the zzso zzso expressed in zzso These findings present a novel paradigm of the zzso regulation of zzso zzso cells by locally produced small zzso zzso zzso and open novel directions toward better understanding and treating of skin and zzso zzso
