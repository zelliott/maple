zzso muscle cells zzso are exposed to both zzso growth factor zzso and type I collagen zzso at the time of zzso zzso In these studies we explore the individual and combined effects of these zzso on human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in zzso DNA synthesis whereas zzso zzso DNA synthesis to a much lesser extent zzso zzso zzso we observed an zzso increase in DNA synthesis when zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso Furthermore, stimulation of zzso with zzso produced a significant increase in zzso activity whereas zzso alone had no zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in zzso activity that was markedly greater than that produced by zzso zzso In a similar fashion, zzso induced zzso of the zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso did not, whereas concurrent zzso stimulation produced a synergistic increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso eliminated this synergistic interaction, implicating the zzso zzso as the zzso of this zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso for the zzso as well as zzso family members, zzso zzso zzso and Yes demonstrated zzso of zzso and the zzso as well as zzso zzso of cells with zzso and/or zzso did not change the degree of zzso Finally, zzso of zzso activity with zzso eliminated the synergistic effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in the observed zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso proliferation through zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso
