The largest energy consumer in the cell is the zzso zzso whose zzso elicits various diseases in zzso It has been recently revealed that zzso zzso along with cell cycle arrest, is related with abnormal zzso zzso but the exact mechanism still remains zzso In this study, we have found that zzso zzso zzso activates two parallel cellular zzso zzso and zzso which result in zzso induction and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso activates zzso by zzso on zzso 15 and zzso Our studies demonstrate the relationship between these two pathways and zzso zzso The changes caused by impaired zzso stress, such as zzso induction and zzso arrest, were completely disappeared by zzso of either zzso These findings suggest a monitoring mechanism of zzso and zzso against abnormal zzso zzso through controlling the stability and activity of zzso zzso
