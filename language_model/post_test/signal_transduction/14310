Recent zzso in isolation techniques for zzso c zzso have allowed us to discover zzso modifications of this zzso We previously identified two distinct zzso zzso zzso on zzso in zzso liver and heart that alter its electron transfer zzso and the ability to induce zzso Here we investigated the zzso status of zzso in zzso brain and sought to determine if zzso zzso and zzso of zzso release was associated with zzso of zzso Using an animal model of global brain zzso we found a zzso decrease in zzso death in the zzso zzso region with zzso insulin zzso This zzso increase in zzso survival was associated with zzso of zzso release at 24 hours of zzso To investigate possible changes in the zzso state of zzso we first isolated the protein from zzso pig brain and brain that was treated with zzso zzso brains demonstrated no zzso zzso zzso In contrast zzso isolated from brains treated with insulin showed robust zzso of zzso and the zzso site was zzso identified as zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso zzso mass zzso We next confirmed these results in rats by in zzso application of insulin in the absence or presence of global brain zzso and determined that zzso zzso is strongly induced under both conditions but cannot be detected in zzso zzso These data suggest a mechanism zzso zzso is targeted for zzso by insulin zzso which may prevent its release from the zzso and the induction of zzso
