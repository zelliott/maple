High level expression of zzso zzso zzso gamma chain replaces the deficient zzso zzso and contributes to altered zzso signaling abnormalities in T cells of patients with systemic lupus zzso Increased responsiveness to zzso has been considered to lead to zzso To test this concept, we studied early signaling events and zzso production in fresh cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma chain zzso with the zzso zzso chain on the surface membrane of T cells and that zzso of the new zzso complex leads to a dramatic increase of zzso calcium zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed that zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma is associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso is zzso We propose that altered composition of the zzso complex leads to increased T cell responsiveness to zzso stimulation and sets the zzso grounds for the development of zzso
