zzso differentiation and regional zzso of zzso zzso such as the cerebral cortex, are regulated by the interplay of zzso proteins produced by patterning centers and signal zzso systems deployed in the surrounding zzso Among other signaling zzso members of the zzso growth factor zzso family have a prominent role in regulating growth, differentiation and regional zzso In the mouse zzso the zzso patterning center expresses members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling have major roles in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso whereas the functions of zzso and zzso in the zzso patterning center have not been zzso 

Using zzso zzso mice, we provide evidence that zzso suppresses zzso and that it promotes zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso thus, reducing zzso and zzso dosage have opposite zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cultures of embryonic zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso proliferation in cortical zzso 

zzso and zzso have distinct signaling properties, and opposite effects on zzso patterning and zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso proliferation and promotes neural zzso
