zzso is the major zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso Although its role in zzso has been studied zzso little is known about its function in zzso We studied the effects of zzso on signaling pathways in primary zzso We found that the zzso zzso related zzso focal zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in response to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso This zzso was zzso toxin zzso sensitive and could be attenuated by the depletion of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso primarily by class zzso zzso zzso receptors and depends on protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso treatment of primary zzso also results in a significant increase in the activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso sensitive and can be attenuated by the depletion of zzso zzso and by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might mediate the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso stimulation of primary zzso leads to a significant increase in DNA zzso zzso DNA synthesis is zzso sensitive and can be inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that in primary zzso zzso might signal via zzso and zzso zzso to promote DNA synthesis and cell zzso
