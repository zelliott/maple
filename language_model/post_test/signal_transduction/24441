zzso zzso induced the zzso of not only T cell lines but also of other types of cell lines in a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was suppressed by zzso but not by zzso indicating that zzso binding is essential for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso required at least 60 zzso of zzso binding and possibly de zzso protein synthesis to mediate the zzso We also assessed the zzso of peripheral blood T cells by zzso zzso was induced in both activated zzso and zzso T cells, but the former were more susceptible than the zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso inhibitor zzso but not others such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso We also found that a zzso inhibitor zzso suppresses zzso zzso that zzso zzso calcium zzso influx, and that either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso via the zzso pathway, and that zzso plays a role in zzso of T zzso immune zzso
