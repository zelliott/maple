zzso zzso factor zzso is an important zzso growth zzso zzso cells produce abundant zzso in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso We wished to determine zzso what cellular pathways enhanced levels of zzso zzso and zzso if zzso used any of these zzso zzso in levels of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso was studied by using Northern zzso zzso zzso increased levels of zzso zzso occurred in these cells after exposure to sodium zzso zzso and the effect of zzso was slightly enhanced by aluminum zzso these results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso can occur by zzso a zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C dramatically increased levels of zzso zzso however, blockade of protein zzso C activity did not zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso Exposure to zzso increased levels of zzso zzso and this effect was prominently enhanced in the presence of low zzso of zzso zzso and was almost abolished in high zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso also increased levels of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso can increase zzso zzso concentration zzso through zzso zzso A calcium channel blocker zzso blocked the increased levels of zzso zzso zzso by zzso but could not block the stimulation zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased levels of zzso zzso and rapidly increased levels of zzso zzso did not increase zzso and, moreover, was able to stimulate zzso of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Taken together, we have found that several different cellular pathways can lead to prominent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells including zzso zzso of protein zzso C, zzso increase in zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso appears to increase levels of zzso zzso independent of protein zzso C activity or levels of zzso
