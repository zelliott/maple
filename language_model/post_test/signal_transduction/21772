zzso are capable to sense an increase of cell density population and to reply quickly and zzso by the induction of special sets of zzso This type of the regulation was named zzso zzso zzso it is based on the effect of zzso signaling molecules of different nature zzso which accumulate in the culture at high density of bacterial population and interact with zzso regulatory zzso zzso systems are the global regulators of bacterial genes expression and play a key role in the control of many zzso processes in cell including the regulation of zzso of zzso Here we review the molecular mechanisms of zzso systems functioning in bacteria belonging to different zzso groups and discuss the potential of zzso regulation as a new drug target for the treatment of bacterial zzso At present this approach is accounted as a new alternative strategy of zzso therapy directed on the development of drugs zzso zzso regulation and active just against zzso of bacteria zzso zzso Such a strategy allows to avoid a wide dissemination of resistant forms of zzso bacteria and the formation of zzso increasing in many times the resistance of bacteria to drug zzso
