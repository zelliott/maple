Growth zzso peptides zzso as zzso selective zzso feature potent zzso activity that is associated with an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso X zzso alpha zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso However, the mechanism involved in zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso has yet to be zzso zzso the present study aims to zzso the upstream molecular mechanisms through which zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso from zzso through zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso showed a significant increase in cholesterol and zzso zzso to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with enhanced zzso of zzso The zzso zzso by which this zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso involved an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels induced by zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso In agreement, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as ABC zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor had no zzso 

These findings suggest a central role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso of the ABC zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso by synthetic zzso zzso The resulting enhanced cholesterol zzso might explain, at least in part, the zzso effect of selective zzso zzso
