zzso zzso are known to be associated with tumor signaling pathways such as transforming growth zzso zzso zzso double minute zzso and zzso To investigate the role of zzso in tumor progression in zzso we generated zzso transgenic mice by zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso We found that the zzso tumor initiated earlier and grew more rapidly in zzso transgenic mice than in both the zzso transgenic and zzso mice after zzso zzso liver cancer zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso 9 zzso activity, vascular zzso growth factor zzso concentration in plasma and new small blood vessel formation in tumor zzso were enhanced in zzso transgenic mice compared with those in control zzso In addition, injection of zzso zzso in zzso transgenic mice zzso all these effects and suppressed rapid tumor zzso Similar results were observed in human zzso zzso cells, where zzso zzso did increase zzso activity and small blood vessel zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso could suppress zzso zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso was largely responsible for this zzso Our data reveal a functional role for zzso in tumor progression in zzso in which zzso of zzso promotes zzso activity and tumor zzso by providing a suitable zzso for tumor zzso
