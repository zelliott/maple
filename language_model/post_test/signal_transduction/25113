zzso production in the zzso zzso is high at night and low during the zzso This rhythm reflects zzso changes in the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the penultimate zzso in zzso zzso The rhythm is generated by an zzso zzso zzso In the zzso a clock is located in the zzso which also contains two zzso zzso One controls zzso production by adjusting the clock and the other acts zzso to the clock, via zzso zzso mechanisms, to switch zzso synthesis on and zzso Unlike the clock in these cells, zzso zzso does not appear to regulate activity by altering zzso zzso zzso The major changes in zzso zzso levels induced by the clock seemed likely (but not zzso to generate comparable changes in zzso protein levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso might also regulate zzso activity via changes in protein levels, or it might act via other mechanisms, including zzso changes affecting zzso We measured zzso protein levels and zzso activity in cultured chick zzso cells and found that they correlated well under all zzso They rose and fell spontaneously with a zzso zzso They also rose in response to agents that increase zzso zzso They were raised by agents that increase zzso zzso such as zzso and lowered by agents that decrease zzso zzso such as light and zzso Thus, both the clock and zzso zzso can control zzso activity by altering the total amount of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggest that changes in zzso protein levels, in turn, reflect changes in the rate at which the protein is destroyed by zzso zzso It is likely that zzso zzso changes in zzso protein levels mediate rapid changes in chick zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that light can rapidly regulate the abundance of a specific protein zzso within a zzso zzso
