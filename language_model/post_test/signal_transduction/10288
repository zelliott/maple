zzso zzso is induced by hypoxic stimuli and is also involved in the process of zzso We previously demonstrated that vascular zzso growth factor zzso is one of the principal factors produced by hypoxic zzso and is responsible for the induction of zzso expression in zzso zzso Yet the signaling pathways by which zzso zzso zzso gene expression are still less well zzso We therefore examined the regulation of zzso zzso expression by the zzso protein zzso zzso family in zzso zzso 

Human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso as well as the zzso selective zzso zzso for 1 h before treating with zzso (20 zzso zzso expression induced by zzso at both zzso and protein levels was significantly inhibited by selective zzso and zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was observed as early as 5 zzso in zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, the biological significance of the zzso gene in zzso cells was examined by zzso or knocking down zzso gene zzso zzso incorporation and zzso techniques were used to determine cell proliferation and vascular structure zzso zzso cell proliferation was significantly reduced when zzso were either zzso with zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso with zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation was increased zzso Moreover, the formation of vascular structure zzso by zzso demonstrated that zzso vascular structure formation was accelerated in zzso zzso cells but attenuated in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso role of zzso may be, at least in part, through its zzso zzso
