Signaling through zzso coupled receptors is one of the most prevalent and important methods of zzso information to the inside of zzso Many mathematical models have been proposed to describe this type of signal zzso and the zzso complex zzso model and its derivatives are among the most widely zzso Current versions of these equilibrium models include both active zzso zzso and inactive zzso of the zzso but do not include the dynamics of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Yet understanding how these dynamic events effect response behavior is crucial to determining zzso zzso We developed a mathematical model for zzso coupled zzso signaling that includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and used it to predict how zzso and zzso would change if either the zzso selectivity (the effect of zzso binding on the distribution of active and inactive zzso zzso or the zzso rate constant was zzso In addition, the model was used to explore the implications of measuring responses far downstream from zzso zzso By comparing the experimental data from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso N zzso zzso receptors with the predictions of our model, we found that the zzso selectivity is the zzso factor in determining the amounts of zzso and zzso caused by a particular zzso
