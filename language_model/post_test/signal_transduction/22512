Cell zzso pathways play a crucial role in proper cell development and zzso with implications to survival, zzso zzso and even programmed cell death known as zzso In this article, we outline a mathematical model of the zzso zzso zzso in a particular cell line of zzso focusing on zzso of a particular zzso zzso zzso The model is based on the zzso of zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and differential dynamics of multiple species of zzso Insight into the dynamics of the system is given through recently available experimental results and incorporated into the zzso zzso analysis of the model, including establishment of global existence, uniqueness, zzso and zzso of solutions, and global stability of a unique zzso solution is zzso
