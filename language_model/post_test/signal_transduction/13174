To detect whether the mutual interaction occurring between the zzso lining cells system zzso and the bone zzso fluid zzso is affected by load through a modification of the zzso fluid zzso systemic zzso zzso zzso mice zzso bones immersed in zzso were subjected ex zzso to a zzso zzso zzso load of different zzso and zzso The electric zzso currents at the bone surface were measured by a vibrating probe after having exposed zzso to zzso through a zzso zzso The application of different loads and different zzso increased the zzso current in a zzso zzso The zzso current density subsequently decayed following an exponential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were dependent on bone zzso zzso and zzso loads did not induce current density zzso Because zzso is zzso by zzso it is conceivable that zzso tends to restore zzso zzso conditions by controlling zzso zzso at the zzso interface to fulfill zzso zzso Because the electric current reflects the integrated activity of zzso its evaluation in transgenic mice engineered to possess genetic zzso in channels or zzso constituents could be helpful in the characterization of the mechanical and zzso functions of zzso
