Based on the kinetic model of genetic regulation system proposed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of fluctuations in the degradation reaction rate and the synthesis reaction rate of the zzso factor have been investigated through zzso zzso and analysis zzso In the case of zzso noises, it is shown that only the fluctuation of degradation reaction rate can induce a switch process, and the mean first passage time zzso from the high concentration state to the low concentration one is decreased when the noise intensity of degradation reaction rate is zzso In the case of correlations between noises, a switch process can also be induced by the zzso intensity between noises and by the fluctuation of the synthesis reaction rate in the genetic regulatory zzso It is found that, under large zzso intensity, a successive switch process zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we call the zzso transition or twice switch ) occurs with an increase of noise zzso and a critical noise intensity exists at which the zzso of the switch process is the zzso While the system is initially in the high concentration state with an increase of the cross zzso the stationary probability distribution zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso concentration at the low concentration state is increased, yet the zzso is increased due to the decreasing of the zzso of the transient states between the two steady stable zzso
