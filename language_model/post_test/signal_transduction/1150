Gender differences were studied in zzso zzso from zzso zzso 1) diabetic zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso of hearts from control male and female rats and from rats made diabetic with zzso zzso zzso zzso days before zzso zzso II content, measured by zzso was zzso in diabetic males but zzso in diabetic zzso In diabetic zzso zzso zzso II levels were zzso as in zzso zzso II affects multiple cellular pathways including zzso of protein zzso C zzso and several zzso zzso as well as zzso of protein zzso A zzso The involvement of these pathways in modulating outward zzso currents was zzso zzso and sustained outward zzso currents were measured using the whole cell zzso zzso In zzso these currents are attenuated under diabetic conditions but are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso by zzso enhanced both zzso currents in cells from diabetic zzso The zzso of these currents by zzso was blocked when zzso zzso was maintained with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso also zzso zzso currents in cells from diabetic zzso Action zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso However, both zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso currents in cells from diabetic zzso In cells from zzso diabetic zzso zzso and zzso enhanced these zzso currents as in zzso zzso of zzso zzso the transient and sustained zzso currents in cells from diabetic males and zzso A contribution of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso These results describe some of the mechanisms that may zzso zzso differences in the development of cardiac disease and zzso
