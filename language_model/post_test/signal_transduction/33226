An zzso approach was used to detect the expression of putative zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during wheat zzso zzso tissue culture initiated from immature zzso Both the soluble and membrane extracts from the immature zzso revealed bands of 58, 40, and 16 zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins were zzso in zzso in both zzso callus and zzso zzso An additional soluble protein (32 zzso was detected by zzso alpha zzso in cultured zzso but not in immature zzso suggesting a possible function in cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was associated with the appearance of a zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso both in soluble and membrane zzso zzso genetic stocks of Chinese Spring zzso including the zzso 36 zzso and 6 zzso wheat lines, were used to ascertain the zzso location of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso The lack of a signal with the zzso zzso 3 D short zzso arm line suggests that the 3 D long zzso arm possesses at least one gene involved in the expression of the zzso zzso The putative role of the zzso protein in zzso regulating zzso is zzso
