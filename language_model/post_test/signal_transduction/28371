zzso proteins signal via cell surface receptors termed zzso zzso display many properties characteristic of members of the zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso region that is zzso a zzso zzso region that includes zzso motifs for zzso by protein zzso A, protein zzso C and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that couple to zzso G zzso as evidenced by a zzso in zzso zzso zzso responses sensitive to depletion of specific G protein zzso and zzso responses sensitive to bacterial toxins that target G zzso Evidence from a variety of zzso systems demonstrates zzso zzso signaling via pathways other than the zzso zzso linked to zzso controlled by zzso zzso among these additional pathways is a zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The essential role of zzso G proteins in zzso signaling is zzso
