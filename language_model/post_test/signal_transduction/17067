The activity of natural killer zzso cells is controlled by a balance of signals derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso recently shown in humans to interact with two zzso zzso and zzso and to inhibit human zzso zzso Whether mouse zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso is expressed by mouse zzso cells and interacts with mouse zzso Using mouse and human zzso fusion proteins we show that while the human zzso zzso zzso with mouse zzso zzso the binding of zzso is restricted to zzso We further demonstrate using surface zzso resonance zzso and zzso with zzso fusion proteins that zzso binds to zzso with higher affinity than the zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso we show that triggering of zzso leads to the zzso of zzso zzso that zzso zzso is enhanced when zzso is blocked and that the zzso zzso is dominant over the signals delivered by the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we identify the zzso motif responsible for zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso is a powerful zzso zzso for mouse zzso zzso
