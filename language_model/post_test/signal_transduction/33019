zzso is a novel zzso protein expressed on the surface of activated zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso adhere to zzso with high zzso but it is not known if adherence requires zzso zzso and signal zzso To investigate the cell zzso properties of zzso we created zzso forms of zzso that have little or no ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso forms of zzso bound rapidly and with high affinity to immobilized zzso in both zzso and flow zzso Video zzso revealed that zzso cells bound more rapidly to zzso than to zzso zzso versus 190 zzso Unlike zzso zzso did not mediate cell rolling, and after capture on zzso cells did not zzso Finally, soluble zzso induced zzso calcium zzso and zzso but it did not activate zzso Taken together these data provide strong evidence that zzso a zzso domain zzso mediates robust cell zzso to zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and suggest a novel role for this zzso as an zzso zzso
