Using primary cultured cortical zzso from embryonic rat zzso we zzso an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso mechanism through actions of nerve growth factor zzso in developing zzso zzso of zzso in early days in zzso zzso was quite low compared with the mature zzso However, zzso with zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso profoundly raised zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulation resulted in an increase of zzso expression and zzso which was blocked not only by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also by the zzso C inhibitor zzso and the zzso calcium zzso zzso A study of zzso turnover showed that zzso zzso C zzso activity was directly triggered by the zzso zzso activity, but not by the activity of zzso or other zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Sources of zzso zzso calcium levels were contributed by both zzso calcium influx and zzso calcium release and were partially sensitive to zzso zzso These results indicate that in developing cortical zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso may induce zzso followed by zzso of zzso via zzso signaling and zzso calcium zzso and hence increase reception of zzso on zzso zzso A G zzso zzso zzso may be involved in these zzso events for zzso zzso
