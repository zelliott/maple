zzso zzso receptors zzso are a poorly studied zzso of the zzso which have diverse biological roles and are major targets for therapeutic zzso Among them, the Brain zzso zzso zzso family has been linked to several psychiatric disorders, but despite their very high zzso zzso the function of these receptors in the central nervous system has barely been zzso Our results, obtained using expression zzso and zzso experiments, reveal that the zzso zzso controls zzso zzso growth and branching in cultured zzso This role is confirmed in zzso cells in zzso using specific expression of a deficient zzso protein in transgenic mice, as well as zzso driven zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso involves zzso of the zzso zzso and the binding to a functional zzso a critical zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso could lead to direct reorganization of the zzso zzso through zzso signaling in zzso Given the direct link between zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and psychiatric disorders, our zzso data show the importance of further studying the role of the zzso zzso to understand the zzso of such brain zzso
