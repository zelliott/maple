zzso C zzso zzso zzso is a key step in zzso signal zzso in T zzso We used zzso T zzso cells to demonstrate the effect of zzso on cellular levels of the zzso zzso Using zzso real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso analysis, we observed that zzso reduced the zzso transcript and protein contents in zzso T zzso zzso Our results indicate that protein synthesis appears to be crucial in the zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we determined that zzso reduces the zzso of zzso zzso from approximately 2 to zzso Since zzso is considered a key zzso in signal zzso in T cells, zzso may be useful in the treatment of some zzso diseases in which zzso T cells zzso
