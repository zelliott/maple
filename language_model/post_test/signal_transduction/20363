Using the zzso model we describe a previously zzso requirement for the zzso factor zzso controlling embryonic zzso The development of a vascular zzso in the embryonic tail, the zzso zzso tissue zzso fails in zzso depleted of zzso Rather than forming a normal vascular zzso the zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso and cells in the zzso express high levels of zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso emerge from the zzso zzso zzso but fail to colonize the poorly zzso zzso We also found abnormal patterns and levels for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso which was found to be functionally relevant, since the zzso also show defects in development of the lateral line, a zzso organ system highly dependent on a zzso of zzso zzso Reduction of zzso levels was sufficient to rescue lateral line development, zzso and zzso zzso The result was surprising since neither zzso nor zzso is obviously expressed in the zzso zzso we generated transgenic fish that zzso express a zzso zzso zzso and determined that zzso function is required during zzso when it is zzso with zzso in lateral zzso Our study shows that the zzso gene regulates zzso levels during early zzso which impacts embryonic patterning and subsequently the development of the zzso vascular zzso
