zzso posses multiple two component regulatory systems consisting typically of a zzso and a zzso factor that, in concert, monitor the zzso of particular zzso factors and regulate specific gene expression zzso zzso possess zzso which are activated under conditions of zzso zzso and result in gene expression leading to greater stability of the outer zzso New research identifies zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso of zzso peptides zzso adapting bacteria for zzso The development of zzso that do not activate zzso however, should proceed with great zzso zzso are part of the host innate immune response and bacterial resistance to newly developed zzso could possibly lead to intractable infection in zzso zzso
