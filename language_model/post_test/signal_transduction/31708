A zzso of maternal zzso hormones zzso during pregnancy may have severe impacts on fetal brain zzso However, the cellular targets of zzso and their underlying mechanisms are still zzso In this study, we found that maternal zzso during pregnancy in mice inhibited zzso in the embryonic zzso and caused learning and memory impairment in the zzso To explore the underlying mechanisms, we treated cultured mouse embryonic neural stem cells zzso with a zzso level of 3, 5, zzso zzso We found that zzso promoted the zzso differentiation of zzso while zzso zzso zzso In addition, the proliferation and maintenance of zzso were inhibited by zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso was detected in the zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso protein expression with specific zzso eliminated the effects of zzso on zzso We also found that zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso binding activity through zzso The over expression of zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso differentiation of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso promotes the zzso differentiation of zzso by zzso zzso signaling activity through zzso and contributes to early zzso in the embryonic zzso Our studies reveal the zzso effects of zzso in regulating zzso differentiation and suggest that zzso are one of the major cellular targets in the central nervous system by which zzso influences early brain zzso These findings also provide new insights into the mechanisms of neurological deficits caused by zzso zzso during zzso
