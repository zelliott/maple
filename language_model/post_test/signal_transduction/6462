zzso fat zzso is related to several diseases, especially diabetes and heart zzso zzso mechanisms associated with this independent risk factor are not well zzso Through the serial analysis of gene expression zzso strategy, we have studied the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue of zzso male zzso zzso 50,000 zzso tags were isolated in intact and zzso mice, as well as 3 and 24 h after zzso zzso zzso involved in energy zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso involved in zzso and cell cycle and cell shape organization, such as zzso zzso zzso I, zzso types I, III, IV, V and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2, were zzso by zzso Cell defense, division and zzso protein expression and many novel transcripts were regulated by zzso and zzso The present results provide global zzso evidence for a stimulation of zzso fatty acids and zzso production, zzso and cell shape zzso as well as cell proliferation and zzso by zzso The novel transcripts regulated by zzso may contribute to identify new mechanisms involved in the action of sex hormones and their potential role in zzso
