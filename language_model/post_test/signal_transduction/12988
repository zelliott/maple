zzso survival in developing animals is often dependent on zzso zzso In the zzso zzso approximately zzso of the zzso in the avian cochlear nucleus, nucleus zzso zzso die following elimination of zzso nerve zzso The factors that influence death or survival of an individual zzso zzso are largely zzso Previous studies indicate that both cell death and cell survival mechanisms compete to determine cell zzso One factor that has been shown to suppress cell death zzso in a variety of systems is zzso If this gene product plays a role in regulating cell survival following zzso then one might expect the expression of this gene to be influenced by removal of zzso zzso In the present study, in zzso zzso revealed a rapid and transient increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was observed at 6 and 12 h following zzso but not at 3 or 24 zzso Surprisingly, the zzso of zzso zzso was limited to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to the number of zzso zzso that eventually die following zzso zzso The robust and rapid zzso of this gene suggests that cell death zzso regulated by zzso may be initiated following zzso
