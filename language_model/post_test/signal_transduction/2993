zzso zzso processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso is a central event in familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease zzso In a process termed regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso shedding executed either by zzso zzso at the plasma membrane or by zzso in the zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso are zzso within the membrane plane by the zzso complex, releasing the zzso zzso domain zzso into the zzso and leading to the generation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that is initiated by zzso The zzso peptides zzso to form soluble zzso and finally deposit into zzso plaques that are a hallmark of zzso Recent evidence indicates a role for zzso zzso in regulating synaptic plasticity with excess amounts of zzso zzso synaptic zzso The zzso cascade hypothesis of zzso is centered on the zzso zzso the zzso zzso that has been most intensely zzso while other zzso products have been largely zzso The zzso zzso generated after zzso in the zzso zzso has zzso and zzso activities, thus opposing the zzso observed with high zzso of zzso Further, in zzso to many other membrane proteins that are subject to zzso zzso can zzso to the nucleus to regulate zzso Many zzso zzso are localized to the zzso and thus could convey a direct signal from the zzso to the nucleus upon zzso Evidence indicates that only the zzso zzso generates zzso capable of nuclear zzso due to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In aging and sporadic zzso there is an increase in zzso levels and activity generating more zzso peptides and zzso leading to an increase in zzso nuclear zzso In this review, I zzso the current knowledge on zzso nuclear signaling and propose mechanisms to explain how this zzso function of zzso might impact the pathology seen in zzso
