zzso zzso is required for mast cell development, survival, and migration toward its zzso stem cell factor zzso Many solid tumors express zzso and this leads to mast cell recruitment to tumors and release of zzso linked to tumor zzso growth, and zzso Here, we investigate whether zzso zzso zzso a downstream zzso of zzso signaling in mast cells, is required for migration of mast cells toward zzso zzso zzso Using a novel zzso drop zzso for zzso of bone zzso mast cells zzso toward zzso we found that defects in zzso of zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso networks in polarized zzso zzso displayed partial zzso with zzso in polarized zzso and has at least two direct zzso binding sites within its zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso domain had no effect on zzso zzso whereas zzso binding to the zzso domain was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso involvement in mast cell recruitment to tumors was tested using the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso These tumor cells expressed zzso and promoted zzso recruitment in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and subcutaneous tumors in control or zzso mice, revealed a key role for zzso in recruitment of mast cells to the tumor zzso This may contribute to the reduced tumor growth and zzso observed in zzso mice compared with control zzso Taken together, zzso is a potential therapeutic target to limit the progression of tumors with zzso mast cell zzso
