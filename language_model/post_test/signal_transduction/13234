The cerebral complement system is hypothesized to contribute to zzso in the zzso of zzso neurological zzso Our former results have shown that the human zzso virus zzso strongly zzso the synthesis of complement factor zzso in zzso This zzso explains in zzso data showing elevated complement levels in the zzso fluid of patients with zzso neurological zzso Since zzso of complement synthesis and zzso in the brain may represent a putative therapeutic goal to prevent zzso damage, we analyzed in detail the mechanisms of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso levels in zzso culture zzso from 30 to up to 400 zzso signal zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso is the central signaling zzso to mediate that zzso Furthermore, activity of protein zzso C is necessary for zzso induction of zzso since zzso of protein zzso C by prolonged exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partly abolished the zzso zzso The zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma zzso were not involved in zzso the zzso zzso zzso since zzso zzso had no zzso Besides whole zzso zzso the zzso viral proteins zzso and zzso are biologically active in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were not able to zzso zzso zzso Further experiments revealed that zzso were also able to respond on incubation with zzso with increased zzso zzso although the precise pattern was slightly different from that in zzso This strengthens the hypothesis that zzso complement synthesis represents an important mechanism for the zzso of AIDS in the zzso
