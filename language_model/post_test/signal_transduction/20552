zzso blockade of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso is a common therapy for treatment of zzso heart failure and zzso zzso evidence suggests that selective engagement of zzso zzso zzso referred to as biased zzso promotes zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that a zzso zzso zzso zzso would zzso zzso in response to acute cardiac injury compared with the traditional zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso promotes cardiac zzso assessed by zzso loop zzso while blocking the effects of zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso significantly activates zzso and zzso signaling zzso These zzso and zzso effects were lost in zzso knockout zzso zzso In response to cardiac injury induced by zzso zzso injury or mechanical stretch, zzso with zzso significantly diminishes cell death compared with zzso which did not appear to be zzso This zzso effect was lost in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso and functional properties in zzso which are distinct from zzso Our data suggest that this novel class of drugs may provide an advantage over conventional zzso by supporting cardiac function and reducing cellular injury during acute cardiac zzso
