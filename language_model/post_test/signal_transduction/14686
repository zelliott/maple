To investigate the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso after zzso injection of zzso in rat zzso 

Three groups of five zzso rats each were zzso Group I was a normal control group, zzso saline zzso In Group II, one eye received an zzso zzso injection zzso zzso dissolved in zzso while the zzso eye served as zzso In Group III, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso injections were administered 1 zzso before zzso zzso Seven days after injections, zzso zzso zzso in zzso was localized by zzso and fluorescent double labeling of retinal zzso zzso zzso blockade was documented to assess the functional significance of activated zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso in rat zzso was observed in the inner nuclear layer, the outer nuclear layer, and the nerve fiber layer after 3 days zzso injection of zzso increasing significantly after 7 zzso Double zzso zzso demonstrated that the increased retinal zzso for zzso was predominantly localized to the retinal zzso cells after 7 days zzso injection of zzso Moreover, blocking zzso of zzso significantly improved the number of zzso cells in the eyes receiving zzso zzso injections compared with the eyes receiving zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is involved in signal zzso in the zzso after excessive stimulation by zzso which may contribute to the zzso role in retinal zzso cell death induced by zzso
