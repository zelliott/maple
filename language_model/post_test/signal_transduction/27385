zzso and zzso receptors can be either zzso or selectively expressed in zzso zzso Our results indicate that both these peptides can regulate insulin zzso from zzso through their own specific zzso The finding of a selective expression of G proteins in insulin and zzso cells indicates a clear difference in their zzso zzso A key role of the G alpha s family in zzso function is further supported by its zzso cell distribution between different zzso In conclusion, one could zzso that in the human zzso zzso and zzso receptors could mediate their action through different G protein zzso of the G alpha s zzso
