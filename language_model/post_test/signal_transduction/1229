zzso zzso are receiving increased attention as cancer zzso but little is known of the cellular effects of these zzso on tumor zzso We sought to determine whether two agents, zzso and zzso that inhibit vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso merely stop zzso or cause zzso of existing tumor zzso Here, we report that treatment with these zzso caused robust and early changes in zzso cells, zzso and basement membrane of vessels in spontaneous zzso tumors of zzso transgenic mice and in zzso implanted Lewis lung zzso zzso within 24 hours, zzso zzso in zzso tumors disappeared, vascular zzso was zzso and zzso and blood flow ceased in some zzso By 7 days, vascular density decreased more than zzso and zzso and zzso expression was reduced in surviving zzso zzso zzso in Lewis lung tumors, which lacked zzso zzso showed less zzso In both tumors, zzso did not zzso to the same extent as zzso cells, and those on surviving tumor vessels acquired a more normal zzso zzso basement membrane persisted after zzso cells zzso providing a zzso record of zzso vessel number and location and a potential scaffold for vessel zzso The potent zzso action observed is evidence that zzso signaling zzso do more than stop zzso Early loss of zzso zzso in zzso tumors is a clue that vessel zzso may be zzso of exceptional sensitivity to these zzso
