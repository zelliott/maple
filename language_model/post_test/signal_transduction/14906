The activity of zzso II alpha and beta zzso is tightly regulated during different zzso of cell zzso In the present study, the action of zzso agents, zzso acid zzso is analyzed in zzso infected zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso and zzso the expression of zzso II alpha is zzso with that of zzso and is highly sensitive to zzso while the zzso II beta is expressed along with zzso and exhibits low sensitivity to zzso suggesting distinct pathways of regulation for the two zzso zzso infection in these cells enhanced the expression of zzso II alpha and zzso Further, the regulation of zzso II beta and zzso in infected and zzso SK cells is distinctly zzso zzso zzso derived peptides could block zzso zzso inflammation and zzso II alpha and beta zzso suggesting the viral zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso derived peptides and zzso has completely blocked the viral zzso suggesting the enhancement of potency of zzso under the suppression of inflammatory zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso II alpha and beta was zzso by zzso in zzso cells showing distinct regulatory zzso in these cells that was resistant to zzso zzso This suggests the requirement of inflammatory response for productive viral zzso In zzso an induction of zzso zzso inflammatory response can distinctly enhance regulated expression of the cellular zzso II alpha and beta and promote productive infection in zzso and zzso
