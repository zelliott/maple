To assess the role of the zzso zzso motif of the seventh zzso domain in zzso zzso G protein zzso we have zzso the zzso charged zzso in this motif of the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to zzso but polar zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso showed similar binding affinities for the zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso and zzso receptors but not zzso zzso associated with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso but not two zzso receptors had the ability to stimulate zzso activity and to inhibit the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the chemical nature of the zzso acid zzso at position zzso of the seventh zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso the step of zzso association from that of subsequent zzso zzso in the process of the zzso zzso zzso
