Maintenance of adult stem cells is largely dependent on the balance between their zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso provide a powerful in zzso system for studying stem cell fate zzso It has been shown that maintaining the zzso population involves both genetic and zzso zzso Although the role of zzso regulation in this process is zzso the underlying mechanisms remain to be further zzso In this study, we find that zzso mushroom zzso a zzso putative zzso family zzso zzso controls zzso maintenance in the zzso at multiple zzso zzso or zzso of zzso in the zzso causes a zzso maintenance zzso Further studies show that the zzso role of zzso in maintaining zzso is not dependent on the zzso zzso Interestingly, molecular studies reveal an zzso expression of Bruno, an zzso binding zzso in the zzso and their zzso daughter cells zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of Bruno in zzso and their immediate descendants results in a zzso loss that can be exacerbated by incorporating one copy of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest a role for Bruno in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we observe that zzso is required for maintaining zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the niche cells zzso the niche maintenance and zzso signal zzso thereby causing defective zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that the niche size control requires an zzso zzso Taken together, studies in this paper provide new insights into the zzso fate zzso
