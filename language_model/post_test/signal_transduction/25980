zzso of zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso leads to the formation of tumors in nude zzso However, the molecular mechanism for zzso cellular transformation has not been studied in zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein levels were increased substantially in cells zzso zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso was due to a decrease in zzso followed by sustained protein turnover and subsequent zzso These observations suggest that regulation of the turnover rate of zzso is critical for zzso growth and zzso synthesis of transformed zzso
