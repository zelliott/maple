zzso stem cells called zzso zzso generate a variety of zzso and zzso cells in the central nervous system of the zzso zzso These zzso few in number, are selected from a field of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso lobe of the third zzso zzso all zzso cells of the outer zzso zzso zzso develop into either zzso that generate the zzso zzso or zzso zzso precursors of the adult visual zzso The number of zzso and zzso zzso must be precisely regulated because zzso zzso project their zzso directly to corresponding zzso or zzso zzso Here, we show that expression of the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso signals the transition of zzso cells to zzso in the zzso zzso expression is zzso progressing in a synchronized and ordered zzso zzso that sweeps toward more lateral zzso zzso expression is sufficient to induce zzso and is necessary for timely onset of zzso zzso Thus, zzso wave precedes and zzso transition of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso signaling pathway, is expressed in the most lateral zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso wave progression and controls the number of zzso in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso might be balanced with the number of zzso zzso by zzso regulation of zzso wave zzso thereby providing the zzso basis for the formation of a precise zzso map in the visual zzso
