The zzso zzso zzso positively regulates terminal differentiation of zzso but the mechanism by which this occurs remains zzso Using primary zzso cultures, we identified and examined a connection between zzso and the ability of zzso growth zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso with previous reports, treatment with zzso IGF-1 caused an increase in zzso protein that was preceded by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was further shown to zzso the effect of IGF-1 on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso however, blocked the ability of IGF-1 to promote zzso differentiation of cells grown on zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso Indeed, loss of zzso led to a reduction in the ability of IGF-1 to activate zzso but not zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling also prevented zzso increases in zzso basic protein zzso indicating that zzso signaling was necessary to drive zzso enhancement of zzso zzso Using zzso we found that zzso the zzso protein zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso were associated in a protein zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the positive regulatory effect of zzso on zzso differentiation may be zzso at least in part, to zzso ability to promote zzso zzso
