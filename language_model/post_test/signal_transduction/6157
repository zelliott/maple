The three important characteristics of the output signal of zzso activated protein zzso zzso cascade are time delay between stimulus and response, zzso gain, and duration of the output zzso In this study, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the zzso model of zzso growth factor zzso zzso activated zzso cascade developed by zzso and co-workers zzso to identify the sensitive steps of the zzso affecting these zzso We show that the signaling network is sensitive in a zzso manner, which provides the ability to control its output zzso and duration one at a zzso Signal duration is found sensitive only to the zzso reactions at the zzso zzso In contrast, signal zzso is found most sensitive to the zzso reactions at the zzso zzso Time delay is found to be a robust characteristic of the zzso
