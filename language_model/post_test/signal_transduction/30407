The zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso plant pathogen that causes head blight disease on zzso zzso The fungus produces the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in infected zzso posing a threat to human and animal zzso Despite its agricultural and zzso importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying its growth, development and zzso remain largely zzso To better understand such mechanisms, we studied the zzso G proteins of zzso zzso which are known to control crucial zzso pathways that regulate various cellular and zzso responses in zzso Three putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso resulted in female zzso and enhanced zzso and zzso production, suggesting that zzso is required for normal sexual reproduction and repression of toxin zzso The production of zzso and zzso was also enhanced in the zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso protein similar to zzso zzso zzso caused reduced zzso and increased zzso zzso in the cell wall, zzso that zzso has multiple zzso Our study shows that zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso can regulate zzso growth, sexual development, toxin production and zzso
