By interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso triggers various zzso pathways responsible for zzso survival, differentiation and zzso of synaptic zzso Numerous reports have implicated zzso and zzso in the zzso of various central nervous system zzso and in cancer, thus representing zzso as a promising therapeutic zzso In this study, we used an zzso approach to search for zzso functional zzso 

Six commercially available zzso and zzso zzso were tested on zzso and native, human and zzso zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological characterization was performed using a modified version of the zzso method and zzso binding zzso Western zzso analyses and zzso outgrowth zzso were carried out to determine the specificity and selectivity of zzso zzso The survival properties of one zzso were further assessed on cultured zzso in a zzso zzso 

The functional zzso zzso showed distinct pharmacological profiles, ranging from partial zzso to antagonists, acting on zzso receptors through zzso zzso The same diversity of effects was observed on the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso and on the subsequent zzso zzso One zzso with partial zzso activity demonstrated cell survival properties by zzso the zzso zzso Finally, these zzso were functionally validated as true zzso zzso because they failed zzso zzso or zzso and contrary to zzso none of them bind to zzso 

These zzso zzso represent a novel class of pharmacological tools to explore the zzso roles of zzso and its potential therapeutic relevance for the treatment of various zzso
