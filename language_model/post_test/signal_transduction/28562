zzso resistant zzso to zzso zzso were established, showing zzso times more resistance to zzso than parental zzso Both zzso demonstrated increased expression of the zzso molecules of zzso zzso with approximately zzso times increased zzso In zzso cells, zzso B and zzso were zzso whereas zzso was expressed at a similar level to zzso Because of the zzso inhibitor acting as a zzso blocker, results are to the advantage of resistant cells zzso in the presence of an inhibitor under a severe zzso zzso cells showed increased expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso but also slight zzso of protein of zzso which is a negative regulator of zzso possessing zzso zzso activity to zzso zzso zzso zzso acting intimately with zzso was decreased in level compared to zzso These phenomena can be regarded as one of the causes of prevention of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, enabling them to zzso The zzso zzso mainly consisted of a zzso form with resistance to zzso degradation, suggesting that zzso zzso occurred independently of its zzso zzso zzso cells showed resistance not only to zzso but to the 5 zzso zzso while demonstrating collateral sensitivity to zzso
