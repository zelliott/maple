Blood flow plays crucial roles in vascular development, zzso and zzso but the molecular pathways required for zzso flow signals are not well zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which encodes a zzso family type I zzso is dependent on blood flow, and loss of zzso mimics lack of blood flow in terms of zzso of a subset of zzso zzso genes and increased zzso zzso cell zzso These data suggest that blood flow activates zzso signaling to promote a zzso gene expression program that limits nascent zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that restoration of zzso zzso expression to zzso arteries fails to rescue zzso activity or zzso zzso zzso cell gene expression or number, zzso that blood flow may play an additional role in zzso signaling independent of zzso zzso To this end, we define zzso zzso as the crucial zzso for zzso zzso in embryonic vascular development, and provide evidence that circulating zzso acts through zzso zzso to limit zzso cell number in and thereby stabilize the caliber of nascent zzso Thus, blood flow promotes zzso activity by zzso inducing zzso expression and distributing zzso thereby reinforcing this signaling pathway, which functions to limit zzso caliber at the onset of zzso Because zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso zzso our findings suggest that an impaired flow response zzso zzso zzso
