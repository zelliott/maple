The human tumor zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso recognition component of zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso E , zzso , zzso and zzso zzso zzso loss in cancer may thus have profound effects on the pathways that govern cell division, zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso occur in human tumor cell lines and primary zzso , and zzso loss in cultured cells causes genetic instability zzso In mice, deletion of zzso leads to embryonic zzso associated with defective zzso and zzso E regulation zzso The human zzso locus encodes three protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that these zzso occupy discrete zzso compartments and have identified zzso zzso signals within each zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso is zzso zzso with zzso when the zzso is zzso and regulates zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we find that zzso of zzso increases cell size consistent with its ability to control zzso levels in the zzso We suggest that interactions between zzso and zzso within the zzso regulate zzso zzso function and that zzso zzso is likely to be an important zzso consequence of zzso loss in zzso
