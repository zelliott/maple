zzso and its G zzso zzso zzso play important roles in blood pressure regulation, body fluid zzso and possibly the zzso of immune zzso Here, we report that zzso signaling is essential for embryonic zzso and zzso during tumor zzso A detailed expression analysis demonstrates that both zzso and zzso mechanisms mark areas of embryonic and tumor zzso zzso studies in zzso reveal that zzso signaling is required for zzso vessel zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso but not vascular zzso growth factor A zzso is sufficient to trigger premature zzso In zzso zzso is zzso for primary human zzso cells but promotes zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso suggest that zzso signaling functions downstream of zzso Finally, we show that zzso and zzso expression is highly zzso in zzso zzso of brain tumors such as zzso zzso Thus, our results define zzso and zzso as genes of potential diagnostic value and promising targets for the development of a new generation of zzso zzso zzso
