zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently associated with a zzso gene zzso that generates a zzso zzso zzso is a fusion of the zzso zzso domain of zzso to the zzso portion of a different zzso This fusion results in a zzso active zzso pathway, which plays a key role in zzso zzso The zzso fusion is primarily associated with zzso zzso zzso studies show a lower zzso of zzso in zzso regions that are associated with an zzso zzso Since the influence of excess zzso on the development of zzso cancer is still zzso the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of high zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells, a rat zzso cell lineage harboring zzso zzso were treated with zzso M zzso Cell growth was analyzed by cell counting and the zzso zzso The expression and zzso state of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso proteins were analyzed by Western zzso zzso gene expression was further analyzed by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain zzso 

A significant zzso of proliferation was observed, along with no significant variation in cell death rate, in the zzso zzso Further, zzso treatment attenuated the loss of zzso and zzso gene and protein expression induced by zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment reduced zzso and zzso zzso without altering zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results indicate an zzso role for excess zzso during zzso zzso zzso These findings contribute to a better understanding of the effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells, particularly how it may play a protective role during zzso zzso zzso
