We demonstrate that zzso is an essential survival factor in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso through its ability to suppress zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso selectively in zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso family members zzso and zzso and both their induction and subsequent cell death are zzso independent but require zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso involves both direct promoter binding and physical interaction with zzso In zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso is instead zzso and can suppress zzso zzso Together, these data define a zzso zzso zzso promotes survival in zzso zzso zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso
