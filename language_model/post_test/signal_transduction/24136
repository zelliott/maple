zzso zzso are widely used zzso agents known to suppress T cell zzso by interfering with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of early zzso signaling events by these compounds has been recently attributed to a selective displacement of key signaling proteins from membrane zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins zzso for zzso of T cells and zzso associated with zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso T cell zzso possibly by zzso their zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso content of the membrane zzso revealed that zzso treatment led to a significant decrease in zzso acid zzso Moreover, we found an overall decrease in the proportion of zzso saturated fatty zzso These changes were consistent with a decrease in zzso zzso of isolated zzso zzso indicating an increase in their zzso These findings identify the mechanisms underlying the complex zzso effects of zzso on early zzso signaling and suggest that some of the zzso properties of zzso on T cell responses may be related to their ability to affect the membrane zzso composition and the zzso status of important signaling zzso
