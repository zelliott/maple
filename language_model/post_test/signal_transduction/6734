zzso target of zzso zzso is a central zzso that regulates cell survival, proliferation and zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are second zzso with potential in manipulating cellular zzso Here we report that two zzso generating zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells in inducing enhanced zzso by independently zzso both zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Low level transient zzso generated after zzso with these zzso led to zzso of these two zzso Both zzso and zzso pathways played important roles in zzso zzso by knocking down either zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso as evident from zzso of its downstream zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso protein 1, led to release of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso which was subsequently zzso by zzso leading to translation of zzso proteins zzso and Bad without affecting the expression of zzso protein zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso pathways zzso at zzso in zzso enhanced zzso and provide zzso insight for the role of zzso zzso in zzso
