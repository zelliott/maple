zzso protein is a zzso stimulus for zzso zzso zzso release from zzso L zzso This study aimed to zzso the molecular mechanisms employed by L cells to detect zzso 

zzso zzso from zzso primary zzso cultures and zzso dynamics in L cells were monitored in response to zzso and zzso L cells were identified and zzso based on their zzso expression of the fluorescent protein zzso using zzso transgenic zzso zzso tools and knockout mice were used to zzso candidate sensory pathways identified by expression zzso 

zzso zzso was triggered by zzso and zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Two sensory mechanisms involving zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso to zzso (10 zzso were abolished in the absence of zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso blocker zzso (10 zzso and were zzso as demonstrated by their sensitivity to pH and zzso acid and the finding of impaired responses in tissue from zzso (also known as zzso knockout zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso responses were insensitive to zzso but were blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not impaired in mice lacking the putative zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 5 zzso also known as zzso 

zzso stimulate zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Both pathways are highly expressed in native L cells, and likely contribute to the ability of zzso protein to elevate plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways in L cells could be used to zzso zzso zzso stores in humans, and could mimic some of the zzso benefits of zzso zzso
