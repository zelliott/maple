It has been reported that the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso is involved in the growth, invasion, and zzso activity of cultured tumor zzso 

The authors used zzso to examine the expression of zzso and the signaling molecules leading to zzso zzso in 36 zzso biopsy specimens from patients with zzso cell zzso zzso and in 15 specimens from patients with zzso zzso of the oral zzso 

Among the molecules zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso were expressed highly in almost all SCC specimens zzso whereas the samples of normal zzso zzso adjacent to tumors as well as zzso zzso specimens were negative in for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of SCC seemed to correlate with the degree of zzso degree in the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso which may be associated with zzso signaling of zzso was detected in the same areas where zzso existed in large zzso 

The results suggest that high expression levels of zzso and zzso contribute to zzso behavior and zzso activity in SCC of the oral zzso zzso
