zzso tissue engineering offers new possibilities for the functional and structural restoration of damaged or lost heart tissue by applying cardiac patches created in zzso Engineering such functional cardiac patches is a complex mission, involving material design on the zzso and zzso as well as the application of biological cues and stimulation patterns to promote cell survival and organization into a functional cardiac zzso zzso we present a novel strategy for creating a functional cardiac patch by combining the use of a zzso zzso scaffold impregnated with zzso responsive zzso zzso and the application of external magnetic zzso Neonatal rat cardiac cells seeded within the zzso responsive scaffolds and zzso by an alternating magnetic field of 5 zzso developed into matured zzso tissue characterized by zzso organized zzso cardiac zzso which preserved its features for longer times than zzso zzso A greater zzso of zzso zzso in cardiac cell zzso after applying a short-term (20 zzso external magnetic field indicated the efficacy of magnetic stimulation to zzso at a distance and provided a possible mechanism for its zzso Our results point to a synergistic effect of magnetic field stimulation together with zzso features of the scaffold surface as providing the zzso environment for cardiac cells driving their organization into functionally mature zzso
