zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene with a zzso high frequency of gene zzso in pancreatic cancer that suggests a discrete role for zzso in these zzso zzso zzso function has been implicated to mediate the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso however, in a zzso pancreatic cancer cell line, zzso zzso and zzso responses were found to be zzso This was observed within native cells having a natural zzso deletion and in clones engineered for stable expression of zzso zzso integrated into the zzso This observation contrasted with the absolute zzso dependence of zzso responses in a breast cancer cell line studied in zzso This zzso response to zzso in zzso cells relied on an intact zzso zzso zzso These data further suggest a major categorization of zzso responses into zzso and zzso signaling pathways and specifically suggest that disruption of the zzso signal might be a basis of selection for the emergence of zzso zzso during zzso in the zzso and other zzso
