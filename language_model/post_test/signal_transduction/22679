The site for interactions between the nervous system and much of the chemical world is in the zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso to mediate these zzso However, the function of most zzso has not been demonstrated in zzso or in zzso For this and other reasons, we created a zzso immortalized cell line derived from the zzso zzso which we term zzso zzso cells, under control conditions, are zzso similar to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso cells more closely resemble zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso including components of the zzso signal zzso zzso Unlike other cell lines, they also efficiently target zzso zzso to their zzso zzso differentiated zzso cells expressing zzso respond to zzso as measured by an influx of zzso In particular, cells expressing one zzso demonstrate a specific response to only one type of tested zzso zzso cells, therefore, are ideal models to examine the genesis and function of zzso sensory zzso
