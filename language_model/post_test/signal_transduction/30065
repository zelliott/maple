Human zzso zzso cells have the potential to differentiate to zzso or zzso We show interactions between zzso and zzso signaling pathways during stimulation of zzso and zzso of zzso Combining these signals may be useful in zzso zzso cell zzso 

Human bone zzso zzso cells zzso have the potential to differentiate to lineages of zzso zzso including cartilage, fat, bone, tendon, and zzso Agents like transforming growth factor zzso promote zzso differentiation at the expense of zzso zzso In other zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways play major roles in zzso certain zzso events and zzso of specific target zzso We tested whether these pathways interact during differentiation of zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso 

Both a line of human zzso zzso cells zzso and freshly isolated zzso were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso were used for analysis of the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Early passage zzso obtained from zzso and zzso women were used for the effects of zzso and/or zzso zzso by zzso signals on zzso and zzso differentiation in two-dimensional zzso cultures, 3-D zzso cultures, and collagen zzso 

As indicated by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso activated genes in the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and increased nuclear zzso and stability of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso cells and also zzso zzso differentiation and inhibited zzso differentiation in zzso zzso with zzso zzso Finally, zzso cultured in 3-D collagen sponges were zzso by zzso to express zzso and collagen type II zzso whereas expression of zzso zzso was zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation and inhibited zzso differentiation of zzso in zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso signal pathways by zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso signals, supports the view that zzso signaling is one of the mechanisms of zzso effects on zzso and zzso differentiation of zzso
