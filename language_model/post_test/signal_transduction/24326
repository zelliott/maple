The zzso of zzso signaling zzso family of proteins has been implicated in the negative regulation of several zzso zzso particularly the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathways of zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso and zzso zzso signaling by many zzso Because of the previously observed zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and the critical role of zzso zzso as a survival factor in multiple myeloma zzso we examined zzso island zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which correlated with zzso zzso Treatment of these cell lines with the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines correlated with greater sensitivity to the chemical zzso inhibitor zzso Using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso we found that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso of zzso patient zzso In contrast, zzso analysis of zzso zzso of various zzso revealed zzso zzso in only zzso zzso and there was no zzso of zzso in normal peripheral blood zzso or bone zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is frequently zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene may impair negative regulation of the zzso zzso and therefore result in greater responsiveness to zzso thus supporting survival and expansion of zzso zzso
