zzso growth factor beta zzso zzso protein zzso family zzso interact with specific membrane zzso complexes that have zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso induced by the zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso to the nucleus, controlling gene zzso Thus, regulation of zzso proteins is a key step in zzso signal zzso Here we report a novel mechanism of the regulation of zzso zzso by which the zzso protein level is controlled through expression of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified as a zzso zzso However, we have isolated zzso as a zzso protein in a zzso zzso screen using zzso as zzso zzso we have shown zzso interaction using the zzso zzso zzso which can interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction has been confirmed in zzso in zzso cells through zzso Interestingly, we demonstrate that the zzso of zzso and zzso with the zzso protein results in the degradation of the zzso proteins through a zzso zzso zzso with the observation that zzso zzso zzso degradation, we further show that the expression of zzso can inhibit the zzso activities of the zzso complex induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso which diminishes zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso or zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso can interact with the zzso proteins and block zzso signal zzso through the zzso degradation of zzso zzso
