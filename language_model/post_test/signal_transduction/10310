The zzso zzso zzso is crucial for migration of mature zzso cells zzso directed toward secondary zzso zzso however, there is little knowledge about the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in DC and its contribution to directional migration of DC during zzso By comparing the impact of zzso zzso engagement on mature DC we found that the zzso zzso zzso holds a stronger zzso potency than the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso steep and long-lasting zzso of zzso calcium in individual cells and induced intense zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and protein zzso B, while the zzso signals zzso by zzso were in part distinct and significantly zzso Analysis of zzso zzso expression revealed that although zzso and zzso were expressed by a similar percentage of DC, the mean zzso intensity of zzso was up to six times higher, suggesting a higher zzso zzso Based on these correlations we propose that the type of zzso signal in conjunction with the expression and functional activity of the respective zzso zzso is also determining the migration rate and potency of a zzso response in mature zzso In conclusion, our data support the fundamental role of zzso for rapidly guiding DC toward secondary zzso zzso at an zzso and zzso molecular level and on the contrary render zzso a weaker contributor to directional migration of DC during zzso
