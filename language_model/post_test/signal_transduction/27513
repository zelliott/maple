The central nervous zzso of zzso fever and anorexia are manifestations of zzso that seem to be zzso by increased zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor zzso an essential zzso of zzso zzso prevents the zzso degradation of zzso a regulator of zzso zzso The stabilization of zzso by zzso requires zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and the presence of candidate zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is rapidly zzso in mouse brain after exposure to either zzso or zzso a response that is nearly zzso in mice lacking zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso changes in central nervous zzso
