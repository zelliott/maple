Severe traumatic brain injury stimulates the release of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso Studies in cultured mouse zzso suggest that zzso zzso the production of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso lacking zzso zzso indicating that its action is due to zzso binding to an zzso zzso rather than zzso binding to surface zzso Signal zzso may be zzso by zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso abolished zzso induction by zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso occurred further zzso as evidenced by western zzso analysis combined with the use of zzso A and specific zzso zzso By contrast, induction of zzso by zzso necrosis zzso zzso involved both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Following stimulation with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso of human zzso and incubation of these zzso with zzso zzso more efficiently suppressed the migration induced by zzso than by zzso These results show that zzso zzso the production of biologically active zzso in zzso by zzso binding to an undefined zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
