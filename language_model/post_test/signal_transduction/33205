Cell zzso strongly affects the signal zzso cascade initiated by zzso zzso For both zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor, zzso of the consensus zzso protein zzso cascade is impaired when cells are held in suspension as compared with cells anchored to a zzso zzso zzso events in the signaling zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso loading of zzso are similar in anchored and suspended zzso However, propagation of the signal to zzso and subsequently to the downstream zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso is markedly attenuated in suspended zzso Thus, there seems to be a distinct zzso step between Ras and zzso in the signaling cascade initiated by zzso zzso These observations may have important implications for understanding the zzso dependence of cell zzso
