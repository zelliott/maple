Data were presented showing that zzso sites show a unique zzso specificity that differs markedly from that of any of the alpha zzso zzso or the zzso sites labeled by zzso On the other hand, the zzso specificity of zzso sites is maintained across zzso species zzso zzso dog, and zzso and between different zzso and cell zzso zzso sites can be further distinguished from zzso sites because the latter, unlike zzso sites, were not present in zzso zzso from bovine brain zzso Furthermore, zzso sites were modulated by zzso zzso with a specificity appropriate for a zzso coupled to zzso and were mainly localized to plasma zzso zzso sites show a unique pattern of distribution between diverse zzso and cell types and appear to be a zzso marker as well as being present in zzso cells of the pancreatic zzso The widespread distribution of zzso sites implies that the functional significance of this putative zzso may have been zzso The signaling zzso associated with the zzso zzso remains to be fully zzso but is likely that zzso of zzso zzso leading to release of zzso acid and subsequent generation of zzso plays a major zzso
