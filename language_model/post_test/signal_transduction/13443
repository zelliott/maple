We previously demonstrated that embryonic stem zzso cell zzso required sustained signaling by leukemia zzso factor zzso in a zzso manner, allowing us to zzso that thresholds in zzso signaling zzso stem cell differentiation zzso To test this hypothesis, we have zzso and zzso compared the abilities of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to sustain zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso markers zzso embryonic zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso body formation zzso and zzso factor zzso expression over a range of zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a superior ability of zzso to maintain zzso cell zzso at higher zzso zzso or zzso zzso Additionally, we observed distinct qualitative differences in the zzso cell zzso dose response profiles between the two zzso A zzso model permitted calculation of the number of signaling complexes as a function of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties, generating predictions for the degree of zzso as a function of zzso concentration by comparison of these calculated complex numbers to zzso determined threshold zzso zzso Model predictions, consistent with experimental data, indicated that differences in the zzso of these two zzso were based primarily on differences in zzso zzso and zzso These results support a zzso signaling threshold model of zzso cell fate zzso through appropriate types and levels of zzso zzso zzso from these results may be more generally zzso to zzso stem cells and could aid in the development of stem zzso zzso
