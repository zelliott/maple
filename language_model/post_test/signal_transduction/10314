To date, much of our knowledge about the signaling networks involved in the innate immune response has come from studies using zzso model systems rather than actual immune zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso strategy to identify the components of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso This systems approach revealed 16 potential zzso partners, one of which, zzso I zzso zzso was verified to interact with zzso and was further characterized as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso a reduction in zzso zzso by zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso as well as zzso production by zzso zzso from zzso and a zzso zzso further indicated that zzso directly zzso with the formation of the zzso signaling zzso These results in turn suggest a new basis for the regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso
