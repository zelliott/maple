The zzso is zzso in that zzso the function of vascular zzso molecules blocks zzso recruitment and thus tissue zzso The function of zzso cells during zzso recruitment is regulated by zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso In inflammatory sites and zzso zzso the zzso is zzso to express zzso molecules that mediate zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso these zzso molecules activate zzso cell signal zzso that then alters zzso cell shape for the opening of zzso through which zzso can zzso If the stimulation of this opening is zzso inflammation is zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso cell zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced on zzso cells during inflammatory diseases by several zzso including zzso Then, zzso on the zzso functions as both a scaffold for zzso migration and a trigger of zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso These zzso induce signals for the opening of zzso zzso through which zzso zzso In several inflammatory diseases, inflammation is blocked by zzso of zzso binding to zzso or by zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso inflammation are blocked by zzso Thus, zzso signaling is a target for intervention by pharmacological agents and by antioxidants during inflammatory zzso This review discusses zzso and zzso functions during zzso of zzso expression and zzso signaling in inflammatory zzso
