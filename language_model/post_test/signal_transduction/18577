zzso play an essential role in iron zzso by zzso iron in a zzso and zzso zzso In plants, zzso zzso are highly and quickly accumulated in response to iron zzso Such zzso leads to a subsequent zzso protein synthesis and iron storage, thus avoiding zzso stress to take zzso By combining pharmacological and imaging approaches in an zzso cell culture system, we have identified several elements in the signal zzso zzso leading to the increase of zzso transcript level after iron zzso zzso oxide quickly accumulates in the zzso after iron zzso This compound acts downstream of iron and upstream of a zzso zzso to promote an increase of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso has been previously shown to be zzso under low iron conditions with the involvement of the zzso element zzso regulatory sequence identified within the zzso promoter zzso We show here that the zzso is unlikely a zzso factor directly bound to the zzso regulatory zzso such a zzso is zzso upon iron treatment and subsequently zzso through a 26 S zzso zzso
