zzso and zzso breast zzso have distinct zzso zzso which play a role in progression to invasive zzso However, little is known about how zzso interactions evolve in benign and zzso zzso 

To study zzso interactions in zzso breast cancer zzso we zzso reduction zzso zzso with the zzso zzso series of cell lines (representing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We used gene expression zzso to identify pathways induced by zzso in zzso cells zzso compared with normal and benign cells zzso and zzso zzso pathways were then evaluated in zzso for associations with zzso zzso and were targeted in zzso to evaluate effects on zzso 

Our results show that zzso zzso cells express characteristic gene expression patterns of invasive zzso zzso Furthermore, while zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso zzso to normal, zzso zzso when zzso are zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, only zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso In three-dimensional cultures, zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced zzso changes suggestive of invasive potential, and these changes were reversed by zzso blocking of zzso zzso These results are relevant to in zzso progression because high expression of a novel zzso zzso signature was correlated with the zzso zzso with approximately zzso of zzso zzso highly expressing the zzso signature, and because high expression of zzso signature was associated with poor zzso 

zzso and complementary changes in zzso expression occur in zzso and zzso during progression of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that targeting zzso zzso signaling in early zzso may block progression of zzso precursor zzso
