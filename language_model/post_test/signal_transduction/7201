Despite the successful application of zzso zzso acid zzso in multiple myeloma treatment, zzso zzso in the myeloma patients is very common in zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso myeloma cells to explore the zzso mechanism zzso zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso via a zzso signaling pathway, leading to enhanced zzso activity zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso rapidly activated zzso zzso and stress activated protein zzso cascade to zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was recruited to the zzso promoter to evoke the gene zzso The stimulation of zzso on zzso expression was attenuated by either zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso modification and zzso of zzso an important zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso a competitive zzso zzso abolished the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso played a dominant role in the expression of zzso zzso our study suggests the existence of a zzso mechanism involving zzso cascade and zzso induction to mediate zzso zzso expression and acquired zzso in myeloma zzso
