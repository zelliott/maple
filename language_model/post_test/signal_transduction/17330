zzso skeletal muscle is composed of distinct types of zzso that are functionally adapted through differences in their zzso and zzso zzso An understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso is of relevance to human health and zzso The zzso provides an attractive model for investigating zzso type zzso not only are their rapidly developing zzso zzso transparent, but in contrast to zzso the embryonic zzso shows a discrete zzso and spatial separation of zzso type zzso that zzso its zzso Here we review the current state of understanding of muscle zzso type zzso and differentiation during embryonic development of the zzso with a particular focus on the roles of the zzso and zzso zzso factors, and consider the relevance of these findings to higher zzso muscle zzso
