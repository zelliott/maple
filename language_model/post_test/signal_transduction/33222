The reversal line zzso the zzso of zzso activity from the zzso of zzso activity at a zzso site in zzso It is a zzso between segments of bone that are formed at different zzso We believe that the reversal line contains regulatory signals that, in part, control zzso zzso We have conducted a pilot study to examine the fate of reversal lines during abnormal bone zzso in zzso zzso A surgical zzso zzso was created in a zzso monkey zzso zzso allowed to heal in the presence of zzso and evaluated zzso In this model, there is an acute inflammatory reaction followed by compromised bone zzso zzso bone rather than zzso bone was deposited in the zzso A striking finding in this zzso model was the disruption of the zzso material along the reversal zzso This supports our theory that disruption of the signaling molecules in the reversal line may be responsible for uneven woven bone zzso
