In general, zzso Ras zzso zzso exchange factors zzso show little zzso zzso although they are often thought to regulate specific zzso Here, we provide in zzso and in zzso evidence that two zzso can each act on specific Ras zzso During zzso development, zzso and zzso are activated in response to zzso zzso with each regulating different downstream zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was abolished in a zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was normal in this strain, indicating that zzso activates zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso was normal in a zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was greatly reduced, indicating that zzso activates zzso These results were confirmed by the finding that zzso and zzso specifically released zzso from zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso This zzso target specificity provides a mechanism for one upstream signal to regulate two downstream processes using independent zzso
