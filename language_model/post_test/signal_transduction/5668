zzso natural systems are known to display some sort of distributed zzso against the loss of individual zzso Such type of zzso is not just the result of zzso Instead, it seems to be based on zzso zzso the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function or yield the same zzso Here, we explore the problem of how relevant is zzso in a class of evolved digital systems formed by zzso gates, and what types of network structures zzso the resilience of evolved designs to the removal or loss of a given zzso It is shown that our fault tolerant circuits are obtained only if zzso arises in a distributed zzso No such reliable systems were reached just by means of zzso thus suggesting that reliable designs are necessarily tied to zzso
