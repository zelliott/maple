zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso differentiation by zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we identified a novel suppression zzso operating in the early phase of zzso that increased the production of zzso zzso and zzso by enhancing zzso zzso 2 expression through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso zzso expression was enhanced with a peak at 1 h for the zzso level and at 3 h for the protein level after the addition of zzso an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso expression was suppressed by the zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso within 10 zzso after the addition of zzso and its zzso was inhibited by the zzso with zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cascade and zzso expression increased the production of zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso and each inhibitor for zzso and zzso suppressed the zzso zzso induction of synthesis of these zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression was activated through binding of zzso to the promoter region of the zzso gene in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso suppresses the progression of the early phase of zzso by enhancing the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter via zzso zzso activated zzso zzso Thus, zzso forms a positive feedback loop that zzso suppresses the early phase of zzso through the increased production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
