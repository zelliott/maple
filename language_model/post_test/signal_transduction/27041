We have isolated an alternative transcript of the rat zzso alpha signal zzso protein zzso referred to as zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso was isolated by differential zzso screening of genes induced upon zzso treatment of the zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso transcript is generated by alternative zzso and zzso of a novel terminal zzso This zzso lies 800 base pairs downstream of zzso 3 in the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso induced zzso alpha zzso zzso relative to zzso alpha zzso in the zzso cells, similar to the bias seen with alternative processing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the differential regulation by zzso the expression pattern of zzso alpha zzso in rat zzso differed markedly from zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso was much more abundant in the brain, with intermediate levels in skeletal muscle and very low levels in other zzso This was in contrast to the more zzso expressed zzso alpha zzso Within the brain, zzso alpha zzso was particularly abundant in discrete regions of the zzso and zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso demonstrated that zzso alpha is expressed in both brain and zzso tissue at least 1 day before zzso alpha zzso zzso could be detected in the embryonic zzso Based on the regulated expression of the zzso alpha zzso transcript and previous studies on G alpha zzso the predicted zzso alpha zzso protein may potentially zzso several zzso G protein functions in the nervous zzso
