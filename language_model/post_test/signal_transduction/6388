The type V zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso growth zzso by zzso and mediates growth zzso by zzso in concert with the other zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently found to be identical to zzso Here we find that insulin and zzso zzso (an zzso analog that has a low affinity for zzso antagonize growth zzso by zzso in mink lung zzso cells zzso zzso zzso by zzso In these cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is prevented by zzso of cells with insulin, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The magnitude of the zzso zzso induced by zzso positively zzso with the degree of growth zzso by zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells (which lack zzso zzso proteins and are insensitive to growth zzso by zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to growth zzso by zzso this zzso growth zzso can be completely reversed by insulin in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso and the insulin zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are key molecules for the zzso growth zzso signaling zzso
