zzso V zzso zzso the zzso branching of zzso on zzso zzso expression is elevated during zzso transformation in various types of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso promotes cancer progression is zzso To characterize the biological significance of zzso we established zzso transgenic zzso mice, in which zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso No spontaneous cancer was detected in any zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso mouse skin, and cultured zzso derived from these mice showed enhanced migration, which was associated with changes in zzso zzso and zzso transition zzso Further, zzso factors zzso twist, and zzso were zzso and zzso wound healing was accelerated in zzso We further investigated the detailed mechanisms of zzso by assessing zzso signaling and found zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso mouse zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso migration in part through enhanced zzso zzso zzso
