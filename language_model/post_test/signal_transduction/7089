All zzso are derived from a common zzso unit, zzso zzso zzso In plants, zzso is zzso via two distinct zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a zzso analysis to identify zzso factors that zzso regulate the expression of multiple genes zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Some candidates showed especially strong correlations with multiple genes zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso factor 5 zzso a zzso type zzso factor, functions as a positive regulator of the zzso zzso Its zzso in zzso suspension cultured cells resulted in increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso by zzso indicated that some zzso zzso pathways were zzso zzso possibly as a result of enhanced zzso zzso zzso Our results also revealed other zzso family proteins that play different roles from that of zzso in zzso zzso
