zzso possess multiple zzso growth factor zzso binding proteins zzso and related zzso that zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso a zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso that affects animal zzso Here, we examine if increased levels of an zzso protein can extend zzso using zzso as the model zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso protein and the fly zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso is capable of binding at least two of the seven zzso zzso peptides zzso namely native zzso and zzso as present in the adult zzso Increased expression of zzso results in zzso changes in the adult consistent with zzso of zzso including zzso of zzso binding protein zzso increase in storage zzso reduced zzso and enhanced zzso stress zzso Increased zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealing a feedback circuit that is zzso via the fly gut and/or fat zzso zzso zzso of zzso ubiquitous or restricted to zzso cells or gut and fat body, extends zzso This enhanced longevity can also be observed upon zzso induction of zzso indicating it is not attributable to zzso zzso Our findings point to the possibility that an zzso or a related zzso such as zzso plays a role in zzso zzso
