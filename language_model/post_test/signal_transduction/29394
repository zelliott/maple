zzso a zzso zzso agent, has shown to suppress zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso almost completely suppressed production of zzso oxide zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso induced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso human zzso and zzso cells, whereas this agent showed little effect on other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double strand zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited nuclear factor zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso whereas this agent showed little effect on other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso of zzso Although zzso zzso which are consist of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of human or mouse zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the signaling from zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso is therefore a selective inhibitor of signaling from the zzso domain of zzso and represents a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of zzso zzso
