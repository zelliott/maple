The introduction of biologically sound radiation zzso regimens and combinations of zzso with chemotherapy have gradually improved both the survival of patients with locally advanced head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and the prospect of organ zzso zzso zzso however, has shown that some of the zzso combinations are associated with increased late zzso This zzso in conjunction with advances in tumor biology, has led to the launch of investigations into molecular markers and targets for therapeutic zzso Research on the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso has enriched our understanding of the biology of zzso in terms of zzso and cellular processes governing tumor response to zzso The finding that the addition of an zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso to zzso significantly improves zzso control and overall survival rates in patients with locally advanced zzso without increasing zzso zzso has resulted in the growing acceptance of such combined regimens as a frontline therapy option for locally advanced zzso Because such therapy has benefited only an additional zzso of patients, studies are being undertaken to identify markers and mechanisms of resistance to zzso zzso that are essential for the further refinement of zzso Overall, zzso and clinical studies on zzso have validated the concept that selective tumor radiation zzso can be achieved by modulating a specific zzso signaling pathway, and these studies have increased the enthusiasm for developing and investigating other novel agents targeting other cellular zzso
