We investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso in modulating the zzso properties of the zzso zzso cells zzso were placed in zzso flow chambers and exposed to zzso human blood at a zzso wall zzso rate zzso zzso zzso deposition on resting zzso treated with a control zzso was zzso In contrast, a significant amount of zzso deposited when TM expression was specifically suppressed by zzso zzso by zzso zzso with an zzso zzso Similarly, zzso deposited on zzso zzso zzso but the zzso deposition was further increased zzso with zzso zzso zzso results were found when zzso were zzso at 650 zzso When TM surface activity was enhanced by zzso by treating zzso with active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the deposition of zzso was zzso lower than on zzso not zzso with zzso Finally, zzso deposition on zzso zzso was significantly higher in 11 zzso patients with zzso deficiencies of protein C or S or zzso factor V zzso zzso than in 11 healthy individuals, and it was significantly correlated to zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso Thus, this study zzso the central role of the zzso zzso S zzso in modulating the zzso status of resting and zzso zzso and indicates that zzso zzso system markers may be helpful in monitoring patients presenting a disorder of this zzso zzso
