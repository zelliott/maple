zzso not only acts as a sensor of cellular energy status but also plays a critical role in the energy balance of the zzso In this study, zzso signaling was investigated in zzso obese zzso and diet resistant zzso zzso In zzso zzso rats had lower level of zzso zzso and zzso than zzso or DR zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression were reduced in zzso of zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso an zzso of zzso increased zzso expression but did not alter zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso zzso protein content and zzso level were lower in the zzso tissue of zzso rats compared to zzso and DR zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso protein levels obtained from zzso fat pad were zzso correlated with zzso fat zzso zzso protein content and zzso in skeletal muscle of zzso rats were not different from those in the muscles of zzso and DR zzso In zzso zzso rats, but not DR rats, have impaired zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the disturbed energy balance observed in zzso rats is related with abnormalities of zzso signaling in a tissue specific zzso
