A potential zzso site within the essential zzso zzso region of the zzso protein was interrupted by a lethal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The elimination of two potential zzso sites found in the same region zzso zzso and zzso zzso does not affect growth but completely prevents zzso zzso zzso in the double zzso whereas the single zzso produce normal or slightly retarded zzso zzso A cluster of five potential targets for zzso zzso at the zzso region could be deleted without affecting zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso 137 zzso of the zzso protein are involved in three different zzso control of zzso growth, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
