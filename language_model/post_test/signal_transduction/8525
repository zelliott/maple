Brain zzso systems play critical roles in mood, zzso emotion, zzso learning and attention, and zzso in brain zzso activity is associated with a variety of zzso zzso The present commentary focuses on trace zzso zzso 1 zzso and its potential regulatory roles in brain zzso zzso zzso was discovered in 2001 and has been established to be a zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso This zzso is activated by a broad spectrum of zzso although there are notable species differences in zzso efficacy and zzso zzso is expressed and widely distributed in brain zzso systems and zzso with the zzso zzso in a subset of zzso zzso in zzso monkey and mouse brain zzso zzso zzso zzso by the common zzso zzso the trace zzso zzso and methamphetamine alters the zzso zzso function in both mouse and zzso monkey brain zzso suggesting a zzso role for this zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso However, little is known about other functional roles of zzso in the zzso With a purpose to promote further studies on this zzso we zzso discuss the recent findings that provide insights into the functional significance and biological relevance of this zzso as a zzso in brain zzso zzso
