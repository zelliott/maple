zzso are prominent regulators of zzso zzso While most zzso cells express only one zzso two zzso zzso and zzso are present in the zzso To challenge the hypothesis that the expression of two zzso zzso is linked to the complex shape of zzso and to the zzso structural zzso we zzso how zzso and zzso respond to changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso embryonic zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed both zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso on brain sections demonstrated both zzso in zzso of the mature zzso cortex, zzso and zzso Both zzso were significantly more abundant in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso showed zzso associated with zzso clusters of the zzso active zone in zzso zzso of embryonic zzso When cultures were zzso in order to change their activity level, active zzso that were identified by the zzso of zzso zzso displayed significantly higher amounts of both zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors by the zzso zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso but left zzso zzso zzso by the brain derived zzso factor zzso on the other hand, led to a significant increase in both synaptic zzso and zzso zzso results were obtained for zzso zzso both zzso were localized in the same nucleus, and their levels rose significantly in response to zzso zzso whereas zzso caused here a higher increase in zzso than in zzso Our results strongly support the notion of an zzso specific role for zzso as regulators of zzso dynamics in different zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso Furthermore, they suggest a functional role for both zzso in zzso zzso
