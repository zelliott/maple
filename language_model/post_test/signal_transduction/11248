A T cell zzso raised against the synthetic zzso zzso was used to study whether the initial zzso signaling events are markedly different when the zzso is zzso with zzso closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso group zzso to the central zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso is known to be highly specific for this zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins and the downstream zzso zzso zzso and strong zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso which differs from zzso solely by the orientation of a zzso group in the zzso structure, completely failed to induce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso which differs from zzso by not having a zzso group in the zzso zzso acid side chain to which the zzso is zzso induced partial zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso complex revealed that the dramatic difference between the zzso power of zzso and zzso is mainly due to very small differences in the zzso exposed zzso zzso
