A zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the vicinity of the zzso complex and zzso downstream signaling by interaction with negative zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of this recruitment remain zzso We have found that zzso associates with zzso upon zzso stimulation and that zzso is essential for zzso zzso By analysis of several zzso zzso the zzso binding domain zzso of zzso was found to be both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso domain, a novel zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is critical for zzso association with zzso Through this association, zzso is recruited to the zzso raft after zzso zzso and exerts zzso zzso The in zzso significance of this association is illustrated by the fact that zzso responses are impaired in transgenic mice expressing zzso zzso but not in mice expressing zzso zzso lacking the zzso Furthermore, T cells from zzso mice showed enhanced zzso responses upon zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso association is critical for the zzso function of zzso zzso that zzso induced in zzso T cells may exert an efficient negative feedback loop by recruiting zzso molecules to the zzso raft and competing with zzso through zzso zzso
