This study investigated the effects of zinc on zzso zzso zzso expression in human cancer zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines in a zzso and zzso zzso The induction of zzso by zinc was detected after 4-6 hours of treatment, reached zzso level at 8 hours, and declined zzso Using a human zzso gene promoter reporter zzso we identified two zzso response elements zzso that zzso the zzso increase in zzso gene transcription, indicating that the nuclear factor zzso zzso 2 zzso signaling zzso is involved in this zzso This assumption was supported by the observations that zzso of zzso expression compromised the zzso increase in zzso gene transcription, and that zinc increased zzso protein expression and the zzso binding to the zzso Additionally, we found that the zzso zzso gene zzso can be enhanced by zzso a zinc zzso and reversed by zzso with zzso a known zinc zzso indicating that an increase in zzso zinc levels is responsible for this zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zinc at zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in human cancer zzso The biological significance of this induction merits further zzso
