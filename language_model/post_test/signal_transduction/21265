Treatment of cultured carrot cells with zzso zzso or zzso resulted in the appreciable decrease in zzso zzso zzso This decrease was found to be transient and the concentration of the zzso in the culture medium restored to the original level within few zzso The zzso decrease in zzso level in the medium was almost completely inhibited when carrot cells were incubated in the presence of zzso channel blockers, zzso and zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso were discharged from zzso zzso zzso of carrot plasma membrane by the stimulation with zzso however, the release of the zzso was significantly inhibited in the presence of the zzso channel zzso The release of zzso from the zzso was also observed when zzso current was evoked with an zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso These results suggest that the gating of some of the inward zzso channels located at plasma membrane of cultured carrot cells is controlled by zzso concentration of zzso and the inward zzso current across the plasma membrane induced by the zzso elicits zzso influx into the cells possibly by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
