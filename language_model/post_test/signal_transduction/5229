This study assessed zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso leaf extract on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with or without zzso zzso extract for 1 h prior to incubation with zzso for 24 zzso zzso activity was evaluated with reference to zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso In addition, NO and zzso zzso generation were determined by zzso method and zzso intensity and zzso of zzso and zzso by Western zzso 

Prior treatment with zzso zzso leaf extract inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with their zzso zzso in a zzso zzso NO and zzso zzso contents were similarly zzso These effects were due to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso ethanol extract was shown to contain zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso acid, compounds known to exert these zzso zzso 

zzso zzso leaf extract possesses zzso effects against zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso has a high potential to be used as a food supplement to reduce risk of cancer associated with zzso
