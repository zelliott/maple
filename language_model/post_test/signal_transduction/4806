zzso zzso is responsible for zzso a zzso disease that affects 200 million people zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso interaction are complex and involve a zzso between host signals and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has been shown to play an important role in zzso zzso development and zzso In particular human zzso zzso has been shown to bind to a zzso zzso zzso zzso a signal that regulates the expression of a zzso target zzso Here we describe zzso zzso genes whose expression levels are affected by in zzso treatment with zzso Among these zzso expressed genes we highlight genes related to zzso development and cell cycle that could be players of zzso effects on the zzso We confirm by zzso the expression changes detected with zzso for 5 out of 7 selected zzso We also highlight a set of zzso zzso transcribed from the same zzso of zzso genes that are zzso expressed upon zzso zzso These zzso offer potential targets to be explored in order to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the possible role of zzso effects on zzso zzso
