zzso play a critical role in the initiation and progression of a variety of zzso We sought to define the interactions between zzso activated human zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso by employing a cell culture system that permits the accurate assessment of the contribution of soluble factors and zzso zzso Human peripheral blood zzso primed with zzso and zzso were activated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso induced higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis by zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso by a porous membrane decreased the zzso synthesis of zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso against the beta 2 zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso production by 40 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso surface zzso directly enhanced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso and zzso beta decreased zzso production by zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (to preserve membrane integrity but prevent zzso zzso zzso with zzso at various ratios, induced zzso zzso and zzso synthesis by zzso Plasma membrane preparations from activated zzso also induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso The addition of plasma membrane enhanced zzso zzso zzso production by approximately zzso Together, these data suggest that the zzso is essential for optimal zzso function of zzso that zzso zzso stimulate zzso through both soluble factors and zzso contact zzso zzso and that both pathways are essential for maximum stimulation of zzso
