zzso cells sense oxygen levels and respond to hypoxic conditions through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways and zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso on the activity of two zzso regulators, zzso and zzso in skeletal muscle cells in primary zzso We found that zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and that it zzso zzso gene zzso as well as nuclear zzso of a green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso required calcium entry through zzso calcium zzso zzso release from zzso stores was also necessary for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso a general scavenger of zzso oxygen species, blocked zzso zzso generation but did not affect the stimulation of zzso zzso induced by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and did not depend on zzso zzso as shown by the lack of effect of the upstream zzso inhibitor zzso These separate pathways of zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso may contribute to muscle adaptation in response to hypoxic zzso
