zzso adaptation is a zzso phenomenon, the zzso bases of which reside largely in the primary visual zzso The cellular mechanisms of contrast adaptation were investigated in the cat primary visual zzso in zzso through zzso recording and current zzso Visual zzso cells, and to a much less extent, zzso lateral zzso nucleus zzso zzso exhibited a reduction in firing rate during prolonged presentations of a zzso visual zzso a process we termed zzso zzso In a majority of cortical and zzso cells, the period of adaptation to high contrast was followed by a prolonged zzso zzso period of reduced responsiveness to a zzso stimulus zzso zzso an effect that was zzso and positively zzso with a zzso of the membrane potential and an increase in apparent membrane zzso In simple cells, the period of zzso suppression was not consistently associated with a decrease in the grating modulated component of the evoked synaptic zzso (the F1 zzso The generation of the zzso appears to be at least partially intrinsic to the recorded cells, because the induction of zzso activity with the zzso injection of current resulted in both a zzso of the membrane potential and a decrease in the spike response to either current injections or visual zzso zzso zzso visual stimulation could suppress the response to zzso zzso current zzso We conclude that control of the membrane potential by intrinsic zzso mechanisms contributes zzso to the adaptation of zzso responsiveness to varying levels of zzso This feedback zzso internal to cortical zzso provides them with the ability to continually adjust their responsiveness as a function of their history of synaptic and action potential zzso
