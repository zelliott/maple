The zzso protein is a key zzso protein in zzso zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso Its zzso function is to link the activity of the zzso zzso to the zzso of two parallel zzso pathways dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms by which zzso interacts with, and zzso zzso are well zzso However, little was known about how zzso zzso the zzso of zzso We show here that the zzso of zzso is specifically important for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso but not for the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso is specifically important for zzso zzso arrest after zzso and zzso zzso damage but not for tolerating zzso damage or zzso zzso activity at zzso This work extends data showing that zzso zzso within the zzso zzso protein allow it to activate two distinct zzso zzso pathways independently of each zzso
