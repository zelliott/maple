zzso plays a critical role in maintaining zzso integrity by selectively removing the most heavily damaged cells from the zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and certain inflammatory zzso are always elevated during the human zzso zzso However, the biological significance of the interplay between zzso and inflammatory zzso remains zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso effectively protects gastric cancer cells from the zzso induced by hydrogen zzso zzso The cell death signaling zzso zzso zzso by zzso is also inhibited by zzso We further found that zzso but not other zzso family members, was zzso by zzso by a substantial level over 24 zzso We further zzso a zzso expression zzso zzso into the zzso cells, and successfully obtained several zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that these zzso zzso cells are more resistant to the zzso induced by zzso when compared with the zzso control zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso induced by zzso is also blocked in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso effect of zzso is, at least in part, due to the zzso of zzso To our surprise, either zzso exposure or zzso zzso fails to reduce the level of zzso zzso in the zzso cells triggered by zzso This study also determined the level of zzso zzso an indicator for zzso DNA zzso in zzso or zzso zzso cells after treatment with zzso zzso our results indicate that a majority of the zzso is efficiently removed in the zzso cells without zzso treatment, whereas only approximately 50% of the zzso was repaired in the zzso zzso cells after 24 zzso Similarly, approximately zzso of the zzso also failed to repair and was retained in the zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso in this study provide a novel mechanism by which zzso of the zzso protein by zzso may enhance the zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso by overriding zzso
