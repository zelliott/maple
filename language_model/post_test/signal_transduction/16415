zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor zzso Several zzso genes for ALS have been zzso however, ALS zzso and zzso remain largely zzso To identify further zzso zzso we conducted a large-scale zzso association study using zzso tag zzso zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso was found to be significantly associated with ALS through a zzso screening approach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso The zzso was located in an zzso region of zzso a zzso factor of unknown biological function, and the zzso zzso showed decreased activity and decreased binding to nuclear zzso zzso zzso increased transforming growth zzso zzso zzso while zzso had the opposite zzso zzso expression was increased in the anterior horn motor zzso of the spinal zzso of ALS patients when compared with zzso zzso results strongly suggest that zzso is an important positive regulator of zzso signaling and that decreased zzso expression increases zzso to zzso
