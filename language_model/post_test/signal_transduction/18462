DNA repair pathways are crucial for the maintenance of zzso zzso The zzso that repairs DNA zzso breaks zzso has components involved in both signaling and repairing DNA zzso zzso zzso repair using specific zzso of signaling or repair might, in principle, sensitize tumor cells to particular zzso zzso Moreover, the existence of specific defects in DNA repair pathways in tumors provides the rationale for the use of zzso zzso approaches targeting this cellular zzso zzso Here, we discuss the mechanisms involved in zzso repair and detail potential therapeutic approaches based on targeting this zzso
