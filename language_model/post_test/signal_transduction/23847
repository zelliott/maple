Recent experimental findings show that the efficacy of transmission in cortical zzso depends on zzso zzso In most neural models, however, the zzso are regarded as zzso entities where this dependence is not zzso We study the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso responses to zzso patterns of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that, for suitably chosen threshold values, dynamic zzso are capable of coincidence detection zzso over a much larger range of zzso than zzso zzso The phenomenon appears to be valid for an zzso as well as a zzso zzso and various types of CD zzso
