Analysis of zzso events by classical zzso approaches is limited as the outcome is an averaged zzso for protein zzso of a single protein within a cell zzso This is a clear restriction when addressing zzso events in mixed populations or zzso of zzso By combining flow zzso with a panel of zzso zzso against several signal molecules simultaneously in a zzso zzso flow zzso analysis it is possible to obtain a higher level of understanding of the signal zzso dynamics at a single cell zzso In addition, analysis of mixed cell populations makes it possible to study cells ex zzso in a state more closely resembling the in zzso zzso The zzso analysis yields information on combinations of signals turned on and off in specific settings such as disease zzso zzso that can be used for zzso analysis and for development of drug screening zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to signal through four zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso a multitude of potential zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso network zzso by zzso of the four zzso receptors in zzso cells revealing several zzso zzso is reviewed as an zzso
