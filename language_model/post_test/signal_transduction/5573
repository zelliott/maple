zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is suppressed by the zzso zzso gamma but the mechanism of this action is zzso We zzso activity of zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso B cells that were treated at zzso h with zzso zzso zzso followed by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso at 0 zzso zzso treatment suppressed zzso zzso promoter activity in a construct carrying the zzso promoter and also one containing the zzso zzso The suppression was independent of the zzso at zzso but involved the zzso at zzso In zzso analysis this zzso motif did bind zzso zzso and with zzso treatment it did, in addition, bind zzso zzso analysis for detection of zzso factor binding to zzso in intact cells demonstrated zzso binding to the zzso zzso promoter when cells are zzso with zzso zzso Treatment with zzso only led to zzso binding in zzso analysis and treatment with zzso plus zzso led to reduced zzso binding while zzso binding remained zzso Finally, zzso activity of the zzso zzso in front of the zzso reporter was suppressed by zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene by a novel mechanism that involves displacement of zzso zzso by zzso zzso
