This study aims to understand the mechanisms of zzso targeting of zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso B zzso zzso We show that brief zzso are sufficient to induce zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the zzso zzso contributes significantly to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso are sufficient to induce zzso zzso of zzso zzso After binding to zzso zzso exerts this action by zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is not zzso by zzso neurotransmitter zzso Because most zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these results show that the zzso distribution of zzso zzso is under the control of an zzso zzso zzso
