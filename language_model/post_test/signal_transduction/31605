The cellular effects of zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso the zzso zzso Typically, the zzso zzso is viewed to exert its activity by binding to zzso response elements located in or near the promoter region of target zzso thereby directly affecting the expression of these zzso However, increasing evidence indicates that zzso may also indirectly influence the expression of genes that do not contain zzso response elements by modulating the activity of secondary zzso factors, zzso the expression of growth factors acting in a zzso or zzso fashion, or by inducing changes in the production of other zzso These indirect effects of zzso can induce zzso actions and may play an important role in more complex processes involving coordinated responses of zzso cells, and zzso Previously, our laboratory has identified and characterized a novel indirect mechanism of zzso action involving zzso zzso of the key zzso zzso factor zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso resulting in the coordinate zzso of entire cellular zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso by zzso occurs not only under normal zzso conditions but has also been observed in a growing number of zzso and more in particular in the setting of zzso zzso where increased zzso has been shown to have remarkable diagnostic and zzso potential and is considered a prime target for novel therapeutic zzso This review aims to analyze current insights into the molecular zzso underlying zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and to ascertain the extent to which this phenomenon can be generalized to zzso cell zzso
