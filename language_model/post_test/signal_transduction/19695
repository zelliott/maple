Since the onset of the zzso era more than 1000 bacterial zzso have been zzso and several fold more are expected to be completed in the near zzso These zzso sequences supply a wealth of information that can be exploited by statistical methods to gain significant insights into cellular zzso In Volume 422 of zzso in zzso we described a zzso method, which was able to identify zzso zzso pairs between the ubiquitous bacterial zzso signal zzso zzso the sensor zzso and the response zzso Such zzso position pairs supply interaction specificity in the light of highly amplified but structurally zzso zzso systems in a typical zzso and are enriched with interaction surface zzso zzso In this chapter we describe an extended version of this method, termed zzso zzso zzso zzso which greatly enhances the zzso power of traditional zzso zzso zzso introduces a statistical zzso step to zzso analysis, which allows to distinguish zzso patterns introduced by direct correlations between zzso positions, from those patterns that arise via indirect zzso that is, correlations that are introduced by zzso with other zzso in the respective zzso This method was shown to reliably identify zzso positions in spatial proximity within a protein or at the interface between two interaction zzso It is the goal of this chapter to allow an experienced programmer to reproduce our techniques and results so that zzso can soon be applied to new zzso
