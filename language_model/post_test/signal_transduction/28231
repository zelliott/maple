We examined the changes of two zzso factors, zzso and zzso in zzso root zzso zzso after acute (8 or 48 zzso or chronic (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an increase in the number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso after acute and chronic zzso The number of zzso cells in the zzso zzso was not altered with zzso The number of zzso cells increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso only with chronic zzso although it increased in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso of acute zzso P zzso or zzso zzso and chronic zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso After zzso treatment, the percentage of zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The increase occurred 8 hours zzso injection and was maintained with chronic zzso There were few zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso expression is not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso can reveal an altered zzso zzso that may be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso showed that a zzso of zzso cells expressed zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso may be zzso by a zzso signaling zzso
