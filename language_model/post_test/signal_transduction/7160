The zzso of cardiac growth by zzso in healthy mice is not completely zzso The aim was to investigate the effects of zzso on cardiac growth in healthy mice lacking either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso knockout zzso 2-month-old mice were zzso and randomly assigned to groups receiving an zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso diet zzso After three months of zzso administration, zzso and zzso mice had significantly lower body weight, higher relative zzso and heart weight than zzso mice, while there was no major zzso effect in zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a higher concentration of zzso genes zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that the zzso regulation of cardiac growth in healthy mice is primarily zzso through zzso and not zzso
