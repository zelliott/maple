zzso zzso cells zzso may play an important role in zzso immune regulation by producing numerous zzso and expressing zzso and T cell zzso zzso Due to disruption of the zzso barrier during zzso storage and zzso of liver zzso zzso can interact directly with cells of the immune zzso zzso zzso levels of which increase in liver diseases and zzso stimulates the synthesis of many zzso by zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso might promote zzso zzso by influencing naturally occurring zzso zzso regulatory T cells zzso Following their portal zzso infusion, zzso zzso T cells, including zzso were found closely associated with zzso and this association increased in zzso zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on conventional zzso T cells and induced their zzso in a zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso induced zzso zzso which required zzso contact and was zzso class zzso This effect was zzso when zzso were zzso with zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso class II, zzso and zzso and zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Interestingly, production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was strongly zzso but that of zzso enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso transferred zzso zzso migrated to the secondary zzso zzso and induced zzso expansion in zzso zzso These data zzso zzso zzso as important immune regulators in liver transplantation by inducing selective expansion of zzso zzso and reducing inflammation and zzso
