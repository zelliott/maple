A primary event in zzso is the zzso of activated inflammatory cells into the zzso zzso There they zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso inducing foam cell formation and zzso cell zzso which in turn lead to plaque growth, zzso and zzso In addition, there is evidence that this vicious circle between zzso stress and inflammation occurs not only in the diseased zzso wall but also in zzso zzso in zzso In this condition, zzso stress and inflammation impair zzso zzso resulting in defective insulin action and zzso zzso This observation raises questions regarding what molecules are probably common regulators of these zzso processes in zzso and vascular zzso Candidates are small, zzso zzso zzso that control gene expression by inducing zzso degradation or blocking zzso This review summarizes recent insights into the roles of zzso in regulation of zzso stress and inflammation in vascular and zzso zzso It emphasizes the role of zzso zzso in the interaction between inflammatory cells and zzso cells within these zzso and in communication between these zzso possibly explaining the similarity and the zzso of molecular changes and interactions in zzso and vascular zzso
