zzso protein zzso zzso an important regulator of energy zzso is known to be activated during T cell zzso T cell zzso by T cell zzso zzso engagement or its pharmacological zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the role and mechanisms of zzso in zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso T human zzso zzso zzso of zzso by a pharmacological agent, compound C, or zzso zzso suppressed expression of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins in zzso zzso zzso It also reduced zzso of zzso protein and zzso zzso a main product of zzso in zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso activated with zzso or zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked promoter activities of zzso and zzso in activated zzso zzso As protein zzso C zzso zzso is a central zzso for zzso zzso we examined any possible zzso between zzso and zzso in activated T zzso Of particular importance, we found that zzso of zzso blocked zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is an upstream zzso of zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso was directly associated with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso of zzso by zzso or dominant negative zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in activated zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso regulates expression of zzso and zzso via the zzso and zzso and zzso pathways in activated zzso zzso
