zzso an zzso human zzso can transform primary B zzso into immortalized zzso cell lines zzso through multiple regulatory zzso However, the involvement of protein zzso zzso in the infinite proliferation of B cells is not zzso In this study, we performed zzso display zzso to investigate this subject and identified a specific cellular target, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso but not in primary B zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso membrane protein 1 zzso an important zzso zzso zzso enhanced RON expression through its zzso zzso zzso zzso by promoting zzso binding to the RON zzso RON zzso decreased the proliferation of zzso and zzso with RON compensated for the growth zzso caused by zzso of zzso zzso analysis revealed a correlation between zzso and RON expression in zzso from zzso zzso disorder zzso suggesting that zzso RON expression not only is essential for the growth of zzso but also may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso Our study is the first to reveal the impact of RON on the proliferation of transformed B cells and to suggest that RON may be a novel therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso
