zzso zzso was discovered as an inhibitor of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are very effective agents used to treat neuroendocrine tumors and are now being used with increasing frequency in clinical trials to treat more aggressive zzso However, the cellular components zzso zzso signal zzso remain largely zzso We have zzso zzso the zzso type 2 zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso cells, establishing a zzso relevant model zzso In this model, the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso and zzso promoter zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin inhibited the effects of zzso documenting that zzso signaling was coupled to zzso Moreover, the zzso effects of zzso were reversed by zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso indicating that zzso does not act via zzso zzso but, rather, by lowering protein zzso A zzso These data define the components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and provide important zzso insights into how zzso controls neuroendocrine zzso As zzso zzso are effective zzso agents, and many other related compounds are in development, the knowledge gained here will further our understanding of their mechanism of action in other zzso as zzso
