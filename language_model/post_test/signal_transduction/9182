zzso zzso 33 has been recently identified as a zzso to the zzso zzso that mediates zzso allergic zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the role of zzso zzso zzso innate immunity in zzso induction by zzso zzso Human zzso zzso and cultured primary human zzso zzso cells zzso were treated with a variety of viral or bacterial components without or with different zzso to evaluate the zzso regulation and signaling zzso The level of zzso expression was determined by reverse zzso and real time zzso and protein was measured by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso and protein were largely induced by various microbial zzso mainly by zzso and zzso the zzso to zzso and zzso respectively in human zzso zzso ex zzso and in zzso zzso zzso protein was normally restricted inside cells, and could be zzso outside when activated by zzso The zzso induced zzso production was blocked by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso protein nuclear zzso and suppressed zzso production induced by zzso and zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso an zzso zzso zzso is induced by microbial zzso through zzso innate signaling zzso suggesting a possible role of zzso zzso in zzso allergic zzso
