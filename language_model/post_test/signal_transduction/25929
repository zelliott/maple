zzso growth zzso zzso a zzso zzso plays a crucial role in wound healing in the damaged central nervous zzso To examine effects of the zzso signaling zzso on formation of zzso tissue and zzso zzso the small zzso inhibitor of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso was continuously infused in the zzso site of mouse brain after a unilateral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso At 2 weeks after injury, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules including zzso type IV zzso and zzso zzso zzso was formed in the zzso center, and zzso zzso were increased around the zzso zzso In the brain injured and infused with zzso zzso zzso formation was suppressed and decreased numbers of zzso zzso occupied the zzso zzso Although zzso and serum zzso were observed within the zzso zzso in the injured brain, they were almost absent in the injured and zzso zzso At 2 weeks after injury, zzso zzso zzso fibers barely extended beyond the zzso zzso in the injured brain, but numerous zzso fibers zzso over the zzso site in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso signaling suppresses formation of the zzso zzso and creates a zzso environment for zzso zzso
