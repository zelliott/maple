zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein zzso three zzso zzso growth factor repeats, an zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso is expressed in an zzso zzso pattern during early zzso In studies reported here, zzso zzso zzso protein was shown to promote zzso zzso cell attachment and zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso was associated with zzso of zzso the formation of focal complexes, and recruitment of zzso and zzso into these zzso These events were shown to be associated with zzso of proteins in the focal complexes, including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso When zzso zzso was evaluated in an in zzso chick zzso membrane zzso it was found to have potent zzso zzso This zzso activity was inhibited by a zzso zzso directed against zzso and an zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso Thus zzso provides a unique zzso zzso zzso for the embryonic zzso and this function is zzso in part by productive zzso of zzso zzso
