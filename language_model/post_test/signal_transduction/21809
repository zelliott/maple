zzso SK proteins are zzso zzso channels, which show a zzso zzso zzso We have expressed the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso and found protein to be produced at considerably higher levels than in brain zzso The channel was correctly folded as evidenced by its high affinity interaction with zzso a specific zzso from bee zzso However, the protein was largely unable to reach the plasma zzso its normal destination, instead remaining in the zzso zzso Adding a putative zzso sequence altered the zzso distribution significantly with enhanced trafficking out of the zzso zzso Fusion of zzso with the associated protein zzso also altered the channel zzso but in a different manner with channels now found mainly in transit between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
