zzso is associated with zzso of cortisol and zzso and a high prevalence of zzso zzso At the cellular level, a direct effect of zzso on the expression of the zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso a regulator of cortisol and zzso zzso and on zzso and cortisol zzso has been zzso However, the molecular mechanisms zzso this effect are not zzso 

zzso molecules are zzso by zzso and regulate the activity of zzso a key zzso factor in adrenal zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso stimulate adrenal zzso through the zzso of zzso 

Using zzso we detected the expression of zzso and zzso in the adult human adrenal zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso into adrenal zzso cells showed an induction of zzso zzso to zzso after treatment with human fat zzso medium zzso This finding was paralleled by an induction of zzso promoter activity zzso by zzso The induction of zzso promoter activity by zzso was inhibited by zzso when zzso was blocked by the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso of zzso induced the zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso at a zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and cortisol by zzso cells induced by zzso was significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso 

These data indicate that the zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms zzso the effects of fat cells on adrenal zzso zzso and zzso and cortisol zzso
