zzso protein zzso zzso zzso appear to coordinate many aspects of neural development, including cell zzso migration and zzso Here we investigated potential roles of zzso in the developing mouse zzso Using a zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction approach, we identified 11 different zzso in the zzso at embryonic stage 13 zzso zzso the expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso from embryonic stages to adult were analyzed in detail using quantitative zzso in zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso At zzso all six zzso are expressed in actively cycling retinal zzso cells and zzso newborn retinal zzso With ongoing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso display a different zzso regulation of zzso and proteins in the zzso and zzso zzso Finally, in adulthood these six zzso zzso to distinct cellular compartments of multiple retinal zzso Additional studies in zzso and zzso (also known as zzso zzso or zzso mice at zzso stage zzso reveal no apparent differences in retinal zzso organization or in the expression pattern of specific retinal zzso markers when compared with wild zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso of zzso a marker of zzso zzso cells, is selectively reduced and the zzso of zzso zzso processes of zzso cells is considerably zzso Our results suggest distinct roles of zzso in cell proliferation and establishing zzso of different retinal cells during zzso as well as later in the maintenance of mature zzso
