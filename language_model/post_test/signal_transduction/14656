The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recently was reported to induce zzso of some cancer cells and zzso although it generally known to exert zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on the cell growth, zzso and zzso of cultured zzso mouse melanoma zzso In results, zzso was found to induce zzso in zzso melanoma cells in a zzso and zzso manner, but exerted minimal effects on zzso Although receptors of zzso zzso zzso differentiation gene 1 zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso melanoma cells, they were shown not to be associated with zzso zzso In addition, zzso toxin did not block the zzso effects of zzso on zzso melanoma zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso effects of zzso on zzso melanoma zzso These results suggest that zzso induced zzso of zzso melanoma cells via an zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, and appears to be associated with the zzso and zzso zzso
