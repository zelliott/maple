The activity of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is controlled by two zzso systems, the Ras proteins and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso synthesis is thought to be zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Using a sensitive zzso zzso for zzso we demonstrate that zzso addition also triggers a fast increase in the zzso loading state of zzso zzso with the zzso increase in zzso This increase is severely delayed in a strain lacking zzso the zzso zzso exchange factor for Ras zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or with zzso or the presence of zzso zzso causes zzso high Ras zzso loading that no longer increases upon zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso or zzso zzso of these proteins causes higher zzso loading indicating that the two zzso systems might directly or indirectly zzso Because deletion of zzso or zzso reduces the zzso zzso increase the observed enhancement of zzso zzso loading is not sufficient for full stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or the zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso might sustain zzso of zzso synthesis by enhancing zzso zzso loading likely through zzso of the Ira zzso zzso with reduced feedback zzso on zzso synthesis also display elevated zzso and induced zzso zzso loading consistent with the zzso protein acting as a target of the zzso zzso
