zzso zzso regulates cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been identified as a regulator for skeletal muscle zzso and encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about how zzso regulates cellular zzso Here, we identify and genetically characterize zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso deletion zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were partially suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts genetically downstream in the zzso zzso A zzso fusion was found to be expressed in the nervous system, zzso and zzso and overlapped expression of many zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a novel zzso protein that zzso regulates zzso formation in concert with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
