Of the more than one million global cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year, approximately zzso percent are characterized as zzso lacking the estrogen, zzso and zzso zzso Lack of effective therapies, younger age at zzso and early zzso spread have contributed to the poor zzso and outcomes associated with these zzso Here, we investigate the ability of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso to selectively target zzso breast cancer zzso cell proliferation and survival in zzso and zzso in zzso 

zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso zzso quantities of zzso zzso zzso zzso was verified by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso blue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation were used to evaluate overall cellular zzso Changes in cell cycle progression were assessed with zzso zzso flow zzso Additionally, zzso zzso were used to probe zzso cells for zzso changes in cancer zzso and signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso models were used to assess the effects of zzso on zzso Lastly, flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso were applied to detect changes in zzso zzso zzso protein expression and the results paired with zzso zzso in order to examine changes in cell zzso 

zzso treatment increased zzso zzso decreased cell proliferation and survival, and blocked cell cycle progression at zzso with a concurrent decrease in S phase in all zzso cell zzso Treatment also resulted in zzso induction at 24 hours in all lines except the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso tumor formation was significantly inhibited by zzso (10 zzso in zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso and in zzso and induced cell zzso changes in zzso cells consistent with reversal of the zzso zzso 

This study revealed that zzso is overtly toxic to zzso cells in zzso and decreases zzso in zzso Additionally, treatment zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso marker genes in zzso cells and initiated a partial reversal of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a potential therapeutic role of zzso in targeting aggressive zzso breast cancer cell zzso
