Generation of human zzso zzso cells zzso for cancer vaccination involves ex zzso maturation in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the inclusion of zzso during maturation is imperative for the induction of DC migration, zzso has zzso effects on the zzso capacity of these zzso Like zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso of DC zzso We therefore sought to characterize the migratory and zzso properties of zzso that matured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso matured in the presence of zzso but not zzso or zzso are superior to zzso zzso in stimulating zzso zzso responses and in inducing zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso without zzso induction or recruitment of regulatory T cells zzso zzso zzso migrate efficiently through layers of zzso zzso and zzso higher levels of zzso zzso while producing reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso studies reveal that, in contrast to zzso zzso did not signal through zzso in zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso represents a promising candidate to replace zzso in DC maturation protocols for cancer zzso
