Motor zzso are able to survive even after nerve zzso In order to reveal the molecular basis underlying this survival zzso we carried out gene screening using zzso Display zzso method and a zzso library derived from rat injured zzso zzso This gene hunting provided us with some of the parts of the molecular mechanism for nerve zzso among which zzso signaling zzso in particular downstream growth factor zzso seemed very zzso We therefore examined the significance of the molecules by using zzso zzso gene transfer system, and concluded that zzso zzso could be one of the important pathways by which injured motor zzso survive and zzso
