Juvenile zzso zzso is an zzso dominant disease that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso account for approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso is the common zzso zzso of the zzso and bone zzso protein zzso zzso Since zzso in zzso zzso zzso also cause zzso we zzso that altered zzso signaling is the underlying zzso in zzso We therefore set out to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso identified in zzso patients were selected for zzso These were created in zzso zzso expression zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were confirmed by direct sequencing, then zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control zzso into zzso zzso zzso were then collected after 48 hours, and zzso activity was zzso using a zzso A zzso empty zzso was used as a negative control, and its zzso activity was considered the baseline for cellular zzso zzso zzso obtained for each zzso clone were compared to those with the wild type zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed with the zzso zzso 

Eleven distinct zzso from 16 zzso patients were zzso seven zzso were nonsense, and four were zzso Both type of zzso resulted in reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso reduction in zzso activity, whereas nonsense zzso led to zzso reduction in zzso activity when compared to the zzso clone zzso zzso All nonsense zzso led to significantly reduced activity relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso while the reduction in signaling seen in zzso zzso was not statistically zzso 

zzso zzso zzso as seen in the zzso patients appear to zzso impact downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly reduced zzso activity when compared to zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that disruption of the zzso signaling zzso is the likely zzso of zzso in patients with zzso zzso
