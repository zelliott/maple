The effect of zzso zzso on the zzso free calcium activity zzso and zzso zzso turnover was investigated in human zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso Human zzso exhibited a baseline zzso of 114 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso BK zzso zzso zzso caused a rapid and transient increase in zzso which could also be observed in the absence of zzso zzso The effect of BK zzso zzso on the zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso BK also induced zzso turnover in a zzso and zzso zzso A transient increase in zzso zzso formation from zzso zzso 119 to 4,629 zzso 323 zzso occurred after 5 zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso by short-term zzso (15 zzso of human zzso with zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso of human zzso with zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso resulted in a slight but significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that BK zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso turnover via a zzso zzso in human zzso zzso might exert a negative feedback function for the zzso zzso zzso
