zzso of zzso coli or zzso zzso can sense chemicals in their environment and respond by moving toward some and away from zzso The ability to sense and swim requires the products of approximately 50 zzso about 10 for detecting and processing sensory cues and the rest for assembly and operation of the zzso The function of each component in the zzso signaling zzso is well zzso Signaling is known to involve zzso of a set of zzso zzso but questions remain concerning the protein zzso changes and interactions that take zzso zzso have been assigned to almost all of the approximately 40 zzso zzso and the sequence of events in zzso assembly has been largely zzso zzso assembly depends on a specialized apparatus for exporting certain zzso components to their appropriate zzso The structure and mechanism of this apparatus remain a mystery, as does the mechanism by which the zzso motor generates zzso
