Environmental and genetic aberrations lead to neural tube closure defects zzso in 1 out of every 1,000 zzso Mouse and zzso models for these birth defects have indicated that Van zzso 2 zzso also known as zzso and other components of zzso cell polarity zzso zzso might control zzso by promoting the convergence of neural zzso to the zzso Here we show a novel role for zzso zzso during zzso in zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso neural zzso along the zzso zzso This polarity is zzso lost during cell division in the neural zzso but is zzso as daughter cells zzso into the zzso Loss of zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso the polarization of neural zzso cells, zzso zzso of daughter cells into the zzso and results in zzso neural zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocking cell division leads to rescue of zzso neural tube zzso despite persistent defects in convergence and zzso These results reveal a function for zzso zzso in zzso cell division and zzso at zzso and indicate a previously zzso mechanism that might zzso zzso
