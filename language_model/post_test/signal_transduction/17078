zzso zzso diseases zzso have become increasingly recognized as a complication of zzso zzso therapy in patients with chronic zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can manifest as clinical zzso in approximately zzso of zzso patients receiving zzso and zzso zzso in up to zzso of patients, possibly resulting in either dose reduction or zzso of zzso zzso However, the exact mechanisms that lead to the development of zzso are unknown and may include zzso zzso as well as direct toxic effects on zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso develops in genetically predisposed individuals whose threshold for developing zzso is lowered by zzso zzso our aim was to identify the zzso genes for zzso We used a zzso convergence approach combining genetic association data with zzso analysis of genes zzso by zzso zzso results of genetic association, zzso data, pathway, and zzso analyses enabled the identification of 3 putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso emerged as the zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso
