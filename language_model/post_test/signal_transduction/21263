Spreading is a critical process involved in zzso and growth of tumor cells during the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to participate in the regulation of zzso organization in both normal and transformed cells during zzso The role of other signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso has not been studied during spreading in tumor zzso We now show that the spreading of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was significantly reduced by zzso a zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the presence and absence of serum, as measured by zzso zzso zzso only zzso cell spreading over the control in the absence of serum and zzso zzso was completely reversed by zzso treatment in both zzso zzso the product of zzso activity, zzso zzso cell spreading and the same effect was observed with zzso Spreading was enhanced when cells were seeded on zzso or zzso surfaces and zzso could inhibit both zzso zzso Cell spreading zzso correlated with the absence of zzso zzso and fewer zzso point contacts as determined by double zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in the presence of serum zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso contact zzso involved in spreading and zzso require the participation of zzso regulatory pathways in zzso zzso
