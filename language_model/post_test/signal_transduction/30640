The zzso zzso forms part of the zzso zzso an essential protein complex for zzso zzso zzso in skeletal zzso Because of the lack of a viable zzso animal, little is known regarding the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso or in other cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso appears before the zzso zzso in development and contains zzso zzso zzso known to be important in cell zzso and zzso zzso These facts raise the possibility that the zzso zzso performs vital functions not associated with zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is important for interactions of muscle cells with their zzso Using zzso zzso we followed the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso We found that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso concentrated towards the ends of the cells, while the zzso zzso clustered near the zzso As zzso aged zzso zzso the zzso became evenly distributed along the zzso and zzso with zzso When the expression of zzso was blocked with zzso migration, attachment and spreading of zzso were impaired while the zzso calcium current remained zzso The results suggest a previously unidentified role of the zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and support the involvement of this protein in zzso zzso This new role of the zzso zzso may be crucial for muscle development, muscle repair and at times in which zzso attachment and migration are zzso
