The mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso release was examined in the cardiac zzso cell line, zzso zzso of cells with zzso induced zzso AA release, and this effect was completely inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also produced zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso this was not affected by zzso zzso indicating the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso for these two effects of zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid increase in zzso followed by a sustained zzso The zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the effect of zzso whereas the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso only induced a slight increase in AA zzso Both the zzso or zzso AA release and the zzso sustained zzso increase were completely blocked in the absence of external zzso The zzso zzso channel blocker, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso channel blockers, zzso and zzso also inhibited the zzso AA zzso Western blots demonstrated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso and delta by long-term (24 zzso zzso treatment caused a partial blockade of the zzso response, whereas the zzso AA release was unaffected by zzso of these zzso zzso but not zzso AA release was partially blocked by the zzso zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso induced an increase in activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso together with a molecular weight shift, consistent with zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were completely blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but still occurred, together with the zzso zzso mobility shift, in the absence of external zzso These results show that zzso AA release in zzso cells is secondary to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, leading to an influx of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The influx of zzso zzso and zzso act, respectively, through zzso or zzso zzso pathways to mediate AA zzso
