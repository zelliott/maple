zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability of insulin to stimulate zzso and zzso zzso into the cell membrane and thus zzso zzso The effect on zzso but not on zzso is zzso by zzso of protein zzso B zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso a further zzso downstream of zzso zzso regulates several zzso by enhancing their plasma membrane zzso zzso contains a consensus site zzso for zzso by zzso Thus, the present study investigated whether zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso and zzso cells demonstrated that zzso transport is enhanced by zzso active zzso The effect requires the zzso zzso activity since the inactive zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso stimulation by zzso is not due to de zzso protein synthesis but rather to an increase of the zzso abundance in the plasma zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso enhances zzso transport rate without altering zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso regulates zzso and may contribute to or account for the zzso zzso but zzso stimulation of zzso by zzso
