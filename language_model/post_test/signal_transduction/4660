zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso receptors are implicated in the zzso of depression and the mechanism of action of zzso zzso Here, we explore possible zzso interactions of zzso zzso knockout and the expression of zzso its zzso zzso and downstream zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We compared female and male double zzso mice zzso with single zzso mice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was examined using Western zzso analysis zzso As expected, the zzso mice showed zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso receptors induced a significant decrease in zzso levels in the zzso in female zzso The zzso ratio was also significantly decreased in female zzso mice and zzso mice but not in zzso Despite markedly reduced zzso levels in zzso mice and double zzso zzso zzso was unchanged in the female zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was significantly elevated in the zzso of female zzso mice and double zzso Given the greater vulnerability of women to develop depression and the role of the zzso in stress responses and zzso zzso our results may shed more light on sex differences in depression and other psychiatric disorders with zzso and zzso zzso zzso
