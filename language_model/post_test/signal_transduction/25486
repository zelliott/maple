The role of zzso in airway disease is poorly understood although they have been suggested to influence on proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells zzso zzso have been found localized in the airways in autopsy material from zzso patients and have been implicated in airway zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various zzso zzso on proliferation of zzso obtained from guinea pigs zzso and humans zzso zzso of zzso was measured by the zzso zzso and the results confirmed by zzso of the DNA zzso A key observation was that the zzso membrane preparations induced a significant increase in the proliferation of both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither zzso from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso proliferation to the same extent as the membrane zzso We have previously shown that zzso proliferation is dependent on zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso zzso In the present work we established that zzso zzso zzso proliferation was reduced in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso In conclusion, our results showed that zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso effect of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso is mainly due to zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso were evident on both zzso and zzso and involved zzso and zzso These new findings are of importance in understanding the mechanisms contributing to airway zzso and may contribute to the development of new pharmacological tools in the treatment of inflammatory airway zzso
