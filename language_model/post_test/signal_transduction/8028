Directed cell migration and target recognition are critical for the development of both the nervous and muscular zzso zzso mechanisms that control these processes in the nervous system have been zzso zzso whereas those that act during muscle development are still largely zzso Here we identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates zzso target recognition in the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a specific subset of zzso and is required autonomously for these zzso to recognize their zzso cell targets and to establish a stable zzso zzso is enriched at zzso tips during targeting and signals through the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso stimulates muscle zzso We propose that zzso promotes directed zzso migration and zzso a zzso signal that zzso the formation of a stable zzso
