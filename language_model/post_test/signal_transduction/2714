The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso that is regulated by a zzso cascade whose known elements are zzso (a zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso and the functionally redundant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso An activated zzso of zzso zzso zzso growth when zzso This zzso effect was suppressed by the zzso delta zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso is toxic to zzso To search for genes that interact with the zzso pathway, we isolated both zzso zzso and dosage zzso genes that zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso One of the genes identified by the analysis of zzso zzso is zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a protein zzso to a zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum response zzso box family of zzso zzso Although zzso delta cells grow normally at any temperature, they display a zzso zzso similar to that observed in zzso defective in zzso zzso or zzso A gene fusion that provides zzso with a zzso zzso domain of zzso suppresses zzso delta and zzso zzso A screening for dosage zzso yielded the zzso zzso which zzso a zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso factor downstream of zzso that is subject to zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
