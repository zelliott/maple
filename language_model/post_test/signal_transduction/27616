To examine the molecular mechanism of insulin zzso trafficking, we investigated the zzso signaling molecules that regulate this process in zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso Cellular zzso of insulin receptors was assessed by zzso laser zzso with indirect zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso treatment induced the change of insulin zzso zzso to zzso zzso This zzso insulin zzso trafficking was not affected by treatment of the cells with zzso inhibitor zzso whereas treatment with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso partly inhibited the process in a zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment with both zzso and zzso almost completely inhibited insulin zzso zzso The functional importance of zzso and zzso zzso in the trafficking process was directly assessed by using single cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein gave the same results as treatment with zzso and zzso Furthermore, to determine the crucial step for the requirement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso and zzso on insulin zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso from the plasma membrane and subsequent insulin degradation were not affected by treatment with zzso and zzso In contrast, insulin zzso zzso from the cell surface and insulin zzso degradation, after prolonged incubation with insulin, were markedly impaired by the zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso pathways zzso regulate insulin zzso trafficking at a step subsequent to the zzso zzso
