The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso and bone formation during skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) is initially induced in zzso precursor cells, maintained in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso with these expression patterns, zzso has been shown to enhance zzso differentiation and cell survival, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether zzso an zzso zzso factor, can be regulated by zzso a key regulator for zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso can induce zzso degradation of zzso In addition, we found that zzso can suppress levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, may selectively enhance zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso In agreement with these findings, zzso zzso degradation requires zzso which is capable of triggering zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso protein levels in zzso are remarkably elevated in mice defective in zzso zzso by deletion of either zzso or zzso Thus these results suggest that zzso zzso may play a role in negative regulation of zzso for appropriate progression of zzso zzso during zzso
