zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso is regulated by an zzso zzso sensing mechanism involving the synthesis and detection of two signaling zzso one of which is zzso zzso zzso and the other of which is zzso zzso evidence has suggested that zzso associated with a toxic zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are zzso In this study the effects of an zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by the marine zzso zzso zzso on zzso and toxin production in a virulent strain of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and toxin production were both inhibited by the signal zzso at zzso that had no impact on zzso zzso production was found to be prematurely induced in zzso zzso cultures incubated in a zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a significant reduction in the toxicity of concentrated zzso extracts from zzso zzso cultures incubated in the presence of the signal zzso as measured by in zzso toxicity zzso in mice and prawns, was zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling zzso have potential utility in the control of zzso zzso prawn zzso
