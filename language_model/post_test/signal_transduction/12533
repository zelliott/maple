Few membrane proteins with a role in zzso regulation have been zzso and none are able to perceive their respective stimuli and activate zzso of their zzso without the aid of auxiliary zzso The zzso resistance regulator, zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso DNA binding protein and is required for zzso expression of the zzso resistance zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso A zzso DNA binding zzso demonstrated that the affinity of zzso for its target DNA is much higher zzso zzso 40 zzso than previously found for zzso regulators and is comparable to that of soluble DNA binding zzso A construct of zzso that lacked the zzso domain was unable to bind to DNA, indicating that membrane zzso was important for DNA zzso zzso did not cause a change in the zzso footprint of zzso on the zzso promoter, but in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso signal zzso system, which perceives an zzso stimulus zzso of zzso and zzso it to an zzso zzso response independent of any auxiliary zzso
