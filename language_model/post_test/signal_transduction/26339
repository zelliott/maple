Most solid zzso contain regions of zzso oxygen concentration zzso zzso cancer cells are more resistant to zzso and represent the most aggressive fraction of a zzso It is therefore essential that strategies continue to be developed to target hypoxic cancer zzso zzso of the DNA damage response zzso might be an effective way of zzso hypoxic zzso cells to zzso 

Here, we describe the cellular effects of pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso with a highly selective zzso zzso in hypoxic conditions and its potential as a zzso 

zzso was shown to inhibit zzso zzso in response to replication arrest induced by severe zzso In these same conditions, zzso induced DNA damage and consequently increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines to a range of oxygen zzso Most importantly, zzso increased zzso loss of viability in hypoxic zzso Using this inhibitor we have also demonstrated for the first time a link between zzso and the key regulator of the hypoxic response, zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were both decreased in response to zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso represents a novel strategy to target zzso cells in conditions relevant to zzso and enhance the efficacy of zzso
