The means by which zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso are recognized by zzso immune systems are poorly zzso Here we wished to explore the contribution of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in initiating zzso responses to zzso zzso Live zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, but not zzso zzso or zzso mice, rapidly succumbed following in zzso bacterial infection via the zzso route even with a very low dose of zzso (5 zzso zzso that was zzso less than the zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso By day 5 after zzso infection, bacterial organ burdens were 5-6 logs higher in zzso knockout zzso further, unlike infected zzso mice, levels of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso An in zzso culture system was used to assess the ability of bone zzso zzso derived from either zzso or zzso mice to support bacterial growth, or to control zzso bacterial replication when zzso with immune zzso In this zzso bacterial replication was similar in zzso derived from either zzso or any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth was controlled in zzso containing zzso from zzso zzso mice or zzso zzso mice as well as in zzso containing immune zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso controlled zzso growth comparably to those from normal zzso Thus zzso is essential for innate host resistance to zzso infection, but is not required for zzso control of zzso bacterial zzso
