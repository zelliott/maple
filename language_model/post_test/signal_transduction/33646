zzso zzso shares common structural features with the prion protein zzso whose zzso zzso is considered as the zzso agent of prion zzso Although their zzso functions in the immune system remain largely unknown, we demonstrated that substantial amounts of zzso and zzso are expressed by zzso cells notably B zzso zzso and DC, but not T zzso and zzso To characterize zzso partners of zzso and zzso on mouse zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso were produced and used as zzso Both zzso specifically bind to B zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso and in a lesser extend to T zzso No binding was observed on zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso signals zzso zzso calcium concentration and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso and zzso zzso bind to functional receptors on B zzso None of the previously described zzso partners account for the binding sites characterized zzso Our study suggests a possible role for zzso and zzso in the zzso interactions in the immune zzso
