In this paper, we consider a three-dimensional model of cell signal zzso In this model, the zzso of zzso proteins occur throughout the zzso and zzso is localized to specific sites in the zzso We use matched zzso expansions to construct the dynamic solutions of zzso protein zzso The result of the zzso analysis is a system of ordinary differential zzso This reduced system is compared to zzso simulations of the full three-dimensional zzso As well, we consider the stability of equilibrium zzso We find that the systems under consideration may undergo sustained zzso zzso and other complex zzso The simulations of the full three-dimensional system agree with simulations of the reduced ordinary differential zzso
