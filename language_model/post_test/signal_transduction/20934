zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso were found as components of the zzso signaling complex, which exerts multiple biological effects on cells such as cell zzso zzso production, and cell zzso In the zzso signaling zzso zzso works as a zzso for zzso signals such as zzso but the role of zzso has not been previously zzso Here we show in transgenic mice that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso T zzso Our results demonstrate a biological role for zzso as a regulator of zzso signals and also support the hypothesis that the combination of zzso proteins in a given cell type determines distinct biological effects triggered by members of the zzso zzso zzso
