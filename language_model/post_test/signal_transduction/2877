Few molecules have been shown to zzso cell zzso Although the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest the zzso 4 zzso zzso member zzso can induce a zzso zzso gene zzso studies have failed to confirm this zzso We report here that zzso expression of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso poorly zzso human B cell line zzso dramatically enhances migration across zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on either zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso was zzso inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas migration of zzso on zzso was inhibited only by zzso zzso Since zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso as effectively as mock zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso but not zzso zzso migration was inhibited by the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A suggesting that zzso zzso played a role in the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso adherent to zzso expressed zzso higher levels of zzso than zzso zzso zzso also zzso proteins on zzso more effectively than zzso including a protein of 110 zzso which was zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not on bovine serum zzso Our results support a role for zzso in the amplification of a zzso signal in B cells involving beta 1 zzso and the zzso of protein zzso zzso
