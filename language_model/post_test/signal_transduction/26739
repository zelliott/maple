T cells critically regulate inflammatory zzso disease zzso with zzso experimental colitis models gaining favor in identifying potential zzso zzso yet limited understanding of specific zzso molecules or pathways still zzso 

In this study we sought to identify changes in whole zzso expression profiles using the zzso zzso transfer colitis model compared to zzso expression differences from Crohn's disease zzso tissue zzso zzso tissue was used for zzso and zzso expression profiling analysis at 0, 2, 4, or 6 weeks after adoptive zzso zzso 

We identified 1775 genes that were significantly altered during disease zzso with zzso being progressively zzso and zzso progressively zzso Gene expression changes were validated by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso confirming zzso expression analysis zzso zzso expressed genes were clearly related to zzso responses but also strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso network analysis revealed 25 unique network associations that were associated with functions such as zzso zzso cell zzso zzso signaling and interaction, as well as nervous system development and zzso Moreover, many of these genes and pathways were similarly identified in CD zzso 

These findings reveal novel, complex, and dynamic changes in gene expression that may provide useful targets for future therapeutic zzso
