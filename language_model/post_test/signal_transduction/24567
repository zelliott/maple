zzso of zzso membrane signal zzso in target cells containing growth zzso factors have been found in various zzso zzso including zzso activated by zzso zzso development of the zzso membrane zzso was observed within 3 days in zzso of rats with zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of these rats was the highest also within 3 days and constituted zzso zzso of protein as compared with zzso zzso in zzso within the subsequent periods dynamics of the zzso zzso content correlated with the rate of zzso membrane signal zzso zzso The state of receptors to zzso was altered as zzso content of their binding sites in zzso was distinctly decreased at the beginning of zzso and continued to decrease within later periods but the receptors affinity was not zzso Thus, production of zzso zzso was not related directly to amount of receptors to zzso while it correlated with formation of the zzso membrane signal zzso The phenomenon of the signal zzso synthesis in zzso occurred mainly at zzso of zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso produced also the zzso membrane signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso after stimulation with zzso and their zzso activity was the highest among the target cells zzso This suggests that zzso membrane signal zzso is involved in membrane zzso of a signal to zzso of zzso and zzso
