zzso evidence shows that the offspring subjected to uncontrolled zzso during gestation display zzso zzso and cellular abnormalities during zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects remain zzso Previous studies have shown an increased rate of zzso and a decreased index of zzso proliferation associated with diabetic zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether zzso in zzso related proteins also occur in the developing central nervous system from zzso zzso exposed to uncontrolled zzso zzso zzso rats injected with either zzso or vehicle were killed on zzso day zzso zzso brains were quickly removed to evaluate protein expression by Western zzso zzso brains from diabetic rats exhibited a decrease in the cell survival zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso protein zzso showed a zzso increase while there were no changes in zzso 3 or zzso zzso 3 zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso were also zzso Neither zzso nor zzso showed differences in embryonic brains from diabetic rats compared to zzso Altogether, these results indicate that both proliferation and zzso pathways are decreased in the brain from the developing offspring of diabetic zzso Since selective zzso zzso as well as selective cell zzso are specifically involved in brain zzso it is possible that simultaneous zzso during the zzso period contribute to the long lasting zzso observed in the adult zzso
