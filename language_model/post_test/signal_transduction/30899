The zzso zzso factor of activated zzso family of zzso factors functions as zzso of multiple signaling pathways by binding to zzso in combination with other zzso factors and zzso to regulate genes central for many zzso zzso Recent experimental evidence has shown that the zzso signaling zzso is important in zzso growth and guidance during zzso zzso In fact, studies with triple zzso zzso mice demonstrate that the extension and organization of sensory zzso projection and zzso zzso growth are both dependent upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium channel signaling zzso zzso calcium levels to regulate the nuclear import and zzso activity of zzso by zzso the zzso zzso The zzso and subsequent export of zzso from the nucleus is zzso by several zzso including zzso which contribute to the fine tuning of zzso zzso activity in zzso However, zzso no direct zzso targets for zzso have been identified in a zzso environment in the nervous zzso zzso are also the binding partners of zzso that might zzso regulate specific genes important for zzso zzso This review will discuss the current knowledge related to zzso signaling in the nervous system development and the potential for future research zzso
