The use of zzso viruses for treatment of cancer marks a significant zzso in the battle between host and zzso zzso are confronted by cellular innate immune responses and contain an zzso of zzso proteins that suppress innate zzso zzso can result in impairment of innate immune zzso zzso engineered to be vulnerable to normal responses may mediate zzso killing with minimal zzso zzso 

To examine the mechanisms by which zzso cells respond to viral infections in normal versus cancer cells and how viruses overcome these responses and to illustrate how this knowledge is used to develop zzso targeted zzso zzso 

Literature describing studies investigating innate responses to virus infections, zzso molecular zzso zzso viral products and design of zzso viruses is extensively zzso and pertinent concepts are distilled and zzso 

zzso responses to viral infections are complex involving zzso viral zzso zzso induction of zzso and other zzso and zzso establishment of an zzso zzso zzso viruses are engineered to be susceptible to zzso responses in normal zzso zzso can be partially vulnerable to these viruses because they have defective zzso responses but the zzso potency of zzso targeted viruses may be significantly zzso
