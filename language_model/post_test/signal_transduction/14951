The zzso zzso is the zzso for zzso zzso the zzso of an important family of membrane receptors that function in embryonic patterning and innate zzso A zzso precursor of zzso is processed by an zzso to produce a form zzso that zzso Toll zzso zzso and establishes zzso Here we show that before processing the zzso of zzso is required for correct zzso and zzso We mapped two zzso zzso of zzso to a discrete site in the zzso and showed that the zzso arises because of a zzso in zzso rather than zzso We also report that the zzso and zzso remain associated after zzso and that this processed complex signals with the same characteristics as the zzso zzso These results suggest that before zzso the zzso on zzso that bind specifically to Toll are zzso by the zzso and that zzso processing causes zzso zzso that expose these zzso and enables binding to zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso is released when the Toll zzso domain binds to the complex, a finding that has implications for the generation of a zzso Toll zzso
