The level of zzso II zzso was markedly increased during 24 h zzso zzso zzso but showed no further increase zzso On the other hand, the level of zzso II zzso in zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso containing the rat zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased during 3 h zzso zzso but rather decreased zzso Although no significant difference was observed in the zzso of zzso by zzso among parental zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso were markedly zzso in the zzso zzso Then zzso reporter zzso containing zzso II promoter with zzso in two zzso sites zzso site, zzso approximately zzso L site, zzso approximately zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso The promoter activity following zzso stimulation for 24 h was significantly increased by zzso at the L site, but not by zzso at the U site, suggesting that zzso II expression is zzso zzso at least in part, through the zzso L site in response to zzso
