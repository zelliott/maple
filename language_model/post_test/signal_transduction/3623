zzso zzso factor zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso learning, and zzso zzso of zzso and its main zzso zzso zzso have been reported to be decreased while the levels of the truncated zzso zzso are increased in Alzheimer's zzso We show here that incubation with zzso increased zzso zzso levels and decreased zzso levels in primary zzso In zzso zzso transgenic mice zzso showed an zzso relative increase in cortical but not zzso zzso zzso levels compared with zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease, we crossed zzso mice with mice zzso the truncated zzso zzso zzso or the full-length zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice exacerbated their spatial memory impairment while the zzso of zzso alleviated zzso These data suggest that zzso changes the ratio between zzso zzso in favor of the zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso and supports the role of zzso signaling through zzso in the zzso and cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's zzso
