zzso of zzso network models to uncertainties in the model structure, with a focus on autonomously zzso systems, is zzso zzso zzso as defined here, concerns the sensitivity of the model predictions with respect to changes in the specific interactions between the network components and zzso for instance, uncertain kinetic models, neglected intermediate reaction steps and zzso transport zzso Traditional zzso sensitivity analysis does not address such structural uncertainties and should therefore be combined with analysis of structural zzso Here a method for zzso the structural zzso of models for systems displaying sustained zzso is zzso The method adopts concepts from robust control theory and is based on adding dynamic zzso to the network of interacting zzso zzso In addition to providing a measure of the overall zzso the method is able to identify specific network zzso The importance of considering structural zzso is demonstrated through an analysis of a recently proposed model of the zzso metabolism in activated zzso The model displays small zzso sensitivities, but is shown to be highly zzso to small zzso in some of the network zzso Identification of specific zzso reveals that adding a small delay or diffusion term in one of the involved zzso likely to exist in zzso completely removes all zzso zzso in the zzso
