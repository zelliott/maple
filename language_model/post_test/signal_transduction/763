zzso has been known to induce cardiac zzso and sudden zzso However, the molecular mechanism for the induction of zzso is not zzso zzso zzso plays an important role for zzso This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that zzso could induce zzso expression in cardiac zzso 

Neonatal zzso rat cardiac zzso were cultured under the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were examined by Northern and Western zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to investigate the signal zzso of zzso expression of zzso 

The level of zzso protein significantly increased from 4 to 24 h after addition of zzso (10 zzso The zzso zzso increased zzso to zzso at 6 h after addition of zzso and returned to the baseline level at 48 zzso These increases of zzso protein at 24 h were completely attenuated zzso by zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased and zzso decreased the zzso labeling of zzso zzso increased and zzso decreased the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso activity of zzso increased after addition of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso abolished the binding activity induced by zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso activates zzso gene expression in cultured rat zzso cardiac zzso zzso mediates the zzso gene zzso at least in part, through the zzso zzso These findings from our study suggest that zzso plays a role for the molecular mechanism of zzso cardiac zzso
