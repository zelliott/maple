Various zzso strains were used to examine the regulation and zzso control of the zzso zzso reductive zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Previously, a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was found to show enhanced levels of zzso and zzso promoter activities during zzso growth in the presence of zzso zzso With this strain as the starting point, additional zzso were made in genes zzso zzso and zzso and in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso These strains revealed that a product generated by zzso was involved in control of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso Additionally, zzso expression experiments indicated that zzso zzso zzso responded to the same zzso signal in zzso zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso
