Although a number of recent studies have reported the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso findings are contradictory and difficult to zzso Our group has previously reported that zzso signaling might have an important role in the development of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated zzso signaling in zzso zzso focusing in particular on the differences in zzso signaling between zzso zzso and zzso Whereas no significant differences in the serum zzso levels were observed among normal control subjects and zzso patients, increased expression and zzso of the long form zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and cancer zzso compared with the normal zzso zzso However, no significant differences were observed between the zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso increases in the zzso levels of important molecules of the zzso signaling pathway, located downstream of zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso target molecules were observed in zzso zzso tissue compared with the findings in normal zzso zzso Furthermore, these changes were significantly more pronounced in zzso cancer compared to zzso zzso zzso This is the first analysis of zzso and zzso signaling in a human zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso signaling through the zzso of zzso may be involved in zzso zzso both in zzso formation and in the progression to zzso zzso signaling in zzso cancer may be zzso not only by zzso but by other zzso
