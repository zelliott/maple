The zzso pattern of breast cancer molecular zzso is incompletely zzso The purpose of this study was to identify zzso in genes that may be targeted with currently available zzso drugs in the three major breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and Triple zzso We extracted DNA from fine needle aspirations of 267 stage zzso breast zzso These tumor specimens typically consisted of zzso zzso zzso We examined 28 genes for zzso known zzso zzso acid variations by zzso zzso We observed at least one zzso in 38 zzso corresponding to 15 genes in 108 zzso samples, including zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each), zzso and zzso zzso each), and zzso zzso We also checked for the zzso in zzso that is known to activate zzso and it was found at zzso of the patient zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in zzso zzso zzso compared to triple negative breast cancer zzso (19 zzso zzso zzso High frequency of zzso zzso zzso were also found in zzso breast zzso In zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent compared to zzso tumors (13 zzso zzso zzso We performed validation for all zzso zzso with zzso zzso or direct zzso zzso analyzed by two different sequencing techniques showed zzso zzso for zzso zzso In conclusion, different breast cancer zzso harbor different type of zzso and approximately 40 % of tumors contained individually rare zzso in signaling pathways that can be potentially targeted with zzso zzso testing of many different zzso in a single needle biopsy is feasible and allows the design of prospective clinical trials that could test the functional importance of these zzso in the zzso
