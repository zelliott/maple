zzso adherent cells can be zzso in zzso as they grow on a glass slide coated with zzso zzso zzso transparent zzso oxide zzso Although the introduction of DNA is a common use, the technique of zzso in zzso is valuable for studying many aspects of signal zzso This is because, under the appropriate conditions, in zzso zzso can be remarkably zzso while a large variety of zzso such as zzso zzso or drugs, are introduced instantly and into essentially zzso of the cells, making this technique especially suitable for kinetic studies of zzso zzso Following the introduction of the material, the cells can be either extracted or zzso zzso or their zzso and gene expression can be examined by zzso In this chapter, we describe the introduction of a zzso blocking the zzso 2 domain of the zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso of the downstream zzso zzso by zzso The setup includes zzso control cells growing side by side with the zzso ones on the same type of zzso zzso In a modified version, this assembly can be used very effectively for studying zzso zzso zzso cells are grown on a glass slide half of which is zzso An electric pulse is applied in the presence of the fluorescent dye zzso yellow, causing its penetration into the cells growing on the zzso part of the slide, and the migration of the dye to the zzso cells growing on the zzso area is microscopically observed under zzso zzso
