zzso oxide zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso that has numerous targets in zzso Both zzso and zzso synthesis of NO has been detected in several plant species, and NO functions have been characterized during diverse zzso processes such as plant growth, development, and resistance to zzso and zzso zzso This wide variety of effects reflects the basic zzso mechanisms that are zzso by virtually all zzso and plant cells and suggests the necessity of zzso mechanisms to control the level and functions of zzso During the last two years an increasing number of reports have implicated zzso zzso as the key zzso system for NO scavenging in plants, indicating that the primordial function of zzso may well be to protect against zzso stress and to zzso NO zzso zzso The biological relevance of plant zzso during specific conditions of plant growth and stress, and the existence of further zzso and zzso NO scavenging systems, suggest the existence of precise NO zzso mechanisms in plants, as observed for different NO zzso
