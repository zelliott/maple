Ral zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified to be a possible zzso protein of zzso zzso shares 50% zzso acid identity with Ral zzso zzso zzso and contains the zzso domain in the central region and the zzso domain in the zzso zzso Since the modes of zzso and action of zzso have not yet been zzso in this paper we have analyzed the functions of zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso (a Ras zzso in which zzso and zzso were changed to Val and zzso zzso which failed to bind to zzso but not with zzso which bound to zzso zzso did not inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso under the condition that zzso inhibited that of zzso to zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso into zzso cells slightly activated zzso promoter, while zzso of both proteins greatly zzso the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso the zzso exchange of Ral and this action was enhanced by the zzso modification of zzso However, zzso was not active on zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, this action of zzso to stimulate the zzso exchange of Ral was dependent on Ras in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso constitutes another zzso zzso which is distinct from the zzso zzso and indicate that the zzso zzso regulates the zzso promoter activity and the zzso exchange of zzso
