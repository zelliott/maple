zzso is an zzso 28 zzso acid zzso predominantly zzso by the stomach, and has potent zzso effects on zzso Several laboratories, including our own, have demonstrated that zzso levels fall in states of acute inflammation brought about by injection of bacterial zzso zzso We now demonstrate that the decrease in circulating zzso is not due to a decrease in zzso gene zzso but is instead likely to be due to an acute decrease in zzso zzso Furthermore, we have found that the change in circulating zzso during acute inflammation required a zzso second messenger, but did not require the synthesis of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso injection of zzso zzso failed to decrease circulating zzso levels, whereas zzso decreased circulating zzso to a similar extent as did zzso We also provide anatomical evidence for the mechanism of the regulation of zzso by zzso We demonstrate that the type 1 zzso zzso zzso is expressed within the gastric zzso but is not expressed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also expressed in the gastric zzso and the majority of zzso cells were found to zzso this zzso Mice with genetic deletion of the type 1 zzso zzso do not suppress circulating zzso levels with zzso zzso zzso these data support a model in which the mechanism of inflammation induced decreases in zzso are due to the action of zzso on cells within the gastric zzso that in turn produce zzso as a second zzso These data provide further support for the potential role of zzso as a therapeutic agent in acute and chronic inflammatory zzso
