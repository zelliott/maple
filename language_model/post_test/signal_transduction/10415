zzso intermediate layer protein zzso is an zzso zzso protein abundant in zzso zzso zzso is implicated in common musculoskeletal disorders, including zzso and zzso disc zzso zzso of the zzso gene is largely unknown, zzso We have found that zzso zzso expression is induced by zzso and dependent upon signaling via zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso is zzso by zzso which acts directly through zzso in the zzso promoter zzso Pathways other than zzso also are involved in zzso induction of zzso These zzso together with the finding that zzso protein binds and zzso zzso suggest that zzso and zzso may form a functional feedback loop that controls zzso zzso
