Emerging evidence indicates that zzso as novel member of the zzso zzso family plays an essential role in zzso and tumor progression of human various tumors, but the functional significance of zzso in human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is still zzso In the current study, zzso expression in zzso zzso and cells was zzso and the biological functions of zzso in zzso cells were zzso The results revealed that zzso expression at zzso and protein levels was significantly zzso in zzso zzso and cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was tightly associated with differentiation degree, clinical staging, and zzso zzso zzso of the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso but no significant correlations were found between zzso expression and gender or age of the patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we found that zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells promoted cell zzso cell cycle zzso as well as cell invasion in zzso and inhibited cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells inhibited cell zzso arrested cell cycle at zzso phase, reduced cell invasion, and promoted cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso expression significantly reduced zzso level and enhanced zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso expression markedly increased zzso level and decreased zzso zzso zzso investigations demonstrated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased the expressions of zzso and zzso proteins but decreased the expressions of zzso D1 and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso may play a driving role in the development and progression of zzso and targeting the zzso may be an effective and feasible approach for treatment of zzso
