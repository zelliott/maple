zzso growth factor zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso and zzso may play key roles in tissue zzso in zzso However, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the airway after an acute asthma attack and the effect of prolonged airway exposure to these zzso on airway zzso are zzso 

To measure the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso obtained from patients with asthma under various conditions, and to examine the effects of zzso and zzso on the proliferation or differentiation of airway structural zzso 

zzso growth factor and zzso levels were measured by zzso in zzso specimens collected from 14 hospitalized children with asthma during an acute asthma attack, 13 stable zzso with zzso 8 healthy control children, and 7 children with respiratory tract zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on the proliferation and/or differentiation of normal human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso and normal human lung zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso levels of zzso were significantly higher for about a week after an acute asthma attack compared with the levels in stable subjects with asthma and control zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in the zzso of patients with asthma was observed only during the acute zzso zzso caused proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso induced proliferation of only zzso zzso exposure of zzso to zzso and zzso induced zzso cell zzso in an zzso zzso 

Acute asthma attacks are associated with zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso acute attacks may aggravate airway zzso
