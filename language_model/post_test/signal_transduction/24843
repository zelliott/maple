By comparing the zzso responses to tumor necrosis factor zzso that occur during situations that promote liver injury (such as obesity or chronic exposure to zzso with those that occur after stimuli (such as partial zzso that lead to liver zzso it is apparent that zzso are usually able to zzso noxious responses to zzso such as the release of zzso oxygen from zzso It appears that by promptly zzso survival genes that regulate zzso membrane zzso zzso are usually able to zzso noxious responses, including the release of zzso zzso oxygen species, that follow exposure to potentially toxic zzso such as zzso Indeed, transient zzso increases in zzso may even be exploited by zzso to evoke a subsequent zzso zzso Thus, the healthy liver has well-developed defense mechanisms that permit zzso to adapt to zzso stress, protecting them from zzso zzso Nevertheless, these same zzso may cause liver injury when zzso have been zzso to toxins zzso zzso that interfere with their usual protective zzso Furthermore, while transient adaptations to zzso stress permit zzso to survive and zzso persistence of these zzso zzso responses (as occurs, for example, in fatty zzso may inadvertently enhance zzso vulnerability to necrosis when the liver is confronted by secondary insults that promote zzso membrane zzso
