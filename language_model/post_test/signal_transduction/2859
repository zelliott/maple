zzso growth factors zzso are expressed at high levels in the central nervous system zzso however their function in the zzso is not well zzso The immortalized zzso cell line zzso derived from a transgenic mouse central nervous system zzso expresses high levels of zzso zzso 1 zzso and demonstrates both zzso and zzso changes when treated with basic zzso zzso We have derived zzso of zzso cells with varying degrees of zzso responsiveness by zzso either a wild type zzso or a truncated zzso form of zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso rapidly and zzso respond to zzso while cells expressing zzso fail to respond to zzso either zzso or by the expression of molecular zzso These zzso zzso will prove useful to study zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso responsive genes in a zzso derived zzso These studies also demonstrate that a dominant negative zzso zzso can be used as a tool to zzso the function of zzso in the central nervous zzso
