zzso zzso zzso cells have been used to characterize molecular events involved in the regulation of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso gene expression zzso by zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso induce a signaling event which involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso also induce zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso stimulate zzso zzso remain zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso cells, zzso expressing the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a specific zzso zzso also blocked this zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have reported that zzso is responsible for zzso zzso of zzso which is required for zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso Thus, we examined the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and subsequent zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso Further experiments showed that neither zzso Ras expression nor zzso of zzso which completely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected zzso DNA binding activity or zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso does not appear to be involved in the zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso
