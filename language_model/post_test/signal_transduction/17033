The wood zzso zzso zzso exhibits well-developed natural freeze tolerance supported by multiple mechanisms of zzso zzso The present study investigated the role and regulation of the zzso signaling zzso in wood zzso zzso (with a focus on zzso responding to freezing zzso 

zzso was used to assess total and zzso levels, total and zzso zzso protein level, as well as total and zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate transcript levels of zzso and zzso 

zzso was inhibited in skeletal muscle, kidney and heart after zzso freezing exposure with a reversal after zzso The responses of the main zzso zzso and zzso zzso that regulate zzso were consistent with freeze zzso of zzso in zzso freezing exposure activated zzso via enhanced zzso zzso whereas zzso protein levels were zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso that regulate zzso expression were elevated in liver during zzso One well-known role of zzso is in zzso zzso in part by zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso triggered an increase in liver zzso zzso content, suggesting that an important action of zzso may be zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in wood zzso is stress and tissue specific, with zzso regulations zzso and zzso involved in supporting this specific signal zzso zzso 

This study implicates the zzso zzso in the zzso reorganization of cellular metabolism in support of freezing zzso
