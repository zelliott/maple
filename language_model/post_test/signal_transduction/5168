The cell biological principles that govern innate immune responses in zzso are zzso Here, we report that Toll signaling in flies was dictated by the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso was located at the plasma membrane by a process dependent on a zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed that zzso binding by zzso was necessary for its zzso and zzso functions as well as for the recruitment of the downstream zzso zzso zzso to the cell zzso These data are reminiscent of the interactions between the zzso Toll zzso zzso and zzso with one major zzso In the zzso system, zzso is the zzso zzso that depends on the zzso protein zzso for its recruitment to the cell zzso We therefore propose that zzso is the functional zzso of zzso and that both proteins function as sorting zzso to recruit downstream signaling zzso to activated zzso
