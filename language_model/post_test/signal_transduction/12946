Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso of human zzso on zzso 15 contributes to protein stabilization after DNA damage and that this is zzso by the zzso family of zzso However, cellular exposure to zzso does not induce any zzso level of DNA zzso compared to zzso radiation, and the oxygen dependency of zzso protein zzso differs from that of zzso the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that, under severe hypoxic conditions, zzso protein accumulates only in S phase and this zzso zzso with replication zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity substantially reduces zzso zzso of zzso protein on zzso 15 as well as zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso cell growth arrest is tightly linked to an zzso zzso that is required for zzso modification and zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso plays an important role during tumor development in responding to zzso replication arrest, and hypoxic conditions could select for the loss of key components of zzso checkpoint zzso
