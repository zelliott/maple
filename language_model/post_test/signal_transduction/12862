zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso specifies the formation of veins in the zzso zzso However, little is known about how the zzso signal regulates zzso responses during the zzso cell fate zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso genes by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a known regulator of embryonic body zzso Lack of zzso function causes zzso expression of zzso targets such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and leads to formation of extra vein zzso In vein cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels in the nucleus and zzso repression of zzso zzso whereas zzso cells maintain high levels of zzso throughout zzso and zzso development, zzso the expression of zzso genes and allowing zzso zzso However, regulation of some zzso targets such as zzso appears not to be under direct control of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso branches out in the nucleus and controls different targets via distinct zzso zzso Our results support the idea that zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso is a rather general mechanism for regulation of target gene expression by the zzso zzso
