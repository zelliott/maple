Several abused drugs are known to alter zzso signaling in reward pathways of the brain, and these plastic changes may contribute to the establishment of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the prefrontal cortical projections to the nucleus zzso zzso are suggested to be under zzso zzso control - play a central role in the addiction zzso The most abundant zzso in the brain is zzso zzso It is zzso by zzso zzso alpha zzso and exerts its action via type 1 zzso receptors zzso However, the precise zzso of zzso and zzso - zzso the sites of synthesis and action of zzso - is still zzso At the light microscopic level, zzso revealed a zzso pattern of zzso distribution in the core of the zzso zzso microscopic analysis confirmed that these zzso corresponded to the heads of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso terminals forming zzso zzso on these zzso were found to express zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the molecular constituents for a retrograde zzso control of zzso transmission are available in the core of the zzso and their relative zzso location is consistent with a role of zzso in zzso plasticity of cortical zzso zzso in this reward zzso
