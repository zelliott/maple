Although zzso has been considered as a downstream zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso signaling in diabetes zzso the role of zzso in diabetes remains largely zzso The current study tests the hypothesis that zzso may play a protective role and has therapeutic potential for diabetic kidney zzso 

zzso role of zzso in diabetic kidney disease was examined in zzso diabetic mice that have zzso gene knockout zzso and in diabetic rats given zzso gene transfer using an zzso zzso 

We found that mice deficient for zzso developed more severe diabetic kidney injury than zzso mice as evidenced by a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso I, IV, and zzso and zzso inflammation zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further studies revealed that enhanced zzso zzso and inflammation in zzso zzso mice with diabetes were associated with increased zzso of both zzso and nuclear zzso zzso signaling zzso To develop a therapeutic potential for diabetic kidney disease, zzso gene was transferred into the kidney in diabetic rats by an zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on levels of blood zzso it significantly attenuated the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as collagen I and IV and zzso zzso and zzso zzso inflammation including zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso in diabetic zzso 

zzso plays a protective role in diabetic zzso zzso zzso of zzso may represent a novel therapy for the diabetic kidney zzso
