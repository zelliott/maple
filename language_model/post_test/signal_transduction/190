zzso expression stimulates in zzso migration and invasion of cultured gastric cancer cells by an unknown mechanism and is also correlated with aggressiveness of gastric zzso The aim of this study was to show that zzso is involved in zzso of gastric cancer cells in zzso and to explore the molecular mechanism by which zzso regulates migration and zzso 

In an experimental liver zzso zzso zzso gastric cancer cells were injected into the zzso of nude zzso zzso analyses were used to compare expression patterns between mouse zzso L cells that zzso express zzso and a zzso form of zzso to investigate zzso gene zzso The expression of genes found to be regulated by zzso was investigated in cultured gastric cancer zzso zzso analyses were performed to measure levels of zzso gene products in 153 gastric cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso in gastric cancer cells reduced the number of liver zzso that formed in nude zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso activity induced expression of the gene zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso basement membrane protein zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso through the zzso of protein zzso C and zzso zzso The invasive activity of gastric cancer cells depended on zzso zzso zzso expression levels correlated with those of zzso zzso in zzso type gastric tumor samples from zzso 

zzso contributes to gastric cancer progression by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to mediate gastric cancer cell zzso
