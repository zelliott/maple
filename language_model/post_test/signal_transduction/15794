zzso zzso zzso zzso signal negative zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Yet zzso zzso are largely zzso indicating that this zzso may occur through an intermediate zzso Recent studies in rats have suggested a candidate for this role, the zzso zzso zzso nucleus zzso but this neural zzso has not yet been tested zzso We now show using zzso and zzso tracing that zzso the monkey has an zzso structure similar to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso receive zzso input from the zzso exhibit negative zzso zzso and send zzso projections near zzso zzso and zzso stimulating this structure zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, some zzso zzso responded to reward cues earlier than the zzso and carry zzso signals not found in zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that the zzso translates zzso zzso errors zzso into zzso zzso errors zzso while zzso additional motivational signals to zzso zzso
