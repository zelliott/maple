zzso zzso zzso pathways have essential functions in innate immune zzso In response to type I zzso zzso B zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby promotes the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that type I zzso induce the zzso of zzso B by zzso gene 15 zzso zzso of zzso B led to the release of zzso zzso and zzso from the scaffold protein and thus to the prevention of sequential zzso of the zzso zzso By contrast, blockade of zzso B zzso by substitution of zzso zzso with zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the release of the zzso molecules from zzso B, resulting in persistent promotion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso B zzso acts as a negative feedback regulatory gate for the zzso of type I zzso zzso zzso
