The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso amygdala, and most regions of the frontal zzso is essential between zzso zzso zzso for the expression of normal anxiety levels in adult zzso Thus, the zzso plays a crucial role in this time window of brain zzso We show that the zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso in the zzso zzso a transition between zzso and zzso At zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso zzso which causes increased cell division in the zzso zzso By contrast, at zzso zzso alpha zzso downstream of zzso to augment synaptic transmission through the zzso zzso zzso but does not cause increased cell zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso cascade uses zzso zzso zzso first boosting the cell division to form new zzso zzso at zzso and then undergoing a plastic change in mechanism to strengthen synaptic connections in the zzso at zzso
