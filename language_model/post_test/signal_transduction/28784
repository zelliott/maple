zzso zzso is the zzso pathogen of zzso disease, which is characterized by severe zzso In regard to the zzso of zzso infection, the role of inflammatory zzso such as zzso has been well zzso but the involvement of zzso cells zzso has not been zzso In this study, we have investigated the immune responses that zzso generate in zzso and in zzso after contact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not live zzso zzso induced immature zzso to undergo similar zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso showed different zzso The mechanisms of the DC maturation by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at least in part, on zzso zzso 4 signaling or on zzso zzso zzso After transfer to zzso mice, zzso zzso with dead zzso produced serum zzso zzso responses specific for zzso leading to protective immunity against an otherwise lethal respiratory challenge with zzso zzso The in zzso immune responses required the zzso presentation of zzso especially that on zzso class II zzso and the immunity yielded zzso between clinical and environmental strains of zzso zzso Although the DC maturation was impaired by live zzso zzso were activated by live as well as dead zzso zzso as evidenced by the zzso of zzso class zzso Finally, zzso but not zzso exhibited a zzso response to live zzso zzso that was consistent with their cell cycle zzso These findings provide a better understanding of the role of zzso in zzso immunity to zzso zzso
