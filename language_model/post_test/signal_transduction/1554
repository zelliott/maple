Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in early embryonic patterning of zzso zzso data suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso while zzso is an zzso of zzso but their precise function remains zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso was investigated with the use of a zzso zzso system based on zzso animal zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso of various receptors indicated that zzso and either zzso or zzso function as type I and type II receptors for zzso zzso A soluble form of zzso lacking the zzso region zzso with zzso but failed to mediate zzso zzso indicating that the native zzso protein functions as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso both smaller and larger forms, inhibited zzso zzso Such zzso zzso was rescued by excess zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso through competitive binding to the common zzso zzso or zzso This idea was supported by the demonstration of a genetic interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins were also investigated in chick zzso Both proteins could diffuse over a long distance, but the latter diffused faster than the zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso signals by zzso may involve competitive binding of zzso to the common receptors and faster diffusion of zzso
