zzso is the master regulator of zzso and the molecular target of the zzso zzso zzso By screening for compounds that promote zzso we identified a small zzso that targets the zzso zzso by a distinct zzso This zzso zzso is not a zzso for the zzso rather, it acts as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso Administration of zzso to diabetic mice mimics the effects of zzso zzso on zzso gene expression and insulin zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso does not cause significant weight gain or zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso controls zzso expression through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso This work zzso zzso screening of zzso as a promising strategy for the identification of zzso small molecules and suggests that regulators of zzso expression may represent a complementary approach to zzso zzso in the treatment of insulin zzso
