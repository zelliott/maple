Few circulating tumor cells implant or cause zzso We hypothesized that zzso or zzso pressure or zzso pressure during zzso activates signals governing zzso zzso zzso 

We studied the effect of 15 zzso zzso increased pressure for 30 minutes on zzso of primary human colon cancer cells and zzso zzso to collagen and zzso zzso We modulated zzso affinity with zzso zzso We assessed binding affinity by detachment zzso zzso surface expression by flow zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by Western analysis and zzso in zzso zzso zzso We inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso primary and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso strengthened zzso binding force to zzso without changing zzso surface zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso prevented pressure zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso or zzso C did zzso 

In contrast to zzso zzso zzso pressure may increase zzso affinity and promote colon cancer zzso via zzso dependent zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso may regulate zzso tumor cell zzso
