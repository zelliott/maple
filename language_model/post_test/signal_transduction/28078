zzso is an episodic pain disorder whose zzso is related to zzso of zzso signaling and abnormal function of the zzso calcium channel, zzso Because the relationship of the zzso channel to zzso signaling is unknown and potentially of therapeutic interest we have used genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of this calcium channel, zzso to help identify candidate downstream zzso of the human zzso By genetic dissection of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso we have established an zzso zzso showing that zzso function zzso a transforming growth factor zzso zzso influencing movement zzso This same zzso zzso is required for zzso of normal zzso levels and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso We also show that transgenic expression of the zzso zzso channel, zzso in zzso animals can functionally substitute for zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso The demonstration that these zzso related channels share a zzso ability to zzso zzso expression through their effects on zzso signaling provides the first specific example of how zzso function may influence levels of the critical migraine neurotransmitter zzso
