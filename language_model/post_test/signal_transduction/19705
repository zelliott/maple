zzso associated with implementing gene therapy are caused by the complexity of the underlying regulatory zzso The forms of interactions between the hundreds of zzso zzso and zzso in these networks are not known very zzso An alternative approach is to limit consideration to genes on the zzso Steady state zzso of these influence networks can be obtained from DNA zzso zzso However, since they contain a large number of zzso the zzso of influence networks requires a zzso large set of zzso zzso Furthermore, error estimates of the network make verifiable predictions zzso 

Here, we propose an alternative zzso Rather than attempting to derive an accurate model of the network, we ask what questions can be addressed using lower zzso highly simplified zzso More importantly, is it possible to use such robust features in zzso We first identify a small group of genes that can be used to affect changes in other zzso of the zzso The reduced effective empirical zzso zzso can be zzso using steady state zzso on a small number of genetically zzso zzso We show that the zzso can be used to make predictions on expression profiles of other zzso and to zzso how to implement zzso changes in the steady state of the underlying biological zzso These assertions are verified in a synthetic influence zzso We also use previously published experimental data to zzso the zzso associated with an oxygen deprivation network of zzso and use it to predict gene expression levels on a double zzso The predictions are significantly different from the experimental results for less than of zzso 

The constraints imposed by gene expression levels of zzso can be used to address a selected set of questions about a gene zzso
