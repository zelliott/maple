To explore the mechanisms and evolution of zzso control, we analyzed the position and conservation of large numbers of zzso sites for the zzso zzso zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso We combined specific chemical zzso of zzso with quantitative mass zzso to identify the positions of zzso zzso sites on 308 zzso zzso in zzso Comparisons of these zzso with zzso throughout the zzso lineage revealed that the position of most zzso sites is not zzso in zzso instead, clusters of sites shift position in rapidly evolving zzso zzso We propose that the regulation of protein function by zzso often depends on simple zzso mechanisms that disrupt or enhance zzso zzso The gain or loss of zzso sites in rapidly evolving regions could facilitate the evolution of zzso zzso
