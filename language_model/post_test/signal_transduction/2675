Using the zzso zzso system, a genetic zzso for studying zzso zzso we have examined and compared the interaction of the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and the insulin zzso zzso with their two known zzso zzso and the insulin zzso zzso zzso We also mapped the specific zzso of the zzso and zzso participating in these zzso Our findings can be summarized as zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity of the zzso is essential for the interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contrary to zzso zzso binds also to the major zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso the zzso domain of zzso is required for its association with the zzso and the zzso We propose that zzso the zzso and the zzso share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso interacts with the zzso in a fashion that is different from that used by zzso Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the zzso domain in signaling by both the zzso and the zzso
