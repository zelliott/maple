It is clear that a number of zzso factors facilitate virus replication and, conversely, a number of other factors possess inherent zzso zzso Research, particularly over the last decade or so, has revealed that there is a complex zzso between viral infection and the zzso zzso response and repair zzso There is now a realization that viruses can selectively activate and/or repress specific components of these zzso pathways in a temporally coordinated manner, in order to promote virus zzso Thus, some zzso such as zzso virus 40, require active zzso pathways for optimal virus zzso whereas others, such as zzso go to considerable lengths to zzso some zzso Although there is ever-increasing molecular insight into how viruses interact with zzso damage zzso the precise molecular roles of these pathways in virus life cycles is not well zzso The object of this review is to consider how DNA viruses have evolved to manage the function of three principal DNA zzso pathways controlled by the three zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to explore further how virus interactions with these pathways promote virus zzso
