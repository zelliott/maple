Human zzso zzso zzso class II zzso have a well defined role in zzso presentation to helper T zzso Moreover, engagement of zzso class II molecules leads to signal zzso in the zzso presenting zzso Signaling via zzso increases zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Given the importance of zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso we examined the impact of the zzso signal on the most zzso events in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruits the adapter zzso zzso death domain protein zzso and thereby provides a scaffold for zzso zzso The zzso signal increased both recruitment of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso was tightly controlled because neither zzso recruitment to zzso nor zzso zzso was induced via zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso signal and the zzso signal both led to decreased zzso membrane zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso interaction with zzso class II molecules zzso the zzso presenting cell for death in the event of a subsequent interaction with the zzso zzso This would ensure termination of a specific immune response, particularly in cells with limited sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso
