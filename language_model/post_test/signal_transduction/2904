zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of a large number of human zzso But its effects on the progression and prognosis of zzso cancer remain poorly zzso The aim of this study was to investigate expression patterns of zzso zzso components in zzso cancer and to zzso their zzso values in this zzso The expression of sonic zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso factor zzso in 118 specimens of zzso cancer and 30 specimens of adjacent normal zzso tissue was determined by zzso zzso analyses were applied to test the relationship between the expression of these three proteins and zzso features and zzso zzso zzso results showed the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins to be mainly located in the zzso of zzso cancer cells, whereas zzso was mainly localized in the nuclear of tumor zzso Additionally, positive expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins was correlated with pathological stage zzso zzso and zzso respectively), zzso invasion zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), but not with other factors including age, zzso tumor grade and recurrence of superficial zzso Moreover, patients with positive expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins respectively showed poorer zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and overall survival (all zzso than those with negative expression of these three zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso factors in zzso cancer patients indicated that the expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were independent zzso zzso factors (all zzso This is the first report describing about the correlation between zzso zzso and the prognosis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins was greater in zzso zzso than in the adjacent normal zzso The examination of their expression is potentially valuable in zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
