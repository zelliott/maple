zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a plasma membrane scavenger and signaling zzso composed of a large zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to a shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level and function are controlled by zzso shedding of its zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso in human zzso cells and demonstrated regulation of the zzso by cholesterol by comparing the classical zzso type with a spontaneous zzso zzso enriched zzso zzso in zzso Two zzso zzso were involved in zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso expressed similar levels of zzso zzso zzso and specific tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso shedding from zzso cells was zzso lower than from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was triggered by cholesterol depletion in zzso cells and impaired by cholesterol overload in zzso zzso zzso of zzso shedding on clearance was reflected by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso We conclude that cholesterol exerts an important control on zzso levels and function at the plasma membrane by modulating shedding of its zzso and therefore represents a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso
