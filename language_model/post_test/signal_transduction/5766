A recent study of zzso tumors discovered a new X zzso zzso zzso tumor gene on the X zzso zzso which was found to harbor small deletions and point zzso zzso protein zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and is considered a zzso zzso One of the questions about the zzso gene is whether the genetic zzso of the zzso gene are specific to only zzso zzso To see whether zzso point zzso of zzso occur in other zzso we analyzed the zzso gene for the detection of zzso in 141 cancer zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The cancer zzso consisted of 47 gastric zzso 47 zzso zzso and 47 zzso zzso Overall, we detected one zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was no zzso zzso in other zzso zzso The detected zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso Although the zzso zzso is common in zzso tumors, our data indicate that it is rare in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data also suggest that deregulation of zzso zzso signaling by zzso gene zzso may be a rare event in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
