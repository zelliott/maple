zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso proteins that have been recognized as potent survival factors for distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso act through a zzso zzso system consisting of the zzso binding zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso and the common zzso zzso zzso In addition, it has been demonstrated that zzso can signal through zzso in the absence of zzso In the present study, we sought to determine whether a similar zzso signaling applies for zzso In addition, we have characterized the zzso specificity of the zzso action of zzso To establish an zzso system for these studies, several neural cell lines were screened for the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso only in zzso cells, which did not express zzso or zzso The zzso cell line zzso expressed zzso and the zzso cell line zzso expressed zzso whereas the zzso cell line zzso expressed both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso but not with zzso for 10 zzso resulted in zzso zzso In apparent contrast, neither zzso nor zzso promoted zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, exposure of zzso cells to zzso or zzso also failed to activate zzso and zzso Together these findings provide evidence that, in contrast to zzso zzso fails to signal in the absence of zzso In addition, these observations reveal that zzso signaling of zzso is zzso specific and occurs only with zzso
