The role of zzso in controlling a multitude of cell biological events is well zzso zzso and zzso characterization of zzso has predominantly focused on zzso zzso zzso although many other zzso pathways have been zzso It was recently shown that the BAR zzso and zzso GAP zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulator associated with focal zzso zzso is found on zzso zzso zzso zzso and is essential for the major, zzso zzso zzso that these zzso zzso This zzso is characterized by its ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial toxins and large amounts of zzso zzso These membrane carriers are highly dynamic and associated with the activity of the small zzso zzso zzso division cycle zzso In the present paper, we review the role of zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso zzso and discuss the current understanding regarding how this zzso protein functions at the interface between membrane zzso small zzso zzso and zzso
