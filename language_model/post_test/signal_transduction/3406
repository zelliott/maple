The processes involved in the development of complex zzso communities, including the programmed elimination of individual cells during the formation of specialized structures, exhibit fundamental similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarities may also exist at the molecular level, as bacterial proteins hypothesized to be related to the zzso regulator zzso family have been identified, fueling speculation about the existence of bacterial zzso Here we review the regulatory networks controlling cell death and zzso in zzso zzso and examine the environmental parameters that might influence them during the development of a zzso We zzso that the zzso environmental conditions found within a developing zzso generate distinct zzso signals that coordinate the differential expression of cell death and zzso zzso
