zzso the cells responsible for bone formation, derive from zzso stem cells zzso in bone zzso To acquire a new cell zzso zzso zzso must undergo several proliferation and differentiation zzso zzso it is known that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling is involved in the proliferation and differentiation zzso the role of zzso in zzso differentiation it is controversial, at zzso In addition, the function that zzso could play in zzso derived from zzso patients it is not well zzso In this study, we analyze whether previously observed differences in the dynamic response of zzso from normal and zzso zzso women can be explained by changes in the zzso of this signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their correlation with zzso differentiation were evaluated in cultures of zzso derived from zzso zzso women and zzso zzso The results show that, under zzso conditions, zzso derived from zzso donors show a level of zzso zzso zzso times higher than zzso derived from control zzso The addition of the zzso stimulus only slightly increases the zzso level in cells derived from zzso donors, and is higher in cells derived from control zzso Important differences in the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso of zzso in both types of cells were also observed, as well as the effect that this zzso produced on calcium zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso activated in zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso The high zzso levels in zzso derived from zzso donors could determine the zzso of these cells to the zzso differentiation zzso
