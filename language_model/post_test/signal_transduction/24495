zzso of the zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso and late zzso promoter is essential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso We studied the regulation of the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso using zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso was active in zzso cells as was also found with stable zzso zzso activity decreased strongly in zzso from all cells, except those at the zzso This is almost opposite to zzso activity traced with stable zzso where zzso showed sustained activity with highest levels at the zzso zzso was zzso after zzso irrespective of stimulation with any of the factors known to control gene zzso zzso activity was induced in cell suspension by zzso and zzso acting in zzso However, a zzso zzso showed normal zzso activity during development, suggesting that zzso does not control zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso promoter showed that all sequences essential for correct zzso control of promoter activity are downstream of the zzso start site in a region between zzso and zzso zzso relative to the start zzso zzso of zzso to position zzso eliminated responsiveness to zzso and zzso but normal zzso activity in zzso cells in zzso was zzso Further zzso deletions abolished all promoter zzso This result also indicates that the induction by zzso and zzso as seen in cell suspensions is not essential for zzso activity in normal zzso
