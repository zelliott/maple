zzso marginal zone zzso of zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso is characterized genetically by several zzso but mutually zzso zzso zzso To date, it has been shown that at least the zzso products of zzso zzso and zzso activate the nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso an essential global zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso deletion and/or zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, these genetic abnormalities alone are not sufficient for zzso transformation and thus need to cooperate with other factors in zzso zzso Recent studies have shown steady, exciting zzso in our understanding of the biological functions of zzso zzso and zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso pathways and the biology of zzso This review discusses the implication of these recent advances in the molecular zzso of zzso lymphoma, and explores how the above genetic abnormalities cooperate with zzso stimulation in the development of zzso
