zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade and the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins are expressed in response to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso acting in a zzso mechanism to hinder the activities of these zzso However, there are no data concerning the role of zzso proteins in the regulation of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and that these proteins are zzso associated with zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso and zzso revealed their zzso clustered prominently in the zzso zzso part of the zzso The effect of the interaction between zzso and zzso on zzso activity was investigated in a zzso cell line zzso zzso In these cells, zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso is elevated and zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is directly zzso by zzso in zzso was zzso by lower levels of zzso in cells expressing zzso compared with parental zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso decreased zzso expression in both cell types, but this decrease was more marked in cells expressing zzso The presented results suggest a novel interaction between the zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso signaling zzso
