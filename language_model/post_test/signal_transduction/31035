We have previously proposed that one of the major consequences of zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso by zzso zzso could be zzso of zzso stress zzso reactions zzso zzso zzso 66 zzso zzso This hypothesis was based mainly on the similarity between the toxic symptoms, particularly those related to the wasting syndrome, and those induced by bacterial zzso namely zzso zzso in zzso as well as the zzso and molecular consequences of their toxic actions in zzso Since the basic action mechanism of zzso as an zzso of cell stress responses zzso is known to some extent, including knowledge of their specific receptors zzso zzso zzso and their signaling process through the inflammatory response zzso the above comparison offered a good point of reference to this zzso Furthermore, the process of constructing this hypothesis itself has provided us with a good opportunity to give a fresh view on the toxic action patterns of zzso
