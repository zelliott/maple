zzso protein zzso zzso pathways are important signal zzso pathways that control pivotal cellular processes including zzso zzso survival, zzso gene regulation, and zzso zzso pathways consist of a relay of consecutive zzso events exerted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Conventional zzso are characterized by a zzso zzso motif in the zzso loop of the zzso domain, while zzso zzso lack this motif and do not seem to be organized into the classical zzso zzso zzso One functional group of conventional and zzso zzso zzso consists of protein zzso known as zzso protein zzso Eleven zzso zzso protein zzso have been identified, and they are divided into five zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and 2, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 2, the zzso protein zzso zzso and 3, and the zzso protein zzso zzso (also referred to as zzso zzso is the only zzso protein zzso that is a zzso for both conventional and zzso zzso while all other zzso are exclusively zzso by conventional zzso This review focuses on the structure, zzso zzso functions, and possible implications of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
