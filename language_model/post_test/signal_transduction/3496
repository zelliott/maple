zzso bacteria that colonize zzso barrier surfaces are reported to influence T helper type 2 zzso zzso inflammation and zzso to allergic disease, although the mechanisms that zzso these observations are poorly zzso In this report, we find that deliberate zzso of zzso bacterial populations via oral zzso treatment resulted in elevated serum zzso zzso increased zzso circulating zzso populations and exaggerated zzso zzso cell responses and allergic zzso zzso serum zzso levels correlated with increased circulating zzso populations in mice and subjects with zzso E zzso Furthermore, B zzso expression of zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso was required to limit serum zzso zzso and circulating zzso populations in zzso zzso signals were found to influence zzso development by limiting proliferation of bone zzso precursor zzso zzso these results identify a previously zzso zzso through which zzso signals influence zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso inflammation and allergic zzso
