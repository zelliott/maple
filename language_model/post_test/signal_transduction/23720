zzso signaling plays an important role in tumor zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso signaling also regulates the progression of primary zzso toward an aggressive zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of zzso signaling zzso in organization of tumor cells into zzso structures zzso the phenomenon also known as zzso mimicry zzso Here, we show that zzso signaling cascade was zzso active in melanoma cell lines we zzso zzso zzso signaling with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso resulted in stabilization of CLS indicating that zzso signaling zzso zzso melanoma zzso We further studied this phenomenon on zzso grafted in nude zzso Compared to control, zzso channels in zzso grafted melanoma became larger and more zzso zzso zzso also exhibited an zzso of zzso and zzso both known as zzso zzso Moreover, we did not observe necrosis in zzso channels areas of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso regulated by zzso signaling may present a novel target in melanoma zzso
