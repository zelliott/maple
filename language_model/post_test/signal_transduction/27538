In many instances, remote signaling involves the transport of zzso zzso Here, we examine the spread of zzso within the embryonic zzso of zzso Using two zzso for zzso activity zzso of naked zzso and repression of zzso zzso we found that zzso acts at a different range in the anterior and zzso zzso We show that this asymmetry follows in part from differential distribution of the zzso zzso Transport or stability is reduced within zzso cells, and farther zzso zzso movement is blocked at the zzso segment boundary and perhaps zzso We demonstrate the role of zzso in the formation of this zzso
