During development, zzso zzso cells produce a series of spatial patterns by zzso their motion through a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the frequency at which cells reverse their gliding zzso It does this by interacting with the zzso system (a zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso via a cascade of zzso zzso Here we show that introducing a negative feedback into this cascade results in zzso behavior of the signaling zzso The model explains several aspects of zzso zzso behavior during development, including the zzso distribution of reversal times, and the differences in response of the reversal frequency to both moderate and high levels of zzso at different zzso zzso We also propose experiments to test the zzso
