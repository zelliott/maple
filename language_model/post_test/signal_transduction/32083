zzso zzso zzso an effective therapeutic agent for acute zzso zzso can cause sudden cardiac death due to long zzso syndrome zzso The present study was designed to determine whether zzso could induce cardiac zzso and explore whether cardiac zzso zzso are involved in the development of zzso by zzso 

zzso treatment of guinea pigs caused substantial zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was accompanied by an increase in transforming growth factor zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso gene zzso and inward zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso promoted collagen production and zzso expression and zzso in cultured zzso zzso patch clamp and western zzso showed that treatment with zzso markedly reduced zzso and zzso current zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in zzso cells zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso channel and in zzso zzso These changes were completely reversed by treatment with the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso CM and zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly increased zzso levels in the culture zzso whereas markedly reduced zzso and zzso protein levels were observed in zzso compared with zzso zzso not zzso with zzso Finally, in zzso administration of zzso a pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso dramatically prevented zzso zzso and zzso and abolished zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso guinea zzso 

zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of drug-induced zzso
