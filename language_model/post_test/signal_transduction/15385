The ability of zzso growth factor I zzso to stimulate cartilage zzso synthesis is reduced in aged and zzso zzso Aging and zzso are associated with an increase in zzso oxygen species, which we hypothesized would interfere with normal zzso zzso We compared zzso signaling in normal and zzso human zzso zzso and investigated the effects of zzso stress induced by zzso zzso In normal human zzso zzso initiated a strong and sustained zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and transient zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso which possessed elevated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso failed to stimulate zzso zzso or zzso zzso In normal human zzso zzso triggered strong zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso whereas both dominant negative zzso and CA zzso inhibited zzso zzso CA zzso also promoted type II collagen and zzso zzso whereas zzso treatment and CA zzso inhibited zzso collagen II, and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the antioxidants zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso and promoted zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and alleviated zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrate opposing roles for zzso zzso and zzso in cartilage zzso synthesis and suggest that elevated levels of zzso oxygen species cause zzso zzso resistance by altering the balance of zzso to zzso zzso
