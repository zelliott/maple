The zzso X zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso nuclear zzso that plays a major role in the regulation of BA and zzso zzso Recently, several studies have suggested a potential role of zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso but its contribution to the maintenance of peripheral zzso zzso remains to be zzso zzso mice display decreased zzso tissue mass, lower serum zzso zzso and elevated plasma free fatty acid zzso zzso and insulin tolerance tests revealed that zzso zzso is associated with impaired zzso tolerance and insulin zzso Moreover, zzso zzso disposal during a zzso zzso clamp is decreased in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso alters zzso insulin zzso as reflected by decreased zzso zzso zzso in both white zzso tissue and skeletal zzso Whereas zzso is not expressed in skeletal muscle, it was detected at a low level in white zzso tissue in zzso and induced during zzso differentiation in zzso Moreover, mouse embryonic zzso derived from zzso mice displayed impaired zzso zzso identifying a direct role for zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of differentiated zzso zzso with the zzso synthetic zzso zzso enhanced insulin signaling and zzso zzso zzso Finally, treatment with zzso improved insulin resistance in genetically obese zzso mice in zzso Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be zzso these results clearly identify a novel role of zzso in the regulation of peripheral insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso This unexpected function of zzso opens new perspectives for the treatment of type 2 zzso
