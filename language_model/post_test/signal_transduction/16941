zzso zzso germ cell tumors zzso are hypothesized to result from the combined interaction of multiple zzso zzso We reported zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso Recent zzso association studies have identified zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso as strong zzso of zzso to both familial and sporadic zzso germ cell zzso 

We studied 94 patients with zzso and 50 zzso male relatives from 63 unrelated zzso in whom the zzso gene had been zzso by investigating the association between zzso zzso association study zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso risk in these patients and in zzso zzso We also examined zzso and zzso signaling in zzso zzso and cell lines and extended the studies to 2 sporadic cases, one with a zzso zzso and one without, as a zzso 

We found a higher frequency of the zzso risk zzso in zzso patients who also had a zzso sequence zzso compared with those with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells zzso with the zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly higher, and the relative zzso activity was lower than in the zzso zzso zzso expression was consistently increased in the presence of zzso zzso both at the zzso and protein levels, in familial zzso germ cell zzso The 2 sporadic cases that were zzso one with a zzso zzso and another without, agreed with the data in zzso and in the cell zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso defects also carry zzso risk zzso more zzso There may be an interaction between zzso and zzso signaling in predisposition to zzso germ cell zzso
