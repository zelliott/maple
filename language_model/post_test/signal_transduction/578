zzso occurs in two regions of the adult brain, zzso the zzso zone zzso throughout the wall of the lateral zzso and the zzso zone zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Adult zzso requires several zzso factors to sustain and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the adult stem cell zzso In the present review, we examine the cellular and functional aspects of a zzso system zzso by zzso growth zzso zzso and its receptors zzso related to zzso in the zzso and zzso of the adult rat zzso In the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells of zzso but is not present in zzso precursor cells, which instead express zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso although expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso it seems that in the zzso zzso may be released by zzso cells, different from the precursor cell zzso and via volume transmission it reaches the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso and is localized in zzso precursor cells, whereas zzso and zzso zzso although expressed in the zzso are not located within zzso precursor zzso An zzso decline of zzso precursor cells in the zzso and zzso of old rats has been well zzso and there is the suggestion that in part it could be the consequence of zzso in growth factor expression zzso Thus, the old precursors may respond to growth factors, suggesting that during aging the basic components for zzso precursor cell proliferation are retained and the capacity to increase zzso after appropriate stimulation is still zzso In conclusion, the zzso system zzso by zzso and its receptors contributes to create an important zzso niche that promotes zzso in the adult and aged zzso
