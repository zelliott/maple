A broad range of membrane functions, including zzso and zzso are strongly inhibited during zzso The underlying mechanisms are zzso however, but will probably be important in relation to the zzso cycle and the regulation of surface phenomena zzso A major unanswered question is whether membrane signal zzso is altered during zzso suppression of an zzso calcium zzso zzso transient could inhibit zzso zzso zzso could zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is shown here by zzso zzso to produce a transient zzso of zzso The zzso transient consists of an initial sharp rise that is at least partially dependent on zzso calcium followed by an elevated plateau that is absolutely dependent on zzso zzso The zzso transient is completely suppressed by zzso with the tumor promoter, zzso zzso zzso but is unaffected by zzso with zzso toxin zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, the zzso transient is largely limited to the initial zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows that it is zzso by zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso We conclude that the zzso generation of the second messenger, zzso in zzso cells is limited by failure to activate a sustained calcium zzso The initial phase of calcium zzso from zzso stores is comparable to that in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso thus appears to be altered during zzso
