To assess the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in human pancreatic zzso 

The zzso analysis and Western zzso were employed to examine zzso expression in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso was used in a zzso controlled trial to compare its influence to zzso insulin zzso 

zzso was expressed predominantly in zzso cells zzso by insulin but was barely detected in the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso results indicated that zzso cells expressed an zzso band at the 80 zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso response was dramatically reduced in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso insulin zzso from isolated human zzso 

zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso insulin zzso under the zzso zzso
