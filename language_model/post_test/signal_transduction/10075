zzso zzso zzso is the founding member of a zzso protein family that also includes zzso an integral component of the zzso zzso that mediate cargo export from the zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso is required for transport of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso but not the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso domain of zzso and propose that zzso acts as a cargo zzso recruiting zzso into zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso function, zzso fails to leave the zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso still occurs in zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that release of the active growth factor from its zzso precursor occurs earlier during zzso transport than described for the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso background can overcome the requirement of zzso zzso for zzso activity, confirming that zzso is not essential for the production of the functional zzso zzso However, the rescued egg chambers lack zzso zzso This demonstrates that the generation of temporally and zzso precisely coordinated zzso signals cannot be achieved by bulk flow zzso but instead has to rely on fast and efficient zzso export through cargo zzso recruitment of zzso into the zzso zzso
