zzso stress plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso constitutes a major source of zzso zzso in zzso cells, and its zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso by these zzso We investigated the effects of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso inhibited several protein zzso C zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a study performed in 153 zzso patients, zzso zzso zzso activity was lower zzso in zzso compared with zzso patients and in patients treated with other zzso II type 1 zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso Plasma levels of zzso were lower zzso in zzso zzso compared with the other group of zzso Thus, zzso acts as a blocker of the zzso zzso in zzso cells by a potential mechanism that targets the protein zzso C signaling zzso This effect can be involved in reduced zzso zzso by these zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso may zzso to zzso the specific capacity to reduce zzso stress zzso by zzso cells in zzso zzso
