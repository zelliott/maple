zzso zzso zzso are important regulators of airway smooth muscle function, because zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso activity and zzso zzso We have previously shown in a number of cell types that zzso selectively couples to zzso and these proteins are zzso in zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso smooth muscle cells zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells by using zzso zzso and assessed their zzso and regulation by various G zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso were expressed primarily in zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was excluded from these zzso zzso expression enhanced zzso production in response to zzso but did not increase responses to zzso reflecting the zzso of zzso with zzso but not E zzso type 2 zzso zzso in zzso raft zzso zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso production but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso did not couple to any zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was assessed as a functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso of zzso and zzso but zzso had no zzso zzso zzso mirrored the selective zzso observed for zzso zzso With the addition of the zzso 4 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso accelerated zzso zzso Thus, zzso selectively couples to zzso but signals from this complex are limited by zzso zzso zzso does not seem to couple to zzso in either zzso or zzso cells, so it probably exists in a distinct signaling domain in these zzso
