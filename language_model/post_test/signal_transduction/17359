The zzso junction zzso is the most extensively studied model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso membrane is a zzso event in the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso differentiation is orchestrated by sophisticated interactions among three zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso act as scaffolds for multiple binding partners, resulting in a complex and dynamic network of interacting proteins that is required for zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the structural basis for zzso zzso differentiation zzso by the zzso signaling zzso
