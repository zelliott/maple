The demise of B cell zzso expressing functional zzso receptors for self appears to be the main mechanism by which B cell tolerance is zzso The genetic mechanisms that regulate the death process during this critical step of B cell development are still poorly zzso We have studied the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso cells after treatment with a panel of zzso zzso as an in zzso model of zzso B cell zzso We showed that a product of zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso but not cell cycle arrest in a zzso zzso zzso was efficient in protecting B cells from low but not high zzso zzso zzso In contrast to that observed with zzso zzso stimulation was efficient in zzso both cell cycle arrest and zzso after zzso zzso regardless of the binding zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso through zzso receptors but not zzso induced zzso followed by rapid zzso of zzso Thus, the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is highly dependent on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
