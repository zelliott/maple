Sonic zzso zzso produced in the zone of polarizing activity is the major zzso of zzso development of the zzso zzso The mature and active zzso protein is zzso at its C zzso and the zzso nature of the modification requires the function of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso release from its zzso The current model suggests that the cholesterol zzso promotes the spread of zzso zzso in the limb zzso However, this model is inconsistent with findings in zzso and not in line with current thoughts on the role of the cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso zzso it remains unclear how the cholesterol zzso affects the zzso zzso behavior of zzso that relates to the shape of its activity zzso in responsive zzso Here, we report functional analyses in mice showing that zzso lacking cholesterol modification zzso has an increased propensity to spread zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with target gene expressions and modulating the level of zzso processing in the anterior limb zzso These molecular zzso are reflected in the zzso of digits in zzso zzso Additionally, we provide direct evidence for the long-distance movement of zzso across the zzso axis of the limb zzso Our findings suggest that the cholesterol zzso regulates the range and shape of the zzso zzso zzso by restricting rather than promoting the zzso spread of zzso across the limb bud during early zzso
