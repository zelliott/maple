The zzso protein family is made up of small, abundantly expressed proteins that bind to the zzso form of zzso zzso with an affinity equal to or greater than that of the zzso zzso Their zzso zzso are zzso and contain an zzso zzso Two members of this family, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in long-term zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso interactions suggests that these molecules regulate zzso flux size and zzso zzso zzso of the interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso imply that zzso and zzso tune and zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso In so doing, they link zzso zzso to downstream elements of a signaling cascade that generates zzso
