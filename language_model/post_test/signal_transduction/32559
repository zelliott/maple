zzso tip is a zzso sensitive tissue possessing a zzso light zzso which, upon zzso elicits a signal cascade resulting in zzso zzso of the zzso In this context, the nature of the zzso and the exact mechanism through which the zzso zzso the signal across the membrane are not zzso In this study, we attempted to examine whether the blue light zzso zzso zzso status of the zzso tip and zzso molecular oxygen as part of the signal zzso zzso tips of zzso zzso and wheat zzso zzso grown in the dark showed pronounced zzso free radical zzso which diminished upon zzso with weak blue light for one zzso zzso the generation of zzso radical by the zzso tip was zzso upon zzso with blue zzso Various zzso zzso tested in this study caused powerful zzso of blue light induced zzso zzso radical zzso Treatment with these zzso blockers, with the exception of zzso resulted in marked increase in the levels of zzso acid free radical in the blue light zzso zzso The blue light zzso zzso by the zzso tip zzso is also inhibited by the zzso of blue light responses zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and sodium zzso Based on our zzso we zzso that the activated blue light zzso present in the zzso tip zzso molecular oxygen to zzso zzso radical in the tip zzso the blue light signal cascade zzso
