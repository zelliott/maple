Although enhanced expression of zzso family zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso during wound healing has been observed, the zzso roles of these factors, particularly zzso still remain zzso We explored skin zzso processes in zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso mice, zzso mice exhibited impaired wound healing, as evidenced by attenuated collagen deposition and delayed zzso In contrast, zzso recruitment was significantly zzso with the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso Because the zzso of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso requires the zzso of zzso a major target of zzso and zzso signal pathway, we examined the zzso states of zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was significantly enhanced and prolonged in zzso mice, compared to that in zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso signals has been proposed based on in zzso zzso Indeed, compared to zzso mice, the amounts of total and zzso zzso and zzso were decreased with a zzso increase in the amount of zzso in skin wound sites of zzso zzso Moreover, the gene expression of vascular zzso growth factor, a target gene of zzso was decreased in zzso zzso Thus, the absence of zzso may suppress zzso signaling pathway, which is crucial for collagen deposition and vascular zzso growth zzso zzso in wound zzso
