Although the basic principles of zzso development have been known for quite some time, it is only recently that our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved has zzso Such understanding has been facilitated by genetic approaches that have identified key proteins involved in zzso development, which have been placed into zzso pathways by molecular and zzso zzso The challenge of current research is to understand the manner in which these various zzso pathways are interconnected to gain a more comprehensive picture of the molecular intricacies that govern zzso zzso
