Signal zzso the information processing mechanism in biological cells, is carried out by a network of zzso zzso The dynamics of driven zzso reactions can be studied in terms of zzso statistical zzso Such systems may also be studied in terms of Shannon's information zzso We combine these two perspectives in this study of the basic units zzso of cellular zzso the zzso zzso cycle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We show that the channel capacity is zero if and only if the free energy expenditure of zzso system is zzso In fact, a positive correlation between the channel capacity and free energy expenditure is zzso In terms of the information theory, a linear signaling cascade consisting of multiple steps of zzso can function as a distributed zzso zzso With increasing number of steps in the zzso the system trades channel capacity with the code zzso Our analysis shows that while a zzso code can be molecular structure based, a zzso communication channel has to have energy zzso
