The zzso gene zzso encodes a presumed protein zzso The gene is essential for manifestation of resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enables a zzso zzso zzso to grow on zzso carbon zzso zzso of zzso enhances viability of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso also diminishes cellular response to mating zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso genes affect a common zzso that may communicate with the zzso response zzso In addition, disruption of zzso renders cells sensitive to high zzso exposure to zzso zzso causes growth arrest, appearance of bizarre zzso forms, and eventual zzso A zzso suppressing zzso deletion has been zzso That zzso restores full zzso B resistance but only partially zzso the zzso sensitivity zzso These observations indicate that zzso is involved in diverse zzso pathways in zzso
