zzso zzso cells express the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso D zzso zzso was dramatically induced via a zzso calcium increase and protein zzso C zzso We also found that zzso zzso two kinds of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso In terms of the zzso functional zzso of zzso cells, we observed that zzso stimulates the induction of two early genes zzso and zzso and cellular proliferation in zzso zzso We examined the signaling pathways involved in zzso cellular zzso zzso early gene induction was completely blocked by normal zzso zzso but not by zzso suggesting that zzso activity is essentially required for the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso also significantly blocked zzso early gene zzso suggesting a crucial role for zzso zzso toxin zzso did not affect on the zzso early gene induction and zzso zzso ruling out the role of zzso zzso in the zzso The cellular proliferation of zzso cells was also dramatically inhibited by zzso or zzso This study demonstrates the zzso role of zzso on the zzso of early gene induction and on zzso cell zzso and the crucial role played by zzso in the zzso
