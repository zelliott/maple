zzso regulates important cellular zzso including the DNA damage response zzso and DNA zzso The complexity of the zzso signals is zzso by zzso zzso which contain protein zzso named zzso binding zzso zzso We previously identified a new zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso and endowed with two zzso named zzso zzso interacting with zzso Here we have provided the identification of a novel zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso and characterized the interaction surface with zzso centered on two zzso zzso We have demonstrated that integrity of the zzso in addition to the zzso is necessary for the proper zzso of zzso and for zzso of nuclear zzso including zzso zzso Finally, we have shown that simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso prevents the recruitment to zzso zzso of the crucial downstream zzso zzso
