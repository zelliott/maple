Sweet taste zzso involves taste zzso type 1, member 2 zzso taste zzso type 1, member 3 zzso zzso and zzso Because knockout zzso mice lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso exhibited greatly reduced, but not abolished responses of the zzso zzso zzso nerve to sweet compounds, it is likely that multiple sweet zzso pathways zzso That zzso zzso a sweet taste zzso zzso some but not all mouse CT responses to sweet compounds supports the existence of multiple sweet zzso Here, we investigated zzso zzso of CT responses to sweet compounds as a function of temperature in zzso mice lacking zzso zzso or zzso In zzso mice, responses to zzso and zzso were zzso sensitive zzso and displayed a zzso increase zzso In zzso mice, responses to zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and showed a zzso In zzso mice, responses to zzso were zzso and showed a zzso All three zzso mice exhibited no zzso responses to zzso and their responses to zzso displayed neither zzso nor a zzso For all three zzso mice, the zzso application of zzso another sweet response zzso almost fully abolished responses to zzso and zzso but did not affect responses to zzso These results provide evidence for 1) the existence of multiple zzso pathways underlying responses to zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and a zzso temperature sensitive zzso zzso for zzso 2) the requirement for zzso in zzso sweet taste zzso and 3) the existence of a sweet independent zzso for zzso in mouse taste cells on the anterior zzso
