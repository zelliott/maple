zzso plays various important roles including the maintenance of the stem cell state as well as the promotion of zzso fates in zzso zzso zzso However, because of the very low amount of the activated form of zzso present in zzso its precise zzso pattern has remained zzso In this study, we mapped the active state of this signaling zzso in zzso in the developing mouse brain using a specific zzso that recognizes the processed form of the zzso domain of zzso zzso by zzso zzso By using this zzso active state of zzso came to be zzso with a higher sensitivity than using conventional zzso against zzso We found that activated zzso was mainly detected in the zzso of a zzso of zzso zzso cells, the majority of zzso precursor cells in the zzso zone zzso However, zzso zzso was not detected in zzso precursor cells positive for zzso basic zzso proteins or in zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso was zzso activated in the zzso lineage during zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the present method has enabled us to determine the timing, zzso and boundaries of the zzso of zzso zzso
