The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is required zzso for the formation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report that zzso lacking both maternal and zzso zzso activity are defective in germ layer formation, organizer development, and the positioning of the zzso zzso An identical zzso is displayed by double zzso for the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso in zzso eliminate the response to zzso and zzso zzso but are suppressed by expression of zzso and activated forms of the type I zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso role for zzso proteins as essential zzso zzso for zzso signaling during zzso zzso
