zzso is a potent zzso that exerts proliferation of zzso stem cells zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso mimicry of zzso signaling by a zzso recognizing an artificial zzso would be attractive to attain specific expansion of genetically modified zzso Here we propose a system enabling selective expansion of genetically modified cells using an zzso zzso that can be activated by a specific zzso We constructed an zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso When the zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso genetically modified cells were selectively expanded in the presence of zzso zzso zzso as a specific zzso Furthermore, highly zzso mouse zzso zzso with the zzso carrying zzso zzso gene proliferated in zzso in response to zzso and the cells retained in zzso long-term zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso is capable of signal zzso that mimics zzso zzso zzso
