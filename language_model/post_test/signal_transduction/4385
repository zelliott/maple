zzso zzso zzso are zzso and highly zzso zzso Although scarce zzso material can be identified in the zzso as elements of an organized zzso clearly defined zzso structures are formed at the site of zzso contact upon the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and other cellular zzso zzso The structures are reminiscent of the zzso plaques or focal contacts found in higher zzso cells, where zzso filament zzso insert into specialized regions of the plasma membrane and function as signal zzso zzso Thus, the formation of zzso plates in this zzso zzso could be related to the specific signaling responses involved in its invasive zzso Here, we report the isolation of zzso zzso plates and the results of their structural and molecular zzso zzso with the characteristic diameter of zzso radiating from an zzso zzso are the main zzso zzso is one of the main protein components of the zzso other proteins identified are a zzso zzso reported as a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso II, zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso The presence of the isolated plates of several zzso and protein zzso in particular zzso is also zzso our results suggest that zzso plates in zzso are dynamic zzso complexes participating not only in the attachment to zzso zzso but also providing the structural basis for their involvement in zzso locomotion and zzso
