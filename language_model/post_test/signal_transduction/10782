zzso zzso proteins are first zzso across zzso zzso zzso zzso and folded in a specialized zzso zzso zzso zzso folded and assembled zzso cargo are then zzso from zzso proteins into zzso zzso or zzso elements for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso export have been suggested to operate during this transport step, although these mechanisms are poorly zzso In zzso there is evidence to suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso for the export of certain soluble cargo proteins including zzso zzso the precursor of zzso mating zzso Here we identify a zzso signal within the zzso of zzso that is necessary for efficient packaging into zzso zzso and for binding to zzso When fused to zzso an zzso zzso the zzso sorting signal was sufficient to direct zzso export of the fusion protein into zzso zzso These findings indicate that specific motifs within soluble zzso proteins function in zzso export from the zzso Moreover, positive sorting signals seem to predominate over potential zzso mechanisms that may operate in zzso zzso proteins such as zzso
