zzso zzso proteins zzso have been shown to play an important role in cellular zzso However, zzso involvement in the zzso spreading of bacterial pathogens is still poorly zzso In this study, zzso that recognize zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate the zzso of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso and zzso coli, also in their zzso during zzso In zzso coli, zzso zzso sites were detected preferably in the cell wall and zzso of the whole bacterial forms as well as in the zzso of zzso Western zzso of bacterial zzso demonstrated protein bands with positive zzso to zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha with a higher affinity to the zzso against zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was markedly higher in zzso strains of zzso zzso Because of the zzso structure in all zzso proteins which seem to derive from a single primordial protein involved in signal zzso mechanisms, it is reasonable to assume that some zzso proteins in zzso coli might be related to zzso of higher zzso A putative candidate for bacterial zzso seems to be a 36 zzso zzso Enhancement in zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso around the zzso bacteria zzso to the involvement of zzso in mediation of zzso responses of zzso
