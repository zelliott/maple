zzso recurrence is a major clinical concern for patients with zzso zzso of the urinary zzso Traditional zzso analysis is of limited utility for identifying cases in which recurrence will zzso However, molecular and genetic analyses offer new perspectives on the prediction of zzso tumor zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso occurs as a zzso zzso that can involve any number of sites in the zzso zzso zzso evidence supports the notion that resident zzso stem cells in the affected field are transformed into cancer stem cells by acquiring genetic zzso that lead to tumor formation through zzso zzso Both initial and zzso tumors are derived from cancer stem cells in the affected field via two distinct molecular zzso These provide a genetic framework for understanding zzso zzso tumor recurrence and zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These two pathways are characterized by different zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their outcomes correlate with the markedly different clinical and zzso features of both relatively zzso zzso zzso and the aggressive high-grade zzso As such, these molecular findings are potentially useful for counseling patients and for assessing risk of recurrence or biological aggressiveness of the patient's zzso The molecular changes may additionally prove useful for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso zzso A unifying model of zzso zzso tumor recurrence and progression is proposed in this zzso
