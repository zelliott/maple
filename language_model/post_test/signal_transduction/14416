zzso growth factor beta zzso signaling via zzso proteins occurs in various cell zzso However, whereas the biological response to zzso can be as distinct as growth promoting zzso zzso zzso versus growth zzso zzso zzso zzso few discernible differences in zzso signaling have been zzso In the current study, we examined the role of Ras in the zzso response to zzso and how it might interface with zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso Ras activity in a subset of zzso but not zzso cultures and was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although dominant negative Ras had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso signaling zzso zzso nuclear zzso or zzso zzso it did prevent the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso This was not zzso however, to overcome the zzso response zzso by zzso which was dependent on signals downstream of zzso zzso 2 zzso Moreover, although the initial zzso of Ras and zzso are distinctly zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings show the requirement for zzso between two zzso pathways in regulating zzso proliferation and indicate that the zzso by which zzso stimulates growth is not simply the opposite of its growth zzso zzso
