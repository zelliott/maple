zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso and zzso rapidly once expressed on the cell zzso zzso structural motifs play an important role in the zzso of a number of integral zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso motif proposed zzso To determine the zzso motif in zzso we selectively introduced zzso zzso and deletion zzso to the zzso tail of zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an acid zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso immediately membrane zzso to zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso significantly zzso versus zzso mean surface zzso zzso 42 versus 45 zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso zzso are not required for zzso of zzso Additional analyses indicated that zzso was necessary but alone was insufficient for surface zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that there exists a novel zzso zzso signal in the zzso tail which involves zzso and zzso zzso to zzso
