zzso zzso zzso signaling is a fundamental zzso for the regulation of cell zzso survival, migration, and metabolism in a variety of zzso and pathological zzso In recent years information provided by genetically modified mouse models has revealed that zzso signaling plays vital roles in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso In this review, we zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso zzso signaling in regulation of primordial zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso signaling in regulation of zzso zzso recruitment and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in regulation of zzso resumption and early zzso and also zzso the pathological function of zzso signaling in zzso diseases such as premature zzso failure, zzso cell tumors, and zzso surface zzso zzso This updated zzso hopefully will lead to a better understanding of the human zzso and provide potential therapies for treating human zzso
