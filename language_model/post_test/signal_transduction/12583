The zzso distribution of zzso directed by cell polarity has been observed during the migration of zzso from the red zzso zzso zzso The significance of zzso influx and zzso zzso during the formation of cell polarity in zzso zzso was zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso of the establishment of cell zzso as judged by the ability of zzso to zzso zzso cell wall zzso and development into zzso occurred when zzso were treated with zzso of the zzso permeable channel, zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, it was also found that light triggered the establishment of cell polarity via zzso activity but not its direction, indicating that the zzso influx and zzso zzso required for the establishment of cell polarity are light zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso D zzso prevented the migration of zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that there is functional diversity between the zzso and zzso zzso systems in terms of the formation of cell zzso the former being critical for the zzso establishment of cell polarity and the latter playing a role in the maintenance of established cell zzso
