zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso during zzso interactions for the assembly of focal zzso and zzso stress fibers and in the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso on zzso These cellular events are regulated by the small zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso cellular levels of zzso zzso are decreased implicating zzso in the regulation of the small zzso In the present study we report that, compared with wild type cells, zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso and increased zzso activity that could be zzso by zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with the role for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells display higher levels of active zzso zzso and zzso that were abolished by the expression of a zzso zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso regulate gene expression by zzso and zzso zzso factors, we compared both the zzso state and the zzso activity of the zzso zzso factor, as a direct zzso and zzso target in zzso and wild type zzso In the absence of zzso both zzso zzso and zzso activity were significantly more elevated compared with wild type cells, and both activities were decreased either by the zzso of zzso or by the expression of zzso Our results reveal a novel function for zzso in modulating nuclear zzso activity and indicate an underlying mechanism that acts at the level of zzso zzso
