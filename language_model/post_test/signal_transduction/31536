Previous zzso studies have shown a long-term diffusion superimposed to a short-term confinement of the human zzso zzso zzso receptors at the surface of zzso zzso However, additional ensemble average zzso are required to reach a complete understanding of the undergoing zzso Here, we zzso by zzso recovery after zzso zzso the lateral diffusion of fully functional zzso receptors in zzso zzso cells naturally expressing a low level of the zzso zzso zzso carried out at variable observation zzso demonstrate the restriction of the receptors diffusion to zzso sized zzso Furthermore, consistently with the long-term zzso data, the zzso are found zzso
