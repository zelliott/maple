We have produced three forms of human zzso full-length zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and a zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the tumor necrosis factor zzso I zzso zzso We zzso cell lines with these zzso to compare the relative capacity of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso With two zzso zzso the zzso is zzso to zzso more sensitive to induction of death than the full-length zzso The zzso deletion zzso also shows greatly enhanced death in comparison to the zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso is used to trigger the zzso pathway, zzso zzso and the deletion zzso are similarly sensitive, whereas the zzso is zzso less susceptible to zzso killing than zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso and natural zzso can stimulate different signaling pathways and emphasizes the limitations of defining zzso important signaling pathways solely by zzso zzso
