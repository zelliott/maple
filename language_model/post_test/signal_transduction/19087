zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified initially as an zzso that regulates zzso synthesis in response to insulin, but more recent studies indicate that it is also involved in numerous cellular zzso including cell survival, cell cycle regulation, zzso and zzso Because zzso zzso exerts zzso actions on zzso we investigated a possible signaling linkage from zzso zzso receptors to zzso zzso of zzso to primary cultures of rat cortical zzso resulted in zzso of zzso on zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso on zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are coupled to zzso Signaling studies showed that zzso of zzso in response to zzso was inhibited by zzso of protein zzso C zzso but not by blockade of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also links zzso receptors to zzso in zzso but zzso of zzso signaling did not block zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Mechanical strain, which releases zzso also zzso zzso zzso and this was attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or by blockade of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso receptors are coupled to zzso by a zzso zzso that is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling contributes to the regulation of zzso functions, one of which may be the response of zzso to zzso injury on release of zzso
