Lack of the zzso member zzso protects zzso against zzso zzso a model for retinal zzso In mice, light damage increases the activity of the zzso factor zzso while pharmacological suppression of zzso prevents zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso target zzso Recently, however, it was shown that zzso expressing zzso in place of zzso zzso zzso ) are zzso competent despite the lack of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we show that zzso features of zzso zzso were indistinguishable in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, light exposure comparably increased zzso activity in both zzso zzso to zzso mice, zzso but not zzso was zzso in zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness for zzso zzso zzso was preserved in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso takes over for zzso in zzso and zzso signal zzso As zzso lacks zzso zzso zzso may not zzso but rather suppress genes in retinal light zzso
