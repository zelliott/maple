zzso is a potent zzso for zzso and zzso a rapid signal zzso zzso leading to the zzso of Ras and the stimulation of cell cycle zzso While the signaling events downstream of Ras have been studied in significant detail and appear well zzso across many species and cell types, the precise molecular events beginning with zzso zzso zzso and leading to the zzso of Ras are not as well zzso In this study, we examined the immediate events in the rapid response to zzso in a single cell type, and found that an unexpected degree of specificity exists in the zzso linking zzso to Ras zzso Specifically, although zzso cells express all three Ras zzso only zzso is rapidly activated by zzso Further, although several zzso zzso associate with zzso and are released following zzso only zzso couples to the rapid zzso of zzso Similarly, although zzso cells express many zzso and zzso zzso only a subset associates with zzso and of those, only a single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rapid zzso of zzso We then hypothesized that zzso into membrane zzso called zzso zzso or zzso is at least partially responsible for this degree of zzso zzso we found that all components zzso to zzso zzso and that disruption of zzso zzso the rapid zzso of zzso by zzso We thus report the molecular zzso of an extremely specific and rapid signal zzso zzso linking zzso stimulation to the zzso of zzso
