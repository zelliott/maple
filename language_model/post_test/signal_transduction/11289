The nuclear factor zzso family of zzso factors plays important roles in the regulation of many activities of zzso cells, such as synaptic transmission, zzso zzso and zzso In resting cells, zzso activity is present both in the zzso as an zzso complex, and in the nucleus, as a zzso zzso zzso of its zzso activity relies on processing of zzso which occurs through the zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso cells zzso the induction of zzso by zzso withdrawal (5 zzso zzso decreases the amount of nuclear zzso To understand whether zzso was required for zzso survival, these cells, maintained under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with zzso zzso The results show that these treatments reduce the nuclear amount of zzso and increase zzso zzso levels, a process partially regulated via zzso zzso These events are also associated with an impairment in zzso survival, with changes in nuclear zzso induction of DNA zzso and zzso formation, consistent with zzso According to the zzso deprivation model, zzso zzso is reversed by zzso of zzso and translation as well as by specific zzso zzso Together our results show an important role for zzso in maintaining zzso zzso Indeed, under conditions of mild zzso zzso necessary for zzso survival, zzso is distributed between zzso and nucleus, zzso under zzso conditions zzso it is depleted from the nucleus, such as after zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso nuclear deprivation is involved in the induction of zzso zzso
