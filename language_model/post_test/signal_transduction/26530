Thirty male zzso rats were randomly split into three zzso The first served as a control group zzso zzso 10) in which rats were injected with the vehicle zzso The second zzso zzso 10) and the third groups zzso zzso 10) were rendered diabetic by zzso zzso injection of single doses of zzso zzso zzso body zzso The third group was supplemented with vitamin C zzso zzso body zzso for 2 zzso 

T zzso from the diabetic rats were found to be in a stunned state, with a decreased surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso low levels of zzso zzso altered zzso zzso diminished proliferation and zzso production, and, eventually, a marked decrease in abundance in the zzso Vitamin C was found to significantly decrease the elevated levels of blood zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in diabetic zzso Furthermore, it was found to restore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells zzso and zzso cells that exhibit a high proliferation zzso
