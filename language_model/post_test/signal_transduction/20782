zzso class II molecules play a central role in the control of the immune response, but their zzso function and mechanism of action on the surface of activated human T zzso are not entirely zzso In our study, the functional role of zzso class II molecules in zzso proliferation was investigated by analyzing in parallel the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso of class II and zzso molecules significantly increased the zzso zzso zzso while no effect was observed on the zzso cell zzso This phenomenon was not confined to either zzso or zzso zzso nor was specifically affected by zzso zzso zzso studies showed that signaling via zzso class II molecules in T blasts led to zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso The simultaneous triggering of zzso and zzso class II molecules led to a synergistic effect on zzso zzso but did not increase the zzso zzso membrane zzso Our data suggest that zzso class II molecules are involved in zzso interactions and can mediate accessory signals, affecting the zzso zzso zzso
