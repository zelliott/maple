zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso in response to T cell zzso triggering is now thought to be involved in the process of negative selection in the zzso and current work is therefore aimed at investigating how zzso is regulated within the zzso To this end, recent work has implicated several of the well-known signal zzso pathways already known to regulate T cell zzso in the regulation of zzso in zzso In particular, zzso of the zzso zzso level or increases in zzso can trigger zzso zzso whereas zzso of protein zzso C appears to inhibit zzso in response to either induction zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso leads to zzso of T cell zzso cell death, effects that appear to involve protein zzso zzso zzso These observations may be relevant to the question of how T cell zzso occupancy can mediate both differentiation and death during zzso T cell zzso
