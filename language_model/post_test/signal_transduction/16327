zzso zzso is a traditional Chinese medicine that has long been used for treatment of diabetes and zzso disease, but its active component and mechanism on the disease is not well zzso 

zzso of zzso within the zzso and zzso is one of the early and characteristic features of diabetic zzso Advanced zzso end products zzso play pivotal role in the progression of zzso zzso The present study was designed to explore the therapeutic effect of zzso an active component from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso system was established to evaluate zzso migration and zzso zzso was applied to examine zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso real-time zzso was carried out to determine zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was carried out to observe zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and the zzso status of zzso and zzso 

zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso migration and zzso to zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions in both protein and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso incubation significantly increased zzso zzso expression and reversed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and nuclear zzso in zzso and this effect of zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso can reduce zzso zzso migration and zzso to zzso cells and relieve the local zzso zzso this effect was via zzso zzso zzso
