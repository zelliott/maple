The zzso zzso zzso has served as a paradigm for how zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso participate in networks driving animal zzso Here, we discuss an emerging direction in the field, which places zzso research in a quantitative and zzso zzso The final zzso cell fate pattern is known to be robust to change, but only recently has the variation of zzso traits been measured under zzso environmental or genetic zzso Whereas the resulting cell fate pattern is zzso among zzso zzso recent studies indicate that the zzso system has accumulated cryptic variation, even among wild zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the signaling network have emerged through experiments and modeling as the driving force behind cryptic variation in zzso zzso On a wider evolutionary scale, the establishment of new model species has informed about the presence of qualitative variation in zzso signaling zzso
