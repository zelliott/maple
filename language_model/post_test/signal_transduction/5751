Treatment with zzso zzso has been accepted as a successful maintenance therapy for patients with inflammatory zzso diseases zzso Moreover, it has been recently reported that blockade of zzso zzso zzso 1 signaling in zzso zzso cells may prevent the development of zzso cancer zzso However, it remains unclear whether the zzso signaling in zzso cells is involved in the development of zzso To investigate this, we studied the effects of zzso zzso in an animal model of zzso by administration of zzso zzso followed by sequential zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso We observed that the zzso zzso is activated in zzso zzso from zzso mice in association with zzso of zzso rather than zzso zzso analysis also revealed that the zzso zzso accompanied by the zzso zzso is further complicated in zzso zzso induced in zzso mice compared with the zzso zzso Such zzso activity in the zzso cells is significantly suppressed by the treatment of zzso an zzso zzso Despite inability to reduce the severity of zzso sequential administration of zzso reduced the numbers and size of tumors in association with the zzso zzso Taken together, present studies suggest that the zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells may be directly involved in the development of zzso with persistent colitis and imply that the maintenance therapy with zzso zzso may prevent the development of zzso in patients with long-standing zzso
