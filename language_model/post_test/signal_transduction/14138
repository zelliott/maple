The embryonic spinal zzso in mice is organized into zzso zzso zzso zzso in each domain first produce zzso and then switch to specifying zzso Five of these zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in the zzso spinal zzso and each expresses a unique code of zzso factors zzso that define the molecular profile of zzso zzso This code is largely responsible for determining the zzso zzso of zzso generated from each zzso zzso codes for a zzso zzso that plays a central role in defining the molecular boundaries between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using fate mapping and gene expression studies we show that zzso in addition to each patterning function, is expressed in a group of late born zzso that derive from the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso represent a subset of late born zzso zzso and their zzso depends on zzso zzso The zzso zzso represent zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso diversity in the zzso spinal zzso is more complex than originally appreciated and point to the existence of additional mechanisms that determine zzso diversity, particularly in the zzso zzso
