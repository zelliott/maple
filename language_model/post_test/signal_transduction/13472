The AA zzso zzso rats are selectively bred for their preference of alcohol to water, contrasting to zzso rats that avoid zzso They also exhibit a lower growth rate compared to zzso rats, as well as differences in their response to substances affecting food zzso The zzso zzso system is involved in the regulation of feeding zzso and in mechanisms underlying drug addiction and zzso Recently, administration of an zzso zzso zzso proved to reduce alcohol intake in AA zzso We predicted that the ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso would differ from zzso rats, and that subsequent differences in zzso zzso levels would be zzso We used in zzso zzso to detect an increased ratio of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso of AA zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso binding differed in the nucleus zzso and several zzso zzso possibly reflecting differences in zzso zzso transmission in the AA zzso Our results support the claim that AA rats have a high ratio of zzso zzso and that this observation is accompanied by differences in zzso zzso zzso
