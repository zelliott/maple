Whereas the interplay of multiple hormones is essential for most plant zzso zzso the key zzso molecular players remain largely undiscovered or zzso It is shown here that a member of the tomato zzso acid zzso gene family, zzso zzso the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso genes zzso short-lived zzso regulators central to the control of zzso zzso Their functions have been defined primarily by dominant, zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that can repress zzso from zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso and zzso dependent, is regulated on a tight zzso basis, and is associated with zzso undergoing differential growth such as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso and zzso zzso including altered zzso dominance, lower zzso sensitivity, exaggerated zzso hook zzso in the dark and reduced zzso zzso in the zzso The results provide novel insights into the roles of zzso and position the zzso protein at the crossroads of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
