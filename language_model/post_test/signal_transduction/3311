zzso cells are crucial in achieving a regulated effective immune response to zzso zzso zzso cells are activated after interaction with zzso complex and differentiate into specific zzso depending mainly on the zzso milieu of the zzso Besides the classical zzso 1 and zzso 2, other zzso have been identified, including zzso 17, regulatory T cell, zzso helper T cell, and zzso 9, each with a characteristic zzso zzso For a particular zzso to be zzso a set of zzso signaling pathways coupled with zzso of zzso zzso factors and zzso modifications at appropriate genes are zzso The zzso functions of these cells are zzso by the zzso zzso by the differentiated zzso This paper will focus on the zzso and the network of zzso factors responsible for the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso
