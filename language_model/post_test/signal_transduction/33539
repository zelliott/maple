Although zzso a marker of poor prognosis in chronic zzso leukemia zzso is known primarily as an zzso it has also been ascribed a zzso zzso zzso with its proposed zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells would result in zzso and zzso Yet, in zzso both zzso and zzso zzso interactions are expected to be rather zzso We analyzed whether zzso interactions result in zzso and zzso zzso We found a high expression of zzso on zzso irrespective of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso with or without blocking zzso or zzso zzso did not result in increased survival or zzso Analysis of gene expression of most known regulators of zzso revealed no influence of zzso with zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our data do not support an important contribution of zzso triggering by zzso to the zzso and zzso state of the zzso zzso
