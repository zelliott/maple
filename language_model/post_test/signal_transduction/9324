Recent studies have shown that low zzso of zzso are produced zzso by zzso after zzso We observed that zzso at such zzso can stimulate proliferation as well as migration of zzso in a zzso zzso Both wounding and zzso can induce zzso of zzso via zzso but the zzso of zzso by zzso is more sustained and can last more than zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the increased proliferation and migration induced by zzso The zzso zzso was also found to be zzso upon treatment with zzso but it was not required for zzso migration or zzso Furthermore, it was observed that there is a cross talk between the zzso and the zzso pathways zzso zzso of either zzso can lead to zzso of the zzso As a result, the zzso effects of zzso were further enhanced when zzso was zzso Our data are consistent with the view that zzso may play an important signaling role in wound zzso
