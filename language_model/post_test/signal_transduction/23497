zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso projections emanating from the cell zzso They are assembled on virtually all cell types in the human body, with very few exceptions, and several recent reviews have covered the topic in great zzso The zzso is assembled from mature zzso zzso or zzso bodies, which serve to zzso growth of zzso that give rise to two structurally distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso are typically found in large zzso and beat zzso to generate fluid flow, primary zzso (with the exception of those found at the embryonic zzso are generally zzso and are found as solitary zzso zzso until recently, the primary zzso was considered a vestigial zzso without apparent biological zzso However, research over the past decade has established that the primary zzso is capable of zzso essential signaling information from the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the structure from which it zzso the zzso body, have been shown to cause a spectrum of diseases, ranging from zzso defects to zzso diabetes, and zzso Many of these diseases, or zzso are zzso as genetic zzso such as zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso illustrating the importance of understanding zzso structure and function and the mechanisms required for its zzso This review focuses primarily on recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory controls governing the assembly and maintenance of the primary zzso
