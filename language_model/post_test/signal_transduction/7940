zzso therapy is the future of cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently activated in solid zzso however, zzso no reliable test for zzso zzso zzso exists for human zzso Taking advantage of the observation that loss of zzso the negative regulator of zzso results in robust zzso of this pathway, we developed and validated a zzso gene expression signature for zzso zzso zzso loss in breast cancer zzso The most significant signature gene was zzso itself, indicating that zzso zzso levels are the primary zzso of zzso protein levels in zzso Some zzso zzso zzso exhibited the signature of zzso loss, which was associated to moderately reduced zzso zzso levels cooperating with specific types of zzso zzso and/or amplification of zzso This demonstrates that the signature is more sensitive than zzso zzso for identifying tumors with zzso zzso In independent data sets of breast, zzso and zzso zzso prediction of zzso activity by the signature correlated significantly to poor patient zzso zzso zzso by the signature gene zzso was an accurate zzso marker of the signature and had zzso significance in zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso and in zzso Thus, the signature or its components such as zzso may be clinically useful tests for zzso of patients for zzso zzso therapy and monitoring therapeutic zzso This study indicates that zzso zzso zzso signaling is strongly associated with zzso and poor survival across zzso types, highlighting the enormous potential impact on patient survival that zzso zzso could zzso
