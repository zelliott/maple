Does exposure to zzso acid zzso during in zzso maturation zzso enhance the maturation and zzso competence of mouse zzso 

zzso of zzso medium with 30 zzso zzso enhanced the zzso competence of in zzso matured zzso and so made them more comparable to in zzso matured control zzso 

zzso is a small zzso that acts as an zzso signaling zzso by binding to and zzso at least five G zzso zzso zzso has various biological actions, with both zzso and zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso at six different doses zzso 1, 10, 30, 50 or 100 zzso was added into the zzso zzso After zzso the zzso competence and other parameters of the zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso stage zzso from zzso to 6-week-old female zzso mice were incubated for zzso h in zzso medium containing 0, 1, 10 or 30 zzso zzso and then either zzso in zzso with zzso zzso or assessed for zzso zzso zzso membrane potential zzso or the zzso expression of a zzso checkpoint gene zzso a zzso structure gene zzso two zzso derived genes zzso and zzso and an zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso were grown in zzso to assess zzso rates, differential cell counts and zzso 

Rates of zzso zzso and zzso formation and zzso were significantly higher in the 30 zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in the zzso control zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and more comparable to that of the in zzso matured zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not adversely affect zzso activity, zzso integrity, zzso cell number, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso matured in 30 zzso zzso had reduced zzso zzso but zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in all of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the production of normal zzso were not zzso Only mouse zzso were zzso 

zzso of zzso medium with 30 zzso zzso may enhance the zzso competence of mouse zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

This study was supported by a research grant zzso from the Seoul National University zzso zzso The authors declare that they have no competing zzso
