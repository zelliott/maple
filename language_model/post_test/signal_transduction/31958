Cell therapy is a promising option for the treatment of acute or chronic zzso zzso The zzso infusion of cells zzso the potential risk of cell zzso which may be prevented by the addition of zzso However, a comprehensive analysis of the effects of zzso on the function of the cells is zzso 

Here, we investigated the effects of zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso on bone zzso zzso cell zzso functional activity and zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso profoundly and zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with 20 zzso zzso for 30 minutes zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso of zzso zzso whereas no effects on zzso or colony formation were observed zzso and zzso of control, zzso zzso of zzso with zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the injected cells in a mouse zzso model zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not inhibit in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso binds to both, the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso blocking zzso zzso as well as zzso signaling after zzso zzso 

zzso blocks zzso signaling by binding to the zzso as well as the zzso thereby interfering with migration and zzso of zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso but not zzso might be recommended as an zzso for zzso infusion of zzso for cell therapy after cardiac zzso
