zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are implicated in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We describe three pathways for the formation of zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso severe combined immune zzso zzso zzso A pair of zzso signal zzso sequences composed of zzso and zzso motifs separated by 12- or zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso were present in the vicinity of the deletion zzso in zzso zzso zzso accompanied by zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso In zzso zzso zzso the deletions at the zzso signal zzso sequences occurred at a significantly lower frequency than in zzso mice, whereas the deletions did not occur in zzso zzso These results show that the zzso are formed by zzso zzso zzso machinery at cryptic zzso signal sequences in the zzso zzso In contrast, one third of the deletions in zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso at both ends, indicating that in the absence of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as the main mechanism to produce zzso Furthermore, the deletions were induced via a coupled zzso between zzso zzso at a cryptic zzso signal sequence and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso As the deletions at cryptic zzso signal sequences occur spontaneously, zzso pathways might participate mainly in zzso zzso zzso signal zzso deletions were present zzso in the zzso population, suggesting that zzso with a zzso of the zzso gene have a growth advantage and are involved in zzso
