The signaling pathways zzso zzso oxide production and zzso in pancreatic zzso are incompletely zzso We report here that the inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide production in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso induced by a combination of zzso and zzso However, the contribution by zzso to the induction of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso is independent of zzso nuclear zzso since zzso does not prevent zzso zzso of this zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso alone leads to zzso of zzso which may reflect zzso of a zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso mediates zzso zzso and zzso independently of zzso zzso Moreover, a preventive effect on zzso induction and zzso by zzso of zzso may be partly masked due to simultaneous zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso
