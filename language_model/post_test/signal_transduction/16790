A zzso zzso screening allowed the selection of zzso as a factor that zzso with the zzso zzso gene zzso In mobility shift zzso zzso and its close zzso zzso zzso 1) interact with zzso 2 of the zzso promoter, containing a zzso zzso binding zzso In a loss of function zzso for genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the response of zzso to zzso zzso was completely lost, showing that the two zzso factors regulate zzso expression upon zzso zzso This regulation does not involve the zzso zzso regulatory zzso present in the zzso promoter and involved in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso response of zzso is not linked to the iron status of plants and is specifically initiated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of iron, zzso by zzso zzso zzso was strongly altered in a zzso zzso zzso revealing that both zzso and zzso are major factors involved in the regulation of iron zzso
