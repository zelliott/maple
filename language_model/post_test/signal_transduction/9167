Although zzso was first identified as a zzso that zzso zzso precursor protein zzso within the zzso domain, thus producing zzso peptides that are thought to be zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso its zzso functions have not been fully zzso In the zzso zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso by zzso serves to release an zzso domain of zzso that shows activity in the nucleus through binding to zzso zzso Many type 1 zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso have recently been shown to be zzso for zzso and their zzso zzso are released from the cell membrane following zzso by zzso The common zzso zzso zzso zzso and the turnover of possible signaling zzso which has led to the attractive hypothesis that mechanisms similar to zzso signaling contribute widely to zzso signaling zzso zzso is also likely to have a signaling zzso although the zzso functions of zzso have not been zzso Indeed, we have shown that the zzso domain of zzso alters gene expression and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling responds to the onset of zzso Here, we review the possibility of zzso zzso including zzso zzso which leads to zzso
