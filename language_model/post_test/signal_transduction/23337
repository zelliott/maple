The specific roles of zzso zzso components in behavior and development remain largely unknown, even though advances in molecular biology and conventional zzso laser zzso have greatly accelerated the identification of contributors at the molecular and cellular zzso We systematically applied zzso laser zzso which has zzso resolution zzso to dissect the cell bodies, zzso or zzso of a sensory zzso zzso in zzso zzso to determine their roles in modulating locomotion and the zzso decisions for zzso a zzso zzso life zzso Our results indicate that the cell body sends out zzso zzso and hormonal signals in order to mediate these zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso sensory zzso signals primarily drive and switch polarity between the decisions to enter and exit zzso Thus, the improved resolution of zzso laser zzso reveals a rich complexity of zzso signaling at the zzso level, including multiple zzso and zzso zzso pathways dependent on life zzso
