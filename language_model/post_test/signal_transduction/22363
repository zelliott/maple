zzso and early patterning of the zzso heart are dependent on both zzso and zzso wingless zzso signal zzso However, the impact of each zzso zzso on the later stages of zzso development and differentiation remains zzso Here, we report that the components of each zzso signal zzso are expressed in the developing and zzso heart, yet zzso activity is restricted to zzso zzso zzso we observed that zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso differentiation while preventing stabilization of the zzso zzso suggesting active repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was synonymous with zzso of a zzso 3 signal zzso while zzso of zzso activity led to zzso of zzso and a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso signals promote zzso maturation through zzso zzso of zzso zzso
