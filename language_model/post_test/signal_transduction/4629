zzso species exhibit diverse behaviors when presented with zzso zzso zzso zzso can undergo cell differentiation and zzso formation in response to fluctuating zzso levels, and these responses are required for zzso In the model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso limitation zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso Both responses require the same signal zzso zzso zzso and the same cell zzso zzso zzso but have been studied under different zzso We found that zzso growth and mat formation are aspects of a related response that is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso mats differentiated into zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulated mat expansion (in the plane of the zzso and zzso invasion zzso in the plane of the zzso which zzso the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also regulated an upward growth pattern (in the plane of the zzso in response to zzso limitation and changes in surface zzso zzso growth allowed for another level of mat responsiveness and resembled a type of colonial zzso Together our results show that signaling pathways play critical roles in regulating social behaviors in which zzso cells zzso Signaling pathways may regulate similar processes in zzso whose highly nuanced responses are required for zzso
