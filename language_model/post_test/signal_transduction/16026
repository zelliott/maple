DNA repair is an active cellular process to respond to constant DNA damage caused by zzso processes and environmental zzso Since the outcome of DNA damage is generally adverse and long term effects may contribute to zzso cells have developed a variety of DNA repair mechanisms, which operate depending on the type of DNA damage zzso At least 15 zzso anemia zzso proteins interact in a common zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in any of these zzso genes cause a rare disease, zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso progressive bone-marrow failure and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to various types of zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso have been identified in diverse cancer zzso Evidence exists that cells deficient in the zzso zzso become dependent on alternative pathways for zzso Additional zzso of such alternative pathways is thus expected to result in cell death, creating a relationship of synthetic zzso zzso these relationships can reveal yet unknown mechanisms of DNA repair and new targets for zzso
