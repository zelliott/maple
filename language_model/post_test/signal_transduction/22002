The zzso protein zzso undergo zzso zzso and are zzso expressed in various zzso in zzso adults, and zzso zzso and pathological studies suggested an apparent correlation between oxygen deprivation and zzso zzso The aim of the study was therefore to investigate the effect of a pathological insult zzso and a zzso growth factor zzso which zzso regulate zzso zzso on zzso expression using the zzso zzso cell zzso In the present study, we first demonstrated the expression of zzso in zzso cells, providing an experimental system to investigate the zzso role of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated the induction of zzso during zzso by oxygen deprivation and during chemical zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso In mice, zzso injection of zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso and protein expression in the zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly induced in correlation with zzso zzso This induction was partially blocked by zzso a selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicating the involvement of the zzso pathways in zzso induction by zzso zzso the zzso role of zzso will clarify mechanisms related to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
