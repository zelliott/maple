zzso synaptic transmission in the central nervous system is zzso primarily by the release of zzso from zzso terminals onto zzso channels gated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The myriad zzso responses arising from the zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors have previously been attributed to the flow of zzso and/or zzso through these zzso zzso Here we report that the binding of the zzso zzso to its zzso can generate zzso signals that are independent of zzso and zzso in rat cortical zzso In the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso brought about changes in a zzso protein zzso that inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the protein in an in zzso zzso This effect was observed in intact zzso treated with zzso as well as in isolated zzso exposed to zzso and was also found in zzso cells, which express functional zzso receptors but have no zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso demonstrating that zzso proteins were zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso protein arose from the association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that, as well as acting as an zzso channel, the zzso zzso can exhibit zzso zzso
