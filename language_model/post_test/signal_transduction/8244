zzso are known to act as zzso zzso by recruiting the zzso zzso protein 2 zzso complex to zzso receptors zzso linking them to zzso pits zzso for zzso They also act as signaling molecules connecting zzso to different downstream zzso We have previously shown that stimulation of the zzso II zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso a member of the zzso family, promotes the formation of a complex between zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report that formation of such a complex is involved in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso involved in binding zzso We identify a crucial zzso zzso in the ear domain of zzso and show in zzso that the zzso of this site regulates the interaction between zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso proteins combined with resonance energy transfer and image zzso zzso approaches, we show in live cells that zzso zzso is an important regulatory process for the zzso of zzso complexes in zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso is involved in the early steps of zzso zzso Our findings not only unveil zzso as a new zzso target during zzso zzso but also support the role of zzso signaling in the control of zzso zzso of zzso
