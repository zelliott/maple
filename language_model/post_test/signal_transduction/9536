The possibility to induce zzso zzso by the zzso of resident cardiac stem cells zzso has raised great zzso However, to propose zzso zzso as therapeutic options, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms controlling heart zzso is needed, including the cellular and molecular interactions that zzso precursors establish with cells of the zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso immature zzso from zzso mouse hearts with mouse bone zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to investigate whether these cells could influence zzso growth in zzso We found that zzso proliferation was enhanced by direct zzso with zzso compared with the single zzso We also showed that the zzso response of the zzso zzso involved the zzso of zzso zzso by its zzso zzso expressed by the adjacent zzso In fact, the zzso in contact with zzso revealed a stronger zzso for the activated zzso domain zzso as compared with those cultured alone and this response was significantly attenuated when zzso were silenced for zzso The presence of various zzso zzso and growth factors in the zzso medium of zzso underscored the contribution of zzso mechanisms to zzso zzso by the zzso In conclusions these findings unveil a previously zzso function of zzso in regulating zzso proliferation through zzso zzso and suggest that zzso cell zzso and zzso interactions may contribute to the development of new and more efficient zzso zzso repair zzso
