zzso immune response and zzso signaling with aging has previously been zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize zzso and zzso G proteins and to determine whether their relative amounts are altered with zzso First we studied the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso It was found that in any group of elderly the zzso zzso formation was significantly decreased compared to that of young zzso In zzso zzso binding affinity no measurable difference exists in either low- or zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso proteins by CT in zzso of young individuals showed a major zzso of 40 zzso and two much less prevalent components of 52 and 45 zzso In contrast, in zzso of elderly subjects the major zzso was 45 zzso and the two others were very zzso zzso In zzso CT labeled the zzso band quite zzso mainly in the elderly, and the zzso and zzso bands were very zzso labeled, mainly in young zzso When zzso was used, no age-related pattern changes could be demonstrated, while differences could be observed between the two types of zzso
