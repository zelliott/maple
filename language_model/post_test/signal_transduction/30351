zzso zzso is a gut zzso that plays an important role in gastrointestinal zzso zzso and growth as well as the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso family members zzso 2, and 3) have been identified as important regulators of zzso transport at the zzso zzso Previously, we showed that zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso however, the mechanisms are not entirely zzso Here, we show that zzso which is a zzso of zzso proteins in neuroendocrine cells, is localized in the ends of the processes of zzso cells, similar to the expression pattern of zzso zzso and zzso to the membrane and large zzso structures formed in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso The short hairpin zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso in parental zzso cells or zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso treated with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso co-exist with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso abrogates zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso Our data establish a zzso link between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and suggest the role of this zzso in the regulation of hormone zzso Because zzso is an important gut hormone that affects zzso zzso and both normal and tumor cell growth, our findings identify a novel signaling zzso that may be amenable to drug targeting for clinical zzso
