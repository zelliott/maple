The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the visual guidance of movements was studied in monkeys trained to use a zzso to guide a spot to a zzso Visual and motor influences were zzso by zzso zzso the spot and by varying the relationship between the direction of zzso and spot zzso We found a strong segregation of function in zzso during visual zzso zzso in area zzso were selectively modulated by the direction of visible moving zzso whereas zzso in area zzso were selectively modulated by the direction of hand zzso In contrast, the selectivity of cells in the lateral zzso area zzso did not directly depend on either visual input or motor zzso but rather seemed to zzso a zzso representation of stimulus zzso These zzso signals may be an important link in zzso zzso
