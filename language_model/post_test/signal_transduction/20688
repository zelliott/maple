We report the results of an extensive kinetic analysis of the effects of zzso zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso gene family members at the zzso zzso zzso and protein levels zzso and indirect zzso in the mouse zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso proteins are induced by zzso independently of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are induced by zzso the kinetic profiles for zzso and respective protein products being similar, except for a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is an exception, being zzso zzso However, zzso D protein is induced by zzso zzso closely mimics these zzso effects of zzso On the other hand, zzso derivatives are not effective in inducing the zzso and zzso zzso except for zzso zzso zzso D zzso and to some extent zzso B zzso Clearly, zzso is endowed with the versatile capability of modulating zzso and zzso gene zzso suggesting that zzso zzso factors play a role in zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso receptors are likely to activate signaling routes other than the classical zzso zzso A in order to induce zzso and zzso zzso
