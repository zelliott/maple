Recently, zzso studies of type 2 diabetes patients have provided evidence that zzso treatment is associated with a reduced cancer zzso and zzso but its mode of action remains zzso Here we report effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and details of molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso Our research indicates that zzso displays zzso activity against zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in an zzso manner, leading to zzso arrest in the zzso and subsequent cell zzso through the zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso strongly attenuated colony formation and dramatically inhibited zzso tumor growth in zzso In conclusion, our studies suggested that zzso might have potential as a zzso drug in the prevention and treatment of zzso
