The mechanisms leading to the increase in free zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso remains zzso Here we present our perspective on studies from different fields that reveal a previously unnoticed vicious cycle of zzso zzso The plasma zzso zzso during zzso in the night and early morning hours (the zzso zzso decreases with zzso This decrease is associated with a decrease in tissue zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso important zzso zzso The decrease in zzso reflects changes in the zzso protein zzso that normally ensures free zzso acid zzso during zzso zzso is zzso regulated by the insulin zzso signaling cascade that is enhanced by zzso stress in the absence of zzso This synopsis of seemingly unrelated processes reveals a novel mechanism of progressive zzso stress in which decreasing zzso zzso and increasing zzso zzso insulin zzso signaling activity compromise not only the zzso protein zzso but also the activity of zzso zzso factors zzso two functions that were found to have an impact on lifespan in several animal models of zzso In addition, the zzso decrease in zzso levels is likely to facilitate certain zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso Studies on zzso supplementation show therapeutic zzso
