zzso cells zzso are unique in their capacity to either stimulate or regulate T cells, and zzso pairs on DC and T cells are critically involved in this zzso In this study we present such a zzso which was discovered by us when analyzing the functional effects of an zzso zzso This zzso zzso reacted strongly with DC, but only minimally with zzso In zzso it constantly reduced zzso T cell zzso zzso we assumed that zzso zzso primarily exerts its functions by binding to a zzso This does not seem to be the case, zzso zzso of DC with zzso zzso before adding T cells had no zzso effect on T cell zzso zzso expression cloning identified the zzso zzso as zzso This zzso membrane protein zzso is only minimally expressed on resting T cells but can, as we show, quickly shift to the surface upon zzso zzso of that structure together with zzso zzso strong T cell zzso zzso on T cells thus represents an alternative target for zzso zzso with its binding to activated T cells rather than DC being responsible for the observed functional zzso This efficient zzso zzso of T cells is characterized by pronounced induction of zzso strong zzso production and compared with zzso enhanced T cell responsiveness to zzso Particularly in this latter quality zzso clearly zzso several other zzso zzso pathways previously zzso zzso thus represents an zzso reinforcing element, whose triggering promotes sustained and efficient T cell zzso and zzso
