A zzso approach has been taken to identify genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two independent lines of research led to the finding that the dominant zzso zzso zzso causes a diminished zzso zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso flies showed about zzso and zzso reduced responses to zzso and zzso respectively, compared to zzso zzso and sibling control flies lacking the zzso zzso when zzso recordings were made from the zzso anterior third zzso zzso The responses to five other zzso from three different chemical classes were zzso The maximum response to either zzso or zzso was decreased with no change in apparent zzso zzso to zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso were dramatically affected at all zzso locations zzso Only in the zzso zzso were responses to zzso zzso also zzso Most zzso zzso tested had a normal zzso zzso zzso of the region including zzso partially suppress the zzso bristle as well as zzso zzso zzso adults had an impaired behavioral response to zzso but not to banana or zzso There was no effect of the zzso on zzso zzso behavior or zzso recorded adult compound eye and zzso visual zzso These findings suggest the involvement of zzso in an zzso zzso in adults which is specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso
