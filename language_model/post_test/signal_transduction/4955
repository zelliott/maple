zzso nuclear receptors broadly influence zzso fitness and serve as popular targets for developing drugs to treat cardiovascular disease, zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways that govern zzso metabolism remain poorly zzso We previously found that the zzso zzso nuclear hormone zzso zzso regulates multiple genes in the fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso Here, we identify additional zzso targets that include zzso processing and zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso regulates distinct zzso of its target genes by zzso with at least two other distinct nuclear zzso Gene expression profiles suggest that zzso partners with zzso to regulate zzso and zzso zzso genes and with zzso to regulate genes involved in fatty acid zzso In addition, although we did not detect a direct physical interaction between zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso also regulates genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso with this, gene zzso of these receptors display a host of zzso that reflect their gene expression zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso regulated fatty acid zzso genes contribute to the shortened lifespan zzso of zzso deletion zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso animals had significantly altered zzso zzso and function, and that distinct aspects of this zzso can be ascribed to defects in zzso and zzso zzso Identification of zzso binding partners zzso a zzso dissection of its myriad regulatory roles in zzso zzso Our findings also provide further insights into the functions of the zzso zzso nuclear receptors zzso and zzso
