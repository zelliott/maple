The small zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso during diverse biological processes such as zzso zzso cell migration, zzso of zzso cells, and the invasion of zzso zzso Although it is known that zzso stimulates zzso outgrowth in the rat zzso zzso cell line, neither the zzso function nor the regulation of this zzso in zzso differentiation is zzso Here, we identify zzso as an inhibitor of zzso process complexity, which is regulated by the zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso branching in zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso acting via an zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso branching dependent on the small zzso zzso Finally, we show that the expression of zzso in zzso is suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso and connect the regulation of zzso expression by zzso to the stimulation of zzso process zzso Thus, zzso emerges as a cellular conductor of zzso and zzso activity, in turn regulated by zzso to control zzso and zzso zzso
