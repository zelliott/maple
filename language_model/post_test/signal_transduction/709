Through their ability to degrade the zzso zzso zzso mediate cancer cell invasion and zzso Paradoxically, some zzso zzso zzso zzso are often zzso in human zzso Using zzso analysis, we found that the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso a zzso that blocks numerous zzso activity, is significantly elevated in zzso zzso and in high-grade breast zzso The in zzso approach was zzso by zzso studies on two zzso cancer cell lines, the zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso cells, both of which form primary zzso tumors, but only zzso tumors are able to zzso to the zzso We show that treatment of zzso cells with zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express low zzso zzso Moreover, injection of zzso cells into mice did not affect zzso primary zzso tumor zzso however, the tumors had impaired zzso potential, which could be restored by zzso soluble zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, using zzso tumor models, we describe a novel zzso zzso the zzso zzso by binding zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spread of zzso zzso zzso an analysis of 126 breast cancer patients revealed that those whose breast tumors had elevated zzso levels had a significantly higher probability to develop lung zzso but not zzso to other sites, on zzso These results suggest that zzso might become a zzso marker in breast zzso
