The zzso signaling zzso is zzso activated in some pancreatic zzso when zzso it zzso zzso zzso We examined whether zzso activity zzso with zzso resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic zzso 

A panel of human pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated for zzso zzso activity as well as response to three zzso zzso cell death was evaluated following either zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso a downstream target of zzso was also zzso 

There was a broad distribution among pancreatic cancer cell lines by zzso activity, as well as sensitivity to the three zzso agents with no apparent zzso zzso of zzso but not change in total levels, correlated with the zzso effect of zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso activity does not appear to be a useful predictor for selection of pancreatic zzso in targeting zzso to broadly induce zzso
