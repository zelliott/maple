zzso sequencing has provided a vast resource for identifying interesting zzso but often an exact zzso is unknown and is only described as zzso present in a zzso by an observed zzso or by the known presence of a zzso signaling zzso such as that facilitated by the zzso zzso The low sequence similarity of G zzso receptors zzso and the absence of a known zzso with an associated zzso screening system in plants zzso their identification by simple zzso queries or zzso force experimental zzso zzso zzso analysis is useful in that it can reduce a large pool of possible candidates to a number manageable by medium or even zzso zzso Here we describe a method for the zzso identification of candidate zzso from whole zzso and their subsequent in zzso analysis for zzso zzso using a membrane based zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Genome zzso zzso zzso Rather than present the zzso process in a format requiring scripts or computer programming knowledge, we describe procedures here in a simple, zzso outline that only zzso the basic syntax of regular zzso
