zzso and zzso are common zzso conditions that can lead to zzso zzso namely if present at the same zzso We have reported that tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso are produced by cultured zzso and mainly by zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso The effects of these zzso are zzso by cell surface receptors through a nuclear factor zzso zzso that we have showed to be activated by zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the role of zzso and zzso signaling on zzso zzso to zzso in rat cortical zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso increased the expression of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso as well as their zzso observed by zzso binding of zzso molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso technology, or blockade of zzso zzso using its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso release and zzso zzso Interestingly, lack of zzso signal zzso reduced zzso cell death for short periods of zzso although an increase was observed after extended exposure; in contrast, zzso of zzso cascade produced a sustained blockade of zzso injury by zzso Together, our data show that inflammatory pathways are activated during in zzso exposure of rat cortical zzso to zzso and that this zzso is prolonged in zzso This supports the concept that inflammatory pathways play a role in brain damage by zzso and that they may represent important pharmacological zzso
