zzso is the master zzso zzso regulator operating at low cell density in zzso zzso regulation of target genes by zzso has been characterized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but it is still poorly understood in zzso zzso 

The zzso proteins are extremely zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The above nine zzso zzso appear to recognize zzso zzso DNA signals which can be represented by two consensus zzso a 20 zzso box sequence and a position frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso through direct zzso promoter DNA association, while it zzso the zzso zzso in an indirect zzso zzso and zzso starts, core promoter elements for zzso factor recognition, zzso sequences for zzso recognition, and zzso sites zzso corresponding zzso zzso zzso were determined for the three direct zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso was characterized in zzso zzso by using multiple zzso and molecular zzso The zzso promoter analysis indicated the zzso mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
