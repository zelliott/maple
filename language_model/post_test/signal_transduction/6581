The induction of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso activity is central to the deposition of inflammatory zzso in the pulmonary zzso The presence of enhanced tissue factor activity is often associated with pulmonary zzso deposition, an important zzso event that can delay resolution of pulmonary inflammation and promote the induction of pulmonary zzso Since tissue factor synthesis induction and zzso pathways are potential therapeutic targets for zzso of zzso zzso tissue factor zzso activity, we examined the pathways through which zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was markedly enhanced to 10 times the levels of freshly isolated zzso after 8 h of culture in the presence of either the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Both zzso less than zzso and zzso activity zzso less than zzso was completely zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso but was unaffected by the zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 100 zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso had modest effects that were not statistically zzso The zzso increase of zzso activity in zzso cultures was unaffected by the same zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
