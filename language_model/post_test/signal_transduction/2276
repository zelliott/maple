Recent studies have indicated that repeated brief episodes of zzso and zzso render the zzso more tolerant to subsequent lethal zzso zzso In view of the previous observations that zzso zzso zzso D signaling and that such signaling is beneficial for the heart, we investigated whether a similar zzso D signaling is responsible for the beneficial effects associated with repeated zzso and zzso Using an isolated zzso working rat heart model, we demonstrated that four brief episodes of 5 zzso of zzso and 10 zzso of zzso reduced the zzso of zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso performance, and decreased the release of zzso zzso from the zzso heart, with simultaneous zzso of zzso D generating the second zzso zzso and zzso acid and leading to the zzso and zzso of protein zzso zzso The specific zzso D zzso blocked the zzso of zzso D and attenuated the generation of zzso and zzso acid and zzso of protein zzso zzso In concert, zzso D zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso blocked the beneficial effects of zzso on the zzso performance, and increased the amount of zzso zzso release from the coronary zzso The results of this study indicate that repeated brief episodes of zzso and zzso exert beneficial effects on the intact rat heart by triggering the zzso of a zzso D signaling zzso
