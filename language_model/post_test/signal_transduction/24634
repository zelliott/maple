Many cells develop enhanced zzso zzso activity after prolonged exposure to drugs that acutely inhibit the zzso and it has been suggested that this adaptation may be due to an increase in zzso zzso We have treated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells with a stable analogue zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso After incubation with zzso for 24 zzso the zzso zzso synthetic rate in intact zzso cells was increased by zzso similar to the increase found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso was also increased in zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was not changed despite a small decrease in zzso zzso alpha zzso detected by zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso toxin prevented zzso from inducing the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso in intact zzso After chronic incubation of zzso cells with zzso exposure to zzso which abolished zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not zzso the enhanced rate of zzso zzso synthesis compared to zzso zzso These results with zzso cells demonstrate that an zzso increase in zzso zzso activity induced by chronic treatment with an zzso drug can occur in the absence of expression of zzso zzso
