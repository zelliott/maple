zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, which is mainly produced by zzso and known for its zzso biological zzso Recently, the zzso product of a zzso zzso gene of zzso was isolated from human zzso and named as zzso zzso shows only zzso zzso acid divergence in the mature zzso but exhibits a 38% zzso acid divergence in the signal zzso zzso We hypothesized that this may imply a difference in the cell type in which zzso is expressed or a difference in its mode of zzso In different types of zzso cells, zzso and zzso exhibited a distinct zzso zzso and a differential regulation of zzso zzso being stored in zzso zzso and released in response to protein zzso C zzso whereas zzso was continuously zzso and zzso through a zzso zzso A protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed also in zzso a cell type expressing mainly zzso zzso whereas smooth muscle cells, which zzso expressed zzso exhibited a zzso zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso exhibit a distinct zzso zzso and are zzso in a zzso regulated manner, suggesting distinct roles in inflammatory or zzso zzso
