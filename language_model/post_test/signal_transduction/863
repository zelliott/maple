zzso is a zzso factor essential for zzso zzso cells lacking zzso undergo zzso while zzso of zzso results in a block in zzso zzso However, zzso cells zzso zzso differentiate normally in zzso when in the presence of zzso zzso We have proposed a model, zzso a signal generated by zzso cells (red cell differentiation zzso zzso overcomes the intrinsic zzso in zzso zzso zzso The simplest interpretation of this model is that zzso zzso cells generate zzso To substantiate this notion, we have exploited a tissue specific zzso system and the process of zzso to generate mice that zzso zzso in half the zzso cells and are zzso zzso in the other zzso The results show that the cells zzso zzso are zzso zzso This study demonstrates the importance of zzso zzso in regulating zzso activity and that this zzso zzso between zzso cells is crucial to normal zzso
