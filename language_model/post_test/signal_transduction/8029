zzso a member of the zzso zzso class of zzso zzso is required for zzso extension movements in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso cells fail to align zzso which results in zzso movements and a selective zzso of zzso zzso depletion was rescued by zzso of zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts upstream of zzso zzso but not zzso stimulates zzso expression independent of the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso regulation of zzso by zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal through zzso zzso and zzso to activate the zzso signaling cascade with the zzso factors zzso and zzso The zzso zzso represents an alternative, distinct branch of zzso zzso signaling that controls gene expression and is required in the regulation of zzso extension movements in zzso zzso
