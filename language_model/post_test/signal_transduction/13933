zzso zzso 3 zzso is a widely expressed zzso protein in human zzso which zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso However, our zzso analysis of gastric cancer tissue samples zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was specifically altered in cancer zzso Here we investigated the zzso effects of zzso zzso and confirmed a significant correlation between the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso increased cell migration, invasion, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso conversely, zzso zzso expression in zzso cells reduced these zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso increased both the zzso level and activity of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso by increasing the levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with these findings, treatment with a protein zzso A zzso inhibitor decreased zzso and zzso expression levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by stable zzso in human gastric cancer cells suppressed tumor growth in a tumor zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may exert its zzso effects via the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso sequencing of the zzso promoter region revealed that gene expression was reduced by zzso of zzso sites, and increased by zzso zzso zzso Our study is the first to report an association of zzso with gastric cancer as well as its zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the expression of zzso is regulated through an zzso zzso Further study on the mechanism of zzso in zzso will provide the basis as a new molecular target of gastric zzso
