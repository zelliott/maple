zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was characterized in crude plasma membrane preparations from cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso of zzso mice, a model for Down syndrome, and their control zzso The levels of expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso by Western zzso analysis to establish their contribution to the patterns of zzso zzso zzso activity regulated by zzso and zzso and zzso receptors presented a regional distribution in both control and zzso zzso In both groups of mice, the intensity of zzso responses to zzso zzso by calcium followed the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso activities, however, were significantly lower in zzso zzso of zzso than in control zzso This difference was mostly revealed in crude plasma zzso prepared from zzso at the level of zzso activity because the zzso curve to zzso showed a reduction of the zzso effect in zzso mice, with no change in sensitivity zzso Western zzso analysis showed a zzso distribution of zzso zzso in both groups of zzso The levels of zzso zzso however, were significantly lower in the zzso of zzso than in control zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso mice has severe deficiencies in zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso which are specifically related to a lower level of expression of the zzso zzso a fact that may account for the neurological zzso observed in this zzso model of Down zzso
