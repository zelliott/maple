We demonstrated recently that the zzso acid zzso cascade is involved in zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and the zzso of nuclear factor zzso in human smooth muscle cells zzso Since AA release from zzso is zzso by zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized by zzso that zzso stimulates zzso generation in zzso and ultimately activates zzso via a zzso G zzso zzso Our first test of this hypothesis demonstrated that zzso blocked AA release induced by zzso infection of zzso as well as blocked the terminal products of this reaction, zzso generation and zzso zzso More zzso components of the zzso were then zzso zzso infection increased zzso and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso causing AA zzso these effects were inhibited by zzso zzso infection activated zzso protein zzso zzso a key zzso for zzso zzso an effect also inhibited by zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso and thereby activates zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that a zzso G zzso signaling zzso mediates cellular effects of zzso infection of zzso The downstream events include zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and subsequent zzso and zzso of zzso (with its zzso to cell zzso followed by stimulation of the AA zzso which generates zzso zzso and thereby activates zzso
