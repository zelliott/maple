Even a short blockade of oxygen flow in brain may lead to the zzso of zzso zzso and depletion of cellular zzso which results in profound deficiencies in cellular zzso Following zzso dying, injured, and hypoxic cells release soluble zzso and zzso zzso Growing evidence suggests that zzso zzso might act as zzso factors in the zzso and zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso zzso for these compounds are expressed on zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso diverse zzso Such effects range from induction of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes, to stimulation of synthesis and/or release of zzso and zzso factors under both zzso and pathological zzso Multiple signaling pathways regulate the critical balance between cell death and survival in zzso A zzso zzso for the regulation of multiple zzso involved in zzso sensing is the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso terminating in a variety of zzso factors, for example, zzso factor zzso In this review, the zzso of zzso zzso pathways and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso regulation of the nervous system's development and zzso under hypoxic stress will be zzso
