Previously, we showed that insulin growth factor zzso binding zzso zzso independent of IGF-1, reduces pathological zzso in a mouse model of the zzso zzso zzso The current study evaluates novel zzso functions of zzso including blood retinal barrier zzso integrity and zzso To evaluate vascular barrier function, either zzso expressing zzso under the regulation of an zzso promoter or a control zzso was injected into the zzso humor of mouse zzso zzso and compared to the zzso eyes of the same zzso undergoing standard zzso zzso Prior to zzso the mice were given an injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eyes displayed zzso vessel zzso and enhanced vascular barrier zzso Further, in zzso zzso protects retinal zzso cells from zzso loss of zzso integrity by zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso To assess the zzso effects of zzso rat zzso cerebral arteries were examined in zzso zzso zzso decreased both zzso and zzso zzso by stimulating zzso oxide zzso release that were blocked by zzso or scavenger zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release to a similar extent in human zzso zzso cells zzso NO release was neither associated with an increase in zzso calcium nor decreased by zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso were both increased by zzso and selectively blocked by the zzso or zzso blocker zzso In conclusion, zzso mediates protective effects on zzso integrity and mediates robust NO release to stimulate zzso via zzso of zzso This response is zzso and zzso but requires zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has novel protective effects on retinal and systemic zzso and may be a therapeutic candidate for zzso complications such as diabetic zzso
