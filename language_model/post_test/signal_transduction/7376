zzso zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to improve outcome in adults and newborn zzso Other than zzso factor, sensors of zzso demand remain largely zzso During zzso zzso zzso is arrested resulting in zzso of zzso zzso zzso As such zzso readily increases, exerting its biological effects via a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso enhances zzso zzso and reduces zzso size in a model of newborn zzso brain zzso 

The zzso model of zzso zzso was zzso zzso was measured by mass zzso and zzso density was evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso Gene expression was evaluated by real-time zzso chain zzso zzso levels rapidly increased in the zzso region of brain zzso zzso was zzso localized not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso density increased at 96 hours after injury in zzso zzso it was diminished in zzso mice leading to an increased zzso zzso zzso with zzso led to an increase in growth factors implicated in zzso only in zzso zzso To explain the mode of action of zzso we investigated the role of zzso zzso E zzso 4, previously proposed in neural zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor expression was zzso by a zzso inhibitor and a selective zzso E zzso 4 zzso This zzso also abolished zzso zzso 

We uncover a dominant zzso sensor responsible for zzso zzso adaptation, notably zzso acting via zzso zzso E zzso 4 to govern expression of major zzso zzso We propose that pharmacological intervention targeting zzso could improve zzso brain zzso
