zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso ammonium zzso zzso and ammonium zzso zzso were obtained during simultaneous current and zzso clamping of the zzso field zzso Although functional and zzso similarities for zzso have been reported for zzso and zzso zzso we report here that significant differences are discernible in the CT responses to both zzso Unlike neural responses to zzso those to zzso are zzso sensitive, enhanced by zzso negative and suppressed by positive zzso zzso In this regard, zzso responses are zzso similar to zzso zzso however, the magnitude of zzso zzso sensitivity is significantly less than that of zzso The concentration dependence of the CT response to zzso zzso a zzso zzso relationship not observed with zzso or zzso Below zzso M, the CT response increases as if to approach a zzso zzso However, beyond zzso M an inflection appears in the zzso curve because of an abrupt increase in CT zzso This kinetic profile is zzso and is correlated with an increase in zzso zzso that displays similar zzso concentration zzso The zzso relation to salt concentration is not observed when zzso or zzso is zzso for zzso As with zzso and zzso zzso less mobile zzso than zzso zzso and zzso lower the CT zzso However, like zzso zzso but in contrast to zzso zzso the onset zzso of CT responses to zzso or zzso remained zzso even under positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partially suppresses CT responses within the concentration range of zzso M zzso zzso zzso also suppresses the zzso sensitivity of zzso CT responses, but does not eliminate the sensitivity as it does for zzso zzso In conclusion, the data suggest that taste zzso for zzso zzso is zzso over two zzso zzso pathways in the taste zzso This is especially evident with zzso where the zzso zzso show two distinct kinetic zzso Below zzso M the zzso with increasing zzso clamp zzso response zzso and zzso sensitivity suggest an zzso membrane zzso zzso Above zzso M, the high zzso dependence of the response and its zzso zzso indicate participation of the zzso zzso in zzso
