In zzso rat zzso slices spreading depression zzso and zzso zzso zzso are associated with increased light zzso and decreased light zzso indicating increased light zzso By contrast, mild zzso or electrical stimulation decrease light zzso which is usually taken to be caused by cell zzso This difference has been attributed to experimental conditions, but in our laboratory moderate zzso challenge and zzso produced opposite intrinsic optical signals zzso in the same slice under identical zzso To decide whether the zzso zzso is related to cell zzso we investigated the effects of zzso transport zzso and zzso withdrawal on both light zzso and zzso as well as on changes in zzso volume and tissue electrical zzso In normal zzso early during zzso there was a slight decrease in light zzso paired with increase in zzso At the onset of hypoxic zzso zzso with the onset of cell swelling zzso of zzso zzso the zzso signals suddenly zzso indicating sharply increased zzso The zzso zzso started in a single spot and spread out over the entire zzso region without invading zzso Application of 2 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso When zzso was zzso by zzso or zzso the zzso zzso increase and zzso decrease were suppressed and replaced by opposite signals, indicating scattering zzso Yet zzso withdrawal did not prevent cell swelling measured as shrinkage of zzso zzso The zzso increase of tissue electrical resistance was reduced when bath zzso was replaced by zzso and almost eliminated when replaced by zzso The zzso signal is judged to be a more reliable indicator of zzso space than tissue zzso Neither application of zzso A nor raising zzso depressed the zzso zzso increase, suggesting that zzso flux through zzso zzso may not be a major factor in its zzso zzso poisoning of zzso cells (5 zzso accelerated zzso onset and enhanced the zzso zzso increase zzso This suggests, first, that zzso cells normally moderate the zzso process and, second, that zzso are the zzso generators of the zzso zzso We conclude that light scattering by cerebral tissue can be changed by at least two different physical zzso Cell swelling decreases light zzso whereas a second process increases zzso During hypoxic zzso the scattering increase masks the zzso scattering decrease, but the latter is revealed when zzso is zzso The scattering increase is zzso dependent, nevertheless it is apparently not related to cell volume zzso Its underlying mechanism is as yet not clear; possible factors are zzso
