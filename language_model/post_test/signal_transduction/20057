zzso growth factor zzso signaling has been shown to play critical roles in zzso zzso and zzso of the embryonic zzso Neither the exact roles of zzso zzso nor the identity of the zzso zzso involved in these zzso has been zzso zzso zzso is required for cell migration away from the primitive streak when zzso zzso but previous studies have shown that drastically reducing the level of zzso later in zzso has no apparent effect on zzso or zzso of the zzso In this study, we demonstrate that loss of both zzso and zzso expression during late zzso resulted in a dramatic skeletal zzso zzso zzso and ribs had abnormal zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso or completely zzso and no tail zzso were zzso The expression of zzso in the tail and the amount of nascent zzso expressing zzso were both severely zzso zzso of genes in the zzso signaling zzso involved in zzso was significantly affected, and zzso formation ceased after the production of about zzso zzso zzso seen in the zzso appear to result from a failure to produce sufficient zzso zzso rather than a failure of zzso precursors to migrate away from the primitive zzso Although the zzso prematurely decreases in size, we did not detect evidence of a change in the proliferation rate of cells in the tail region or excessive zzso of zzso or zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso are required to maintain a population of zzso cells in the zzso that generates zzso and contributes to the stem cell population that is incorporated in the zzso and required for zzso zzso of the mouse zzso after zzso
