zzso zzso oxide zzso synthesis during learning that food is zzso in zzso blocks subsequent memory zzso To gain insight into the function of NO transmission during learning we tested whether blocking NO synthesis affects aspects of feeding that are expressed both in a zzso context and during zzso zzso NO synthesis with zzso and blocking zzso zzso with zzso blue decreased the efficacy of ad zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso also decreased rejection responses frequency, but did not affect rejection zzso The effect of zzso was explained by a decreased signaling that efforts to swallow are not successful, leading to a decreased rejection rate, and a decreased ability to zzso and subsequently consume food in ad zzso zzso Signaling that animals have made an effort to swallow is a critical component of learning that food is zzso zzso of the lips with food alone did not produce memory, but stimulation combined with the NO donor zzso did produce zzso zzso NO at a concentration causing memory also excited a key zzso responding to zzso the zzso Block of the zzso zzso cascade during training by zzso blue also blocked memory formation after zzso Our data indicate that memory arises from the contingency of three events during learning that food is zzso One of the events is efforts to zzso which are signaled by NO by zzso
