zzso promotes zzso water zzso decreasing zzso of free water to dilute plasma and lower serum zzso We have good understanding of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of this zzso zzso water zzso In comparison, zzso actions on zzso zzso including sodium zzso and its consequences have been less well zzso This is so for investigation and discussions of the zzso actions of zzso are framed primarily around water metabolism rather than any direct effect on salt zzso The fact that water moves in biological systems, to include the zzso zzso only by zzso passively down its concentration zzso is implicit in such discussion but often not overtly zzso This can cause zzso Moreover, although zzso action on zzso sodium zzso via the V2 zzso is critical to water zzso it is masked easily being zzso instance, dependent on zzso zzso It is now clear that an increase in sodium zzso along the zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso by zzso makes an important contribution to maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso necessary for zzso water zzso Thus, we need to modify slightly our understanding of zzso and its zzso actions to include the idea that while zzso decreases free water zzso to dilute zzso it does this, in part, by promoting sodium zzso and consequently decreasing sodium zzso via zzso activated along the zzso zzso
