zzso evidence has established that direct zzso interactions occur between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso Delta and zzso and that zzso interactions occur between Delta molecules on opposing cell zzso Using an zzso zzso developed for zzso cultured cells, we have compared the affinities of these zzso We find that the zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso Delta and zzso have higher affinities than zzso interactions between Delta zzso zzso to previous suggestions, our evidence implies that the interactions between zzso and zzso are similar in affinity to those between Delta and zzso We find that Fringe does not zzso affect the zzso interactions of the zzso zzso in cultured zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso like zzso is a zzso zzso that can participate in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso between expressing zzso Our findings imply that qualitative differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso depend on characteristics other than intrinsic zzso affinities or the ability to participate in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
