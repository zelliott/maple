High zzso zzso of the zzso zzso negative selection in the zzso and can also induce zzso of peripheral T zzso zzso through zzso enhances T cell zzso and zzso negative selection in the zzso but the role of zzso in peripheral T cell zzso tolerance has not been zzso We used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains to assess the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on peripheral T cell expansion and zzso We compared the zzso division, expansion, and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso with intermediate zzso high zzso or very high zzso + zzso zzso zzso With intermediate zzso zzso the zzso signal enhanced T cell zzso and zzso However, when T cells encountered high zzso zzso the zzso signal reduced T cell expansion and increased zzso These results indicate that the zzso signal can zzso peripheral T cell responses by increasing zzso when zzso zzso exceeds a critical zzso
