zzso is a fundamental stimulus that impacts cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent identification of other members of the zzso family of zzso zzso has provided insight into the molecular zzso of oxygen zzso This review focuses on the mechanisms of zzso zzso and their roles in zzso and zzso responses to zzso with an emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso are zzso comprised of an zzso zzso or zzso zzso and a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity under conditions of reduced zzso availability requires stabilization of zzso and zzso due to reduced zzso zzso zzso with zzso and interaction with zzso due to decreased zzso zzso zzso other than zzso such as zzso oxide and zzso oxygen species, can also activate zzso zzso and zzso are essential for acute zzso sensing by the carotid body, and their coordinated zzso zzso is critical for zzso adaptations to chronic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, intermittent zzso which occurs in association with zzso breathing, results in an imbalance between zzso and zzso that causes zzso stress, leading to zzso zzso
