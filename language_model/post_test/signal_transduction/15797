In this study, we evaluated whether a cross talk between nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso may take place and contribute to regulate cell zzso and/or zzso network in primary cortical zzso We found that lack of zzso either induced acutely by zzso zzso nuclear zzso or genetically in zzso mice, results in cortical zzso characterized by reduced zzso zzso loss of zzso and zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso effects found in zzso cortical cells were reversed after treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggested that zzso abnormalities in zzso cortical zzso were dependent on zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso being a major player in zzso such zzso In this line, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso acts as zzso zzso of zzso We also found altered distribution of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso mice compared with zzso zzso at zzso day zzso These data suggest the relevance of future studies on the role of zzso cross talk in regulating zzso structural plasticity in zzso and pathological zzso
