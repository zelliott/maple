We have determined that zzso H zzso zzso strongly to the nuclear membrane as well as being found in the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells which have been zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is consistent with findings in cells of zzso zzso There is strong evidence that zzso zzso zzso which in other zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso and/or differentiation promoting activities, act through binding of zzso receptors which then enter the zzso In addition, some zzso acid derivatives are clearly generated by zzso at the nuclear envelope and zzso to sites in zzso or bind sites in zzso The zzso cell line will make an excellent system for studying these zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso
