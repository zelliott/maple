zzso transient zzso potential zzso channels are opened by classical signal zzso events initiated by zzso zzso or depletion of zzso calcium zzso Here, we report a novel mechanism for opening zzso channels in which zzso zzso zzso a cascade resulting in zzso zzso When zzso cells zzso are incubated in zzso zzso rapid zzso of zzso zzso calcium influx that results in zzso of zzso zzso of this zzso cascade causes a prolonged increase in zzso calcium concentration zzso that zzso zzso zzso When zzso is zzso with zzso the zzso rise in zzso is shortened and the zzso of zzso migration is zzso When zzso is zzso or zzso from zzso mice are zzso zzso has minimal effect on zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso is not zzso in response to zzso supporting the dependence of zzso zzso on the opening of zzso zzso zzso of this novel zzso channel cascade by zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso migration, could adversely impact on zzso healing in zzso arteries where zzso is zzso
