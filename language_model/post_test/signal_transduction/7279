zzso zzso zzso is the most lethal form of primary brain tumors, characterized by highly invasive and aggressive tumors that are resistant to all current therapeutic zzso zzso are highly zzso in nature and contain a small but highly zzso and zzso population of stem or initiating cells zzso stem cells or zzso zzso have been shown to contribute to tumor propagation and resistance to current therapeutic zzso Recent studies of human zzso have zzso the genetic zzso common in these tumors, but much remains unknown about specific signaling pathways that regulate zzso Here we identify a distinct fraction of cells in a genetically engineered mouse model of zzso zzso that respond to zzso therapy by inducing high levels of zzso zzso The zzso cells displayed zzso potential and long-term zzso ability in zzso and are capable of zzso into multiple zzso The zzso zzso cells are resistant to radiation and highly zzso in zzso zzso of zzso signaling led to an increase in expression of the zzso zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso prevented the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso expressing cells were zzso localized in zzso regions of mouse tumors consistent with their function as zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which is a functional requisite for zzso activity and thus represents a promising therapeutic zzso
