In the bacterial zzso network, zzso clusters process zzso and zzso zzso generate zzso zzso and motor complexes are coupled by the zzso protein zzso zzso output (the zzso concentration of zzso varies from cell to zzso However, the motor is zzso with a narrow operating range of zzso zzso How the match between zzso output and motor input might be zzso is zzso Here we show that the motor can shift its operating range by changing its zzso The number of zzso zzso in the zzso increases in response to a zzso in the concentration of zzso increasing motor zzso This shift in sensitivity explains the slow partial adaptation observed in zzso that lack the zzso zzso and zzso and why zzso show zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely to be a common feature in the operation of many molecular zzso
