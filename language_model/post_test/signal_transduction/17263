zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is highly zzso in evolution and mediates communication between adjacent zzso zzso receptors have been implicated in cell fate determination, as well as maintenance and differentiation of stem zzso In the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso and germ cells has been demonstrated, however its role in zzso was not zzso To study the significance of zzso in germ cells, we applied a zzso approach in mice to induce zzso zzso or zzso function specifically in male germ zzso Using a zzso zzso we produced mice with conditional zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso in germ zzso zzso in these zzso was progressively affected with age, resulting in decreased zzso weight and zzso zzso Analysis of downstream target genes of zzso signaling showed an increased expression of zzso with a reduction of the zzso differentiation marker, zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in mouse germ cells with the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also showed that the conditional germ zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso or male zzso Our data suggest the importance of zzso signaling regulation in male germ cells for their survival and zzso
