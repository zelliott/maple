zzso sorting allows the segregation of zzso by a single zzso cell zzso and is a prerequisite for zzso during peripheral nerve zzso zzso sorting is impaired in models of human diseases, zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso zzso and Fukuyama, zzso to zzso zzso in the genes coding for zzso zzso Large or zzso zzso zzso It is not clear which zzso are activated by zzso zzso or zzso by Large and zzso during zzso Candidates are zzso zzso because their absence zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the topography of the zzso is different and zzso zzso are not zzso for Large and zzso By contrast, deletion of the Large and zzso zzso zzso does not result in zzso sorting zzso Here, we show that absence of zzso in a specific genetic background causes sorting defects with topography identical to that of zzso 211 zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso By zzso studies in mice lacking one or both receptors in zzso we show that only absence of zzso zzso zzso proliferation and survival, and arrests zzso sorting at early zzso that zzso zzso and zzso activate different zzso and that the absence of both molecules is zzso Thus, the function of zzso and zzso zzso is not zzso but is zzso These data identify zzso as a functional zzso 211 zzso during zzso sorting and the key zzso relevant to the zzso of zzso zzso muscular zzso
