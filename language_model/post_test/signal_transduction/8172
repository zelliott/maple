zzso zzso 5 zzso a zzso repeat domain zzso has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, including cellular zzso migration, differentiation and survival, and cell cycle checkpoint regulation via the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso However, the zzso functions of zzso have not been zzso To confirm the role of zzso in cell cycle checkpoint regulation, we generated zzso mice and isolated mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells from zzso and zzso control zzso Although zzso mice can survive through embryonic development and zzso life and zzso cells from the zzso mice maintain normal replication checkpoint induced by zzso zzso zzso cells display a significant zzso in zzso DNA damage checkpoint in response to zzso radiation zzso To determine whether this zzso in zzso zzso checkpoint is due to altered zzso zzso we measured zzso zzso activity and zzso downstream zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso activity is attenuated in zzso zzso zzso levels of two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso in response to zzso Furthermore, DNA zzso zzso nuclear zzso were dramatically reduced in zzso zzso These results demonstrate a direct regulatory linkage between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso in zzso
