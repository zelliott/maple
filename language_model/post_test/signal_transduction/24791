Acid zzso zzso mice generated by gene targeting abundantly store zzso in the zzso system of liver, zzso bone zzso and in zzso Liver cells of zzso mice accumulate zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the plasma zzso but cholesterol is depleted in the plasma zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso can be isolated from zzso embryonic zzso and zzso of zzso but not of zzso mice, by zzso zzso density zzso zzso and other zzso zzso are reduced in zzso zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso T zzso is reduced, whereas their zzso to zzso zzso is increased after T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I signaling remains zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and, consequently, zzso signaling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso expression in zzso T zzso increases their sensitivity towards zzso zzso
