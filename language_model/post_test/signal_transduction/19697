For both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso the rates of protein zzso and zzso determine the zzso time zzso Thus, kinetic studies of zzso group transfer between signaling partners are important for gaining a full understanding of how the system is zzso In many cases, the zzso reactions are too fast for rates to be determined by manual zzso Rapid zzso flow techniques thus provide a powerful method for studying rapid reactions that occur in the zzso time zzso In this chapter, we describe experimental design and procedures for kinetic characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso system using a rapid zzso flow kinetic zzso
