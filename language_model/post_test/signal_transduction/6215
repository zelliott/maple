Cell cycle arrest by zzso zzso factors involves zzso repression of zzso D, although the exact mechanism remains zzso In this study, we used the zzso cell line zzso as a model system to investigate the mechanisms zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity, and zzso of zzso zzso Using reporter gene zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso can repress zzso zzso zzso through a zzso site located within the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso which in turn zzso the expression of zzso culminating in the repression of zzso zzso zzso through this zzso zzso This process was verified by mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso We find that conditional zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso at protein and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso This report establishes the signaling events zzso zzso signals are relayed to zzso zzso to mediate cell cycle progression and defines a potential mechanism by which zzso proteins regulate zzso zzso zzso
