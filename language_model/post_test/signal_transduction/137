Plants activate local and systemic zzso mechanisms upon exposure to zzso This innate immune response is partially regulated by plant hormones, and involves the zzso of defensive zzso Although local zzso reactions to zzso are well zzso less is known about the impact of root zzso on shoot zzso Here, we examined the effects of zzso infestation by the western corn zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso induced zzso resistance against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso increased shoot levels of zzso zzso and primed the induction of zzso acid upon subsequent infestation by zzso zzso To gain insight into the zzso network behind this zzso and zzso zzso interaction, we compiled a set of 32 zzso zzso which can be used as zzso marker systems to detect activities of different zzso zzso zzso attack by zzso zzso zzso triggered an zzso zzso pattern in the zzso The zzso of zzso hormones showed a local increase in the production of zzso after root and shoot infestation by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso accumulated locally and zzso upon zzso attack by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso water content, whereas the removal of similar quantities of root biomass had no zzso Our study shows that root zzso by zzso zzso zzso specifically alters the zzso zzso status of a zzso and suggests that zzso plays a role in the zzso network zzso this zzso
