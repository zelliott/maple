zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso by local zzso inflammation is a hallmark of type 1 zzso zzso analysis of zzso from non-obese diabetic mice indicated zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso induce zzso expression as a protective mechanism against zzso in both human and zzso zzso The gene network affected was studied by zzso analysis showing that zzso regulates nearly zzso of the zzso zzso zzso including the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso by zzso is a key event for zzso survival after zzso zzso Moreover, pharmacological zzso of zzso via increased zzso protected zzso primary zzso and human zzso cells against zzso zzso These results were confirmed in genetically modified zzso derived from zzso transgenic zzso Our findings identify zzso as a novel downstream target of zzso in the survival mechanism of zzso under inflammatory zzso
