zzso zzso is a zzso process whose basic function is to convert a low energy reaction, the zzso interaction that may involve a single zzso zzso into a whole cell electrical response, the zzso potential, which triggers the firing of one or more action zzso Although much effort has been devoted to the experimental analysis of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in the favorable zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso is less zzso The model we investigated, which takes into account the zzso of zzso molecules from air to the zzso space, their zzso and their interaction with zzso focuses on the membrane zzso It involves the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose reaction rates are limited by lateral diffusion in the zzso The evolutions in time of these species in response to single pulse stimulation of various zzso were compared to one another and to the zzso measured electrical zzso The results obtained suggest that the zzso conversion is fast with respect to the zzso response, that it presents a small amplification factor, contrary to the zzso and that most of the amplification is achieved in the zzso processes involving the second zzso and zzso zzso
