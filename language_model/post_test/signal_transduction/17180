Acute zzso leukemia zzso is the zzso childhood zzso and is characterized by recurring structural genetic zzso Previous studies of DNA zzso suggest zzso zzso may also be important, but an integrated zzso analysis of genetic and zzso zzso in ALL has not been zzso We analyzed 137 zzso and 30 zzso childhood ALL cases using zzso analysis of DNA copy number zzso and gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiling using the zzso tiny zzso enrichment by zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the different genetic zzso of ALL are characterized by distinct DNA zzso signatures that exhibit significant correlation with gene expression zzso We also identified an zzso signature common to all cases, with correlation to gene expression in zzso of these zzso suggesting that a core set of zzso zzso genes is central to the initiation or maintenance of zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso zzso in multiple genes also targeted by recurring DNA copy number zzso in zzso suggesting that these genes are zzso far more frequently than suggested by structural zzso analyses zzso Together, these results demonstrate zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in ALL that influence zzso activity, and are likely to exert a key role in zzso
