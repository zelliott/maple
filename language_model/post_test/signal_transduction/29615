Recent studies in zzso cells show that zzso zzso a pivotal component of iron transport and zzso also exerts zzso zzso We show here in a zzso model that zzso interferes with zzso zzso death and liver zzso The mechanism involves the zzso of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso signals via zzso The results obtained with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the observed zzso effect of zzso was not zzso by iron zzso In conclusion, the data suggest that zzso has broader functions than previously recognized and may serve as a zzso zzso
