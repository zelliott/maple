zzso cells zzso also named zzso stem cells, are responsible for zzso human acute zzso Although they have been characterized in various zzso their role in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso is zzso To identify and characterize zzso in zzso zzso we zzso peripheral blood cell populations from patient samples by flow zzso into three cell zzso by using two zzso zzso (a marker of immature cells and zzso and zzso (a marker of early zzso zzso We tested these populations in both in zzso culture zzso and in zzso for growth and leukemia development in zzso zzso We found zzso activity in zzso cells only as zzso cells contained normal human zzso and zzso stem cells that differentiated into zzso B zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells were enriched in zzso when compared with zzso zzso These zzso cells also proliferated more upon zzso zzso than zzso cells and were sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso These data show that zzso and zzso expression in human zzso samples help in discriminating zzso cell populations endowed with different zzso activity, proliferation capacity and responses to zzso
