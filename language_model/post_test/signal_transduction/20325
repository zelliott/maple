Although zzso in zzso dynamics are associated with cellular responses to injury, the functional role of these dynamic changes in zzso zzso is zzso One of these dynamic responses to injury includes zzso zzso Various zzso zzso stimuli that induce an zzso state zzso zzso zzso may also induce zzso zzso Using zzso cultures, we found that zzso zzso zzso induced both zzso tolerance and markers of zzso zzso with overlapping zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of critical components of the zzso zzso machinery, including nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso factor A zzso as well as zzso copy number, zzso protein levels, and markers of functional zzso such as increased cellular zzso content, zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both the induction of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso effects of zzso Several signaling pathways coordinated these zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso and zzso expression by zzso whereas zzso signaling was necessary for the nuclear zzso of zzso and subsequent induction of zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso zzso zzso multiple signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso in zzso and that these dynamic changes contribute to zzso zzso
