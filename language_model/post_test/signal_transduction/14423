zzso growth factor beta zzso plays an essential role in the regulation of normal zzso processes of zzso zzso has been shown to regulate several zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in several zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso on soft tissue zzso are seldom zzso Our previous studies suggested that there should be some other signal zzso pathways besides zzso which are important to regulate the growth of human zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the expression and functional relations of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso in human zzso tissue and a zzso cell line, zzso 

zzso cells and normal human primary skeletal zzso zzso were treated with zzso to establish the expression profile of zzso at the zzso and protein levels detected by zzso and zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso in 50 tissue specimens of human zzso and 23 specimens of normal skeletal zzso zzso of specimens was performed 6 months to 70 months zzso 

zzso cells and human zzso zzso showed the higher expression of zzso and zzso than the normal control, either the protein level or the zzso zzso And, zzso zzso stimulation can lead to higher expression of zzso and its nuclear zzso so zzso can also activated zzso zzso pathway, resulting in a sustained zzso of zzso for at least 2 zzso zzso analysis, however, showed that there was no correlation between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso had no indicative effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age, and zzso 

In zzso signaling of zzso from cell surface to nucleus can also be directed through the zzso zzso zzso besides the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso may be zzso zzso Moreover, there may be some other zzso relationships between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which takes part in the development, invasion and zzso of tumor zzso
