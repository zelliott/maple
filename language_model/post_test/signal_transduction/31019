Abstract Physical activity relies on muscular zzso In adult skeletal muscle, force results from the contraction of zzso zzso zzso of different zzso and zzso zzso zzso can adapt to zzso conditions of altered functional demand by zzso growth, zzso growth, and regulation of zzso type functional gene zzso The zzso specificity depends on the distinct molecular and cellular events triggered by unique combinations of conditional zzso In order to derive effective and tailored exercise prescriptions, it must be determined zzso which zzso condition leads to what zzso response, and zzso how this zzso response relates to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso It follows that a thorough zzso description of the loading condition is zzso Unfortunately, the definition of zzso exercise conditions in the past and present literature is zzso It is classically limited to load zzso number of repetitions and sets, rest zzso sets, number of zzso and training zzso In this review, we show why the current description is insufficient, and identify new zzso of quantitative and/or qualitative effects on skeletal muscle with respect to resistance exercise in healthy, adult zzso These new mandatory zzso comprise the fractional and zzso distribution of the contraction modes per repetition, duration of one repetition, rest zzso zzso time under tension, muscular failure, range of motion, recovery time, and anatomical zzso We strongly recommend to zzso the design and description of all future resistance exercise investigations by using the zzso proposed set of 13 zzso zzso zzso and new zzso
