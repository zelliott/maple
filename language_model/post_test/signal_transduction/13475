zzso has been shown to be a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The diversity of zzso actions is due to the existence of several different zzso zzso In this study we report the cloning of a full-length zzso coding for a novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein bears the characteristics of G zzso zzso It shares zzso and zzso of its zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso was zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso binding analysis indicated that the order of zzso of various drugs for the zzso of zzso binding was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso isolated from different zzso indicated that this zzso is expressed in the zzso and in bag zzso The expression of zzso restricted to the zzso suggests an important role for this zzso in the zzso of zzso functions in zzso Moreover, the high expression of zzso in the bag cells, associated with its pharmacological profile, suggests that this zzso may be implicated in modulating the zzso during the zzso zzso
