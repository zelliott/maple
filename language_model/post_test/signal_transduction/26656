The evolution of cancer cells involves deregulation of highly regulated fundamental pathways that are central to normal cellular architecture and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was initially identified as a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies uncovered a variety of new functions for this zzso in growth factor and steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso cell survival, zzso zzso and gene transcription, largely through systematic discovery of its zzso zzso relevant zzso zzso is widely zzso in several human zzso such as zzso cancer, and is intimately linked to tumor progression and therapeutic zzso These exciting developments combined with the zzso role of zzso zzso signaling in cancer cells elevated zzso as an attractive drug zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed the precise mechanism of zzso zzso offering the possibility to develop zzso cancer therapeutic zzso In addition, emerging reports suggest the potential of zzso and its specific zzso zzso as cancer zzso zzso Here, we zzso recent findings about the zzso molecular pathways in human cancer and discuss the current status of zzso zzso zzso
