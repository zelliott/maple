zzso zzso are a unique class of plant steroid hormones that orchestrate myriad growth and zzso zzso Although zzso have long been known to protect plants from a suite of zzso and zzso zzso our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still zzso zzso to further decipher the molecular logic of zzso zzso we have examined the dynamics and impact of zzso during infection of rice zzso zzso with the root zzso zzso zzso zzso the prevailing view that zzso positively regulate plant innate zzso we show that zzso zzso exploits zzso as zzso factors and hijacks the rice zzso machinery to inflict zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that this zzso effect of zzso is due, at least in part, to negative cross talk with salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso defenses occurred downstream of zzso zzso but upstream of the master defense regulators zzso OF zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso alleviated zzso immune responses by interfering at multiple levels with zzso zzso resulting in indirect stabilization of the zzso protein and central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these data favor a model zzso zzso zzso zzso the plant zzso zzso as a decoy to antagonize zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results highlight the importance of zzso in modulating plant immunity and uncover zzso manipulation of plant steroid zzso as a core zzso zzso
