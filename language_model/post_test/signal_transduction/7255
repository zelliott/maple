zzso zzso cells zzso are zzso zzso that are recruited to vessels and secret zzso zzso and thus actively involved in pathological zzso during liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a switch zzso controlling zzso zzso We investigated zzso regulation of zzso signal zzso and the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso rat zzso and liver zzso zzso cells zzso were isolated and used in this zzso zzso chamber and zzso zzso identified that focal zzso zzso zzso signaling activated by zzso growth factor zzso was required for zzso zzso and the associated zzso zzso also zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression and zzso zzso through signals zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso of zzso interrupted zzso zzso and zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso evidence further revealed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso properties was dependent on zzso of zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso inhibited zzso signal zzso through zzso of zzso zzso leading to reduced zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and thereby attenuated zzso zzso zzso could be a molecular target for preventing vascular zzso in zzso zzso
