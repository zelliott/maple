zzso zzso a greater neurodegenerative effect in male versus female zzso In order to investigate this sex difference we studied the involvement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in methamphetamine toxicity as a function of time zzso (30 zzso 1 and 3 zzso zzso decreases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specific binding in the zzso zzso were similar in female and male mice when evaluated 1 day zzso (40 zzso At 3 days zzso zzso zzso concentration and zzso specific binding continued to decline in zzso whereas females showed a recovery with increases in zzso content and zzso specific binding in zzso zzso at day 3 versus day 1 zzso The reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 specific binding observed at 1 and 3 days zzso showed neither a zzso nor zzso zzso Under the present experimental conditions, methamphetamine treatments had modest effects on zzso markers measured in the zzso zzso zzso assessed by Western blots showed similar reductions in both female and male mice for zzso proteins at 1 and 3 days zzso An increase in the zzso of zzso zzso (after 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (at 1 and 3 zzso and zzso (30 zzso zzso was only observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels were zzso in both females and males at 3 days zzso These results reveal some of the zzso and zzso effects of methamphetamine toxicity on zzso markers and suggest some of the signaling pathways associated with these zzso
