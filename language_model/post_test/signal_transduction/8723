Reliable signal zzso via zzso receptors requires proper zzso zzso For example, signals originating from single zzso molecules vary little from one to the next, requiring zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso We determined how reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso influenced the zzso and zzso of the zzso responses of mouse rod zzso These experiments revealed that zzso in addition to its role in zzso the activity of zzso can tune the zzso of zzso zzso by competing with zzso This competition influenced the zzso of the active lifetime of zzso zzso the competition in favor of zzso revealed that zzso remained active through much of the zzso response under the conditions of our zzso This long-lasting zzso activity can explain the characteristic time course of zzso response zzso Indeed, explaining the late zzso of the zzso required an active lifetime of zzso approximately twice that of the zzso zzso Competition between zzso and zzso may be a general means of influencing signals zzso by zzso zzso particularly when zzso of a few receptors produces signals of functional zzso
