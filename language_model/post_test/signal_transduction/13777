The zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to inhibit the proliferation and to induce the zzso of cancer zzso However, the zzso effect of the zzso on cancer cell invasion is zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso properties of four zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso of zzso and zzso reduced the zzso of zzso cells to 45 and zzso respectively, whereas zzso and zzso had a negative zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso had no effect on cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso that play an important role in cancer cell zzso zzso from zzso and western zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso comparatively reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in a zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso had no effect on the activity of zzso zzso and zzso We also found that zzso and zzso reduced the nuclear zzso and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor zzso B zzso which is the expressed zzso of zzso degradation zzso These findings demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell invasion by the reduction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possibly by targeting of zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso
