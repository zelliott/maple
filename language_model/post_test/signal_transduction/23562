We have shown zzso that mice lacking tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso exhibit greater zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be protective in zzso acid zzso zzso Here, we aim to clarify the role of zzso in neurodegenerative disorders and to zzso its potential signaling zzso zzso knockout zzso mice and zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso and, seizure severity measures zzso zzso tests, including zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso Five days following zzso treatment, zzso methods were used to assess zzso zzso and zzso zzso The production of zzso oxide zzso and the expression of nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso were also zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso zzso mice were more susceptible to zzso zzso as demonstrated by more severe seizures, measurable behavior changes, greater zzso zzso in zzso elevated zzso zzso and NO zzso Additionally, zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso mice to a greater degree than in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso adversely influences zzso zzso and that zzso may play a protective role in zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso signaling zzso
