The zzso cellular composition of the zzso zzso collecting duct enables regulation of fluid, zzso and zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism of its development has yet to be zzso The zzso signaling zzso is involved in cell fate determination and has been implicated in zzso patterning in the zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso signaling in zzso collecting duct development, we generated mice in which Mind zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso required for the initiation of zzso zzso was specifically zzso in the zzso bud of the developing zzso Mice lacking zzso in the zzso collecting duct displayed increased urinary production, decreased urinary zzso progressive zzso sodium zzso and a severe urinary concentrating zzso zzso as zzso diabetes zzso zzso analysis revealed a diminished number of principal cells and corresponding increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso domain reversed the altered cellular composition of zzso zzso collecting zzso with principal cells occupying the entire zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso signaling is required for the development of the zzso zzso collecting duct and principal cell differentiation and indicate that zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso
