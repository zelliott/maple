zzso of zzso proteins has been associated with a more aggressive clinical outcome in prostate zzso However, their role and regulation by upstream zzso pathways in response to zzso radiation has remained zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso activity in prostate cancer cells is dependent on the activities of zzso and zzso While zzso of zzso is associated with suppression of zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppresses expression of several zzso zzso and zzso and also zzso prostate cancer cells to zzso The importance of zzso as a zzso of proliferation and radiation responses is demonstrated by the findings that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells suppress these cellular zzso Together, the findings show that zzso activity in prostate cancer cells mediates zzso and zzso zzso is essential for their zzso and zzso protection against zzso cell zzso Thus, its zzso would be a lucrative target for therapy in this widely increasing cancer zzso
