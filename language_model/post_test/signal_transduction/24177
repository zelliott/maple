zzso zzso has received particular attention in the zzso of cervical cancer, although the underlying mechanism remains zzso This study revealed that zzso promotes in zzso tumor growth of human cervical cancer zzso cells, but does not substantially alter their in zzso growth zzso The in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso increases zzso activity in human cervical cancer cells, an effect that is specifically associated with zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso Also, using zzso zzso to block zzso function significantly inhibited zzso zzso and tumor growth in nude mice, strongly supporting the critical role of zzso in the zzso cervical zzso zzso the signaling zzso downstream of zzso responsible for the regulation of zzso was zzso zzso pharmacological zzso of zzso or zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso Meanwhile, blocking zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso effectively abolished zzso zzso zzso In transient zzso a zzso reporter construct containing the full-length zzso zzso promoter or a zzso zzso lacking the known zzso element also exhibited the same degree of response to zzso Additionally, transient zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso by zzso Based on the above phenomenon combined with the zzso increased tumor expression of zzso and zzso in cervical cancer zzso we conclude that zzso may promote cervical zzso by zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso
