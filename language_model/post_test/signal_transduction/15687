zzso neural crest cells migrate into the zzso region and later contribute to various zzso zzso including the zzso zzso body and zzso After reaching the eye, they initially pause before zzso over the lens to form the zzso Interestingly, removal of the lens leads to premature invasion and abnormal differentiation of the zzso In exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, we find that zzso zzso is expressed in the lens zzso and zzso continuously throughout eye zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso is expressed by zzso neural crest but zzso in a manner independent of the zzso by the zzso that zzso into the eye and gives rise to the cornea zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso expressing neural crest cells remain in the zzso region and contribute to the anterior zzso and zzso blood zzso Introduction of a zzso that zzso zzso signaling results in premature entry of neural crest cells over the lens that zzso lens zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso neural crest migration in zzso Taken together, our data reveal a novel and essential role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso neural crest migration that is vital for proper zzso zzso
