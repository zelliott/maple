The most common form of zzso instability observed in zzso cancer is zzso instability zzso whose molecular bases remain to be zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso in human cells of several components of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso altered zzso zzso To determine the contribution to zzso zzso of zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso we screened 56 primary zzso zzso using quantitative multiplex zzso of short fluorescent fragments, a sensitive method for the detection of gene dosage zzso We found that dosage increase of the zzso gene was a frequent event, being detected in zzso of the tumors, and we show that it is associated with an increase of zzso zzso zzso of zzso on which zzso is located, revealed that in zzso zzso gene dosage increase of zzso can be independent from that of zzso and was more frequent than that affecting zzso Finally, transient zzso of zzso in human cells increased the percentage of zzso zzso Together with our previous results, the present study strongly suggests that deregulation of the zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso
