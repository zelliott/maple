zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso derived from a variety of medicinal plants, exhibits potent zzso activity against many types of cancer zzso However, the zzso mechanism of zzso is not clearly zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso gene expression leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been observed in many zzso including zzso making the zzso gene and zzso zzso a central target for cancer zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso was able to inhibit growth, induce zzso in a human chronic zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso via zzso of zzso gene zzso inhibit zzso zzso activity, change zzso zzso potential and reduce the release of zzso c and the activity of zzso These results suggest that zzso may elicit its strong zzso effects via zzso of the zzso gene and zzso of the zzso zzso
