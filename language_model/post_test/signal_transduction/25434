zzso muscular zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso gene and is characterized by muscle zzso and the occurrence of mental deficits in a significant number of zzso Although zzso and its closely related zzso zzso are present at a variety of zzso little is known about their roles in the nervous zzso Previously, we reported that absence of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso junction zzso zzso synaptic zzso resulting in increased zzso neurotransmitter zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso signaling zzso genetically interacts with zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso and the use of zzso and zzso transgenic rescue versus zzso interference reveal that the absence of zzso zzso results in elevated evoked neurotransmitter zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibits an increased number of zzso neurotransmitter release sites and higher probability of zzso release without apparent changes in zzso zzso zzso numbers or zzso Moreover, we find that decreasing expression of the zzso zzso zzso suppresses the high neurotransmitter release in the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso and the zzso zzso signaling zzso likely interact at the zzso side of the zzso to maintain synaptic zzso The absence of this zzso zzso results in zzso structural and functional zzso suggesting that retrograde signaling mechanisms are zzso
