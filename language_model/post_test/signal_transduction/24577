Because the presence of the zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso has been questioned from studies in zzso cells in culture, we looked for this zzso zzso in suspension of freshly isolated rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a prompt zzso 15 zzso and sustained increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso it zzso a rapid and zzso rise in zzso free calcium zzso with an early peak zzso 15 zzso followed by a zzso The peak was maintained in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rises showed a similar dose dependency, with a 50% effective concentration zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We checked that zzso II inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso production, the latter effect being inhibited by zzso toxin zzso The effects of zzso II on zzso and zzso were inhibited by the zzso II zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and not by the zzso II zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso II on zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and not by zzso zzso In agreement with these results, specific binding of zzso II was markedly inhibited by zzso whereas zzso zzso had no zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are present in intact rat zzso zzso cells and are coupled to both zzso and zzso signaling zzso No evidence for zzso zzso zzso is zzso
