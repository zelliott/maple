The target of zzso zzso signaling zzso is an essential regulator of cell growth in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso controls the expression of many genes involved in a wide array of distinct zzso zzso zzso By exploring the zzso zzso under different growth conditions, we have identified novel zzso zzso including genes required for zzso zzso acid zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso control of zzso gene expression occurs independently from previously identified zzso gene regulators and is instead coupled to zzso protein zzso A zzso Additional zzso expression analyses reveal that zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression in a pattern that is remarkably similar to genes within the zzso protein and zzso zzso genes required for zzso zzso Moreover, this pattern of zzso is distinct from other clusters of zzso zzso zzso which includes genes involved in zzso as well as zzso zzso suggesting that control of gene expression by zzso and zzso involves multiple modes of zzso Our results underscore how multiple signaling zzso general growth conditions, as well as the availability of specific nutrients contribute to the maintenance of appropriate patterns of gene activity in zzso
