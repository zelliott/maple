zzso A zzso is implicated in zzso arthritis zzso zzso We studied whether a novel zzso single domain zzso zzso treatment would zzso the severity of the disease in two different animal models of zzso 

A novel zzso named zzso was screened from an zzso camel zzso library and found to have a high binding affinity zzso zzso for zzso The zzso model and the zzso arthritis zzso in mice were used to evaluate the effects of zzso treatment on inflammation and joint zzso For in zzso analysis, zzso were zzso from zzso fluid and peripheral blood of patients with zzso and were tested for the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Human zzso cell line zzso cells were selected and western zzso analyses were performed to examine the potential signaling zzso 

In the zzso model of zzso the zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in clinical symptoms as well as of joint damage zzso zzso In the zzso model, treatment with zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced cartilage zzso inflammatory cell numbers and zzso production in the implanted zzso zzso zzso It also significantly reduced the levels of human inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso in mouse serum zzso zzso No toxic effects were observed in the two animal zzso In zzso results showed that zzso could counteract zzso zzso zzso and zzso production by interfering with the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly inhibited zzso and zzso erosion in the two tested animal models of zzso Our findings provide evidence that zzso may be a potential therapeutic agent for zzso
