Previous works have shown that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso response element binding protein zzso zzso is essential for long-term zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, the role of the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso evoked field zzso in spinal zzso horn, which is relevant to zzso pain, was investigated in adult zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the protein level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso horn was zzso increased after zzso zzso starting at 15 zzso and returning to control at 60 zzso after zzso stimulation and that the protein level of zzso increased at 30 zzso zzso for at least 3 zzso after zzso zzso Double zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso were only located in zzso but not in zzso cells in the spinal zzso horn after zzso zzso More importantly, we found that spinal application of zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso at 30 zzso before zzso stimulation blocked zzso induction and prevented the increase in zzso and zzso in spinal zzso zzso When applied 15 zzso after zzso zzso zzso reversed established zzso The drug, however, did not affect the spinal zzso when applied at 30 zzso after zzso Our results suggested that zzso of zzso zzso in spinal zzso zzso is necessary for induction and maintenance of long-term zzso of the zzso evoked field zzso
