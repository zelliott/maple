The transformation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso requires progressive zzso zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso Loss of zzso zzso is common in colon cancer but not in zzso zzso A few candidate tumor zzso genes have been identified in this region, including zzso at zzso This study investigates the role of zzso in an in zzso mouse model of zzso zzso and in human colon cancer cell zzso zzso mice were crossed with mice harboring targeted zzso of the zzso gene zzso The zzso tumor burden and tumor expression of zzso and zzso was compared in zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in human colon cancer cells with zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell function in zzso mice were zzso in zzso The mean number of small zzso tumors per mouse was zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, compared with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Fewer zzso tumors were observed in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice demonstrated increased nuclear expression of zzso and an increased number of zzso zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso increased zzso dependent zzso and increased zzso zzso cell zzso Loss of zzso enhances tumor progression in the zzso mouse model and activates the zzso signaling zzso zzso is a tumor zzso gene on zzso zzso in this in zzso mouse model and likely has a similar role in human colon zzso
