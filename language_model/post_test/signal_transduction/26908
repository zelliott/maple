zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso frequently zzso in zzso breast cancer, which comprises most zzso breast zzso zzso the only zzso without established targeted zzso 

In this zzso phase II trial, patients with zzso zzso received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso load then 250 zzso per week zzso zzso alone, with zzso zzso under the curve of 2, once per week zzso added after progression or as zzso therapy from the zzso Response rate zzso was the primary end zzso others included time to progression zzso overall survival zzso and zzso Embedded zzso studies included molecular zzso on archival zzso Fresh tumor tissue before and after 7 to 14 days of therapy was used for zzso analyses exploring zzso zzso activity and zzso 

In 102 patients with zzso zzso were zzso zzso of 31) to zzso and zzso (four of 25) to zzso plus zzso after zzso zzso to those treated from the beginning with zzso plus zzso was zzso (12 of zzso zzso of patients responded or had prolonged disease zzso The zzso plus zzso regimen was well zzso but both zzso and zzso were short at zzso months zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso months zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Of 73 patients with archival tissue for analysis, zzso had zzso molecular zzso Sixteen patients had tumor zzso before and 1 week after zzso zzso patterns of the zzso zzso showed zzso in 13 and zzso by therapy in zzso 

Despite strong zzso data, combination zzso plus zzso in zzso zzso produced responses in fewer than zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that most zzso involved zzso However, zzso blocked expression of the zzso zzso in only a minority, suggesting that most had alternate mechanisms for zzso zzso
