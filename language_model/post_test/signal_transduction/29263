The constellation of human inflammatory zzso disease zzso includes zzso colitis and Crohn's disease, which both display a wide spectrum in the severity of zzso One theory is that multiple genetic hits to the host immune system may contribute to the zzso and severity of zzso However, experimental proof of this concept is still zzso Several genetic mouse models that each zzso some aspects of human zzso have zzso a single gene zzso to induce zzso However, none have produced pathology clearly distinguishable as either zzso colitis or Crohn's disease, in part because none of them reproduce the most severe forms of disease that are observed in human zzso This lack of severe zzso models has posed a challenge for research into zzso mechanisms and development of new zzso We hypothesized that multiple genetic hits to the regulatory machinery that normally zzso immune zzso in the zzso would generate more zzso zzso pathology that would mimic either zzso colitis or Crohn's zzso 

We generated a novel mouse line zzso that possessed defects in both zzso and zzso zzso These mice rapidly and zzso developed a disease resembling zzso human zzso colitis that was quite distinct from the much longer and more variable course of pathology observed previously in mice possessing only single zzso zzso was driven by uncontrolled production of zzso zzso resulting in large part from T cell zzso The disease process could be significantly ameliorated by administration of zzso against zzso and zzso and was completely inhibited by a combination of zzso zzso 

Here, we develop to our knowledge the first mouse model of zzso zzso colitis by combining multiple genetic hits in immune regulation and demonstrate that the resulting disease is sensitive to both zzso therapy and zzso zzso These findings indicated the zzso and zzso pathways zzso to inhibit zzso induced production of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso which are known to play a role in the zzso of human zzso zzso Our findings also provide evidence that zzso antibiotics may have an application in the treatment of patients with zzso zzso This model system will be useful in the future to explore the microbial factors that induce immune zzso and characterize how these interactions produce zzso
