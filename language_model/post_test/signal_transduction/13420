zzso growth factor zzso zzso can act as a tumor zzso or a tumor promoter depending on the characteristics of the zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that colon zzso cells zzso with zzso cellular zzso but not zzso cellular zzso switched from zzso to zzso and also became more invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso and Friedman, zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso growth stimulation of colon zzso cells is zzso and zzso In zzso colon zzso cells, which are responsive to zzso by growth zzso a zzso zzso at zzso was found in the zzso zzso Very little zzso protein was detected in these zzso Loss of zzso protein was confirmed by functional zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso response of the zzso and zzso promoter reporter zzso to zzso zzso initiated by zzso in zzso cells required zzso zzso of zzso zzso Less zzso was associated with zzso small middle zzso complexes in zzso zzso cells, and the zzso complexes had increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels diminished zzso response to zzso zzso cells expressing zzso neither proliferated in response to zzso nor zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso levels and zzso proliferation in zzso cells, which express zzso zzso but no zzso zzso zzso did not activate or inhibit the zzso promoter construct in zzso cells even in the presence of zzso zzso or alter zzso zzso zzso Thus the decrease in zzso levels was zzso by a zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso
