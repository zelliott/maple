We investigated whether zzso induced by zzso therapies zzso tumor zzso Using the zzso transgenic model of zzso breast cancer, we show that administration of zzso radiation or zzso caused increased circulating levels of zzso as well as increased circulating tumor cells and lung zzso These effects were zzso by administration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle T zzso tumor cells did not grow ex zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso is a survival signal in these zzso zzso failed to enhance lung zzso in mice bearing tumors that lack the type II zzso zzso suggesting that the increase in zzso was due, at least in part, to a direct effect of zzso on the cancer zzso These data zzso zzso induced by zzso therapy as a zzso signal in tumor cells and provide a rationale for the simultaneous use of these therapies in combination with zzso zzso
