zzso zzso leads to substantial restructuring of the zzso in zzso zzso The expression levels of approximately one-third of all zzso zzso genes are altered at least twofold when a zzso culture is transferred to fresh zzso Several zzso pathways are known to play a role in this process, but the relative contribution that each zzso makes to the total response has not been zzso To better understand this, we used a zzso approach to block the protein zzso A zzso zzso (target of zzso and zzso transport zzso alone and in zzso Of the three zzso we found that loss of zzso produced the largest effect on the zzso zzso however, many genes required both zzso and zzso for proper zzso zzso Those genes that did not require zzso or zzso for zzso regulation were dependent on zzso transport for either zzso induction or zzso zzso loss of these three pathways is sufficient to prevent virtually the entire zzso response to fresh zzso In the absence of fresh zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso does not induce cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a substantial fraction of the zzso zzso In contrast, the absence of fresh medium strongly limited gene repression by zzso These results account for the signals needed to generate the zzso responses to zzso including induction of growth genes required for protein synthesis and repression of stress zzso as well as the classical zzso repression and zzso zzso zzso
