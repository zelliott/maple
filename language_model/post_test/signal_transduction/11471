Despite an zzso zzso symmetrical appearance, most internal zzso of zzso display considerable zzso zzso asymmetry in their anatomy and zzso The orientation of zzso asymmetry with respect to the zzso and zzso body axes is zzso such that fewer than 1 in 10,000 individuals exhibit organ zzso The zzso orientation of zzso asymmetry is ensured by distinct zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways that are initiated by divergent members of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso During early zzso the zzso protein zzso (or a zzso zzso is expressed by the left lateral plate zzso and provides essential zzso cues to the developing zzso In chick zzso at least, bone zzso protein zzso signaling is active on the right side of the zzso and must be inhibited on the left in order for zzso to be zzso Thus, at a key point in the determination of zzso zzso zzso signaling is zzso by the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso by zzso whereas signaling on the right depends on zzso and zzso (which are regulated by zzso This review summarizes the considerable progress that has been made in recent years in understanding the complex network of feedback and zzso zzso that regulates both the zzso and zzso zzso Also discussed is the problem of how signal zzso zzso by the zzso proteins can pattern zzso asymmetry without interfering with zzso zzso zzso which relies on the same zzso zzso
