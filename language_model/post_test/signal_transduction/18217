zzso zzso species differences in the responses of zzso zzso receptors to repeated application of zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso application of 100 zzso zzso resulted in a progressive increase in current magnitude zzso zzso at mouse and human, but not rat zzso zzso zzso Current growth was thought to reflect progressive zzso of the zzso zzso to a pore permeable to large molecules zzso suggesting that channel zzso was not occurring at the rat zzso zzso However, 100 zzso zzso produced a rapid influx of zzso zzso in cells expressing rat or human zzso zzso zzso There were, however, species differences in zzso potency such that 100 zzso zzso was a zzso concentration at zzso but not human or zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso of zzso or zzso were zzso current growth occurred at rat zzso zzso zzso The rate of current growth and zzso zzso increased with zzso concentration and appeared more rapid at rat and human, than at mouse zzso zzso zzso The potency of zzso and zzso was zzso - 10 fold lower in zzso cells than in cells repeatedly exposed to zzso zzso This study demonstrates that current growth occurs at zzso rat and human zzso receptors but only when using zzso zzso of zzso Previously, current growth was thought to reflect the progressive increase in pore diameter of the zzso zzso zzso channel, however, the results of this study suggest a progressive increase in zzso potency may also zzso
