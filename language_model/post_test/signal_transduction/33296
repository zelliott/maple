We have previously demonstrated that zzso of zzso protein by zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso cells permits growth zzso by zzso Here, we show that the promoter of zzso directly responds to zzso acid zzso zzso and functional analysis of the zzso zzso promoter have identified a direct repeat motif that serves as a zzso acid response zzso zzso of this element resulted in a loss of response to zzso This element is activated by zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso with this zzso Thus, these data define a molecular basis for the zzso between zzso and zzso in tumor growth zzso
