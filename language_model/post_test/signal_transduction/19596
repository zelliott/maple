The generation of new zzso from neural stem cells in the adult zzso zzso zzso contributes to learning and mood zzso To sustain zzso zzso throughout life, maintenance of the neural stem cell pool has to be tightly zzso We found that the zzso zzso is highly active in neural stem cells of the adult mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso in neural stem cells in zzso resulted in increased zzso differentiation of neural stem cells in the adult zzso at an early time point and depletion of the zzso neural stem cell pool and suppression of zzso zzso at a later time zzso Moreover, zzso neural stem cells displayed impaired zzso in zzso and loss of expression of the zzso factor zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso signaling increases zzso promoter activity and zzso expression in adult neural stem zzso In addition, activated zzso and zzso were highly enriched on the zzso promoter in adult zzso neural stem cells, thus identifying zzso as a direct target of zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso of zzso can rescue the zzso zzso in zzso neural stem zzso These results identify zzso pathways as essential regulators of adult neural stem cell maintenance and suggest that the actions of zzso are, at least in part, zzso by control of zzso zzso
