Despite the wide use of plant zzso for zzso purposes, the signals that allow cells to become competent to assume different fates remain largely zzso Here, it is demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso a natural genetic variation from the tomato wild relative zzso zzso increases the capacity to form both roots and shoots in zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presented the opposite zzso reducing zzso on either zzso medium zzso or zzso medium zzso zzso showing zzso in the formation of specific zzso in zzso were the zzso zzso zzso zzso the lateral zzso zzso and the zzso Mouse ears zzso zzso failed to form roots on zzso Me increased shoot formation on zzso and the high capacity for in zzso shoot formation of zzso contrasted with its zzso to form zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso rescued the in zzso organ formation capacity in zzso and zzso double zzso and the ex zzso low lateral shoot formation in pro and zzso Such zzso interactions were also confirmed in gene expression and zzso analyses conducted in the single and double zzso Although Me zzso the high shoot formation of zzso on zzso it failed to increase rooting on zzso and to rescue the zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as controlling a common competence to assume distinct cell zzso rather than the specific induction of zzso roots or zzso which is controlled by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
