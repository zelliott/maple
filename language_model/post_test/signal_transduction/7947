zzso zzso gene I zzso plays a pivotal role in the regulation of zzso production induced by zzso The zzso also zzso the production of zzso and other zzso via an amplification zzso Because the production of zzso is closely controlled, zzso and zzso of zzso signaling also needs strict zzso The mechanism of this regulation, however, remains zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso zzso degradation after zzso to zzso by zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso to zzso a family protein of zzso as well as zzso which is also a downstream protein of zzso signaling that results in suppressing the functions of these zzso Because zzso is enhanced by zzso these functions constitute a negative regulatory loop circuit for zzso zzso
