The zzso signaling zzso is a critical regulator of zzso and zzso differentiation during multiple zzso of cartilage and bone zzso Although the importance of zzso signaling during the process of zzso bone development has been previously appreciated using a variety of genetic models that manipulate zzso in skeletal zzso and zzso genetic evidence demonstrating a specific role for zzso in committed zzso zzso has been less zzso To identify the specific role of zzso zzso in regulating cartilage and bone development, we studied zzso zzso and zzso genetic mouse models using the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso From these genetic models and zzso data, three significant and novel findings were zzso First, zzso zzso signaling promotes zzso zzso possibly involving a bone zzso protein 2 zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso primary and secondary zzso center formation via the induction of zzso zzso possibly through enhanced zzso zzso zzso expression at sites of cartilage degradation, and potentially by enhancing Indian zzso zzso signaling activity to recruit vascular zzso Finally, zzso zzso signaling promotes zzso bone formation possibly via a mechanism in which zzso and zzso zzso signals zzso to accelerate zzso zzso zzso The work presented here supports the concept that the zzso zzso signal is a central zzso for major events during zzso bone formation, including zzso zzso primary and secondary zzso center development, zzso and zzso bone zzso
