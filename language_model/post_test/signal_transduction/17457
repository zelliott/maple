We study the signal propagation in a zzso motif consisting of three zzso zzso Two input zzso receive input signals and the third output zzso generates the zzso We find that a weak input signal can be zzso from the input zzso to the output zzso without zzso zzso We further reveal that the initial states of the input zzso and the zzso strength act as signal gates and determine whether the propagation is enhanced or zzso We also investigate the effect of the input signal frequency on enhanced signal zzso
