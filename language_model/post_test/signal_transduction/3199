A high circulating concentration of zzso 6 is associated with increased risk of coronary heart zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso licensed for treatment of zzso arthritis reduces systemic and zzso zzso However, whether zzso blockade also reduces risk of coronary heart disease is zzso 

zzso the zzso zzso principle, we used single zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso to evaluate the likely efficacy and safety of zzso zzso for primary prevention of coronary heart zzso We compared genetic findings with the effects of zzso reported in zzso trials in patients with zzso zzso 

In 40 studies including up to zzso individuals, an zzso zzso zzso marking a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased circulating log zzso concentration zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as reduced zzso protein zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This pattern of effects was consistent with zzso blockade from infusions of zzso zzso zzso every 4 weeks) in patients with zzso arthritis studied in zzso zzso In zzso coronary heart disease cases and zzso controls, the zzso zzso zzso was associated with a decreased odds of coronary heart disease events zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

On the basis of genetic evidence in human beings, zzso zzso seems to have a zzso role in development of coronary heart zzso zzso blockade could provide a novel therapeutic approach to prevention of coronary heart disease that warrants testing in suitably powered zzso zzso zzso studies in populations could be used more widely to help to validate and zzso novel drug targets or to zzso existing agents and targets for new therapeutic zzso
