zzso is known as an essential zzso protein for zzso receptors zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso forms condensed structures in the zzso However, upon zzso zzso there is little formation of zzso zzso condensed zzso Thus, the formation of zzso condensed structures is tightly zzso but the mechanism and significance of this suppression are currently zzso Here we show that zzso a key regulatory protein of zzso zzso the formation of zzso condensed zzso We found that zzso zzso had already formed condensed structures in zzso cells and that the formation of condensed structures was further enhanced by zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso may not be associated with zzso processes because zzso itself was not zzso and because zzso stimulation did not induce zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso could interact with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased formation of the zzso signaling complex induced by zzso zzso and it enhanced zzso of zzso signaling but not zzso and zzso These findings indicate that zzso regulates the formation of zzso condensed structures through association with zzso and eventually exerts a zzso effect on zzso zzso
