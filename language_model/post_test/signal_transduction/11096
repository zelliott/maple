zzso of the origin and zzso status of zzso or zzso major zzso complex zzso molecules is essential for understanding their zzso zzso Here we show that in normal human T cells, zzso of zzso molecules is turned on upon zzso and cell division and is zzso to the level of zzso zzso showed that a number of proteins are associated with zzso heavy chains at the surface of activated T cells, including the zzso zzso and the zzso tandem zzso associations that rely upon the existence of a pool of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso molecules present at the cell surface are fully zzso mature zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules are zzso zzso and are associated with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso indicated that zzso zzso of the class I heavy chain is probably zzso by a zzso zzso zzso because zzso was found associated with zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso of zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in enhanced release of zzso heavy chains from the cell surface of activated T cells and a slight zzso of cell surface zzso zzso This study provides new insights into the biology of zzso molecules and suggests that zzso zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso
