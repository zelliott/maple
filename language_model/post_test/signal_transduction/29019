zzso zzso 1 zzso gene zzso is the main zzso zzso implied in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this work, we have identified and characterized two new knockout zzso for zzso Both have a dwarf zzso and a delayed zzso At complete maturity, their zzso stems display a zzso decreased zzso level, some zzso in zzso structure with a higher frequency of resistant zzso bonds and a higher content in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso were found for the first time in zzso cell walls and in similar levels in zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso a zzso gene usually involved in plant defense, was increased in the zzso and could account for the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have three to zzso less zzso zzso zzso than controls and accumulate some zzso zzso The same compositional changes occurred in the zzso leaves of zzso zzso By contrast and relative to the control, their stems accumulated unusually high levels of both zzso and zzso zzso as well as more zzso zzso These findings suggest that, in their zzso zzso the zzso plants would avoid the zzso zzso by its zzso to cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and to zzso The formation of zzso zzso to an extent far exceeding the levels reported so far indicates that zzso acid is a potential zzso for the zzso involved in zzso zzso and emphasizes the remarkable plasticity of zzso zzso zzso
