Ras zzso zzso are pivotal to many core cellular processes such as proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso of Ras with a zzso or a zzso zzso is thought to be critical for its membrane binding and zzso signaling zzso zzso of Ras zzso have an zzso effect in some zzso zzso We present a study of the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Ras in three zzso cell types, namely primary adult human zzso zzso primary adult human zzso cells, and a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that Ras is necessary for normal proliferation in these zzso Here we show that Ras is zzso and not zzso in all three cell zzso Furthermore, zzso Ras zzso has no effect on cell proliferation or Ras zzso Although zzso zzso in these cells does inhibit zzso this is through an zzso zzso zzso Ras is able to zzso to the plasma zzso bind zzso when cells are zzso by zzso growth factor or zzso growth factor, and activate the Ras downstream zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso cells, zzso Ras does not need to be zzso to be zzso
