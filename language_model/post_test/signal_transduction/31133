The type I zzso zzso are zzso zzso that regulate many different cellular zzso The major signaling zzso activated by type I zzso involves sequential zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso providing the primary mechanism through which gene expression is zzso Recent work has shown that the responses are quite complex, as shown by different responses to specific zzso of type I zzso zzso of zzso in addition to zzso patterns of zzso of all seven zzso in different cells, and zzso of zzso factors other than zzso The type I zzso use this complexity to regulate many different biological functions in different types of cells, by zzso different specific signals and patterns of gene zzso
