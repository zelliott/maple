Analysis of zzso interaction is one of the powerful methods for zzso the new functions of functionally unknown zzso Using this approach, we isolated two proteins interacting with zzso which was isolated as a new zzso zzso binding protein from zzso One was protein zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and the other was zzso zzso zzso The region of zzso responsible for their interaction was the site preceding to the zzso zzso domain of zzso for zzso and the zzso motifs of zzso for zzso which were determined by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso and zzso was confirmed in zzso by a pull-down zzso a zzso zzso an zzso analysis and a surface zzso resonance zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso and zzso was also confirmed by a pull-down zzso and we found that zzso competitively inhibited the binding of the gamma 2 zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso in zzso Our zzso and behavioral analysis of zzso knockout mice revealed that zzso is essential for the function of zzso zzso especially in response to the agents acting on the gamma 2 zzso
