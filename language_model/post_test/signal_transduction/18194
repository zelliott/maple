One of the key molecules promoting zzso is the zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso or zzso which acts through two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso (or zzso It was shown before that a soluble zzso of zzso zzso can be generated by differential zzso of the zzso zzso This soluble zzso is an zzso to zzso action, reducing the level of free, active zzso and therefore, plays a pivotal role in the generation of vascular diseases like zzso or zzso growth zzso Here we show that zzso is produced by cultured human zzso and zzso zzso cells and a human melanoma cell zzso The soluble zzso is mainly zzso with zzso only zzso remains zzso as free, zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show the time course of total and free zzso release together with its putative zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso from zzso zzso zzso The release of zzso was zzso measured in two different zzso zzso The release of zzso was strongly enhanced by zzso zzso the cells produced up to 22 zzso of zzso after 48 zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was moderately influenced by zzso We also show a zzso increase of zzso expression in cells cultured from zzso a tissue that has a high zzso gene zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso in zzso zzso acts as a sink for zzso zzso and zzso Here, for the first time, to what extent zzso zzso have to be added to compensate for the sink function of zzso zzso was zzso In conclusion, human zzso cells produce high levels of zzso which influences the availability of zzso or related zzso zzso zzso may reduce the zzso binding to zzso receptors and interfere with their signal zzso
