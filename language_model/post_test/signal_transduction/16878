The zzso signaling pathways are involved in zzso damage to the zzso zzso zzso leading to elevated zzso pressure zzso which is a major risk factor for the development and progression of zzso The zzso zzso zzso is elevated in zzso TM cells and zzso and can directly elevate zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to induce TM zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to determine whether expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes is regulated by zzso in cultured human TM zzso Human TM cells were treated with zzso zzso and expression of the zzso genes was examined by quantitative zzso and western zzso TM cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor of the zzso signaling zzso zzso or with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify the signaling zzso involved in zzso induction of zzso protein zzso All five zzso genes zzso and zzso were induced by zzso zzso induction of zzso genes and protein expression was blocked by zzso zzso as well as by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso We conclude that zzso employs both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways to induce zzso genes and proteins in cultured human TM zzso Increased zzso levels may be at least partially responsible for zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso humor zzso resistance leading to zzso
