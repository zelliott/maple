The application of zzso radiation for medical purposes requires the investigation of induced and persistent DNA damages, especially for soft zzso that are assumed to be more effective than higher energy zzso zzso we examined the energy dependent time and dose response of residual DNA damage zzso for soft zzso in comparison to 200 zzso zzso 

DNA damage present in cell line zzso within 48 h after zzso with 10 zzso 25 zzso and 200 zzso photons was zzso by zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 53 binding zzso zzso 

The dose zzso of the zzso zzso revealed significant energy dependent differences with increasing amounts of residual zzso at decreasing X-ray energy independent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso biological zzso values ranging from 4 to 7 were determined for 10 zzso relative to 200 zzso zzso based on the 24 hour dose zzso For 25 zzso zzso ratios considerably higher than one were obtained only for doses above 2 zzso 

The expected energy dependence with increasing DNA damage at decreasing zzso energy was confirmed for the residual zzso zzso measured at different time points after zzso
