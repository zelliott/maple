zzso is induced by transforming growth zzso zzso in zzso and is zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso has been proposed to be a downstream zzso of zzso action in zzso however, the role of zzso in regulating this process zzso By using embryonic zzso isolated from zzso mice, we showed that zzso is required for a subset of responses to zzso zzso zzso expression profiling revealed that zzso transcripts were induced by zzso greater than zzso in zzso zzso of which 345 were not induced in zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso properly induced a generic zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso was reduced in zzso zzso Emphasizing the importance of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso responses to zzso in zzso zzso transcripts were not induced by zzso in zzso zzso and were reduced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, induction of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and type I collagen was significantly diminished in zzso zzso Thus in embryonic zzso zzso is a necessary zzso required for zzso to activate the adhesive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso
