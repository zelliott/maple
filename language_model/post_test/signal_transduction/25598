In the current review, we discuss the role of zzso and zzso signaling pathways and their small zzso regulators in the therapy of inflammatory zzso Considering potential harmful effects directly assigned to the zzso zzso novel zzso biological targets such as zzso and zzso signaling pathways have received a growing zzso Here we zzso recent progress in the identification and development of novel, clinically approved or evaluated small zzso regulators of these signaling zzso as promising zzso zzso In addition, we illustrate key structural modifications and zzso transformations among these zzso to provide a helpful basis for further development of novel small zzso zzso zzso
