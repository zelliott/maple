zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso 23,000 zzso which is zzso in the zzso zzso of tooth zzso We have investigated the zzso signaling reactions induced by zzso using zzso human zzso zzso as target zzso zzso activated with zzso were compared with those treated with zzso plus zzso growth factor zzso and other growth zzso zzso caused a transient increase in zzso zzso zzso and this was accompanied by enhancement of membrane protein zzso C activity, zzso basic protein and zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso levels, and zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso obtained from cells activated with zzso contained several protein bands, which zzso with zzso zzso however, proteins corresponding to a putative zzso zzso zzso were not zzso DNA synthesis induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso in cells treated with zzso toxin but only zzso in cultures exposed to zzso or zzso these values were different from those obtained when zzso zzso or fetal bovine serum were used as zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso caused an increase of zzso chain zzso expression 4 h after zzso zzso However, while zzso was zzso for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of DNA stimulation and experiments with zzso zzso indicated that zzso expression does not contribute significantly to zzso DNA zzso When the stimulation of various signaling pathways induced by zzso and other growth factors was zzso the pattern of stimulation by zzso was different from other growth zzso The characteristic signaling reactions of zzso are likely to be important components of the mechanisms that regulate the formation and zzso of zzso and adjacent zzso zzso
