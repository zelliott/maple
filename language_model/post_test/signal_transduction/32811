After the seminal work of zzso and zzso which established the essential role of the zzso zzso concentration zzso in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction, we have witnessed an explosive zzso of the list of cell functions that are controlled by the zzso In numerous instances, release of zzso zzso stores plays important roles in zzso zzso which displays significant variation in zzso zzso There are two families of zzso release channels, zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso release channels are structurally and functionally zzso In particular, the activity of both types of channels is regulated by the zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso release channel activity provides both types of channels with properties of a zzso signal zzso This function of the zzso zzso is important in zzso muscle zzso zzso whereas that of the zzso zzso seems to be the basis of the generation of zzso zzso Thus the wide variety of zzso zzso patterns seem to be critically dependent on the zzso dependence of the zzso release zzso
