To estimate the effects of space radiation on health of space zzso we aimed to clarify whether zzso at a zzso interferes in a zzso centered signal zzso zzso induced by radiation in human cultured cells and zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments, the human cultured zzso cell zzso cells zzso were examined for cellular levels of zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso after zzso at a zzso (1 zzso or a zzso (1 zzso It was found that challenging zzso zzso was depressed by chronic zzso at zzso zzso for 25 h with the depression of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso experiments, a significant suppression of zzso and zzso induced by challenging zzso at zzso zzso was observed when the mice were zzso chronically at zzso zzso for 25 h in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that chronic zzso suppressed zzso function through zzso signaling and/or zzso zzso
