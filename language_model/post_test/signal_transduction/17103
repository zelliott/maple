Aging is usually associated with a progressive disruption of the zzso balance leading to zzso damage resulting from zzso zzso zzso stress resulting from excessive zzso release is likely implicated in the initiation and progression of motor behavior zzso zzso zzso therapies have received considerable attention in motor behavior defects zzso The nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso binds to zzso response element zzso to induce zzso and phase II zzso zzso under conditions of zzso stress, which reduces zzso stress and zzso of toxic zzso zzso has many zzso and behavioral effects throughout the lifespan and shown to affect motor behavior in adult male rats and zzso zzso However, whether zzso zzso is activated after testosterone administration has not been studied in aged zzso The zzso test and the zzso test as well as the zzso stress zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in brain were examined in aged rats following chronic subcutaneous injections of testosterone zzso zzso Our study showed that chronic zzso supplement significantly ameliorated the decline of balancing reactions and muscular strength associated with zzso zzso stress parameters were zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso at protein or gene levels and the number of zzso cells significantly increased in zzso zzso or zzso zzso after zzso treatment in aged zzso Our findings demonstrated that chronic zzso treatment activated zzso zzso may influence the maintenance of the balancing reactions and muscular strength and reduce zzso cells death in aged zzso zzso zzso supplement have shown for therapeutic strategies in the treatment and modification of motor behavior zzso
