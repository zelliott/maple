The recently cloned gene zzso whose alternative zzso products zzso to the zzso target of the central nervous system zzso zzso enhancing zzso zzso zzso codes for membrane proteins enriched in brain, particularly in zzso The zzso acid zzso domain of zzso zzso interacts with a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein with multiple zzso zzso The zzso terminal zzso domain of zzso appears to have a general cellular growth zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, specifically zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso growth cone collapse, possibly through its interaction with zzso and as yet unidentified zzso zzso Recent results also suggest that zzso expression may induce zzso in tumor zzso Together, these proteins provide new molecular handles for the design of therapeutic interventions for zzso injuries and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as possible leads to zzso zzso
