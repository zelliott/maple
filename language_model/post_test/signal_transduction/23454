This study represents the first report characterizing the biological effects of a zzso zzso immune zzso on a marine vascular zzso zzso was shown to serve as a strong zzso of the early defense response in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Banks ex zzso and was capable of inducing an zzso burst identified at the single cell zzso The formation of zzso oxygen species zzso detected by a zzso fluorescent probe and zzso zzso included a zzso sensitive response, suggesting the involvement of an zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso coding for this zzso was zzso and found to zzso a zzso binding pocket domain with extensive zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso burst zzso zzso zzso The triggered release of zzso occurred at zzso zzso and was zzso requiring a minimal threshold of zzso zzso zzso dissection of the early events preceding zzso zzso indicated that the signal zzso chain of events involved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite exclusively thriving in a marine environment, zzso contain zzso machinery and signal zzso components that appear to be zzso zzso with the zzso defense response systems found in zzso zzso
