zzso zzso cells require interactions with the zzso zzso for their survival, though the mechanism is zzso In long term cultures of primary zzso zzso cells, a zzso basement membrane zzso but not collagen I suppresses zzso indicating that zzso survival signals are specific in their response zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We now demonstrate that the signal from zzso is zzso by zzso and requires both the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a hormonal signal from insulin or zzso growth factors, but not zzso or zzso is necessary to suppress zzso cell zzso indicating that zzso and soluble factors cooperate in survival zzso zzso induced zzso of its zzso whether zzso cells were cultured on collagen I or zzso zzso However, both the zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso and its association with zzso zzso were enhanced in cells cultured on zzso as was the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These results suggest a novel zzso zzso restriction point in insulin signaling in zzso zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso event of insulin zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso zzso but the zzso of downstream zzso requires zzso to zzso Since zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso cell survival, we propose that a possible mechanism for zzso suppression of zzso is through its zzso effects on insulin zzso
