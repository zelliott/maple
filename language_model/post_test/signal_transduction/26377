New data have challenged the convention that the adult zzso cell population is fixed and zzso The zzso cell has two distinct zzso 1) formation of the zzso cords and 2) provision of nutritional and structural support to developing germ zzso For these to occur zzso zzso cells must undergo many zzso changes between fetal and adult life, the main switches occurring around zzso including the loss of zzso activity and the formation of the zzso zzso zzso hormone plays a key role in promoting zzso cell zzso while zzso hormone zzso zzso activity in early zzso zzso Together these regulate the zzso cell complement and zzso output in zzso By zzso the zzso cell population is considered to be stable and zzso by zzso But there is mounting evidence that the size of the adult zzso cell population and its zzso status is modifiable by hormones and that zzso cells can gain zzso ability in the zzso disrupted zzso and human zzso This new information demonstrates that the adult zzso cell population, at least in the settings of zzso zzso in the zzso and impaired fertility in humans in zzso and from mice and men in zzso is not a terminally differentiated zzso Data from the zzso now show that the adult zzso cell population size is regulated by zzso This creates exciting prospects for basic and clinical research in zzso zzso The potential to replenish an adult zzso cell complement to normal in a setting of zzso may now be zzso
