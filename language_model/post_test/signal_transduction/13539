The influence of zzso D3 zzso on zzso zzso responsiveness in cultured zzso cells was studied using a human zzso cell line zzso zzso treatment had no effect on cell growth, cell protein and alkaline zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso in intact cells, but the zzso formation in response to zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxin was attenuated by zzso The response to zzso however, was unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein failed to modify these zzso zzso In cell free experiments, zzso showed similar zzso is, zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity were zzso but zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso treatment had no effect on the zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding protein zzso in zzso zzso According to these results, zzso appeared to change the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso but does not affect zzso zzso and zzso zzso themselves, nor zzso zzso binding zzso
