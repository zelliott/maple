The brain is made of billions of highly metabolically active zzso whose activities provide the seat for zzso zzso sensory and motor zzso The cerebral zzso meets the zzso unusually high demand for oxygen and zzso by providing it with the largest blood supply of any zzso zzso disorders of the cerebral zzso such as zzso vascular zzso stroke and tumors, compromise zzso function and survival and often have crippling or fatal zzso Yet, the assembly of the cerebral zzso is a process that remains poorly zzso Here we exploit the physical and optical accessibility of the zzso zzso to characterize cerebral vascular development within the embryonic zzso We find that this process is primarily driven by zzso cell migration and follows a zzso zzso First, zzso vessels with stereotypical zzso are formed along the zzso surface of the zzso Second, zzso sprouts derived from a subset of zzso vessels migrate into the zzso to form the zzso zzso We find that these zzso sprouts zzso penetrate into the zzso via the zzso centers, where differentiated zzso zzso and that specific zzso are invariably zzso zzso While the anatomy of zzso vessels is variable from animal to animal, some aspects of the connectivity of zzso and zzso vessels occur zzso within particular zzso zzso Using a chemical inhibitor of zzso signaling we determine zzso requirements for this zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso Finally, we show that a subset of zzso vessels is aligned and/or in very close proximity to stereotypical zzso clusters and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso is zzso for the organization and maintenance of these stereotypical zzso clusters and zzso tracts in the early zzso However, the zzso upper zzso lip and the zzso zzso are abnormal in zzso Overall, this study provides a detailed, zzso characterization of early zzso zzso zzso development with cellular resolution up to the third day of zzso This work thus serves as a useful reference for the zzso characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
