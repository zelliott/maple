The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso inactive regions zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso We found that silent zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, indicating that these elements are zzso by silent zzso in their native zzso zzso Because zzso is a requirement for zzso integration into silent zzso would appear to prevent subsequent rounds of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso expression is zzso specific and is zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is also regulated by the zzso response zzso and is induced approximately zzso upon zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso promoter revealed that a 33 zzso region with three perfect matches to the zzso response element is responsible for both mating zzso and zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso by silent zzso can be reversed by zzso treatment, which leads to zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore, is normally zzso by silent zzso and appears to be induced during zzso This is the first example of zzso zzso of a gene that naturally resides within silent zzso
