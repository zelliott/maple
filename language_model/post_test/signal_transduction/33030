zzso zzso of zzso molecules can specify different thresholds of gene activity in zzso A zzso of zzso zzso activity subdivides the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The proteins Short zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required to shape this zzso zzso has been proposed to form an zzso complex with either zzso or the related zzso zzso and is subsequently processed by the zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso appears to be required for zzso formation, which is specified by peak zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso redistributes zzso zzso in a zzso background in which zzso is expressed throughout the zzso zzso activity is diminished near the zzso stripe and peak zzso zzso is detected far from this zzso However, a zzso form of zzso suppresses local zzso activity without zzso zzso activity at a distance, indicating that diffusion of zzso may be required for enhanced zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso The long-distance stimulation of zzso activity by zzso requires zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso does zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso but fails to augment zzso zzso These results suggest an unusual strategy for generating a zzso threshold of zzso activity, zzso zzso and its zzso specify peak zzso zzso far from a localized source of zzso
