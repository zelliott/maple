zzso zzso production during respiratory zzso virus zzso infection in infants is poorly zzso To characterize local B zzso responses, lung tissue and zzso from infants with zzso zzso were analyzed for innate B zzso factors and zzso zzso In lung zzso of infants with fatal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso plasma cells were prominent but zzso T zzso were zzso Type I zzso proteins and B cell zzso factors, including B zzso factor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso in infected zzso In zzso zzso from infants who survived zzso infection, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected at presentation and correlated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso predicted better oxygen zzso We conclude that B zzso factors derived from infected zzso are primary zzso of the zzso zzso response in infant zzso zzso
