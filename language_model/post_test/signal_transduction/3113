The nuclear zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are important in regulating zzso metabolism and inflammatory responses in zzso zzso of zzso zzso key inflammatory response gene zzso Recently, we identified a new cholesterol zzso zzso zzso as a potent regulatory zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we report the effect of zzso and its precursor zzso zzso on zzso activity and on inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso to human zzso markedly increased nuclear zzso and zzso zzso and decreased nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso response element reporter gene zzso showed that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso competitor zzso showed that the zzso for zzso was zzso zzso similar to those of other known natural zzso zzso promoter reporter gene zzso showed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso activities only when zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased zzso expression and release of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso or in the presence of zzso zzso zzso failed to increase zzso and to suppress zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso its precursor zzso a known liver X zzso zzso decreased nuclear zzso and zzso zzso and increased nuclear zzso protein zzso We conclude that zzso acts in zzso as a zzso zzso and suppresses inflammatory responses via the zzso signaling zzso
