zzso damage represents a frequent event in the course of hypertension, ranging from a benign to a zzso form of zzso depending on several factors, that is, individual zzso degree of hypertension, type of zzso and underlying kidney zzso Multiple mechanisms are involved in determination of kidney zzso zzso and zzso injuries in zzso The present review article discusses relevant zzso molecular mechanisms underpinning the promotion of zzso zzso damage, such as the zzso system zzso zzso stress, zzso dysfunction, and genetic and zzso zzso We highlighted major pathways involved in the progression of inflammation and zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fibrosis, thus providing a state of the art review of the zzso background useful for a better understanding of current and future therapeutic strategies toward zzso zzso An adequate control of high blood pressure, obtained through an appropriate therapeutic intervention, still represents the key strategy to achieve a satisfactory control of zzso damage in zzso In this regard, we reviewed the impact of currently available zzso pharmacological treatment on kidney damage, with particular regard to zzso zzso zzso recent findings underscored the ability of the zzso to zzso and to repair tissue injuries through the differentiation of resident embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso process zzso is, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso II zzso zzso as well as future therapeutic strategies targeted to the zzso system, offers interesting perspectives for the management of zzso zzso
