zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and consists of three zzso As one of the major regulators of the class I zzso zzso pathway, it has a key role in the control of cell zzso growth, and zzso Although it has been extensively studied in the nervous system, we have only a faint knowledge of the specific role of each zzso in differentiated zzso Here, we have used both cortical and zzso zzso cultures to zzso their zzso We characterized the expression and function of zzso zzso and some of their zzso along different stages of zzso development using a specific zzso approach to zzso the involvement of each zzso in zzso zzso zzso development, and cell zzso Our results suggest that three zzso zzso show substantial compensation in many zzso However, the disruption of zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso viability and zzso zzso These changes correlated with a tendency to increase in active zzso 3 and a decrease in the zzso of some elements of the zzso zzso Indeed, the decrease of zzso and more evident the zzso of zzso reduced the expression and zzso of zzso All these data indicate that zzso and zzso specifically regulate some aspects of zzso and cell growth in cultured zzso and may contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of zzso death and zzso that show zzso zzso
