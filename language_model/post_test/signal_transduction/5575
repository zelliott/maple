zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified as components of the zzso B cell zzso zzso Gene expression profiles between zzso zzso zzso and zzso B cells demonstrate enhanced expression of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice compared to the zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso is also zzso with B cell maturation into end stage zzso zzso zzso of B cells via zzso of the zzso (but not zzso zzso leads to increased expression of zzso and suppressed zzso zzso In total these data demonstrate that the expression of zzso in zzso resting mature B cells is dependent upon zzso stimulation from the zzso proteins via a zzso zzso and that zzso specific B cell zzso can also elevate zzso expression that is zzso with suppression of zzso zzso
