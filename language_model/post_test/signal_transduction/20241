The orphan nuclear zzso zzso is essential for zzso switches during insect development and metamorphosis regulated by zzso zzso zzso of female mosquitoes of the major zzso of zzso fever, Aedes zzso is zzso because of its dependence on blood zzso zzso is an important hormone regulating zzso events in this zzso however, any role for zzso in zzso zzso events has not been zzso Using zzso interference zzso approach, we demonstrated that Aedes zzso plays a critical role in a timely termination of expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso the major zzso protein zzso It is also important for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of programmed zzso in the Aedes fat body at the end of zzso zzso is critical in zzso zzso zzso and zzso the expressions of which are highly elevated at the end of zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso prior to the first zzso cycle affects a normal progression of the second zzso zzso Most of zzso 24 h post second blood meal from zzso females in the second cycle were small with zzso that were only slightly different in length from of those of resting zzso In addition, these zzso females laid a significantly reduced number of eggs per zzso as compared to those of zzso and the wild zzso Our results indicate an important role of zzso in regulation of zzso zzso switches during zzso cycles of zzso aegypti zzso
