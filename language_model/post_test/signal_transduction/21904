We have shown previously that zzso 1 zzso signaling is not necessary for zzso induced zzso delivery in zzso We now test whether combined signaling of zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso is critical for this zzso 

Female mice lacking the type I receptors for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and normal controls underwent zzso zzso with killed zzso coli bacteria on day zzso of a zzso to zzso zzso zzso delivery rates within 48 hours were recorded and gene expression was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso zzso mice had significantly lower rates of zzso delivery than controls zzso vs zzso with 7 zzso zzso bacteria, P zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso with zzso zzso zzso bacteria, P zzso zzso and significantly lower zzso levels of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso There were no zzso or zzso differences in zzso and lower zzso expression of zzso for a variety of genes associated with cervical zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso signaling plays a critical role in zzso induced labor and zzso zzso production in the zzso zzso gene expression patterns during zzso induced zzso labor suggest fundamental differences from spontaneous term labor in the cervical zzso zzso
