zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most lethal human zzso To investigate the cellular zzso of this cancer, we determined the effect of zzso gene zzso in distinct cell types of the adult zzso We show that a zzso of zzso cells is susceptible to zzso zzso transformation without tissue injury, whereas zzso zzso cells are completely zzso to transformation under these zzso However, chronic pancreatic injury can alter their zzso fate and allow them to serve as the cell of origin for zzso zzso These results suggest that one mechanism by which inflammation and/or tissue damage can promote zzso is by altering the fate of differentiated cells that are normally zzso to zzso zzso
