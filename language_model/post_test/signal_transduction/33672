The dynamic interaction between positive and negative signals is necessary for zzso of zzso structures at the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso an zzso protein essential for zzso zzso In cultured zzso treatment with zzso or zzso of zzso the condition mimicking the zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, inhibited zzso formation of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment promoted zzso of zzso zzso and this effect was prevented by zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Next, we investigated possible mechanisms underlying zzso regulation of zzso zzso in cultured muscle zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso treatment caused a decrease in the protein level of zzso In addition, zzso promoter activity in cultured muscle cells was inhibited by the treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso driven by a promoter that is not responsive to zzso prevented the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso indeed acts to disperse zzso clusters by zzso the expression of zzso The role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso clusters was also investigated in zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso into mouse limb muscles, where zzso zzso or zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso signaling plays a negative role for zzso differentiation at the zzso zzso probably by regulating the expression of synaptic zzso such as zzso
