zzso from innate immune system are activated by the engagement of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso in response to the microbial zzso These receptors are able to recognize either the presence of highly zzso microbial components called zzso molecular patterns or zzso zzso molecular zzso These danger signals are recognized by different types of zzso including the zzso for advanced zzso end zzso This new zzso share both zzso and zzso signaling with zzso receptors and thus may cooperate with each other as essential partners to strength inflammatory zzso This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the zzso of this zzso as well as its role in the context of innate immunity by triggering an inflammatory response when innate immune cells detect infection or tissue zzso
