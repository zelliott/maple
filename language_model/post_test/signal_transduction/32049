Recently it was demonstrated that PO activity is switched by calcium within the typical range of zzso free calcium zzso and zzso Plant Signal zzso zzso zzso The heat stability of zzso is also dependent on zzso Here, a scenario is put forward which assigns calcium a zzso function under zzso zzso are switched off by heat zzso zzso calcium zzso It is assumed that this zzso zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and eventually triggers a zzso cascade of cellular events involving plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may also trigger signal zzso and the formation of systemic responses to many different stress factors in zzso This hypothesis can explain some as yet unexplained zzso
