The ability to separate the zzso of human zzso zzso protein zzso expressed in insect cells using zzso zzso with differences in the zzso point of zzso demonstrating that zzso can be zzso modified and providing support for the use of insect cells as a model system for identifying novel zzso pathways that target zzso One zzso zzso that was reduced in its binding to the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso in its binding to zzso by prior incubation with protein zzso suggesting the presence of a previously unidentified zzso zzso site capable of masking the zzso zzso A synthetic zzso from the zzso domain of zzso containing zzso at zzso inhibited zzso zzso thus identifying the zzso site responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overlapping the zzso zzso were developed that are specific for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso to determine whether direct evidence could be obtained for novel zzso sites in human zzso A zzso zzso highly specific for zzso detected significant zzso of human zzso expressed in insect cells, whereas the relative proportion of zzso modified at zzso was substantially zzso The relevance of these two novel zzso sites to zzso regulation in human cells was made evident by the extensive zzso of human zzso at zzso and zzso in a panel of human breast zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso containing zzso peptides are as effective as the zzso zzso at reducing zzso zzso double minute 2) protein zzso indicating that the functional effects of these zzso events might be to regulate the binding of zzso proteins to zzso These results provide evidence in zzso for two novel zzso sites within zzso at zzso and zzso that can affect zzso zzso interactions and indicate that some human zzso might have amplified one or more zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
