zzso is a zzso modification that regulates protein degradation and signaling in zzso Although it is acknowledged that pathogens exploit zzso to zzso zzso cells, it remains unknown how microbes interact with the zzso machinery in medically relevant zzso Here, we show that the zzso machinery is present in the tick zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso named zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso restricts bacterial colonization of this zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso significantly increases tick colonization by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of human zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the really interesting new gene zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso occurs via zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zinc for zzso Taken together, our data define a role for zzso during bacterial colonization of disease zzso
