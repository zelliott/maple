zzso zzso exerts direct zzso effects in tumor cells, triggering either growth arrest or zzso The cellular actions of zzso are zzso through a family of five distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas growth zzso has been reported to follow stimulation of protein zzso zzso via zzso or zzso of zzso channels via zzso in zzso expression systems, the zzso selectivity for signaling zzso has not been zzso The tumor zzso protein zzso and the zzso product zzso regulate cell cycle progression zzso factors zzso or zzso zzso factors zzso The zzso zzso arrest requires induction of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso whereas zzso requires induction of zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso arrest by interfering with the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso We have, therefore, investigated the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cellular zzso in relation to cell cycle progression in zzso cells zzso expressing individual human zzso We demonstrate that zzso is signaled uniquely through human zzso and is associated with zzso zzso change in zzso zzso zzso as well as induction of zzso The induction of zzso zzso occurs rapidly and precedes the onset of zzso We show that the increase in zzso zzso is not associated with the induction of zzso or zzso when zzso zzso becomes zzso suggesting that such zzso does not require zzso arrest and is not zzso zzso These findings provide the first evidence for hormonal induction of zzso zzso zzso via G zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
