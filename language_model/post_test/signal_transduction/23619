zzso zzso levels are often elevated in diabetic zzso To zzso this zzso we investigated the metabolism of zzso in diabetic patients without obvious zzso Study 1 included 119 patients in whom zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured at the time of hospital zzso Study 2 examined 6 patients with markedly elevated zzso levels zzso zzso Their zzso for zzso zzso and serum zzso were calculated using the data before and after diabetes zzso Three diabetic patients with pancreatic cancer were also examined as zzso In Study 1, serum zzso zzso transformed zzso was significantly correlated with zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso On zzso analysis, zzso and zzso but not zzso were significant explanatory variables for serum zzso In Study 2, serum zzso decreased together with zzso and zzso after diabetes zzso The calculated zzso for zzso zzso and serum zzso were zzso days, zzso days, and zzso days, zzso The zzso of serum zzso was longer in the study patients than that reported in patients with zzso zzso By contrast, in the diabetic patients with pancreatic cancer serum zzso showed a marginal decrease after diabetes zzso Taken all together, prolonged zzso of serum zzso may contribute to the increase in serum zzso levels in diabetic patients without obvious zzso
