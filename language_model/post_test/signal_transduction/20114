zzso in the brain alters zzso zzso influences synaptic transmission, zzso synaptic zzso and coordinates firing of groups of zzso As a result, it changes the state of zzso networks throughout the brain and zzso their response to internal and external zzso the classical role of a zzso Here, we identify actions of zzso signaling on cellular and synaptic properties of zzso in several brain areas and discuss consequences of this signaling on behaviors related to drug abuse, attention, food zzso and zzso The diverse effects of zzso depend on site of release, zzso zzso and target zzso population; however, a common theme is that zzso zzso behaviors that are zzso to environmental stimuli and decreases responses to ongoing stimuli that do not require immediate zzso The ability of zzso to coordinate the response of zzso networks in many brain areas makes zzso zzso an essential mechanism underlying complex zzso
