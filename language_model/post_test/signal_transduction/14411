To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso in the zzso cells between layers V and VI in the zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso patch clamp in rat brain slices was zzso 

zzso significantly increased the frequency of zzso in a zzso zzso A selective D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso effects, whereas the D1 zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in the frequency of zzso Moreover, both protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated the effect of zzso on zzso 

zzso elicits its effect on the frequency of zzso on the zzso zzso cells via zzso D1 zzso and is dependent on zzso and zzso signaling zzso
