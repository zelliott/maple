This study reports novel events related to zzso programming of the neuroendocrine zzso To investigate zzso zzso zzso zzso were maintained in long or short zzso that generate zzso states of obesity or zzso zzso expression analysis first identified zzso as a zzso zzso and then further studies using in zzso zzso and zzso revealed that expression levels of several related zzso genes were modulated in response to zzso zzso Genes of the zzso pathway, zzso nuclear receptors zzso and zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso are zzso regulated in the zzso zzso nucleus zzso Their expression is significantly lower in short zzso and parallels body weight zzso Studies in zzso zzso confirm that the zzso zzso rhythm is necessary for these seasonal changes, and studies in zzso zzso reveal that these changes in gene expression are not the secondary consequence of zzso changes in steroid zzso Comparative studies using Syrian zzso which show divergent seasonal body weight responses to zzso zzso when exposed to short zzso showed a distinct pattern of changes in zzso gene expression in the zzso in response to a change in zzso We zzso that the zzso may be an important zzso center for zzso control of seasonal physiology and suggest that the changes in zzso X zzso gamma expression may be associated with seasonal changes in body weight and energy zzso
