The zzso A of the insulin zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso because it binds both insulin and zzso zzso zzso by zzso plays a role in development, but its zzso role in adults is zzso zzso signaling through zzso is zzso in cancer and favors tumor zzso We hypothesized that zzso binding to the zzso elicits a unique signaling zzso In order to obtain an unbiased evaluation of zzso zzso zzso involved after zzso and insulin zzso we performed quantitative zzso of zzso zzso recruited to zzso protein complexes using stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture in combination with zzso zzso pull down and mass zzso Using cells expressing only the human zzso and lacking the zzso zzso we identified 38 zzso zzso Only 10 were known zzso zzso whereas 28 zzso were not previously related to zzso zzso Eleven zzso were recruited by stimulation with both zzso two equally recruited by zzso and insulin, three more strongly recruited by zzso and six more strongly recruited by zzso Moreover, 14 zzso were recruited solely by zzso and 13 solely by insulin zzso Interestingly, zzso domain zzso involved in cell migration and tumor zzso and zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso signaling upon zzso zzso were predominantly activated by zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso by zzso elicits a unique signaling zzso that may play a distinct role in physiology and in zzso
