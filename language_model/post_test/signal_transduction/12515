The advent of large scale sequencing methods has enabled analyses of the zzso parts of cancer zzso to find the zzso genes that cause common human zzso zzso zzso analyses of human tumors originating in the breast, zzso brain, and zzso have revealed zzso landscapes composed of a few frequently zzso genes alongside a multitude of infrequently zzso zzso These analyses have revealed a stark zzso in the compendium of zzso genes even among tumors of the same tissue origin, and provide evidence for a larger number of driver zzso during zzso than zzso zzso From the multitude of zzso zzso a limited number of central molecular pathways are zzso Systems biology approaches will be increasingly important to identify and better define these core zzso zzso of genetic zzso zzso methods for prediction and experimental determination of the zzso of zzso zzso and pathways will be instrumental for improved zzso understanding of cancer as well as future drug discovery zzso
