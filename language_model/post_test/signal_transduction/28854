zzso of the zzso signaling zzso occurs in several types of zzso and thus it is an attractive target for zzso drug zzso To identify compounds that inhibit this pathway, we screened a chemical library using a zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso a compound that suppresses both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and shows structural similarity to zzso a known zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso activity is reduced in cells carrying a deletion of the zzso zzso as well as by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment of the zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso and zzso Its repression of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso is linked to zzso unique capability to inhibit the zzso signaling zzso The zzso effect of the compound observed on some transformed colon lung and liver cell lines is suggestive of its potential therapeutic value in the treatment of zzso
