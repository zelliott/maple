To extend our previous report, which showed the production of the zzso oxygen species zzso after the zzso zzso in the B cells, we further examined the possible mechanisms for zzso production and the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our research shows that the stimulation of zzso 231 B zzso with zzso induced zzso production and zzso zzso An zzso zzso or an inhibitor for zzso zzso blocked both of these, but the zzso for zzso did zzso We also show that the treatment of cells with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso production and zzso zzso In addition, when zzso with a dominant negative form of either zzso zzso or the zzso factor zzso 3, the zzso 231 B cells did not show a full response to the zzso stimulation to produce zzso zzso association studies further revealed that the zzso association with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso of zzso may possibly be responsible for the production of zzso by zzso stimulation in zzso 231 B zzso zzso these data suggest that the zzso zzso production by zzso zzso in zzso 231 requires the role of zzso as well as activities of zzso and zzso
