There is evidence from in zzso studies that inflammatory zzso influence the release of stress hormone via direct effects on the adrenal zzso however, the mechanisms underlying these effects in the intact zzso are zzso Here we demonstrate that systemic inflammation in rats zzso by zzso injection of zzso results in dynamic changes in the adrenal immune cell population, zzso a rapid depletion of zzso cells in the inner cortical layer and the recruitment of immature cells to the outer zzso These changes are accompanied by an induced production of zzso and zzso zzso type 1 as well as zzso and zzso zzso E zzso in these cells, zzso local zzso zzso zzso production in the zzso which also displayed zzso zzso receptors of zzso 1 and 3 in the zzso and zzso The zzso expression was also induced by zzso zzso zzso and was in both cases attenuated by zzso zzso zzso consistent with an zzso signaling zzso zzso similarly induced expression of zzso but the zzso expression was, in contrast, further enhanced by zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate a mechanism by which systemic inflammatory agents activate an zzso regulated local signaling circuit that may influence the zzso response to immune stress and may help explain the zzso between plasma levels of zzso and zzso during chronic immune zzso
