Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso are neurodegenerative diseases, their agents usually replicate and accumulate in zzso zzso long before infection spreads to the central nervous system zzso Studies of a mouse zzso model have shown that mature zzso zzso cells zzso which express the host prion protein zzso are critical for replication of infection in zzso zzso In the absence of mature zzso the spread of infection to the zzso is significantly zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso by zzso is important for maintaining zzso networks, and signaling is zzso through zzso zzso 1 zzso expressed on zzso and/or their zzso A treatment that blocks zzso signaling leads to the temporary zzso of mature zzso raising the hypothesis that a similar treatment would significantly delay the peripheral zzso of zzso Here, specific zzso of the zzso signaling zzso was achieved through treatment with a fusion protein consisting of two soluble human zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso portion of human zzso zzso zzso A single treatment of mice with zzso before or shortly after zzso injection with the zzso zzso strain significantly delayed the onset of disease in the zzso and reduced the early zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso These effects coincided with a temporary zzso of mature zzso within 5 days of zzso zzso We conclude that treatments that specifically inhibit the zzso signaling zzso may present an opportunity for early intervention in peripherally transmitted zzso
