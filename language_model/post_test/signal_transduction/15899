We examined the role of zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso an important zzso of airway zzso in zzso human lung zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso increased after a zzso exposure, and zzso protein increased after a zzso exposure to zzso zzso Both remained elevated at zzso however, no change was observed in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso a major product of zzso zzso increased in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also increased after zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly suppressed by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and mildly suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly suppressed zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso expression in zzso cells in a manner that is dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso Although a marked induction of zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso expression using short interference zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso expression by zzso is zzso
