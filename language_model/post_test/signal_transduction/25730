The appropriate regulation of zzso zzso is critical for maintaining host defense and limiting zzso zzso zzso zzso express a number of zzso zzso zzso that regulate signaling pathways leading to zzso One of the most highly zzso but least zzso zzso in zzso is zzso rich zzso 2 zzso By zzso to the related focal zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in regulating zzso zzso and zzso however, its zzso function has yet to be zzso Using zzso mice, we found that this zzso was required for zzso zzso responses, but was not involved in zzso cell spreading or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso reduced migration on zzso zzso The absence of zzso resulted in a severe reduction in zzso and zzso zzso following zzso zzso which likely accounts for the poor zzso and cell zzso zzso mice were unable to efficiently clear infection with zzso zzso in a skin zzso model, zzso in part to the poor release of zzso contents at the site of zzso However, zzso zzso responded normally to soluble zzso demonstrating that this zzso functions mainly in the zzso zzso These data demonstrate the unrealized zzso role of this zzso in regulating the zzso release of zzso zzso zzso
