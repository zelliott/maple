Renal zzso is the major zzso in progression of acute and chronic kidney zzso zzso growth zzso zzso has been shown to be an important zzso of progressive zzso Several studies have implicated that zzso is involved in the tight balance of survival and zzso responses in zzso that are zzso or zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso another member of the zzso zzso has to date been involved primarily in kidney development and was described as an active blocker of zzso zzso zzso Here, we zzso the direct effects of these two zzso on zzso We describe their involvement in zzso survival and zzso pathways with the potential to modify the critical steps in zzso zzso zzso Our group has analyzed the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and we describe zzso as a zzso factor that could antagonize zzso zzso zzso In addition, we identified various zzso and zzso zzso that can influence this sensitive zzso On the basis of our work and the work of others we conclude that the balance of zzso and zzso signaling and involvement of zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso are important parts of zzso physiology and zzso
