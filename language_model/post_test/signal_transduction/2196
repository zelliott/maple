This paper describes the design and synthesis of compounds belonging to a novel class of zzso zzso which are potent and selective delta zzso zzso zzso modeling studies performed on known, selective delta zzso such as zzso and the potent delta zzso zzso 80 led to the identification of the zzso zzso of the latter as a putative zzso delta zzso zzso of this zzso onto the zzso zzso message resulted in zzso a potent and selective delta zzso The active zzso zzso displayed zzso affinity for the delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with good zzso and zzso binding selectivity ratios zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso behaved as a full delta zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso having an zzso zzso 25 zzso and being zzso in the presence of 30 zzso zzso zzso These studies, based on the zzso concept, indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is a viable alternative to the classical zzso ring as a delta zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies showed that zzso produced a zzso zzso in the mouse abdominal zzso test after zzso administration zzso zzso zzso zzso
