zzso evidence implicates the zzso zzso protein zzso as a molecular switch capable of signaling cell survival or death in response to zzso zzso zzso activity is determined by zzso selection at its zzso whereas recruitment of zzso triggers zzso zzso zzso recruitment of zzso activates zzso zzso via zzso zzso However, it remains unclear how zzso selection, and thus fate decision, is regulated at the zzso zzso We show that the zzso functions in the zzso zzso response to DNA damage, a zzso zzso zzso antagonized by zzso In this pathway, zzso zzso zzso on zzso within the zzso This zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to bind zzso or activate zzso and engages zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso enables a zzso switch through which cells elect to survive or die upon DNA zzso
