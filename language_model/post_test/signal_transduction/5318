zzso often relies on cancer cell death resulting from DNA zzso The zzso tumor zzso zzso that is an important player in DNA damage response is frequently zzso in zzso zzso also activate DNA zzso stress pathways and activity of zzso signaling and adhesive interactions with the cancer zzso can have a strong impact on zzso Here, we have investigated how two different zzso zzso the response to zzso in the context of two classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing either zzso or zzso zzso in which zzso activity is zzso undergo zzso arrest but show little zzso after treatment with zzso or other zzso The zzso response is strongly enhanced by the zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso whereas such zzso is reduced when these cells are engineered to express zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fails to zzso regardless of the zzso expression zzso The enhanced sensitivity induced by zzso in the context of zzso zzso does not rely on zzso DNA damage signaling but instead involves increased zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso Our data zzso that the expression profiles of zzso and zzso strongly affect the response to zzso and may thus determine the efficacy of zzso
