zzso and zzso are zzso activated and nuclear in zzso zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso are only zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso virus zzso and in particular the protein zzso contributes to sustained zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, we examined zzso activity in two sets of paired cell lines, zzso an zzso zzso cell line, zzso the zzso cell line zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso infection was associated with a significant increase in the zzso forms of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This effect correlated with zzso zzso since zzso zzso and zzso levels were also increased in zzso cells relative to the control zzso zzso No change was observed in zzso or zzso zzso in these cell lines, nor was there a significant change in the levels of total zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the normally zzso zzso proteins to enter the nucleus and bind to their recognition sequences in responsive zzso The ability of zzso to activate zzso was further established by zzso zzso in which zzso of zzso in zzso cells was sufficient to mediate nuclear zzso of zzso and by an zzso mobility shift zzso which showed that zzso expression in zzso cells was associated with increased zzso zzso DNA binding zzso In addition, the activity of a downstream target of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso zzso A linkage was established between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso levels in zzso cells, and conversely, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The previous observation that zzso activated the zzso terminal repeat promoter in reporter zzso was extended to show zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells zzso with a zzso activated zzso A model is proposed in which zzso infection of an zzso cell containing activated zzso would permit zzso zzso This in turn would establish a positive feedback loop of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and viral zzso zzso
