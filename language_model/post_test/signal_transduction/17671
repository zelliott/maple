Many marine animals track odor zzso to their zzso Although studies of zzso behavior have been performed in zzso flow, zzso animals such as crustaceans live in coastal zzso characterized by zzso We compared signal encounters by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso flow in a zzso zzso are small enough that we can study their natural behavior in a zzso They sample zzso by flicking their zzso A thin sheet of laser light illuminating an odor plume labeled with dye zzso laser induced zzso zzso zzso permitted us to measure the instantaneous odor concentration encountered by the zzso zzso zzso zzso while it tracked the zzso We simultaneously measured behavior and the high-resolution odor signal at the spatial and zzso scale of the zzso We found that the navigating animal encountered odor filaments more often in zzso flow than in zzso zzso zzso filaments along the zzso zzso were significantly wider and of higher concentration in waves than in zzso zzso
