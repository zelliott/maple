Cellular zzso in addition to serving as structural constituents of cells, also provide precursors for a number of chemical zzso involved in zzso signal zzso This includes the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso of protein zzso C zzso Changes induced in the fatty acid profile of zzso can influence vital zzso processes in zzso Such changes, independent of the function of fatty acids as zzso and zzso zzso can alter the development and regulation of immune zzso In this report we study the effects of the zzso fatty acids zzso on proliferation and signal zzso in the zzso zzso zzso T cell line zzso Culture of zzso cells in the presence of specific zzso resulted in their incorporation into the cellular zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells was markedly suppressed in a zzso fashion by incubation in media supplemented with zzso acid (an zzso zzso slightly inhibited zzso while zzso acid (an zzso zzso had no zzso Neither zzso (a zzso zzso nor zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso reversed the effect of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso manner, the zzso effect of zzso This study presents evidence that zzso alter signal zzso in cells in a manner which is separate from their function as zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a potent zzso effect on zzso T cell proliferation and may alter signal zzso by modification of second zzso or zzso zzso
