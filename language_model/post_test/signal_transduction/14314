zzso zzso is one of the main active principles in traditional herb zzso and has been reported to have a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, so the present study aimed to observe the effects of zzso zzso on zzso stress signaling pathways in high zzso zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso labeling and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso with 50 zzso high zzso for 72 h decreased cell viability and increased the number of zzso cells whereas treating zzso with 1 zzso zzso for 72 h protected the zzso against high zzso cell zzso Further molecular mechanism study demonstrated that zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso proteins including protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso induced by high zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited both the zzso of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and the disruption of zzso membrane potential induced by high zzso In addition, the high zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso stress, zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction can also be attenuated by the inhibitor of zzso stress zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso may protect zzso against high zzso cell injury through zzso zzso signaling zzso as well as zzso stress and zzso zzso
