zzso zzso zzso was found to increase the respiratory zzso zzso zzso although the molecular mechanisms of this process remain zzso We attempted to determine the signal zzso zzso through which zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso of zzso zzso zzso promoter which had been cloned into the zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso By measuring the zzso activity, we were able to evaluate the zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso The involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso To confirm the involvement of nuclear zzso zzso we used zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was confirmed by zzso 

zzso increased the zzso activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The increased zzso activity of the zzso promoter by zzso was found to be associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso binding sites from the zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso decreased the zzso activity after zzso zzso Among the zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso were involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso increased zzso zzso An zzso zzso revealed that zzso induced zzso zzso 

These results indicate that human zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso
