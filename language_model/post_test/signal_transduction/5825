Emerging evidence indicates that vascular zzso growth factor zzso plays a critical role in host inflammatory responses in several disease states, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we determined the effect of zzso on zzso induction of zzso zzso and investigated the responsible signal zzso By using a zzso zzso array that detects the end point protein products released from zzso cells zzso we found that zzso via zzso zzso 2 zzso predominantly induced the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso among 36 zzso in the zzso The production of these inflammatory zzso by zzso was much stronger than the induction of cell zzso zzso in zzso We further found that the zzso production by zzso was essentially zzso by the zzso protein zzso D zzso family zzso zzso the zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited approximately zzso zzso or 37% by zzso zzso (more than zzso zzso with three small interference zzso that target different zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and markedly inhibited the zzso production by zzso in zzso Our results indicate that zzso via zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso but not in zzso which may offer new insights into the mechanism of the zzso activity of zzso
