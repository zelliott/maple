The zzso of zzso zzso T cells by normal zzso zzso cells in zzso or zzso mixed cell culture systems has significant implications for the regulation of zzso immune zzso In this study, we found that the capacity of zzso cells to induce zzso zzso T cell zzso appeared to be linked to the binding of zzso molecules on the T cell zzso This appears to be zzso by a zzso I zzso expressed on the zzso cell surface, which binds to zzso and results in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an early event (in contrast to zzso and is essential for T cell zzso since proliferation could be completely zzso by zzso of T cells with zzso or zzso both of which are protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of T cells with zzso or of zzso zzso cells with an zzso cell zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and further confirmed that zzso on the T cell and a zzso zzso on the zzso cell were involved in this T cell zzso zzso The specificity of this reaction was confirmed in experiments in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressing zzso or zzso respectively, were zzso zzso of zzso with zzso cells but not with zzso activated zzso in this cell line, whereas zzso was zzso activated in zzso cells when zzso were used as the zzso zzso Although stimulation through zzso and zzso zzso was important for zzso zzso T cell zzso T cell proliferation could not be induced by zzso zzso alone with zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that a second zzso possibly through the T cell zzso zzso since zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso was also seen, is required for zzso zzso T cell zzso
