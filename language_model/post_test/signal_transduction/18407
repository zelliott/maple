In our in zzso model of human cell zzso normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso with human zzso type 16 DNA zzso progress toward zzso through several zzso defined and zzso zzso that include zzso growth factor independence zzso differentiation resistance zzso and ultimately zzso zzso While zzso are very sensitive to growth zzso by zzso acid zzso at early passages, they lose their sensitivity to zzso during progression in zzso However, gel mobility shift zzso using the zzso response elements zzso and zzso showed no changes in binding activity of nuclear extracts obtained from zzso at different stages of in zzso zzso Similarly, Western zzso analyses for zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso X receptors failed to reveal any decreases in the levels of these zzso receptors throughout zzso In addition, zzso activity driven by the zzso promoter with a zzso zzso element was activated following zzso treatment of zzso that were resistant to growth zzso by zzso Since zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso in normal zzso and zzso we investigated whether this response changed during zzso Again, zzso induced zzso zzso in early and late passage zzso zzso and zzso approximately to the same extent, confirming that the zzso signaling pathways remained intact during in zzso progression despite the fact that the cells become resistant to growth zzso by zzso We then investigated the sensitivity of zzso to growth zzso by zzso While early passage zzso were as sensitive as normal zzso to growth zzso by zzso and zzso the cells became increasingly resistant to both zzso zzso during in zzso zzso In addition, while both zzso and zzso produced a decrease in the levels of zzso for the zzso zzso E6 and zzso in early passage zzso this effect was also lost at later stages of zzso Finally, blocking zzso zzso partially prevented zzso zzso of growth and zzso expression in early passage zzso Taken together, these data strongly suggest that zzso of growth and zzso early gene expression in zzso by zzso is zzso by zzso and that a loss of zzso sensitivity is linked to zzso resistance rather than zzso in zzso zzso
