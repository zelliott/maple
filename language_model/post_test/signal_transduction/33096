zzso and growth factor zzso engagement leads to the rapid zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso which then zzso to the nucleus where they regulate zzso events from specific promoter zzso zzso expression in particular has been associated with zzso zzso and zzso transformation of normal zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso B cells that display a propensity for zzso transformation and are the normal counterpart to human chronic zzso zzso Further, zzso cells are characterized by zzso zzso zzso including zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso express nuclear activated zzso which is not expressed by zzso conventional zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is induced in B-2 cells after zzso zzso engagement in a delayed fashion (after 3 zzso zzso of zzso is inhibited by both the zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso drug zzso and requires de zzso protein zzso demonstrating novel zzso between zzso and zzso proteins that differs from the classical paradigm for zzso induction by zzso zzso The inability of prolonged stimulation of conventional B-2 cells with zzso a treatment sufficient to induce zzso zzso to result in sustained zzso zzso suggests that zzso is a specific nuclear marker for zzso zzso Thus, zzso may play a role in B cell zzso signaling responses, and its zzso zzso is associated with a normal cell population exhibiting intrinsic zzso zzso
