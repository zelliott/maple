zzso cells require zzso signals for survival as well as zzso The pathways that zzso these signals, ensuring timely regulation of cell fate zzso remain largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso active zzso of components in Ras signal zzso pathways have been identified as key regulation proteins affecting zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Here we show that expression of zzso is regulated by zzso Ras zzso through both the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso By contrast, zzso levels are regulated through the membrane zzso portion in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso which is shared by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso alone is insufficient to ensure cell survival, indicating that multiple independent signal zzso pathways mediate the survival of developing zzso zzso
