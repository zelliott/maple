zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling can lead to human diseases, zzso multiple layers of zzso control mechanisms to keep its activity in zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso undergo a zzso zzso zzso their key zzso binding zzso To test the role of zzso in zzso zzso we introduced zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso weakened the ability of the zzso to zzso effectively increasing the zzso of zzso zzso capable of binding and zzso their zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in living zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso exhibit reduced zzso zzso resulting in their increased zzso of zzso zzso diffusion and zzso action, as evidenced by the wider zzso area of ex zzso lung cultures in response to implanted zzso zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding and concentration zzso in the zzso zzso Our study is the first to zzso zzso zzso as an zzso mechanism for growth factor zzso and sets the stage for engineering modified zzso zzso zzso with desired activity for use in both basic and zzso zzso
