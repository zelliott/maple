The zzso coli zzso two component zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso modulating important cellular zzso In this report the effect of seven zzso derivatives on the regulation of the zzso coli zzso system was zzso The new compounds were tested for their effectiveness on the expression of the zzso and the regulated zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was the most potent zzso on zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso The induction of zzso by zzso was zzso no effect was observed on the other genes of the system zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to significantly zzso the in zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso without altering the protein levels in the zzso zzso compound appeared to zzso the zzso induction of the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence for a differential zzso role of zzso the zzso two component system zzso zzso
