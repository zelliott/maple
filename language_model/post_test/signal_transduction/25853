The zzso process is characterized by tissue wounding and, after zzso zzso by healing being connected to the formation of a corpus zzso zzso The zzso event thus compares with a sterile zzso The concept is forwarded that the zzso process depends on innate immunity zzso zzso The ultimate trigger for zzso signaling are danger zzso from zzso cells damaged by zzso stress and zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso like oxidized low density zzso zzso are recognized by zzso zzso zzso cells with the expression of zzso zzso 4 zzso The subsequent zzso signaling from the zzso towards the zzso cell layer comprises inflammation and tissue zzso which might be dominated by the zzso differentiation factor 88 zzso zzso zzso or zzso function are expected from the complement cascade for vessel zzso and zzso immigration and the wingless zzso for cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso signaling relates to the repair phase, which is primarily controlled by the zzso zzso protein producing zzso type I zzso gateway of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso system could be zzso The appealing concept of zzso function in the zzso is novel and zzso a novel research zzso
