LDL zzso related proteins 5 and 6 zzso and their zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins essential for zzso zzso likely via acting as zzso zzso How zzso activates zzso to initiate signal zzso is not well zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso which is reiterated five times in the zzso zzso domain, is necessary and sufficient to trigger zzso zzso A single zzso zzso upon transfer to the LDL zzso fully activates the zzso pathway, inducing complete axis zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso We further show that zzso zzso zzso and requires, zzso of the zzso zzso which creates an zzso zzso site for zzso a scaffolding protein controlling zzso zzso Our study identifies a critical signaling module and a key zzso zzso step of the zzso zzso complex and reveals a unifying logic for zzso signaling by zzso growth factors, and zzso
