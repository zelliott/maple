zzso C virus zzso is a zzso virus that also zzso cells of the immune zzso zzso clones cultivated in human zzso zzso cells have significantly advanced our understanding of zzso replication and candidate zzso zzso However, naturally occurring zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso is unable to zzso zzso cells, while it can replicate in human primary zzso and selected zzso zzso To better understand this zzso we examined the zzso of primary zzso zzso and zzso lines to infection with zzso zzso the classical zzso zzso and a cell zzso zzso known to be highly infectious to zzso zzso We also tested whether zzso cells are prone to virus readily infecting zzso The results revealed that while primary zzso and zzso and zzso zzso lines were susceptible to zzso zzso they were resistant to infection with either zzso or zzso However, the zzso clone zzso more firmly, although zzso with the cells than zzso Further, zzso cells robustly supported replication of zzso but not zzso zzso virus, despite using highly sensitive detection zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso clones were unable to establish productive infection in human primary zzso zzso and zzso lines known to be prone to infection by zzso zzso while zzso cells were resistant to infection with naturally occurring virus infecting immune zzso The data showed that the ability to zzso zzso is a characteristic of native virus but not laboratory zzso zzso
