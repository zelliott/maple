There is increasing interest in the potential role of the zzso family of zzso receptors in human zzso These zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are well-known zzso of zzso cell survival and zzso but altered zzso signaling has also been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We recently identified a novel gene fusion involving one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the pediatric solid zzso zzso zzso In these tumors (and subsequently demonstrated in several other human zzso a zzso zzso zzso the 3' portion of the zzso gene with zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso The resulting zzso fusion protein functions as a zzso zzso with potent transforming zzso However, previous studies failed to detect interactions between zzso and molecules known to link zzso zzso to its two major zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of the zzso survival zzso zzso it remains unknown whether zzso transformation involves altered zzso zzso We now report that zzso expression in zzso cells leads to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as to zzso high expression of zzso zzso zzso soft zzso colony formation was almost completely abolished by zzso of either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso dramatically reduced expression of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso transformation involves a link between known zzso signaling pathways and zzso cell cycle progression and that zzso and zzso zzso act zzso to mediate these zzso
