The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso cell surface zzso expressed in a wide variety of human cells being involved in a variety of cell zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cells zzso By means of a zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso we studied the zzso expression of zzso on different normal zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso was distribute in a similar form than in human zzso being present on zzso cells of zzso liver, zzso skin, zzso zzso zzso gut zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso with white matter from zzso and zzso peripheral nerves fibers and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso react strongly with our zzso but zzso and zzso react zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso should play a similar functional role in zzso and human and therefore studies on zzso on zzso as an animal model would allow new knowledge about its role in zzso zzso and tumor zzso among other important biomedical zzso
