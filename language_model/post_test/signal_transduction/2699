zzso growth factors I and II are peptides with a structural zzso for zzso and are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, have different zzso roles, and their mechanisms of action are incompletely zzso We hypothesized that zzso and zzso act by different signal zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso from 200 g male zzso rats were isolated by a zzso zzso zzso technique and zzso at a density of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso incorporation into DNA, and an zzso nuclear labeling index zzso To analyze signal zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were measured 5 zzso after addition of zzso by a zzso zzso zzso used were: zzso (2 zzso zzso (2 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso A summary of the findings is as zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso but not zzso effects are inhibited by zzso and zzso We conclude that the zzso effects of zzso and zzso occur by different zzso zzso is zzso zzso is zzso
