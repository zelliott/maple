zzso and zzso gene regulation play a crucial role in breast cancer zzso However, a functional link between the two major players remains zzso This study reveals zzso as an zzso zzso in breast cancer, which promotes several hallmarks of cancer including enhanced cell zzso migration, zzso and survival in tumor zzso zzso is a direct zzso zzso zzso target and our results suggest existence of a positive regulatory feedback zzso We show zzso as critical zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso details of zzso functions identify several zzso genes like zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso show inverse correlation of zzso zzso enhanced cell proliferation and migration are partly dependent on targeted zzso of zzso Further, functional validation of zzso link suggests a cascade initiated by zzso that zzso zzso in zzso manner to target zzso a global zzso zzso thereby contributing to zzso gene signature to regulate genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in breast cancer progression and zzso Overall, the identification of zzso cascade seems to be a significant zzso in zzso signaling in breast cancer with zzso as zzso zzso
