The zzso zzso family of zzso consists of five members, one of these being zzso The zzso half of zzso contains a zzso domain responsible for zzso binding and membrane zzso The zzso half of the zzso contains zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso and response regulators, signaling motifs originally identified in zzso The role of the His zzso domain in zzso signaling was examined in zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso were introduced into the full-length zzso zzso gene and into zzso a zzso zzso that zzso dominant zzso zzso on zzso The zzso forms of the zzso were expressed in zzso and the transgenic plants characterized for their zzso zzso A zzso that eliminated His zzso activity did not affect the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso A truncated version of zzso that lacks the His zzso domain also zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms by which a truncated version of zzso could exert dominance are zzso
