zzso zzso zzso directed zzso provide an important qualitative modeling approach for Systems zzso They enable the analysis of zzso relationships in cellular networks and can even be useful for predicting qualitative aspects of systems zzso Fundamental issues in the analysis of interaction zzso are the zzso of paths and cycles zzso zzso and the calculation of shortest zzso zzso These zzso problems have been discussed only to a minor extent in the context of Systems Biology and in particular the shortest signed paths problem requires zzso zzso 

We first review zzso for the zzso of paths and cycles and show that these zzso are superior to a recently proposed zzso approach based on zzso zzso The main part of this work deals with the zzso of shortest zzso zzso an zzso problem for which only very few zzso are described in the zzso We propose extensions and several new zzso zzso for computing either exact results or zzso zzso with various concrete biological networks show that exact results can sometimes be obtained in networks with several hundred zzso A class of even larger zzso can still be treated exactly by a new zzso combining exhaustive and simple search zzso For zzso where the zzso of exact solutions becomes time-consuming or zzso we devised an zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in realistic networks (where a comparison with exact results was zzso this zzso delivered results that are very close or equal to the exact zzso This phenomenon can probably be attributed to the particular zzso of cellular signaling and regulatory networks which contain a relatively low number of negative feedback zzso 

The calculation of shortest zzso paths and cycles in interaction zzso is an important method for network analysis in Systems zzso This contribution draws the attention of the community to this important zzso problem and provides a number of new zzso partially specifically tailored for biological interaction zzso All zzso have been implemented in the zzso framework which can be downloaded for academic use at zzso
