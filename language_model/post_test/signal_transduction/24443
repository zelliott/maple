zzso formation is dependent on the ability of zzso to enable zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso commitment of zzso precursors to the zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso enables formation is zzso One possibility is that zzso opposes zzso zzso zzso signals generated by zzso zzso such as zzso The zzso zzso is activated by zzso that induce resistance to zzso formation, such as zzso and zzso and the effect of these is opposed by zzso Recently, a group of zzso factors, termed zzso of zzso signaling zzso has been identified that inhibit zzso zzso zzso we tested the ability of zzso to induce zzso expression in zzso precursors and examined the effect of zzso expression on zzso lineage zzso We found that while zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso express zzso and zzso zzso this zzso Furthermore, zzso rapidly zzso sustained zzso expression in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso plays a role in zzso differentiation we expressed zzso in precursors using a zzso zzso We found that zzso differentiation was significantly enhanced in zzso zzso and zzso expression enables formation in the presence of zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of zzso strongly suppressed zzso formation and significantly blunted the response to zzso Moreover, like zzso zzso expression opposed the zzso effect of zzso These data suggest that zzso expression of zzso may represent a mechanism by which zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso zzso precursors for a role in bone zzso
