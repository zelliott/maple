zzso deformation enhances zzso zzso migration across tissue zzso zzso via zzso but zzso migration across zzso Since cell spreading generally precedes zzso we compared the effects of zzso strain on zzso spreading and migration on zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso and investigated the role of zzso in zzso spreading and zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cells on zzso zzso or zzso were subjected to an average zzso strain at 10 zzso for 2 zzso zzso was inhibited with zzso zzso or zzso was reduced with zzso Parallel studies assessed deformation effects on zzso wound zzso 

zzso zzso or reduction each inhibited spreading on zzso but zzso or reduction prevented further zzso of spreading by deformation without preventing further zzso of zzso zzso did not alter spreading on zzso or zzso but inhibited wound zzso 

Although cell spreading generally precedes and parallels zzso repetitive deformation regulates zzso independently of zzso Since deformation activates zzso the ability of zzso blockade to mimic zzso zzso of spreading on zzso suggests that this effect occurs by a separate mechanism that may also require zzso zzso zzso Further zzso of the mechanisms by which strain zzso zzso spreading and zzso may permit acceleration of zzso healing by targeted interventions to separately promote spreading and zzso zzso
