Avian influenza virus zzso is classified into two zzso low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso based on zzso in zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso might eventually be related to specific characteristics of zzso tissue zzso and host zzso 

To study differences in disease development between zzso and zzso we examined the first appearance and eventual load of viral zzso in multiple zzso as well as host responses in brain and zzso of chickens infected with two closely related zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso spread zzso in chickens after a combined zzso zzso In brain, large differences in viral zzso load and host gene expression were found between zzso zzso and zzso infected zzso Chicken zzso brain cell culture studies revealed that both zzso and zzso could zzso cultivated embryonic brain cells, but in accordance with the absence of the necessary zzso replication of zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso indicated zzso in brain of zzso infected chickens zzso In zzso where zzso that cleave zzso of zzso are available, we found minimal differences in the amount of viral zzso and a large overlap in the zzso responses between zzso and zzso infected zzso Interestingly, brain and zzso differed clearly in the cellular pathways that were regulated upon an zzso zzso 

Although both zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected in a broad range of zzso beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal zzso our observations indicate that differences in zzso and mortality between zzso and zzso could originate from differences in virus replication and the resulting host responses in vital zzso like the zzso
