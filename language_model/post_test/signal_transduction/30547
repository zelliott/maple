About a century ago, Conrad zzso discovered X-rays, and Henri zzso discovered a new phenomenon, which Marie and Pierre zzso later coined as zzso Since their seminal work, we have learned much about the physical properties of radiation and its effects on living zzso Alas, the more we discover, the more we appreciate the complexity of the biological processes that are triggered by radiation exposure and eventually lead (or do not zzso to zzso zzso with modern biological methods of zzso zzso imaging, and vastly increased zzso prowess, we are now entering an era where we can piece some of the zzso aspects of radiation exposure and its zzso together, and develop a more systemic understanding of zzso effects such as zzso than has been possible in the zzso It is evident from the complexity of even the known processes that such an understanding can only be gained if it is supported by mathematical zzso At this point, the construction of comprehensive models is hampered both by technical zzso and a paucity of appropriate zzso Nonetheless, some initial steps have been taken already and the generally increased interest in systems biology may be expected to speed up future zzso In this context, we discuss in this article examples of relatively small, yet very useful models that zzso selected aspects of the effects of exposure to zzso radiation and may shine a light on the path before zzso
