zzso zzso is an zzso agent in the development of zzso zzso tissue zzso and gastric zzso Patients infected with zzso zzso carry a zzso increased risk of developing cancer compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressing the zzso zzso A zzso are more frequently associated with the development of zzso than zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso causes zzso transformation remains zzso Here we report that exposure of gastric zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso is strongly zzso We show that zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso strains that do not express zzso or that are zzso in zzso genes zzso by the zzso zzso island do not induce zzso protein 1, zzso zzso activity, or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a crucial step in the zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso
