The small zzso zzso has critical functions in regulating zzso dynamics affecting cellular zzso through the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso signaling controls stress fiber and focal zzso formation and cell zzso in zzso zzso signaling is involved in several aspects of zzso development, including zzso migration, growth cone collapse, zzso zzso and spine zzso zzso zzso signaling is implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative disease and is linked to inherited intellectual zzso Although much is known about factors regulating zzso activity and/or degradation, little is known about molecular mechanisms regulating zzso expression and the subsequent effects on zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso control of zzso expression may provide a mechanism to regulate zzso signaling and downstream effects on cell zzso Here we uncover a cellular function for the zzso protein zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso development and focal zzso formation that involves the negative regulation of zzso synthesis and zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso translation and zzso of zzso induced zzso associated with elevated zzso protein levels and zzso zzso These zzso changes were rescued by ROCK zzso and/or zzso zzso These findings further suggest that negative zzso of zzso zzso translation can provide control over downstream signaling and cellular zzso
