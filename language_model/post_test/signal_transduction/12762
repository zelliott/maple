zzso zzso and zzso interact with specific receptors and thereby trigger a series of molecular events that ultimately produce their biological zzso These zzso localized in the plasma zzso carry binding sites for zzso as diverse as peptides zzso zzso zzso lipids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These receptors do not interest directly with their respective downstream zzso zzso an zzso channel and/or an zzso that zzso a second zzso rather, they control one or several target systems via the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso regulatory protein or G zzso G proteins serve as signal zzso linking zzso oriented receptors to zzso zzso Traffic in these pathways is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso switch, which is regulated by the zzso The combination of classical zzso and zzso DNA technology has resulted in the discovery of many members of the G protein zzso These approaches, zzso in particular by zzso experiments, have also identified several zzso that are regulated by G zzso We can safely assume that current lists of G proteins and the functions that they control are zzso
