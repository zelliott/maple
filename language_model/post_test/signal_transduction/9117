The zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit Ras signaling in zzso zzso and lung cancer cells with activated zzso but its mechanism of action is poorly zzso Here, a zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins identified a clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and the interaction of the two proteins in zzso cells was zzso zzso is zzso processed to zzso that have opposing effects on zzso zzso The zzso zzso P zzso interacts with and sequesters zzso at the cell zzso where it can associate with zzso and promote zzso zzso At high cell density, further processing of the P zzso yields a zzso zzso portion zzso zzso which zzso zzso to the nucleus, where it can function to activate zzso Lung cancer cells were found to contain higher zzso levels than zzso lung zzso zzso In zzso lung cancer cells, zzso zzso expression reduced the nuclear levels of zzso by increasing its turnover in the zzso thereby decreasing the nuclear levels and zzso activity of zzso while increasing zzso membrane zzso Thus, zzso is shown to zzso regulate zzso zzso signaling in lung cancer zzso
