Although several reports have claimed that the zzso zzso per zzso zzso a growth signal in zzso and zzso systems, there is no convincing evidence for this in zzso T cell zzso In order to investigate the mechanism of zzso signal zzso pathways via the zzso zzso in zzso T cells, we have established two zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso expressing the human zzso zzso zzso or the human zzso zzso zzso Whereas the parental T cell line, zzso proliferated in response to zzso or zzso but not zzso cell lines zzso expressing human zzso zzso or zzso zzso complex proliferated in response to zzso This implies that the zzso T cell, zzso contains all the zzso components necessary for directing zzso zzso In human zzso zzso cells, the expression of a functional zzso zzso zzso seemed to be induced and regulated by zzso In human zzso zzso cells, in the presence of zzso an interaction requiring only zzso was sufficient for zzso of a zzso zzso In addition human zzso zzso per se, is biologically functional via a zzso zzso not requiring induction of zzso zzso zzso and consecutive zzso complex zzso Thus, although both zzso cell lines can zzso a zzso signal in the presence of zzso a difference in their zzso zzso is probably involved for the induction of zzso zzso
