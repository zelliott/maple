The negative regulation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso was proposed based on studies of zzso and zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso activity in zzso T zzso zzso was found associated with the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso cells and normal zzso T zzso This interaction was increased upon zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with the zzso complex zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, stimulation of zzso cells or normal zzso T zzso through zzso induced rapid zzso zzso of several protein zzso which was substantially diminished after zzso zzso The zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso family zzso zzso zzso By zzso of all four zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso we found the zzso zzso at position zzso which is located in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso crucial for zzso zzso The zzso point zzso zzso both zzso binding and the zzso activity of zzso during zzso zzso These results suggest a critical role of the zzso zzso zzso which by binding to zzso mediates the zzso activity of this zzso
