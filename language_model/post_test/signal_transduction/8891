To investigate the relationship between activities of early growth response gene 1 zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso resistance of breast zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso was detected by zzso spectral zzso Using specific inhibitor zzso the effect of zzso on cell zzso was analyzed by zzso double zzso The concentration of zzso was detected by flow zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso on zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso shift zzso zzso was performed to examine the affinity of zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso 

After treatment with zzso (15 zzso 24 h and 48 zzso zzso the early and late zzso of zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso And the tendency was in a zzso zzso zzso The average zzso intensity of zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso higher than the blank group zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso resistance of zzso cells significantly zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a significantly higher level of zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity, but zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the cellular zzso zzso protein level, but decreased the zzso level in zzso zzso 

There is a close relationship between zzso zzso activity and the zzso resistance of breast zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso
