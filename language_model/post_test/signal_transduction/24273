zzso receptors facilitate T cell function by zzso adhesive events critical for T cell trafficking and recognition of foreign zzso including interactions with vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the functional activity of zzso receptors is acutely regulated by various zzso signals delivered by other cell surface zzso resulting in rapid changes in T cell zzso and zzso This review highlights recent insights into our understanding of the signaling events by which the zzso cell zzso complex and zzso receptors regulate zzso function and T cell zzso These studies highlight novel functions for several signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the adapter protein zzso In addition, analysis of the regulation of zzso function and zzso migration has highlighted the critical role that spatial zzso of signaling molecules plays in signal zzso and the importance of the zzso zzso in T cell zzso
