To test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a model for the study of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and to investigate the presence of zzso zzso and zzso and their possible involvement in a universal mechanism leading to zzso 

Whole mount skeletons of adult animals were analyzed to determine whether zzso mice exhibit zzso To characterize progression of zzso zzso over time, knee and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice were analyzed zzso and severity of zzso cartilage degradation was graded using the zzso Research Society International zzso scoring zzso zzso was used to detect changes in expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cartilage of zzso 

As previously reported, the zzso skeleton zzso was indistinguishable from wild type, and skeletal zzso revealed no significant zzso The zzso mouse did, however, show significantly higher zzso scores in knee zzso 12 and 18 zzso and zzso zzso at all ages zzso zzso zzso showed regions of zzso degradation as early as 2 months in both zzso and knee zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and erosion were observed to begin between 2 and 6 months in zzso zzso and 9 months in knee zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso knee zzso cartilage showed increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso compared to wild type, which zzso preceded zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

With regard to skeletal zzso the zzso mouse appears zzso normal but develops premature zzso as zzso We conclude that the zzso mouse is a useful model for the study of zzso in individuals with overtly normal skeletal structure and a predisposition for zzso cartilage zzso
