zzso ozone is an air zzso harmful to plants and zzso Its rapid increase at the ground surface has raised serious concern over damage to the quality and yield of agricultural zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are formed in plant cells when that are exposed to a high concentration of zzso and the zzso are thought to alter gene expression and result in cellular zzso zzso of the zzso formation will provide us with a better understanding of the zzso responses to and signaling pathways of ozone stress in zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the zzso formation in rice zzso zzso zzso the premier crop in zzso To determine zzso distribution in rice leaves under acute ozone stress, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso their expression levels under ozone stress, whereas zzso zzso maintained their expression zzso Higher zzso zzso occurred after the end of ozone exposure, which suggests zzso zzso may not be due to ozone directly, but rather to zzso changes caused by the ozone zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not show significant zzso The in zzso analysis indicated accelerated formation of zzso about zzso after the onset of exposure, which suggests that cellular death occurred around this zzso
