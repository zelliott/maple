The majority of zzso familial zzso disease cases are caused by zzso in the genes zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso have been zzso to cause zzso disease either by altering zzso precursor protein metabolism or by increasing the vulnerability of zzso to undergo death by zzso We showed previously that zzso zzso 9 deletion zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to high zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso effect of zzso growth factor I zzso is compromised by these zzso The present study investigates whether the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to undergo zzso is likely due to a zzso of zzso zzso B zzso a key intermediate in the zzso 3 zzso arm of the zzso signaling zzso We used two methods to determine the regulation of zzso in response to the zzso stimuli of serum deprivation and high zzso stress, as well as treatment with zzso We also looked at the zzso state of zzso at zzso Using a zzso zzso with zzso zzso we detected an increased zzso activity in zzso zzso cells at 1 zzso after the combination of 20 zzso zzso plus 10 zzso zzso when compared to the other cell zzso This effect, however, was transient in that no zzso related differences were seen at either 6- or 24-hr zzso zzso for zzso as a ratio of total zzso as well as for zzso zzso at zzso revealed no apparent between cell type and treatment zzso This data strongly indicates that zzso zzso and zzso cells show no major differences in the pattern of zzso regulation after exposure to the zzso stimuli of either serum deprivation or high zzso stress, or treatment with zzso It is suggested that another component of zzso signaling is likely disrupted in these cells to increase their vulnerability to undergo death by zzso
