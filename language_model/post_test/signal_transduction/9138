zzso development is a zzso process where zzso zzso is converted into a highly complex organ through several zzso zzso The general principles regulating these events have been under intense investigation and despite extensive progress, many open questions zzso While the zzso zzso of mouse and rat have served as the primary model, other organisms also significantly contribute to the zzso In particular, the more primitive zzso kidney has emerged as an alternative model due to its simplicity and experimental zzso Many aspects of zzso development such as the patterning along its zzso axis are zzso zzso and are therefore directly zzso to higher zzso This review will focus on the current understanding of zzso development in zzso It summarizes how zzso zzso regulation, as well as zzso mechanisms contribute to the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso The data show that even in the simple zzso the mechanisms regulating kidney zzso are highly zzso It also illustrates that a multifaceted analysis embracing modern zzso approaches combined with single gene analysis will be required to fully understand all the zzso
