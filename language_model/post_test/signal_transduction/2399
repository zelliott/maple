We previously showed that zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso cell line induced zzso resistance, which is correlated with zzso of both zzso receptors on the cell zzso We now analyzed whether zzso zzso production also zzso with zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso cell line, in which cell death can be induced by controlled zzso expression of a zzso fusion protein between zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the latter zzso resistance to cell death induced by zzso zzso while zzso induced by zzso was not zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso did not induce zzso mechanisms that block zzso signaling leading to cell zzso Thus the induction of zzso resistance via zzso zzso production in zzso cells is solely due to zzso of zzso receptors on the cell zzso
