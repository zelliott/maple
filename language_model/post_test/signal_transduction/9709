Resistance against first and second generation zzso zzso zzso is an zzso problem in clinical zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the irreversible zzso zzso zzso and zzso on growth of breast and zzso cancer zzso Although in zzso zzso effects of both drugs exceeded by far the effects of all zzso zzso zzso tested zzso zzso and zzso complete growth zzso was usually not zzso To define the mechanism of resistance, we examined downstream signaling pathways in zzso cells by Western zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso remained essentially zzso in drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells with zzso activated zzso was found to promote resistance against all zzso zzso tested, whereas dominant negative zzso zzso sensitivity in drug-resistant zzso In a next step, we applied zzso zzso including the dual zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These agents were found to cooperate with zzso and zzso in producing in zzso growth zzso in cancer cells resistant against zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso plays a crucial role in resistance against classical and second-generation irreversible zzso zzso and zzso can override this form of resistance against zzso and zzso
