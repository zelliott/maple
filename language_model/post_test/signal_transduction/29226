We report here characterization of five genes for novel components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso These genes were identified in the zzso zzso zzso through a zzso screening for genes required for zzso with zzso and four of them have counterparts in zzso The five genes we studied are as zzso zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso that encodes a protein with zzso repeats, zzso a single counterpart for two human genes zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso that encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso of each of the genes zzso zzso zzso and resulted in suppression of the expression of zzso downstream genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso zzso For every zzso defects in zzso zzso were rescued by zzso of a zzso active form, but not zzso of zzso zzso interactions were found between zzso and each of the zzso These results suggest that these five genes act upstream of or parallel to zzso in the zzso signaling zzso in early zzso zzso
