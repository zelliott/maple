The main components of zzso systems of zzso are zzso zzso molecules that include both sensor zzso specifically recognizing external signals and zzso zzso converting these signals into an adequate cell zzso This review summarizes and analyzes data of zzso organization, molecular mechanisms of action, and regulation of zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso have been shown to be precursors of the zzso and zzso components of the zzso hormonal signaling zzso This confirms the hypothesis developed by the authors about formation of the main archetypes of zzso systems at the early evolution stages and about the evolutionary relationship of the signaling systems of zzso and zzso
