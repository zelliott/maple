zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in several human cancer types and promotes zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso promotes tumor progression are not completely zzso Here we report that zzso of a zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the total level of zzso and the composition of the zzso junction complexes were not affected, nor was the zzso zzso of the zzso complex components zzso By contrast, zzso zzso activity was significantly affected by modulating the zzso activity in zzso zzso Treatment with a ROCK zzso inhibitor rescued zzso zzso defects in zzso cells, whereas expression of zzso activated zzso disrupted zzso junctions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso junctions appeared to be regulated via a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso and the interactions increased in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso activity was zzso and this zzso was accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of either a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso defects in zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso promotes tumor zzso through a mechanism involving zzso zzso of zzso zzso
