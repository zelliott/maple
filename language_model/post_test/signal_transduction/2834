Because zzso exerts opposite effects on cell proliferation in different cell types, we undertook to study its effect on the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in three cell lines zzso zzso and zzso chosen for their different zzso responses to zzso We measured the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso activities after stimulation by zzso acting through a zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso or a G zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells we found that zzso strongly inhibited all three activities zzso zzso and zzso in good agreement with its effect on cell proliferation in these zzso In zzso and zzso cells, on the contrary, zzso did not inhibit zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso activities, and even zzso zzso activity slightly on its zzso Again these results are in good agreement with the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity on the hand, was inhibited by zzso in zzso and zzso as it was in zzso zzso This result indicates that signaling pathways in zzso and zzso cells can activate zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Our results add to growing evidence for the existence of zzso and/or zzso pathways leading to zzso and zzso zzso
