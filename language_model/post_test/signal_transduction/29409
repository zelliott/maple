zzso a zzso zzso zzso growth factor, is required for branching zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso HS increases the affinity of zzso for zzso which forms an zzso zzso signaling complex, and results in diverse biological zzso including proliferation and zzso zzso Defining the HS structures involved in specific zzso events is critical to understand how HS zzso growth factor signaling in specific zzso zzso We used zzso zzso cells, which require zzso HS to zzso to investigate the HS requirements for zzso proliferation and primary zzso zzso to investigate the structural requirements of HS for zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso with at least 10 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were required for zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso HS increased proliferation and end bud zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries showed that zzso with either an zzso zzso induced end bud expansion, whereas zzso with zzso alone induced duct zzso End bud expansion resulted from increased zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso and zzso as well as increased zzso zzso a marker of end bud zzso zzso zzso was associated with expression of zzso a marker of developing zzso zzso these findings show that the size and zzso patterns of HS zzso specific zzso events, such as zzso duct zzso end bud expansion, and zzso and provide zzso insight as to how the zzso zzso of specific HS structures in zzso influences zzso zzso and zzso
