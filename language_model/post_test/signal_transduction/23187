Numerous effects of zzso fatty acids zzso and zzso on functional responses of cells involved in inflammation and immunity have been zzso zzso zzso modifications in membrane order and in the availability of zzso for zzso synthesis are long-standing mechanisms that are considered important in explaining the effects zzso More recently, effects on signal zzso pathways and on gene expression profiles have been zzso Over the last 10 years or so, significant advances in understanding the mechanisms of action of zzso fatty acids have been zzso These include the identification of new actions of zzso zzso that were already described and of novel interactions among those zzso and the description of an entirely new family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have zzso actions and are critical to the resolution of zzso It is also zzso that zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso of the zzso inflammatory zzso factor zzso Recent studies suggest three alternative mechanisms by which zzso fatty acids might have this zzso Within zzso as well as other cells of relevance to immune and inflammatory responses, zzso and zzso act to disrupt very early events involving formation of the structures termed zzso zzso which bring together various proteins to form an effective zzso zzso In zzso recent research has identified a number of new mechanisms of action that help to explain previously identified effects of zzso fatty acids on inflammation and zzso
