Ten male subjects underwent two types of adaptation paradigm designed either to enhance or to zzso the gain of the zzso zzso zzso before undergoing zzso zzso zzso testing with constant zzso earth horizontal axis and pitch zzso The adaptation paradigm paired a zzso zzso zzso rotation about an earth vertical axis with a zzso zzso zzso stimulus that was deliberately mismatched in peak zzso or phase and was designed to produce short-term changes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso tests occurred at a constant zzso of 60 zzso in the dark and produced a zzso component of the slow phase zzso with a frequency of zzso zzso due to zzso stimulation by the zzso changing gravity zzso Of the seven subjects who showed enhancement of the zzso gain, six also showed enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso Of the seven subjects who showed zzso of the zzso gain, five also showed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The probability that these two zzso adaptation effects would occur by chance is less than zzso This suggests that zzso conditioning of the zzso axis zzso also induced changes in the pitch axis zzso We thus zzso that the central nervous system pathways that process horizontal canal zzso stimuli have elements in common with those processing zzso stimuli about the pitch zzso
