The recognition between zzso zzso gene zzso receptors zzso and viral zzso triggers an zzso cascade of signaling to induce the expression of type I zzso Both positive and negative regulation of the zzso signaling zzso are important for the host zzso immune zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling by affecting the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso response element, zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, as the zzso zzso was zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso which promoted its association with zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso zzso with the recruitment of zzso downstream molecules zzso zzso and zzso to zzso Further study revealed that the first zzso domain of zzso is critical for its zzso and association with zzso as well as its zzso effect on zzso zzso We concluded that zzso functions as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso by interacting with zzso in a zzso zzso
