The coordination of zzso pathways within the cell is vital for normal human development and zzso tissue zzso Gene expression and function is therefore tightly controlled at a number of zzso We investigated the role that zzso modifications play during human zzso zzso In particular, we examined the role of the small zzso modifier zzso proteins in this zzso We used a human embryonic stem cell zzso model of zzso differentiation to follow changes in protein zzso Moreover, to confirm the results derived from our zzso system, we performed in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso modification of a key zzso zzso factor, zzso Our analyses indicate that zzso plays an important role during zzso differentiation and this is zzso in part, through regulation of the stability of zzso in a zzso zzso Our study provides a better understanding of zzso during human zzso differentiation and zzso Moreover, we believe the results will stimulate interest in the differentiation and zzso regulation of other zzso cell zzso
