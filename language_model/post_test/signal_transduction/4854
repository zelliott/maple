zzso tumor cells were found with an abnormal cell zzso Previous in zzso experiment had confirmed the zzso intervention effect on checkpoint signaling of zzso in the cell zzso This study was to further observe the expressions of zzso zzso factors intervened by zzso zzso in S zzso 

Lewis lung zzso models of zzso mice were zzso Sixty mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group, model control group, zzso group, and zzso zzso There were 15 mice in each zzso zzso weight and tumor zzso rate were zzso In addition, the cell cycle distribution was detected by flow zzso and the proliferation index was zzso Furthermore, zzso and protein expressions of zzso regulator of zzso zzso 109 zzso zzso function 1 zzso and zzso were analyzed by real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso methods, zzso 

The tumor weights of mice in the zzso group and the zzso group were lower than those in the model group zzso with tumor zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso Cancer cell proliferation index and proportion of cancer cell population in S phase in the zzso group were significantly lower than those in the zzso group zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group were lower than those in the model group zzso 

zzso plays a role in intervening in the abnormal cell cycle by zzso zzso factors and thus zzso the lung cancer cell zzso
