zzso elicit a variety of biological responses in skeletal muscle, including zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso zzso and promoting zzso Thus, excess or chronic zzso exposure leads to muscle zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso their signal mainly through zzso receptors zzso which, upon binding to zzso zzso to the nucleus and bind to zzso zzso response elements to regulate the zzso of nearby zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analysis, we identified 173 genes in mouse zzso zzso The mouse zzso contains zzso regions in or near these zzso and gene expression is regulated by zzso Eight of these genes zzso proteins known to regulate distinct signaling events in zzso growth factor 1 zzso We found that zzso of zzso one of these eight zzso caused a decrease in zzso zzso zzso mimicking the effect of zzso Moreover, reducing zzso expression by zzso interference in zzso zzso significantly compromised the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and reduced zzso induction of insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso at zzso zzso This zzso is associated with insulin zzso Furthermore, decreasing zzso expression abolished zzso zzso of protein synthesis and compromised zzso reduction of cell diameters in zzso zzso Finally, a zzso response element was identified in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso our studies identified zzso zzso networks in zzso and showed that zzso plays a critical role in zzso insulin resistance and muscle zzso in zzso zzso
