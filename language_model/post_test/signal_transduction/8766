zzso signaling regulates key cellular processes including zzso survival, and migration, and it has been implicated in the development of many types of cancer including breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions as a major inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso may play a pivotal role in zzso zzso 

To investigate the effects of loss of zzso function on zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso mice were crossed with an zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso on tumor zzso zzso growth, zzso progression and zzso were zzso To investigate potential differences in tumor zzso between the two groups, zzso to detect von zzso factor was performed and zzso To examine gene expression of potential zzso of the zzso switch, an zzso zzso array was zzso and results were confirmed using zzso Finally, zzso transplantation of tumor fragments was performed to determine the impact of zzso zzso of zzso on tumor zzso 

zzso zzso reduced tumor zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso zzso of zzso mice formed zzso and markedly delayed tumor onset by an average of 46 zzso zzso zzso was also zzso but an increase in the number of zzso zzso was detected indicating that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso was decreased in the zzso zzso tumors, and expression of a potent zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor fragments into zzso recipients restored tumor zzso zzso zzso tumor fragments were unable to grow when transplanted into zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in the zzso is responsible, in part, for the zzso of zzso tumor zzso
