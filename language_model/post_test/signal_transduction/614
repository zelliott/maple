Although the plant growth hormone zzso has long been recognized as a regulator of plant defense, the molecular mechanisms involved are still largely zzso Recent studies reviewed here reveal new insights into the role of zzso in plant zzso Similar to the signaling pathways of the zzso plant hormones salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso signaling zzso affects resistance to separate pathogen zzso Recent evidence suggests that the zzso and zzso pathways act in a mutually zzso manner during plant defense, whereas zzso and zzso signaling share many zzso zzso also affects disease outcomes indirectly through effects on zzso Here, we discuss the multiple ways in which zzso regulation of plant growth and development might be intimately linked to plant zzso
