Recent advances in the understanding of the zzso of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso have revealed multiple zzso signaling zzso One frequently altered axis is the zzso zzso This zzso plays a central role in numerous cellular processes including zzso cell growth, zzso survival and zzso which ultimately contributes to zzso zzso 

Books, zzso databases and zzso have been searched to provide a current review on the zzso 

This article reviews the current understanding of zzso signaling in zzso including the impact of both genetic and zzso zzso This review further highlights the potential of targeting this signaling cascade as a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of zzso 

zzso zzso of several zzso within this pathway, including both genetic and zzso changes, leading to either zzso zzso or zzso of tumor zzso have frequently been implicated in zzso zzso drugs that target the central zzso of this zzso have become attractive for molecular oriented cancer zzso Numerous zzso and clinical studies are being performed in zzso however, more studies are still needed to better understand the biology of this zzso
