zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates diverse zzso responses by binding to its specific zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso second zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular signaling of zzso we have studied its effect on the zzso activity of zzso protein zzso C zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso cells which were zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was also inhibited in the presence of zzso however, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso The exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso which blocks the production of zzso significantly reduced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso protein zzso by zzso restored the zzso levels of zzso activity in the presence of zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, involving the specific zzso zzso its second zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Together, these findings zzso that zzso may act as a negative zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso
