Local infection with zzso pathogens zzso whole plant immunity to secondary zzso zzso genes are induced in parallel with this systemic acquired resistance response and thought to be zzso The hypothesis of zzso has been challenged by induction of zzso zzso but not systemic acquired resistance in zzso zzso plants responding to zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso However, experiments with zzso zzso plants have revealed major differences between zzso zzso The zzso zzso prevents hypersensitive cell death, systemic acquired resistance and zzso induction zzso by bacteria carrying zzso This zzso does not prevent these responses to bacteria carrying zzso 

zzso acquired resistance, zzso induction and zzso induction were assessed in comparisons of zzso and zzso zzso plants, double zzso plants, and zzso zzso zzso acquired resistance was displayed by all four plant lines in response to zzso zzso bacteria carrying zzso zzso induction was partially impaired by either single zzso in response to either bacterial strain, but only fully impaired in the double zzso in response to zzso zzso induction was not fully impaired in any of the zzso in response to either zzso zzso 

Two pathways act zzso rather than in an zzso synergistic fashion, to induce systemic acquired resistance, zzso and zzso One of these pathways is zzso and depends on signals associated with hypersensitive cell zzso The other zzso is dependent on salicylic acid zzso and acts through zzso At least two other pathways also contribute zzso to zzso zzso
