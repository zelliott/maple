zzso and other animals generally perceive motion independently of the cues that define the moving zzso To understand the underlying mechanisms of this zzso of stimulus zzso we have examined the cellular properties of avian zzso zzso zzso that are sensitive to a variety of moving stimuli but not to zzso stationary zzso This in zzso study showed zzso signal transfer at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses to synaptic zzso that interact in a mutually exclusive manner in the zzso zzso zzso A model of the zzso zzso predicts that these two cellular properties mediate sensitivity to a wide range of dynamic zzso zzso including moving zzso but not to zzso stationary stimuli in a zzso zzso The zzso that is independent of stimulus detail is initiated by zzso zzso and is completed by zzso zzso that integrate zzso from multiple zzso zzso in a zzso selective zzso
