To explore the effects of reduced zzso zzso on the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and the nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso 

The rat zzso cell line was activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and incubated with various zzso of zzso zzso 1, 2, 5 and 10 zzso for 24 zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso IV and zzso acid zzso contents were measured by zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso and zzso protein expression was observed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was assessed by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso activity was analyzed by zzso 

zzso treatment inhibited zzso proliferation and decreased the zzso of zzso and collagen IV zzso less than zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells also led to increased expression of zzso and zzso and increased activity of zzso zzso less than zzso 

zzso can inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso cells in zzso and reduce zzso of zzso acid and collagen zzso The underlying mechanism in zzso cells may involve regulation of the zzso signaling zzso
