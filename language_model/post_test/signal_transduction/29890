The zzso zzso signal zzso system of zzso coli regulates gene expression in response to the zzso conditions of zzso Over the years, genetic screens have lead to the identification of about 30 zzso zzso that are involved in zzso zzso However, the discovery of 3 targets that are not implicated in respiratory metabolism (the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso site for zzso zzso and zzso site for zzso zzso suggests that the Arc zzso may comprise additional zzso that are involved in a myriad of zzso To identify these zzso we derived the zzso zzso profile of zzso coli using zzso zzso zzso The findings indicated that zzso of all open reading frames in zzso coli are affected either directly or indirectly by zzso To identify which zzso are under the direct control of zzso we developed the zzso recognition weight zzso from zzso data and used it to scan the zzso yielding an zzso sequence affinity zzso By zzso both methods, we identified 55 new zzso zzso that are implicated in energy zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso zzso The data also suggest that the Arc response pathway, which translates into a net global zzso of gene zzso zzso partly with the zzso regulatory zzso A conservative but reasonable assessment is that the Arc zzso recruits zzso zzso to mediate a role in cellular adaptation that is more extensive than zzso zzso
