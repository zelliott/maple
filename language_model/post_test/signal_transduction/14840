zzso play a key role in energy metabolism within the cell through the zzso zzso They are also involved in many cellular processes like zzso calcium signaling or zzso oxygen species zzso The objectives of this review are to understand the interactions between zzso metabolism and zzso or different stress situations observed in zzso and to know the clinical zzso 

zzso were obtained from zzso data bank zzso using the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso act as a pharmacological target for the zzso zzso The effects can be toxic like in the case of the local zzso zzso On the other hand, beneficial effects are observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism could be disturbed in many critical situations zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso The study of the underlying mechanisms should allow to propose in the future new specific zzso
