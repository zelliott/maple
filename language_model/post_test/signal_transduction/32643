The signals zzso growth hormone zzso differentiation of zzso zzso under zzso conditions have been zzso zzso zzso of cells was required before the induction of terminal differentiation by a combination of zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso Cellular depletion of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and severely attenuated the ability of zzso to promote zzso Although zzso zzso protein zzso were activated during zzso zzso treatment of cells with zzso zzso which prevented zzso of these zzso did not block zzso zzso However, zzso zzso depletion of zzso protein zzso from the cells showed that their expression was necessary for terminal zzso Similarly, although zzso was activated during zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso which prevented the zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso However, zzso did partially block zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso terminal zzso By contrast, cellular depletion of zzso with zzso zzso completely abolished the ability of zzso to promote zzso These results indicate that zzso acting specifically via zzso is necessary for zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is not essential for the promotion of differentiation by zzso although these signals are required for zzso terminal zzso
