zzso transmit numerous devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding for egg zzso Previously, we have shown that the nutritional zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso is critical for the zzso zzso of the major zzso protein precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation of zzso and egg zzso In this study, we provide in zzso and in zzso evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso Enriched in zzso which is an upstream zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the fat body of the zzso Aedes zzso Using zzso interference zzso methods, we showed that zzso was indispensable in zzso zzso of zzso zzso a key downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso and translation in the zzso fat body, which was monitored in zzso after blood meal or in zzso organ culture after AA zzso zzso development was severely hindered in mosquitoes with a zzso zzso depletion zzso This study represents a notable step in deciphering molecular pathways controlling reproduction of this important zzso of human zzso
