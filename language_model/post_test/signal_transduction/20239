In insulin target zzso zzso is known to traffic through multiple compartments that may involve zzso and/or zzso zzso During these trafficking steps, zzso is sorted into a storage zzso compartment that is acutely released by insulin zzso processes that are downstream of zzso zzso associated changes in zzso zzso As zzso components have recently been found to influence cellular sorting processes that are related to changes in both zzso and zzso zzso we have examined whether zzso traffic is routed through zzso dependent sorting zzso Introduction of the dominant negative zzso zzso of the zzso components zzso zzso and zzso zzso into rat zzso leads to the zzso of zzso in large, coalesced and extended zzso structures that zzso with the zzso zzso over large parts of the extended zzso A new swollen hybrid and extensively zzso compartment is produced in which zzso zzso more extensively with the zzso markers including zzso and zzso receptors but also with the zzso marker zzso These zzso are associated with failure of insulin action on zzso traffic to the cell surface and suggest impairment in an zzso sorting step used for zzso traffic to its zzso zzso zzso
