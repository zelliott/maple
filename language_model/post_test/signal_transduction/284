There is growing awareness that zzso trafficking plays a critical role in zzso communication during animal zzso We are beginning to understand how zzso can zzso zzso or terminate zzso In contrast, our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in zzso signaling peptides remains more zzso particularly when it comes to zzso at the zzso surface in zzso zzso In this study, we review the mechanisms that control zzso in zzso zzso focusing on the role of zzso family members and the zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso peptides and of zzso and the zzso complex in zzso zzso
