zzso zzso and zzso zzso are all essential for zzso patterning and zzso cell fates in zzso pathways zzso from flies to zzso zzso zzso of these pathways is observed in a wide variety of zzso suggesting that these embryonic zzso pathways contribute in a fundamental way to the evolution and maintenance of a zzso zzso Because all three of these pathways participate in lung development, recent studies have begun to explore the connection between lung development, airway zzso repair and lung zzso Development, repair and zzso transformation of the neuroendocrine lineage are all accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso may be important in other airway cell zzso Small zzso targeting of these pathways may provide therapeutic opportunities in lung zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso inhibitor that shows therapeutic promise in small cell lung cancer, a highly aggressive neuroendocrine zzso A more detailed understanding of how embryonic zzso pathways participate in airway zzso repair and zzso may reveal more novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung zzso
