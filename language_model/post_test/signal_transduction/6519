The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the central nervous system zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso beta zzso is expressed in zzso These receptors are distributed in both zzso and zzso zzso where they act as zzso or zzso zzso Studies from ours and other laboratories have shown that zzso receptors are densely expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and moderately expressed in the cerebral cortex, the molecular layer of the zzso the zzso nucleus, the superficial gray layer of the superior zzso the zzso zzso and the deep zzso of the zzso At the zzso level, zzso receptors were found distributed in zzso and zzso terminals and these receptors are located on the plasma membrane of zzso zzso terminals and in the zzso close to the zzso The terminal zzso of the zzso receptors in zzso suggests that there is a signal responsible for the protein transport toward the nerve zzso Studies from ours and other groups using zzso zzso binding sites, viral zzso and zzso methods have shown that zzso receptors are located at the nerve terminals of different zzso The zzso receptors act as terminal receptors and are involved in regulation of the release of various zzso including zzso zzso The regulation of zzso acid release by zzso receptors has been found in zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso zzso from nucleus zzso to the zzso zzso area, and from zzso zzso to the deep zzso of the zzso The control of zzso release by zzso receptors has been found in projections from zzso to the zzso zzso and of zzso release from retinal zzso cells to the superficial gray layer of the superior zzso The control of zzso release by zzso receptors was shown in projections arising from the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Multiple zzso suggest that zzso receptors are implicated in several zzso functions, behavior and psychiatric diseases including zzso locomotor activity, drug abuse zzso zzso aggressive behavior, depression and anxiety zzso
