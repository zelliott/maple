The stereotyped arrangement of cochlear sensory and supporting cells is critical for auditory zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso syndrome model mice zzso have hearing loss associated with a supporting cell fate transformation of two zzso cells to two pillar zzso We investigated the zzso origins of this transformation and found that two prospective zzso cells switch to an outer pillar zzso fate zzso between embryonic day zzso zzso and zzso day 3 zzso zzso the zzso hearing loss and supporting cell fate transformation are not rescued by genetically reducing zzso growth factor 8 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required for pillar cell zzso Rather, reducing zzso which normally activates zzso or zzso is sufficient for rescue of cochlear form and zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso changes the specificity of zzso and zzso such that both acquire responsiveness to zzso Moreover, zzso zzso does not block the zzso supporting cell fate transformation but instead allows a gradual zzso of zzso cells toward the normal zzso between zzso and at least zzso This study indicates that zzso and pillar cells can zzso switch fates in an zzso manner over a prolonged period of zzso This property might be exploited for the regulation of sensory cell zzso from support zzso
