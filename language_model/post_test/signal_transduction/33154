Six zzso of the zzso zzso family involved in various inflammatory or zzso diseases share the same zzso signal zzso zzso We made a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso to study the structure and function of the zzso zzso These zzso recognized different zzso of the zzso that we called A to zzso Most of the zzso were found to be zzso and we studied whether some of them could also induce zzso zzso When used alone, none of them was able to initiate the proliferation of zzso cell zzso However, some particular associations of the zzso were able to induce a zzso zzso zzso B1 could activate the lines in association with F1 or with zzso but not with zzso which in zzso was similar to zzso In contrast zzso zzso which in zzso appeared to be very similar to zzso was able to activate the cells in association with zzso but not with F1 or zzso Two other zzso belonging to zzso A and C were found to be zzso either in association with zzso only, or with zzso or zzso zzso These associations of zzso appeared to be nearly as potent zzso as zzso zzso Although we still have no precise idea of the mechanisms involved, they are interesting tools to study the molecular interactions leading to zzso zzso and, from a practical point of view, valuable growth factors of zzso stem zzso
