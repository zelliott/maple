zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso group tumor zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso within the common deleted region identified in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome, and acute zzso zzso zzso is expressed within zzso zzso zzso thus, it may contribute to the zzso of these zzso To define its role in zzso we knocked down zzso expression in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from human zzso blood zzso short hairpin zzso and observed an enhanced commitment to and acceleration of zzso zzso zzso with this effect, zzso of zzso in primary zzso zzso cells as well as in zzso cell lines restricted zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso levels decrease during zzso zzso differentiation or zzso exposure, suggesting a specific role for zzso zzso in enforcing cell fate decisions toward the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso contributes to some zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso by promoting zzso zzso
