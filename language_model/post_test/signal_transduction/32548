The interaction of a zzso with its zzso zzso not only activates signal zzso pathways but also determines zzso responses affecting key elements in these zzso in particular the cell surface zzso Such is the case for G zzso zzso the expression and functional status of which are highly zzso The regulatory mechanisms involved can be divided according to two distinct time zzso acute and zzso In the zzso zzso mechanisms alter the functional status of the elements without changing zzso levels or gene zzso zzso zzso plays a prominent role in these acute zzso zzso Thus zzso promote zzso and the zzso of several G zzso zzso And we have shown in the case of the zzso zzso zzso that protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso to its zzso zzso regulation involves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulation of the turnover of the elements in the information zzso zzso In the case of G zzso zzso long-term regulation is often reflected in changes in zzso levels of zzso (which can be zzso by techniques such as northern zzso analysis, solution zzso or zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso prolonged administration of zzso drugs zzso an zzso of zzso zzso in various brain regions, probably through an increase in gene zzso zzso zzso stimuli are converted into long-term changes in gene expression through specific nuclear zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
