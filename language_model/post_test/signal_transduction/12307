Time and cost are the enemies of cell zzso The number of experiments required to rigorously dissect and comprehend a zzso of even modest complexity is zzso zzso are needed to formulate biological pathways in a zzso fashion, which would automate the process of considering all possible experiments in a complex zzso and identify those that command zzso In this zzso we describe a method that is based on the exploitation of zzso tools that were originally developed to zzso zzso zzso computer systems such as mobile phones and web zzso In this approach, the biological process is articulated as an zzso computer program that can be interrogated using methods that were developed to zzso complex software zzso Using case studies of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that the application of this technology can yield interesting insights into the zzso of zzso zzso which have subsequently been zzso by experimental zzso
