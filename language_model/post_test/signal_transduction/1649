Cell cycle progression and exit must be precisely patterned during development to generate zzso of the correct size, shape and zzso Here we present evidence that zzso growth of the developing spinal zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso positively regulates cell cycle progression and zzso regulates cell cycle exit of spinal neural precursors in part through zzso regulation of zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso expressed at the zzso zzso of the spinal cord, zzso and zzso have zzso activity while more broadly expressed zzso do zzso We present several lines of evidence suggesting that zzso zzso zzso form a zzso to zzso concentration zzso A growth zzso that zzso with the predicted zzso of zzso zzso emerges as the neural tube grows with the proliferation rate highest zzso and the differentiation rate highest zzso These data are rationalized in a zzso zzso zzso that explains how proliferation and differentiation can be patterned across a growing field of zzso Computer modeling demonstrates this model is a robust and zzso mechanism for patterning cell cycle regulation in a growing zzso Supplemental data available zzso
