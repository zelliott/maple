zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso for zzso oxide zzso and so mediates a wide range of effects zzso zzso zzso zzso and neural zzso through the zzso of zzso and the engagement of various downstream targets, such as protein zzso and zzso zzso Until recently, our understanding of zzso functioning has been derived exclusively from studies of the zzso in tissue zzso or in its zzso zzso Here, NO binds to the zzso prosthetic group of zzso triggering a zzso change and a large increase in zzso zzso The potency zzso of NO appears to be about zzso zzso The rate of zzso of zzso by NO is rapid zzso and, in the presence of excess zzso zzso is formed at a constant zzso on removal of zzso zzso zzso slowly zzso Recent investigation of the way that zzso behaves in its natural environment, within cells, has revealed several key zzso For example, the zzso exhibits a rapidly desensitizing profile of zzso the potency of NO is 45 zzso for the zzso zzso but becomes higher with time, zzso of zzso on removal of NO is zzso faster than the fastest estimate for zzso zzso Overall, within cells, zzso behaves in a way that is analogous to the way that classical neurotransmitter receptors zzso The properties of cellular zzso have important implications for the understanding of zzso zzso For example, the dynamics of the zzso means that fluctuations in the rate of NO formation, even on zzso time scale, will result in closely synchronized zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso provides an economical way of generating a cellular zzso signal and, in concert with zzso provides the basis for zzso signal diversity, allowing different targets zzso to be selected from a common input zzso Thus, despite exhibiting only limited molecular zzso cellular zzso functions in a way that introduces speed, complexity, and versatility into zzso zzso zzso
