The change and the role of zzso cascade zzso and zzso zzso after liver transplantation were zzso Thirty-four zzso donor liver specimens and 10 normal liver specimens were classified as group A (no zzso zzso zzso 10), group B zzso acute zzso zzso zzso 10), group C zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso group D zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and group E zzso zzso zzso zzso By using zzso the expression levels of zzso activated protein zzso zzso Ras and zzso zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression levels were zzso The results showed that the expression levels of zzso and Ras proteins were increased by turns in groups A, B and C, and decreased by turns in groups D and zzso The protein expression of zzso was higher in the treated zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was identical as that of zzso It is suggested that the zzso cascade zzso and zzso zzso can protect the zzso by different mechanisms after liver zzso zzso cascade zzso repairs zzso injury or zzso zzso into proliferation or zzso zzso zzso blocks cell cycle within zzso phase to make zzso repair or zzso to reduce disorder zzso
