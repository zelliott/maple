Different zzso growth zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been proposed to have various functions in muscle repair and zzso To gain insight into the potentially differential actions of IGF-1 zzso in the regulation of muscle zzso we assessed the time course of their expressions at both zzso and protein levels after zzso muscle damage in zzso In addition, we characterized mature IGF-1 and synthetic zzso E zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso Ten healthy male volunteers were subjected to zzso muscle damage and biopsy samples were taken from the exercised muscles before and 6 zzso 2, 5 and 16 days post zzso Muscle damage was documented by specific functional and zzso responses post zzso zzso analyses of muscle biopsy samples revealed a rapid and transient zzso of zzso zzso expression which was followed by a prolonged increase of zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso zzso similar to those for zzso expression were detected for zzso and zzso expression at the protein zzso The action of synthetic zzso E zzso differed from that of mature IGF-1 since its zzso effect on zzso zzso cells was not blocked by an zzso zzso zzso zzso and it did not zzso zzso zzso we conclude that the differential expression profile of IGF-1 zzso in zzso and the possible zzso - independent zzso E zzso zzso in skeletal zzso cells in zzso support the notion that zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso produces mature IGF-1 and zzso E peptides which possibly act as distinct zzso in skeletal muscle zzso
