zzso protein binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter that allows it to exchange zzso for zzso Previously, we performed molecular dynamics calculations on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bound to zzso By zzso the average structures of these two complexes, we identified four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso that change zzso and were candidates for being zzso zzso These calculations were performed in the absence of three zzso undefined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have now modeled these zzso into the zzso structure and have zzso the dynamics zzso We find that all three loop zzso undergo large changes in zzso that involve mostly changes in their positioning and not their individual zzso We have also identified another potential zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Overall, our current results suggest that zzso interactions with zzso zzso may enhance zzso zzso signaling through zzso its zzso by maintaining its binding to zzso and by allowing its zzso zzso to interact with zzso zzso
