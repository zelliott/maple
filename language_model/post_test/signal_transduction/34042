The human zzso zzso of zzso protein is highly zzso in zzso where it has been suggested to function as a molecular scaffold recruiting proteins involved in zzso traffic and linking them to the zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently zzso was found highly expressed in zzso prostate cancer cell lines, while one of its zzso zzso 2) is down regulated during prostate cancer zzso 

In this report we characterize the central zzso rich domain of zzso and we describe for the first time its functional role in zzso zzso We show that the zzso expression of this domain has a dominant negative effect on the zzso of activated zzso growth factor zzso zzso while leaving zzso zzso zzso zzso By a combination of different approaches zzso display, zzso predictions, zzso zzso zzso analysis, in zzso zzso we have identified two closely spaced binding motifs for zzso and for the zzso of the proteins zzso II and zzso zzso from wild type, zzso rich zzso that are altered in these motifs do not inhibit zzso zzso suggesting that these binding motifs play a functional role in this zzso 

Our findings are relevant to the characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could work by bridging the zzso zzso and the scaffold protein zzso
