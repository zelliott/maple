zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulate zzso components of zzso cells and have been implicated in zzso zzso In this study, we examined the contributions of zzso cell zzso and zzso reorganization to zzso zzso zzso in cultured bovine zzso zzso We found, as evidenced by a reduction in zzso mobility, that zzso to zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso cells, consistent with the notion that zzso binding is required for zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was zzso 2-4 h after zzso and adherence to either polystyrene or zzso also caused zzso zzso zzso increase 4 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso following passage onto zzso showed near zzso zzso and cell spreading after 4 zzso whereas cells zzso onto zzso demonstrated adherence but minimal zzso To test whether the zzso reorganization accompanying cell spreading is required for zzso zzso zzso we assessed zzso activity following zzso with zzso D, an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso inhibited both cell spreading and zzso zzso following zzso to zzso but had no effect on growth zzso zzso zzso in adherent zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso may occur independently of zzso binding and is primarily related to the cell spreading that follows zzso
