Liver mass depends on one or more unidentified zzso signals that drive zzso when liver functional capacity is zzso zzso acids are important liver products, and their levels are tightly zzso Here, we identify a role for nuclear zzso zzso acid signaling in normal liver zzso zzso zzso acid levels accelerate zzso and decreased levels inhibit liver zzso as does the absence of the primary nuclear zzso acid zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso by increased zzso acid flux is a signal of decreased functional capacity of the zzso zzso and possibly other nuclear zzso may promote zzso not only by regulating expression of appropriate zzso target genes but also by driving zzso liver zzso
