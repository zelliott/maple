zzso are zzso involving hundreds of proteins with many functional zzso zzso assembly belongs to the key processes that enable zzso of zzso and zzso alternative zzso A detailed list of factors involved in zzso reactions has been assorted over the past decade, but, their functional interplay is often unknown and most of the present biological models cover only parts of the complete assembly zzso It is a challenging task to build a zzso model that zzso dispersed knowledge and combines a multitude of reaction schemes proposed zzso for most reactions involved in zzso assembly kinetic parameters are not available, we propose a discrete modeling using zzso zzso through which we are enabled to get insights into the system's behavior via zzso of structural and dynamic zzso In this paper, we compile and examine reactions from experimental reports that contribute to a functional zzso All these reactions form a network, which describes the inventory and conditions necessary to perform the zzso zzso The analysis is mainly based on system zzso Transition zzso zzso can be interpreted as signaling routes through the zzso Due to the huge number of zzso that arise with increasing network size and complexity, zzso common transition sets zzso and zzso were used for further zzso Additionally, we introduce a false color map zzso which allows a quick survey of network zzso and the visual detection of single reactions or reaction zzso which participate in more than one signaling zzso We designed a structured model of zzso zzso which combines the demands on a platform that zzso can display involved factors and concurrent zzso zzso offers the possibility to run zzso methods for knowledge zzso and zzso is successively zzso as new insights into zzso function are reported by experimental zzso The network consists of 161 transitions zzso and 140 places zzso All reactions are part of at least one of the 71 zzso These zzso define zzso which are in good agreement with the current knowledge and known hypotheses on reaction sequences during zzso zzso hence contributing to a functional zzso We demonstrate that present knowledge, in particular of the initial part of the assembly process, describes zzso and interaction of signaling routes, which indicate functional zzso and reflect the dependency of zzso assembly initiation on different cellular zzso The complexity of the network is further increased by two zzso which introduce alternative routes during zzso formation in early zzso assembly and upon transition from the zzso to the zzso By compiling known reactions into a complete network, the zzso nature of zzso zzso leads to pathways that have previously not been described as connected routes, although their constituents were zzso zzso divide the network into zzso which we interpret as building blocks in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso net representations of large biological networks and system zzso are zzso as a means for zzso the integration of experimental knowledge into a consistent zzso Based on this network model, the design of further experiments is zzso
