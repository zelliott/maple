The loss of skeletal muscle mass zzso that accompanies disuse and systemic diseases is highly zzso Although the zzso of this condition has been primarily studied in zzso zzso is emerging as an attractive system to investigate some of the mechanisms involved in muscle growth and zzso 

In this review, we highlight the outstanding zzso questions that may benefit from a combination of studies in both flies and zzso In particular, we discuss how different environmental stimuli and signaling pathways influence muscle mass and strength and how a variety of disease states can cause muscle zzso 

Studies in zzso and zzso should help identify molecular targets for the treatment of muscle wasting in zzso
