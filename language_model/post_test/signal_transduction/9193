In zzso cells, zzso zzso binds vascular zzso growth factor zzso and is thought to act as a zzso for zzso insert zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso and enhancing zzso zzso Here we report zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso which result in complete loss of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells reduced zzso zzso binding and migration toward a zzso zzso and markedly inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso also disrupted zzso between zzso and zzso and decreased zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso at zzso but had little effect on other signaling zzso zzso zzso however, zzso with zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso can act in a zzso manner through formation of zzso zzso with reduced binding affinity for zzso These findings indicate that zzso binding to zzso has specific effects on zzso cell signaling and is important for zzso cell migration and zzso zzso via complex formation between zzso and zzso and increased signaling to focal zzso Identification of key zzso essential for zzso binding and biological functions provides the basis for a rational design of zzso of zzso binding to zzso
