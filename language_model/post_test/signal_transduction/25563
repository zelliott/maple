zzso infection zzso complex interactions between the pathogen and the zzso zzso express several signature zzso known as zzso molecular patterns zzso which are essential for survival and zzso zzso are sensed by zzso zzso zzso host sensors known as pathogen recognition receptors zzso zzso of zzso by zzso rapidly triggers an array of zzso immune responses through the induction of various inflammatory zzso zzso and type I zzso These responses also initiate the development of zzso long-lasting zzso immunity through B and T zzso Several families of zzso including zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso and DNA receptors zzso sensors for zzso are known to play a crucial role in host zzso In this review, we zzso review the recent progress in the field of zzso recognition by zzso and the signaling pathways activated by zzso
