zzso recurrence is the dominant form of treatment failure in head and neck zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is frequently amplified in this disease zzso and can lead to zzso of zzso zzso both directly and indirectly through zzso We have shown previously that zzso could be zzso via the zzso zzso Here we investigate the contribution of zzso to this zzso and its impact on treatment zzso 

In a series of 38 zzso cancer patients, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was zzso zzso signaling was evaluated by zzso for zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso Both zzso and zzso were then related to zzso zzso survival was determined in the zzso cell line, a zzso zzso cell line derived from a zzso zzso cancer, after pharmacological blockade of zzso with zzso of Ras by the zzso zzso or of zzso by zzso 

A significant association was found between zzso zzso and local control in the patient zzso zzso local control was zzso for patients zzso zzso for zzso as compared with zzso for patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In our series of 38 zzso zzso 30 zzso of the specimens were strongly zzso positive for zzso whereas 25 zzso were moderately to strongly zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso might be a zzso marker for response to therapy, and zzso could be a useful target for zzso These results also suggest that signaling from zzso to zzso can lead to zzso
