zzso bone disease is due to bone degradation by zzso and absence of repair by bone forming zzso Recent observations suggest that the zzso drug zzso a zzso zzso stimulates bone formation and may inhibit bone zzso Here, we tested zzso on cultured zzso in conditions mimicking the pulse treatment used in the clinic, thereby avoiding continuous zzso zzso and zzso zzso A 3 h pulse with 25 zzso zzso followed by a zzso culture in its absence markedly inhibited zzso activity as evaluated through bone zzso zzso release, and zzso zzso zzso into zzso an event dependent on zzso and critical for zzso zzso The effect on zzso was zzso during the first 24 h zzso and then tended to zzso zzso applying this pulse treatment to cultured myeloma cells drastically reduced their zzso We measured next the levels of two bone zzso markers in patients during the 3 days following five and seven therapeutic zzso zzso zzso These levels decreased significantly already 1-2 days after injection, and then increased, showing temporary zzso of zzso activity and zzso the in zzso effect on zzso Our study demonstrates a direct zzso of zzso by zzso in conditions relevant to treatment of zzso
