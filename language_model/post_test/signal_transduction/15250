zzso zzso approaches have been used to study signaling zzso However, identification of biologically relevant hits from a single screen remains challenging due to limitations inherent in each individual zzso To overcome these limitations, we implemented an zzso zzso approach and used it to identify zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso interaction mapping method was used in conjunction with two functional screens that examined the effect of zzso and zzso gene zzso on zzso zzso zzso of the three data sets yielded a combined zzso score zzso for each tested zzso a value reflecting the likelihood that an individual protein is a zzso zzso zzso We characterized the role of two proteins with high zzso zzso and zzso We show that zzso interacts with and zzso zzso stability, and that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso signaling requires interaction with zzso itself a negative zzso zzso Thus, integrated physical and functional mapping in zzso cells can identify signaling components with high confidence and provides unanticipated insights into zzso zzso
