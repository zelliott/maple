The zzso zzso of zzso domain zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells was effectively inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso toxin or zzso blocking zzso zzso Moreover, zzso toxin reduced zzso of the cells to collagen by approximately zzso and zzso against zzso zzso had a similar effect that was in fact additive to that of zzso zzso zzso toxin had accordingly no such effect on zzso By comparison, zzso toxin did not influence zzso of zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso tumor cells, neither of which express zzso or exhibit zzso of zzso In accordance with these results, direct zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells enabled zzso zzso of zzso and enhanced their zzso The inactive analogue zzso had no such effects on zzso cells nor did active zzso affect zzso of zzso zzso zzso A possible explanation for how zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso comes from our observations that zzso toxin also inhibited the recruitment of the zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso to zzso as well as its zzso In accordance with that, the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly impaired zzso of normal zzso zzso cells but had little effect on zzso of zzso zzso zzso Thus, a zzso signaling zzso mediates the effect of zzso expression by enabling zzso zzso of zzso which, in parallel with zzso zzso regulates zzso of zzso zzso
