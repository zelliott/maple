zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso chain is highly expressed on some tumor cell lines and primary cell zzso This zzso chain plays an important role in zzso binding and zzso To determine the functional significance of zzso of this chain, we zzso zzso zzso chain in human breast zzso and pancreatic zzso cancer cell lines that naturally do not express this zzso There was no difference in growth between zzso only zzso and zzso chain zzso cells in zzso However, surprisingly, in zzso mice, zzso was profoundly inhibited in zzso chain zzso zzso Because breast tumors that grew later showed loss of zzso gene zzso lack of zzso correlated positively with zzso chain zzso zzso cells including zzso and zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso tumors and zzso were found to produce zzso zzso showed a modest zzso activity to zzso chain zzso tumors in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso chain zzso tumors zzso produced zzso that has been shown to have zzso zzso These results establish a novel function of a zzso zzso chain and further suggest that the presence of this chain on tumor cells by itself may play a key role in zzso
