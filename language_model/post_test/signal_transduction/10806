zzso in the von zzso zzso tumor zzso gene cause zzso tumors, with a striking zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression zzso to zzso and clear cell zzso cell zzso whereas specific point zzso zzso to zzso zzso or combinations of zzso zzso cell zzso and/or zzso The zzso protein zzso has been implicated in many cellular activities including the zzso response, cell cycle arrest, zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have expressed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso embryonic stem cells to test zzso correlations in zzso zzso We first examined the ability of zzso zzso to direct degradation of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso zzso proteins restored proper hypoxic regulation of zzso although one zzso zzso zzso displayed impaired binding to zzso zzso This zzso also failed to restore zzso zzso In separate zzso these embryonic stem cells were used to generate zzso in zzso mice, allowing independent assessment of the effects of specific zzso zzso on tumor zzso Surprisingly, zzso expressing the zzso zzso protein displayed a growth zzso despite restoring zzso zzso Finally, we observed increased zzso density in zzso derived from zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso embryonic stem zzso Together, these observations support the hypothesis that zzso plays multiple roles in the cell, and that these activities can be separated via discrete zzso point zzso The ability to dissect specific zzso functions with zzso zzso in a zzso model offers a novel opportunity to zzso the activities of zzso as a tumor zzso
