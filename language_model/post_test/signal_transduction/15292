Although the cancer stem cell zzso concept implies that zzso are rare, recent reports suggest that zzso may be frequent in some zzso We hypothesized that the proportion of leukemia stem cells would vary as a function of the number of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso served as a zzso model, and zzso of zzso and a zzso gene served as a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso number and in zzso expansion potential of zzso were functionally assessed by limiting dilution zzso zzso expansion potential was zzso increased in the zzso compared with the zzso model, although zzso both zzso were zzso The zzso model was characterized by zzso zzso factor zzso hypersensitivity and activated zzso zzso zzso hypersensitivity of the zzso model zzso was lost in zzso cells, and the zzso expansion potential was reduced by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Interestingly, in 201 acute zzso leukemia zzso patients, zzso of zzso and zzso was restricted to patients with the poorest prognosis and was associated with highly active zzso zzso Our data demonstrate the functional zzso of zzso and show that zzso signaling is critical for leukemia stem cell zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
