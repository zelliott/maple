Unlike the thoroughly investigated zzso population in the hair zzso of the zzso the growth and differentiation requirements of the zzso in the eye, zzso zzso and inner ear - the so-called zzso zzso - remain zzso In this study, we investigated the in zzso and in zzso effects of the factors that regulate zzso development on the stem cells or the precursors of these zzso zzso In general, a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling leads to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso in the eye, ear and zzso zzso were revealed to be less sensitive to zzso signaling than zzso zzso Instead, zzso in the eye and zzso zzso were zzso more effectively by zzso 3 zzso or zzso growth factor zzso signals than by zzso zzso and the precursors of these zzso expressed the lowest amount of zzso The growth and differentiation of these zzso zzso were specifically inhibited by zzso for zzso and zzso In transgenic mice induced to express zzso or zzso in their skin and zzso zzso from human zzso 14 zzso the survival and differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso were zzso apparently irrespective of zzso zzso These results provide a molecular basis for the clear discrimination between zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso a difference that might be important in the zzso of zzso diseases and zzso
