The lateral nucleus of the zzso zzso has been implicated in the formation of long-term zzso memory zzso of stimuli associated with danger through fear zzso The current study aims to detect genes that are expressed in LA following zzso fear zzso Using zzso zzso we monitored gene expression in rats subjected to paired training where a tone zzso with a zzso or zzso training where the tone and zzso are presented in a zzso zzso The paired protocol consistently leads to auditory fear conditioning memory formation, whereas the zzso protocol does zzso When the paired group was compared with the zzso group 5 h after training, the expression of genes coding for the zzso zzso membrane protein zzso zzso heavy chain member 2 zzso zzso fusion protein zzso and zzso 4 protein zzso was higher in the paired zzso These genes zzso proteins that regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycling and release zzso and zzso and zzso zzso maintenance in zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso are expressed hours following fear conditioning but minutes after zzso zzso zzso is induced by paired stimulation only 5 h after the zzso These results show that fear conditioning zzso a unique zzso zzso of molecular pathways involved in regulating synaptic transmission and zzso zzso in zzso which is different from zzso zzso
