In brain, a brief zzso episode zzso protection against a subsequent severe zzso zzso This phenomenon is known as zzso neural zzso zzso An understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso helps in identifying potential therapeutic targets for preventing the zzso brain zzso The present study conducted the zzso and zzso analysis of adult rat brain as a function of time following zzso induced by a zzso transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso analysis showed induction of 40 putative zzso transcripts between 3 to 72 h after zzso These included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso data for the transcripts zzso after zzso zzso gel zzso combined with zzso analysis showed increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso at 24 h after zzso zzso protein induction after zzso was localized in the cortical zzso zzso The zzso volume induced by focal zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly smaller (by 38 zzso zzso p zzso zzso in rats subjected to zzso 3 days before the zzso zzso also prevented several gene expression changes induced by focal zzso
