zzso data were analyzed using zzso tools to screen marker genes of human zzso stem cells zzso in response to bone zzso protein 6 zzso 

A total of 190 zzso expressed genes were zzso The interaction network was divided into three functional zzso These genes were connected with zzso signaling pathways and regulation of cell zzso while zzso and zzso participated in the transforming growth zzso signal zzso Besides, several related small molecules were zzso 

zzso genes in zzso responses to zzso treatment for zzso were screened with zzso data along with elaborate function analysis by zzso zzso and zzso showed potential to become indicators to monitor the directed differentiation of zzso into zzso which can be used for bone disease zzso Moreover, small molecules such as zzso were retrieved and provided directions for future drug zzso
