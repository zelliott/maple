zzso is widely used as a sedative and zzso induction zzso The aim of this study was to systematically examine the zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso were explored by means of analysis of the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso breakdown, zzso zzso zzso measurement of membrane zzso zzso B2 formation, and protein zzso C zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in human zzso zzso by zzso zzso also zzso inhibited zzso breakdown and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso formation zzso by collagen in human zzso Moreover, zzso (15 and 26 zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso Rapid zzso of a zzso protein of Mr zzso zzso a marker of protein zzso C zzso was triggered by collagen (2 zzso This zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso activity of zzso may be involved in the following zzso the effects of zzso may initially be caused by induction of zzso changes in zzso zzso leading to a change in the activity of zzso C, and subsequent zzso of zzso breakdown and zzso zzso formation, thereby leading to zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
