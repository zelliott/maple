Natural killer zzso cells are zzso zzso that are generated from zzso stem cells and play vital roles in the innate immune response against tumors and viral zzso Generation of zzso cells is known to require several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso but not zzso or zzso Here we investigated the in zzso role of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its primary zzso zzso in zzso zzso The numbers of zzso cells appeared normal in zzso lacking zzso or zzso however, the numbers of functional zzso cells were severely reduced in the bone zzso zzso and peripheral blood from adult zzso zzso deficient mice compared with control animals, probably resulting from zzso zzso zzso In culture, zzso enhanced the generation of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso and immature zzso zzso In the bone zzso expression of zzso zzso was considerably higher in zzso zzso zzso cells than in other zzso cells, and most zzso cells were in contact with the processes of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso signaling is essential for zzso development in adults, and zzso cells might function as a niche for zzso cells in bone zzso
