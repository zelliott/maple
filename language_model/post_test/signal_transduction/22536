zzso in zzso is a nutritionally sensitive process, and short-term increases in zzso flux can stimulate zzso in sheep and zzso These short-term effects are probably zzso directly at the zzso level to modify zzso zzso growth and zzso The zzso appears to have a number of zzso zzso mechanism that may form the link between zzso status and zzso This review examines the evidence for the presence of pathways that may sense zzso flux from within the zzso including the insulin zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso pathway, zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso The review then zzso the available evidence concerning their mechanisms in the zzso and zzso on how these zzso zzso pathways are integrated into the zzso zzso pathways to adjust zzso zzso zzso We conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that the zzso does contain more than one functional zzso zzso zzso that have zzso effects on some zzso functions such as the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso These pathways include insulin, zzso and zzso There is also a good case for the integration of zzso in the zzso sensing of zzso zzso However, there is little evidence at present to suggest the zzso zzso zzso has functional significance in the zzso as a sensor of zzso zzso Further study will be required to fully understand zzso zzso pathways in the zzso and their zzso with zzso zzso zzso
