The native zzso zzso zzso which is a G zzso zzso that signals via the zzso zzso pathway, has been assumed to be inactive in the absence of zzso In contrast, a zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso was shown previously to exhibit zzso (or zzso signaling zzso In this report, we measured signaling activity of zzso using a protein zzso zzso reporter gene instead of formation of zzso zzso second zzso zzso Using this more sensitive system, we show that native mouse zzso exhibit zzso signaling activity that is directly zzso to the number of receptors expressed in zzso cells and is inhibited by negative zzso zzso zzso As expected, the zzso signaling activity of native zzso is lower than zzso zzso zzso activity of native zzso is not peculiar to zzso cells in which zzso density is markedly zzso because it can also be demonstrated in zzso zzso canine kidney cells zzso expressing mouse zzso and zzso cells zzso expressing rat zzso These findings support the thesis that native zzso zzso between active and inactive zzso We suggest that demonstration of zzso activity of native receptors may depend on the sensitivity of the signaling zzso zzso
