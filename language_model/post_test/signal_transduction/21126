In rat liver zzso cells zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso stimulate a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso increase in zzso calcium failed to stimulate the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but was well correlated with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso II, which increased both protein zzso C zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso but produced a smaller, less zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso which slowly activated zzso did not stimulate zzso These findings suggest either that zzso is not involved in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso The consequence of zzso zzso zzso was reflected in zzso and zzso zzso induction following treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso which only minimally induced zzso produced a much greater and more prolonged zzso response than zzso zzso zzso of another zzso second messenger, zzso for zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso by approximately zzso but likewise had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso In zzso two pathways stimulate zzso in cells expressing zzso a zzso zzso modifiable by zzso and zzso protein zzso and a zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso the zzso by zzso can ultimately alter gene expression initiated by a calcium zzso
