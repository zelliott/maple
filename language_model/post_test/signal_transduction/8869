Two families with a zzso zzso zzso at zzso 17 of the zzso gene and multiple gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso have been zzso Recently, we generated a zzso mouse model of the family, and mice with zzso corresponding to human zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso In this report, we examined the in zzso effect of zzso on tumor progression in zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso body weight was administered to zzso zzso mice orally for 7, 14 and 28 days, and zzso tumors were zzso Both zzso size and the measured volume of zzso tumors were not significantly reduced after a zzso zzso and zzso administration of zzso when compared with those before zzso zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso and the labeling index significantly decreased after zzso administration, but the value of the index after zzso was only about half compared with that before zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso revealed that zzso expression was almost zzso but zzso zzso was significantly but not completely inhibited in tumor zzso after 7, 14 and 28 days of zzso administration when compared with that before zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was accordingly inhibited after zzso zzso Thus, zzso seemed to inhibit in zzso tumor proliferation but not decrease tumor volume on this mouse model, probably because of an insufficient zzso of zzso of zzso and its downstream signaling zzso These results suggested that progression of multiple zzso in patients with zzso zzso might be partially controlled by zzso and that model mice provide an opportunity to examine the effect of various other targeted drugs on in zzso tumor zzso
