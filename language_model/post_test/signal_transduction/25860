Ras proteins are crucial players in differentiation and zzso and constitute important drug zzso The zzso and activity of Ras proteins are highly dependent on zzso modifications at their zzso In addition to an zzso zzso zzso but not other Ras zzso possesses two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso domain that act as zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that zzso bind to zzso and activate zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso selectively bind to the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that these zzso bind simultaneously zzso and zzso of zzso thus potentially altering the zzso tendencies of the zzso zzso Based on these results, we have explored the capacity of several zzso zzso zzso small molecules to bind to the zzso domain of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso oxide zzso a widely used zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso agent used for zzso zzso effectively bind zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso takes place in zzso and in cells and blocks modification of zzso by zzso Moreover, zzso treatment selectively alters zzso membrane partition and the pattern of zzso zzso in cells, from the plasma membrane to zzso These results identify zzso as a novel target for zzso More importantly, these observations reveal that small molecules or zzso zzso interacting with zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso of zzso zzso potentially contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso
