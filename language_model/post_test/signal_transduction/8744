This study identified, on the zzso level, two components of the zzso II signaling zzso that lay downstream from the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso and are critically involved in maintaining vascular relaxation in cerebral resistance zzso In these experiments, the relaxation of isolated middle cerebral arteries zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso was lost and the ratio of zzso was significantly reduced in zzso of male zzso rats fed a zzso zzso zzso zzso diet to suppress plasma zzso II zzso In zzso rats, relaxation of zzso in response to these zzso stimuli was restored by chronic (3 zzso intravenous infusion of either zzso II (5 zzso or zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso The protective effect of zzso II infusion to restore vascular relaxation was eliminated by zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (20 zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso or the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso (5 zzso In rats fed a zzso zzso zzso diet, zzso relaxation in response to zzso reduced zzso and zzso was eliminated by intravenous infusion of zzso zzso or zzso In zzso zzso rats fed HS diet, and in rats fed zzso diet, zzso responses to reduced zzso and zzso were unaffected by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These findings indicate that maintenance of normal vascular relaxation mechanisms by zzso II in rat zzso requires zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
