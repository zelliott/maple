Major advances in our understanding of how zzso cells sense and respond to zzso forces and, more specifically, to fluid zzso stress have been achieved during the past 3 zzso These include definition of potential zzso stress receptors and multiple zzso pathways that mediate zzso stress regulation of gene zzso A few studies have also pointed to the unique effects of complex zzso stress on zzso zzso thus leading to better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development of zzso
