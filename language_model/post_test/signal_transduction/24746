zzso zzso zzso exhibit extensive directional migration zzso and zzso zzso We have developed an in zzso model to evaluate the organization of the zzso organizing center zzso in zzso as the latter interact with various zzso including immobilized zzso zzso zzso were layered on zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso complex zzso and the location of zzso was determined by indirect zzso of zzso using conventional zzso zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso The zzso in the majority of the zzso attached to zzso occupied an zzso location zzso zzso zzso while in the majority of zzso layered onto zzso a zzso location zzso zzso zzso was zzso Following disruption of zzso zzso by zzso before layering the cells on the zzso the proportions of zzso with zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso while the proportions of zzso with zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso in human zzso in zzso zzso occupied a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso location upon stimulation with immobilized zzso complex; zzso and depended on intact zzso for placement of zzso in both zzso
