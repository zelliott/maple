The sorting of signaling receptors within the zzso system is important for appropriate cellular zzso After zzso receptors are zzso to early zzso and either recycled or sorted to zzso and zzso Most receptors zzso to zzso are modified with zzso and recruited into an zzso zzso enriched in zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso component of the zzso complex required for transport zzso machinery, and then sorted into zzso zzso zzso of zzso bodies zzso However, not all receptors use zzso or the zzso zzso machinery to sort to zzso This is exemplified by zzso zzso zzso a G zzso zzso for zzso which sorts to zzso independent of zzso and zzso We recently showed that the zzso protein zzso binds to zzso recruits zzso and mediates zzso sorting to zzso of zzso However, the mechanism that zzso zzso sorting at the early zzso is not zzso We now report that the zzso protein zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso sorting to zzso through an zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif and mediates zzso zzso degradation independent of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso suggesting that zzso functions before zzso engagement of zzso and zzso zzso
