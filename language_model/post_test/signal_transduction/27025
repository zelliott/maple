The following proteins have been identified in zzso lung and zzso using zzso by bacterial zzso zzso and zzso 41 zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso and 45 zzso zzso of zzso zzso 36 zzso beta 1 and 35 zzso beta 2 zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso the zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso proteins binding with a high affinity to zzso These zzso and zzso are contained in various proportions in membrane and zzso zzso of lung and zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso alpha (but not beta 1 or zzso my partially zzso zzso zzso from the membrane by the action of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso with low zzso strength buffer solutions in the presence of zzso is accompanied by the release of zzso sensitive to zzso cough toxin zzso alpha and beta i zzso The functionally coupled into a alpha beta gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso present in the zzso fraction as well as the zzso revealed by zzso (but not the zzso sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso may interact with zzso zzso zzso of these proteins are associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction of the zzso A conclusion is drawn that interactions of zzso and zzso with zzso filaments may be the reason for the formation of zzso structure in a zzso
