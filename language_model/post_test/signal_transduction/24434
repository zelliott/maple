Published studies reveal that zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso stimulate alkaline zzso (AP) activity and bone zzso formation in fetal rat zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether there are interactions between the signal zzso pathways activated by these two growth zzso zzso did not significantly affect the levels of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso B zzso a protein zzso that is downstream of zzso zzso By comparison, zzso increased the levels of the zzso forms of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso did not significantly alter the stimulation of zzso activity by zzso or zzso in combination with zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso blocked the induction of zzso activity by zzso and zzso plus zzso Treatment of cells with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso target of zzso resulted in a zzso and a zzso decrease in the zzso activity induced by zzso alone and by zzso plus zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the induction of zzso activity by zzso and the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso on zzso activity in zzso zzso
