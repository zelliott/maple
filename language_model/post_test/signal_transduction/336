The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the main signaling zzso for the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso in the development of two vascular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso deficient mice were crossed to an LDL zzso deficient background and were induced for the development of either zzso or zzso zzso and compared to zzso controls, zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient mice developed zzso smaller zzso zzso in the zzso zzso compared to zzso Moreover, expression of zzso a zzso specific marker, exhibited a 50% reduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with a strong zzso in the expression of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso by zzso zzso deficient zzso In addition, expression levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced in zzso of zzso zzso deficient zzso In contrast, in the zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with a slight trend towards increased zzso zzso but the zzso of zzso zzso due to a zzso aneurysm, and the expansion of the zzso zzso were not significantly different compared to zzso 

We found that zzso zzso expression promotes zzso among other mechanisms, by enhancing expression of zzso zzso zzso while it seems to have no major role in the development of zzso zzso
