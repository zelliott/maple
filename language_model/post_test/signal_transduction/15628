Signaling via zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a central component of zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has substantially increased understanding of how zzso activate cellular zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso containing adapter molecules provide important links between zzso and zzso zzso Here, we review data on zzso adapter proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso adapter zzso of 32 zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso families, with a focus on the latter zzso Current data support the model that recruitment of these adapters to the plasma membrane of activated zzso is driven by the zzso zzso and zzso generated through the action of zzso and under the regulatory control of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso At the plasma zzso these adapters serve to assemble distinct protein zzso zzso and zzso function to promote zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso and promote zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso interactions between B and T zzso zzso can provide zzso amplification or feedback zzso of zzso zzso Current work is further defining the molecular interactions driven by these molecules and identifying the functions of zzso zzso which also appear to be involved in zzso zzso and are specific zzso downstream of the zzso product zzso
