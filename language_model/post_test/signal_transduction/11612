The aquatic zzso zzso zzso produces different types of leaves in response to changes in natural environment and culture zzso When the conditions are in favor of producing the zzso leaves, zzso application of the plant hormone zzso acid zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso responsive to zzso were localized to the shoot zzso zzso and the associated organ zzso From these zzso at least two tiers of zzso early genes were identified, including seven primary genes and zzso secondary zzso These zzso designated zzso for zzso zzso showed diverse expression patterns during the course of zzso zzso Changes in the transcript level of zzso genes started early, within zzso h after the addition of zzso to the culture zzso Some changes were transient while the others were zzso The zzso contain extensive sequence zzso to known zzso including those zzso zzso factors, protein zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso structural proteins and those zzso by the zzso zzso Identification of these zzso is a first step toward the understanding of the regulation mechanisms of zzso and the results suggest the involvement of novel zzso and regulatory pathways in zzso zzso
