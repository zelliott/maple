The zzso protein zzso zzso links cellular proliferation control to zzso and is critical for normal development and cancer zzso Here we define a zzso zzso in which deregulation of zzso by zzso zzso expression or zzso zzso by zzso of human zzso type 16 signals zzso by inducing the expression of zzso a component of the DNA damage zzso zzso and zzso zzso are compromised in cells from patients with the related disorders zzso zzso and zzso breakage syndrome lacking functional zzso and zzso gene products, zzso Both zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso and zzso zzso following deregulation of normal zzso growth zzso zzso a related zzso family member that does not induce zzso also activates zzso resulting in zzso of zzso However, we found that the key commitment step in zzso induction is the ability of zzso and not zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a central role in signaling disturbances in the zzso growth control zzso and, by zzso of zzso may sensitize cells to undergo zzso
