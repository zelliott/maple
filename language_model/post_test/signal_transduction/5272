The zzso rule zzso targets protein degradation through the identity of the zzso zzso of specific protein zzso Two components of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown to regulate seed zzso zzso sugar sensitivity, zzso zzso breakdown, and zzso acid zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso seeds to zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced with zzso time, suggesting that seeds display a previously zzso window of sensitivity to zzso zzso root growth of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso double zzso was rescued by zzso zzso and the breakdown of zzso bodies and zzso zzso was impaired in zzso zzso implicating the zzso rule zzso in control of seed oil zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso control of zzso and establishment, as exemplified by zzso and sugar sensitivity, as well as storage oil zzso occurs at least in part via zzso factors zzso and zzso The zzso rule zzso of protein turnover is therefore zzso to zzso zzso unidentified key zzso of zzso signaling to influence the zzso zzso
