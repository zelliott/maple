zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling pathways may play a relevant role in determining the activity of zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso We investigated possible associations between genetic zzso and clinical outcomes of zzso patients treated with zzso salvage zzso 

Patients who underwent zzso salvage therapy after disease progression during or after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemotherapy and a zzso zzso regimen were considered eligible for analysis of zzso with putative influence on zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied for a possible association with overall survival zzso as the primary end zzso Additional analyses were addressed at possible associations among zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In 110 zzso patients, significant association with favorable zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso 61 zzso zzso In the zzso model, zzso zzso zzso and zzso 61 zzso zzso showed a hazard ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers showed more frequent zzso skin toxicity zzso test zzso zzso P zzso zzso and treatment response zzso test zzso zzso P zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although additional studies are required for confirmation, our findings could zzso the use of zzso in zzso zzso
