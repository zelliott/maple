zzso zzso in asthma is associated with the zzso of zzso the primary cell responsible for synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The process by which the number of zzso increases in asthma is poorly zzso but zzso transition zzso may play a significant zzso 

To evaluate whether zzso occurs in primary airway zzso cells zzso the mechanisms involved, and if this process is altered in zzso zzso 

zzso were obtained from subjects with asthma zzso zzso 8) and normal subjects without asthma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cultures were treated with transforming growth factor zzso (10 zzso for 72 hours and zzso for zzso and zzso markers using quantitative zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso and zzso The involvement of zzso zzso and zzso signaling were also zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso derived from subjects with asthma and normal zzso zzso was characterized by changes in cell zzso increased expression of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso and loss of zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling with zzso zzso or zzso zzso prevented and reversed zzso respectively, whereas zzso had no zzso In zzso cultures derived from normal subjects, zzso was confined to zzso situated cells, whereas in zzso zzso cultures zzso was widespread throughout the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner in primary zzso However, in zzso zzso cultures, the number of cells undergoing zzso is zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso repair in zzso airways is zzso
