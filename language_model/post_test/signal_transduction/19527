zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso syndrome caused by a dominant zzso in the gene zzso zzso A, which leads to an zzso spliced and processed protein termed zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso early zzso associated with increased zzso signaling and that zzso extends zzso cellular zzso We demonstrate that zzso extends zzso cellular lifespan by decreasing zzso zzso signaling and zzso of zzso and zzso pathways that otherwise mediate the onset of premature zzso We show further that zzso zzso signaling is localized to zzso and is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling is relatively zzso requires both its zzso and zzso functions, and zzso in time with the acquisition by zzso cells of the ability to zzso All of these findings establish that zzso premature cellular zzso results from zzso zzso zzso
