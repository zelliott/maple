Plant zzso is a unique zzso acid zzso protein first isolated from barley zzso zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso trafficking and in the zzso zzso zzso network in zzso To examine the roles of plant zzso barley zzso was zzso expressed in barley zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins inhibited zzso zzso formation of large zzso zzso which is an important aspect of zzso programmed cell death in zzso zzso The effect of zzso was specific, because zzso of green fluorescent protein or another zzso zzso zzso did not lead to the same zzso zzso acts downstream of the zzso factor zzso which activates programmed cell death and other zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso fluorescent protein fusion proteins showed network and zzso zzso patterns, which were zzso with an zzso marker, zzso and a zzso marker, zzso zzso In particular, the zzso domain 2 was critical for protein zzso and zzso zzso expression of the most zzso similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in the zzso of zzso to a similar level as zzso indicating function conservation between barley zzso and some zzso zzso Taken together, we show that zzso is an zzso and zzso protein capable of zzso regulating zzso zzso cell death in barley zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso proteins to inhibit zzso trafficking involved in zzso zzso to delay zzso of protein storage zzso as part of its role in regulating seed zzso and zzso zzso
