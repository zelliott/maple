zzso evidence has shown the expression of the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso In the present experiments the expression of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in human zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso was found in cultures of human zzso zzso cells zzso and a human zzso cell line zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and small amounts of zzso were also zzso Positive zzso was demonstrated in zzso in zzso cells of the human zzso zzso In addition, in experiments with zzso laser scanning zzso positive zzso zzso was found in zzso in zzso cells of human skin blood zzso In the first functional experiments with zzso zzso appeared to mediate a small zzso effect on the expression of zzso zzso zzso The present experiments demonstrate the wide existence of zzso in human zzso zzso Further experiments are addressed to zzso the biological role of zzso in the zzso and possible differences between the different zzso of zzso zzso
