zzso X zzso zzso mediates important signaling functions of zzso acids in diverse cell types including those residing in the vascular zzso Indeed, recent work has identified zzso as a potential regulator of vascular structure and function in part through zzso zzso of zzso However, the signal zzso pathways linking zzso acids to changes in zzso zzso that are responsible for zzso zzso vascular cell migration remain zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid, zzso acid zzso significantly increased zzso cell zzso zzso as analyzed by time zzso video zzso and tube formation, an in zzso correlate for zzso Increased cell zzso was associated with prominent increases in focal zzso zzso plaques and was inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso indicating a zzso of this signaling zzso zzso incubation of cells with zzso was associated with zzso of a key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso but not at zzso or zzso Studies using a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso induced zzso of the downstream zzso assembly zzso zzso Lastly, zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso induced zzso of zzso cell zzso and vascular tube zzso 

Thus, this study demonstrates a pivotal role for zzso in the process of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and vascular tube zzso
