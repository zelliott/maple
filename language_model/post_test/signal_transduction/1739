While the mechanisms governing zzso zzso zzso actions are becoming increasingly zzso relatively little is known with regard to the cell signaling pathways that zzso rapid zzso zzso Studies of the cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a naturally zzso region of the fish zzso zzso that contains a zzso pure population of zzso zzso cells and is easily dissected and maintained in a completely zzso zzso media, indicate that zzso zzso of cortisol rapidly inhibit zzso zzso The zzso action of cortisol on zzso release occurs within zzso zzso is insensitive to the protein synthesis zzso zzso and zzso by its membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso known to work through membrane receptors to inhibit zzso release, rapidly and zzso reduces zzso free zzso zzso and zzso zzso influx and zzso induced zzso zzso zzso investigations show zzso but not zzso suppresses zzso C zzso activity in zzso cell membrane zzso In addition, cortisol and zzso reduce zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the acute zzso effects of cortisol on zzso release occur through a zzso mechanism involving interactions with the plasma membrane and zzso of both the zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso may reduce zzso by zzso influx through zzso zzso channels and possibly release through a zzso zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso In addition, it is also likely the steroid zzso zzso zzso activity in events leading to reduced zzso production and the subsequent release of zzso
