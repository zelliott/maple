The chicken zzso upstream zzso factors zzso are zzso members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso and zzso However, their role in skeletal muscle (and other major mass zzso and metabolism remains zzso zzso muscle accounts for approximately zzso of total body mass and energy zzso Moreover, this peripheral tissue is a primary site of zzso and fatty acid zzso We zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso and II zzso and zzso in a skeletal muscle cell culture model to understand the regulatory role of zzso in this energy demanding zzso This targeted zzso repression resulted in the significant zzso of genes that regulate zzso zzso and zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso This was coupled to reduced fatty acid zzso zzso we observed significant zzso of zzso a gene involved in energy zzso zzso we observed a zzso increase in zzso levels in cells with zzso repression of zzso and zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso liver X zzso zzso target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport zzso and zzso were both significantly zzso Moreover, we observed that repression of the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression by the selective zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells were zzso to zzso reduction of total zzso cholesterol levels in contrast to the negative control zzso In agreement zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso cells was zzso zzso these data suggest a pivotal role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle cells and the zzso of zzso gene zzso
