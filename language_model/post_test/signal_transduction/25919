zzso zzso which primarily regulates zzso and its zzso zzso are expressed in the brain, where zzso exhibits zzso effects on zzso In the present study, we investigated the implication of zzso in experimental zzso zzso Following zzso infection with the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso we observed zzso of zzso zzso expression at 12 h and 24 h in brain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso at 12 h and returned to baseline at 24 zzso Compared to zzso mice, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of bacteria in blood or zzso fluid zzso as well as zzso zzso were not significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso In human zzso brain, zzso protein was zzso to zzso during zzso In zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was induced by zzso medium but not by bacterial zzso or by medium zzso by zzso zzso defective in hydrogen zzso formation zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that zzso acts as a zzso of zzso damage in bacterial zzso
