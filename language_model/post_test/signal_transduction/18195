zzso expresses on a variety of tumors and is suspected to modify the zzso between tumor and the immune zzso However, the cellular zzso in tumor cells leading to an zzso expression of zzso is zzso In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of Ras signaling in the zzso expression in several zzso First, the activated zzso gene enhanced the zzso expression of primary human zzso zzso Second, blocking the Ras signal zzso in zzso cells by zzso or the zzso zzso zzso gene resulted in reduced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso into zzso cells also inhibited the zzso of zzso which is a downstream component of Ras zzso zzso the zzso zzso competitor suppressed the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression coincided with the Ras activity in the zzso 212 cells, in which the Ras activity could be induced by zzso zzso In zzso these results suggest that the enhanced Ras signaling with consequential zzso zzso which is a frequent zzso found in tumors, could mediate the zzso expression of zzso
