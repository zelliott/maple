zzso of surface folate receptors or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 in zzso triggers within zzso s an influx of zzso zzso that continues for 20 zzso To further characterize the zzso zzso entry, we analyzed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso present during zzso zzso Both receptors induced a zzso zzso zzso that had comparable zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor profiles as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso indicated that zzso zzso entry does not require G protein alpha zzso G alpha 1, G alpha 2, G alpha 3, G alpha 4, G alpha 7, or G alpha zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in g alpha zzso cells did not restore certain G alpha zzso events, such as zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but these strains displayed a zzso zzso influx with zzso comparable to zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a plasma zzso zzso system may be activated by at least four distinct zzso during zzso development and that the response may be independent of G zzso
