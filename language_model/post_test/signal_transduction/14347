It has been reported that zzso C virus zzso may zzso and replicate in human T cells, particularly in zzso zzso zzso but the extent and consequence of zzso infection in patients is zzso This study is conducted to characterize the parameters and functional consequences of zzso infection in T zzso By using a zzso zzso strain, we showed that zzso could zzso T cell lines zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected for several weeks after zzso zzso proteins could also be detected by zzso zzso Moreover, infectious zzso particles were produced from zzso cell cultures, and could be used to zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso could also zzso human primary zzso T cells, particularly zzso zzso zzso cells, in zzso The amounts of zzso and zzso zzso proteins in the infected zzso cells were significantly less than those in zzso cultures, suggesting the possibility of zzso in zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso zzso levels after zzso stimulation in infected zzso were zzso In conclusion, zzso could zzso and zzso replicate in T cells and that zzso replication suppressed the zzso signaling due to the reduction of zzso and zzso of its zzso zzso
