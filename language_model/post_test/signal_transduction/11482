The classic view of the zzso as a zzso produced by the zzso cell that signals survival to the zzso cell has become zzso zzso discusses the evidence that the zzso zzso nerve growth factor zzso can be also released from the zzso cell onto the zzso spine of a zzso cell to regulate the zzso circuit in two directions: forward (from zzso cell to zzso zzso and the classic backward direction (from zzso cell to the zzso zzso These results remind us that in the brain, zzso exist in a complex circuit and one zzso zzso cell is another zzso zzso zzso The evidence that a single growth factor may have different actions based on the zzso of the zzso of the signal adds more complexity to the zzso zzso zzso
