Environmental enrichment zzso was found to facilitate memory functioning and neural plasticity in normal and zzso impaired zzso However, the ability of this manipulation to rescue memory and its biological zzso in animals with specific genetically based deficits in these functions has not been extensively zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso in two mouse models of impaired memory functioning and zzso Previous research demonstrated that mice with a deletion of the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and mice with zzso transgenic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso display impaired zzso memory and long-term zzso zzso We report here a corrective effect of zzso on spatial and contextual memory in zzso and zzso mice and reveal two mechanisms for this beneficial effect: zzso with their disturbed memory zzso zzso in zzso mice that were raised in a regular environment is impaired, and their zzso spine size is zzso Both of these zzso were corrected by environmental zzso No deficiencies in zzso or zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso were found in zzso mice that were raised in a regular environment, and both of these variables were increased to a similar degree in enriched zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that exposure to an enriched environment may be beneficial for individuals with impaired learning and memory related to genetic zzso of zzso signaling (and possibly other genetic zzso by reversing zzso in zzso zzso zzso and spine size and by promoting zzso and zzso factors zzso
