zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates insulin signaling and zzso zzso zzso In this work, the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso action of insulin was determined by analyzing zzso induced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the insulin zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso effect, but the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso Exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within 3 h and zzso within 12 zzso The effect of zzso on insulin action greatly diminished when zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso in insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso by the insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most probable target of zzso is zzso
