zzso zzso is an important character for plant growth and seed zzso We identified a rice zzso that was delayed in its zzso There, zzso was inserted into zzso zzso Delayed zzso zzso 1 zzso causing a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene enhanced seed zzso zzso is most similar to zzso zzso an zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso experiments showed that our zzso binds to zzso indicating that zzso is a rice zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso expressed zzso protein has zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso plants were shorter and had greater tolerance to zzso and drought zzso In the zzso zzso transcript levels of zzso signaling genes and zzso responsive genes were significantly zzso By contrast, expressions of zzso and its downstream genes that zzso zzso zzso were markedly zzso These observations support that zzso is a major regulator of zzso signaling in zzso zzso Finally, we observed that the zzso rates of various rice zzso depended upon the transcript levels of zzso and other zzso zzso
