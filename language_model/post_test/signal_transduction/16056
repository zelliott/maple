Despite being a subject of much scientific zzso the zzso of acute zzso is still not well zzso This article reviews recent advances in our understanding of acute zzso 

zzso zzso observed within zzso early during acute zzso for a long time, was shown to be sufficient to induce acute zzso Another key early event, zzso zzso has previously been shown to induce acute zzso The relationship between these two key early steps is beginning to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso - zzso calcium zzso pH changes, zzso and zzso and of zzso zzso have been investigated zzso along with potential therapeutic targets both upstream and downstream of these key zzso Additional key findings have been zzso of the role of zzso and the dual role of zzso stress in acute zzso recognition of zzso zzso stress as an early step and the status of duct cells as important entities in pancreatic zzso 

Current findings have provided further insight into the roles and mechanisms of zzso zzso and inflammatory pathways in pancreatic zzso Future studies, which will be of great importance in identifying therapeutic targets, are being undertaken to establish the relative contributions of these pathways during acute zzso
