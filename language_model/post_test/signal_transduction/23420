zzso zzso is a cosmopolitan fungus able to respond to external stimuli and to shift both its zzso zzso and the production of secondary zzso including that of the zzso zzso zzso To better understand the zzso of this zzso we examined genetic and zzso responses within the fungus when grown under four conditions that mimic different ecological niches ranging from zzso growth to zzso Global zzso changes were observed in both primary and secondary metabolism in response to these conditions, particularly in secondary metabolism where zzso of nearly half of the predicted secondary zzso clusters changed in response to the zzso states of the zzso The greatest zzso change was found between zzso and zzso growth, which resulted in expression changes in over 800 genes in zzso zzso The fungus also responded to growth conditions, zzso by zzso changes in zzso resulting in differences in their ability to zzso carbon zzso We also examined tolerance of zzso zzso to zzso stress and found that growth and secondary metabolism were altered in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Data presented in this study show a multifaceted response of zzso zzso to its environment and suggest that zzso stress and secondary metabolism are important in the ecology of this zzso notably in its interaction with host plant and in relation to changes in its lifestyle zzso zzso to zzso
