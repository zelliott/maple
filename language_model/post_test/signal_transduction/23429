zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins are classic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Many zzso and zzso zzso induce expression of zzso which act in a negative feedback loop to inhibit further signal zzso zzso zzso expression is regulated by DNA binding of zzso zzso however, their zzso regulation is poorly zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that bind to complementary sequences on target zzso often zzso gene zzso zzso has been shown to regulate zzso expression during zzso myeloma and be induced by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role in the regulation of the zzso zzso This study aimed to identify targets of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso the functional zzso zzso analysis identified highly zzso zzso zzso target sequences in several zzso associated zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and zzso while a zzso zzso specifically reversed its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduction of zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso through zzso These results reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso may augment zzso signal zzso via control of zzso expression and are fundamental to the understanding of inflammatory zzso
