Enteric zzso unlike sympathetic and sensory zzso that require zzso zzso for survival, do not undergo classical zzso programmed cell death zzso during normal zzso Whether zzso zzso in the zzso which originate from a zzso of enteric nervous system zzso zzso or other zzso zzso undergo zzso during normal zzso development is zzso In zzso mice, many zzso and zzso zzso zzso are missing but whether this is due to increased zzso death is zzso Here we show that activated zzso and zzso doubly positive zzso are present in zzso mouse zzso between embryonic day zzso and zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso via zzso during normal zzso We also show that, in zzso mice, most zzso zzso are lost during this late fetal period, which zzso with a period of increased zzso of the zzso Since the percentage of zzso and zzso doubly positive cells in the fetal zzso and the number of zzso zzso at zzso were similar between the zzso impaired precursor proliferation and migration are unlikely to contribute to the loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were also found in zzso zzso zzso around birth, suggesting that zzso zzso depend on limited supply of (presumably zzso zzso signaling via zzso for zzso
