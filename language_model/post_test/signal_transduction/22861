In many cell types, zzso zzso proteins are zzso in zzso membrane zzso These are plasma membrane zzso enriched in zzso and cholesterol and are suggested to be platforms for cell zzso zzso with the synthesis of zzso zzso maturing zzso progressively associate zzso zzso including the zzso molecules zzso 120 and zzso in zzso Here we show that these zzso include zzso and Lyn zzso Both zzso are zzso active in zzso prepared from young animals, zzso with early stages of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is tightly associated with zzso 120 and zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso cells lacking zzso or in zzso membrane zzso of more mature cells, F3 does not associate with zzso The addition of zzso zzso to zzso results in stimulation of zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins in zzso is thus a prerequisite for association with zzso permitting zzso zzso zzso of zzso F3 with zzso zzso such as zzso and ensuing zzso zzso may play a crucial role in initiating zzso
