Signaling between the zzso zzso and the respective receptors of the zzso class is known to play a vital role during vascular zzso and zzso The relative contribution of each zzso zzso type present on zzso cells to these processes remains to be zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso signal zzso leads to a repulsive migratory behavior of zzso zzso It remained unclear whether this zzso effect can be zzso by zzso signaling alone or whether other zzso receptors are zzso It also remained unclear whether the zzso activity of zzso is pivotal to its zzso To answer these questions, we developed a cellular migration system solely dependent on zzso zzso Using this system, we could show that zzso zzso leads to the zzso of cell zzso zzso we identified zzso a known inhibitor of zzso of the zzso family, and zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso the zzso of cell migration by zzso could be zzso demonstrating that the zzso function of zzso is of prominent importance in this zzso These results show that zzso zzso is not only accompanying zzso induced repulsive behavior of cells, but is capable of directly zzso this zzso
