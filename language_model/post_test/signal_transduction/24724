Early work on zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had suggested a correlation between the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso turnover as well as zzso cell zzso The cloning of zzso zzso has now allowed thorough and direct analysis of the signal zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have found that all forms of the zzso are capable of zzso signals leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the same promoter which yields coordinate expression of both products, so that restricted zzso zzso expression in a zzso of zzso is zzso zzso methods employing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show no zzso zzso of zzso sections from adult mice, zzso at best a low level of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression is readily detected in the majority of cortical zzso of zzso zzso transgenic mice using a zzso promoter zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso in mice transgenic for this zzso does not result in increased negative selection in zzso consistent with the in zzso findings that induction of cell death is not strictly dependent on zzso zzso Despite earlier reports of the detection of human zzso zzso zzso we find no zzso zzso message in human zzso or T zzso Cloning of the human CD zzso zzso locus has demonstrated approximately zzso zzso between the mouse and human zzso zzso corresponding to the mouse zzso zzso zzso However, translation of the DNA sequence does not result in a zzso zzso acid zzso Thus, there does not appear to be a zzso zzso protein in zzso
