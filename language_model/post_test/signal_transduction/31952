The zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a significant role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation during embryonic zzso Since zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is implicated in several types of human zzso zzso of this zzso could be promising zzso zzso Using high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a compound of interest with potent in zzso activity but poor zzso zzso Our efforts focused on enhancement of in zzso zzso activity and zzso stability, including core ring conversion and side chain zzso This led to the discovery of zzso zzso zzso which has a structure distinct from previously reported zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso model and demonstrated zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso
