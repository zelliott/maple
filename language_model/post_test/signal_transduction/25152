The zzso proteins are induced by several zzso and are involved in negative feedback zzso Here we demonstrate that in zzso zzso insulin, a hormone whose zzso does not belong to the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso expression but not zzso or zzso Using zzso of zzso cells, we show that insulin induction of zzso is enhanced upon zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from zzso cells binds directly to a zzso element present in the zzso zzso Once zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso of zzso without zzso the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso Two pieces of evidence suggest that this negative regulation likely results from competition between zzso and zzso binding to the same insulin zzso zzso First, using a zzso zzso system, we show that zzso binds to the insulin zzso at zzso zzso which is precisely where zzso zzso Second, using zzso zzso we show that insulin zzso zzso of zzso from an zzso compartment to the cell zzso leading to zzso of zzso with the insulin zzso This zzso is dependent upon zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso Indeed, in cells expressing an insulin zzso zzso in which zzso 960 has been zzso to zzso insulin does not modify the cellular zzso of zzso We have thus revealed an insulin target gene of which the expression is zzso upon zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to function as a negative regulator of insulin zzso
