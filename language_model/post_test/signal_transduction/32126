This study describes functional characterization of two putative zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso The expression and sequence analyses indicate that the two zzso genes diverged, at least zzso in zzso zzso is most highly expressed in roots and induced by short days, while zzso is more zzso expressed throughout plant zzso and is not responsive to short zzso The two zzso genes also had distinct effects on shoot and root growth when their expression was zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects were restricted to roots while zzso had similar effects on aerial and zzso zzso Nevertheless, both genes seemed to be zzso in transgenic zzso that are zzso and zzso suggesting interplay with zzso zzso zzso suppression led to increased starch zzso in both roots and zzso The effect of zzso suppression on starch zzso was coupled with zzso effects in both roots and zzso suggesting that zzso is part of a mechanism that regulates the allocation of zzso to growth or storage in zzso zzso zzso led to significant reduction of zzso formation caused by smaller zzso and vessels suggesting that zzso likely plays a role in the growth of zzso zzso
