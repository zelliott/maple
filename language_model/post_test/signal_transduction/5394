zzso gene expression studies have mainly focused on highly expressed and zzso genes to decipher key regulatory zzso Biological responses are consequence of the concerted action of gene regulatory network, thus, limiting our attention to genes having the most significant variations is insufficient for a thorough understanding of emergent whole zzso zzso Here we zzso analyzed the zzso zzso zzso data of zzso zzso zzso zzso in 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 88 zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso double zzso zzso zzso correlations zzso on the whole zzso expression between different zzso are extremely high zzso indicating a strong zzso of the entire expression zzso Further correlation analyses reveal zzso response is zzso zzso zzso mode consisting of small number of sharply induced zzso genes and zzso collective mode consisting of majority of zzso induced genes of diverse cellular processes which collectively adjust their expression zzso zzso zzso correlations of a small number of randomly selected genes from collective mode show zzso Furthermore, in collective mode, the transition from large scatter in expression zzso for single zzso to smooth linear lines emerges as an organizing principle when grouping of 50 zzso and zzso With this emergent behavior, the role of zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso processes for gene induction can be zzso zzso to decipher quantitative whole zzso differential control of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our work demonstrates zzso zzso responses subsequent to specific innate immune stimulus which have been largely zzso
