The zzso factors zzso and zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso are zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso where they are predicted to work together in a zzso Previous work showed that in zzso as in zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus in response to zzso oxygen species zzso The expression of genes whose products counteract zzso stress depends on zzso as shown by impaired ability of a zzso zzso to induce these zzso zzso In this study, we found that under zzso stress, zzso gene expression is also partially impaired in the zzso zzso but to a milder extent than in the zzso zzso whereas in the double zzso - zzso - none of the tested genes was zzso with the exception of one zzso zzso zzso Both single zzso are capable of infecting the plant, showing similar zzso to the zzso The double zzso however, showed clearly decreased zzso pointing to additive contributions of zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms are discussed, including additive regulation of gene expression by zzso zzso
