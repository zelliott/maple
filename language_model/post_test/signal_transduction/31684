Vitamin A is zzso from cellular stores and zzso in blood bound to zzso protein zzso In turn, zzso associates in plasma with zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso It is believed that binding to zzso prevents the loss of zzso by zzso in the zzso At target cells, zzso is recognized by zzso a plasma membrane protein that serves a dual zzso it mediates zzso of zzso from zzso zzso into cells, and it functions as a zzso zzso that, upon binding zzso triggers a zzso signaling zzso We previously showed that zzso signaling zzso the ability of zzso to induce insulin zzso However, the role that zzso the binding partner of zzso in blood, plays in zzso activities remained zzso Here we show that zzso blocks the ability of zzso to associate with zzso and thereby effectively suppresses both zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso protects mice from zzso insulin resistance, reflected by reduced zzso of insulin zzso and zzso tolerance zzso The data indicate that zzso functions only under circumstances where the plasma zzso level exceeds that of zzso and demonstrate that, in addition to preventing the loss of zzso zzso plays a central role in regulating zzso zzso
