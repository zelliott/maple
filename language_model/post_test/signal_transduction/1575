zzso zzso zzso are composed of a peripheral complex, zzso attached to an integral membrane complex, zzso Association of the two complexes is essential for zzso zzso transport and is regulated zzso in response to zzso zzso A new complex, zzso was recently isolated and implicated in zzso zzso of zzso complexes that had zzso in response to zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso Cell zzso 3, zzso Here, we provide evidence supporting a role for zzso in zzso of the zzso but also demonstrate an essential role in zzso assembly under other zzso The zzso complex associates zzso with zzso complexes released from the membrane by zzso deprivation but binds zzso to zzso zzso sectors in a zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso complexes from cells lacking zzso zzso show serious structural and functional defects even in zzso cells or in combination with a zzso that blocks zzso of the zzso zzso small middle zzso interactions are specifically disrupted in cells lacking zzso zzso E or G, suggesting a direct involvement for these zzso in interaction of the two zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in many different signal zzso zzso binds zzso to other zzso zzso under conditions that alter zzso small middle zzso zzso thus, zzso recruitment to the zzso complex does not appear to provide a signal for zzso zzso
