The zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso regulate the activity of zzso zzso including those that direct zzso from rearranged zzso zzso Unlike zzso which is zzso expressed in many cell types, zzso expression is restricted primarily to B zzso and can be induced in precursor B cells by stimulation with bacterial zzso zzso However, the precise factors that mediate this induction mechanism remain zzso In the present study, we monitored zzso expression in cells arrested for the zzso of zzso an zzso member of the zzso zzso factor zzso Despite stimulation with zzso disruption of the zzso signaling zzso in precursor B cells led to the loss of zzso zzso DNA binding activity in zzso and the suppression of zzso zzso in zzso This zzso zzso correlated with a specific block to zzso gene expression at the level of transcription, whereas the expression of zzso was zzso The finding that zzso is under zzso control highlights an important zzso mechanism involving two distinct zzso factor families that regulate B zzso zzso
