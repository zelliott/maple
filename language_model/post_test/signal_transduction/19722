The nucleus zzso is a key zzso of cocaine zzso but the distinct roles of the two zzso of nucleus zzso projection zzso those expressing zzso D1 versus zzso zzso are poorly zzso We show that deletion of zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso selectively from zzso or zzso zzso zzso affects cocaine zzso Because loss of zzso in zzso zzso increases their zzso zzso we next used zzso tools to control selectively the firing rate of zzso and zzso nucleus zzso zzso and studied zzso effects on cocaine zzso zzso of zzso zzso mimicking the loss of zzso suppresses cocaine zzso with opposite effects induced by zzso of zzso zzso These results provide insight into the molecular control of zzso and zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso contribution of these cell types to cocaine zzso
