The cell state zzso zzso model for zzso supported by recent evidence, requires that an zzso mechanical events result in a commitment signal to the nucleus that determines which of two readied gene zzso is to be zzso via their master zzso We show how a link between the zzso of cell state splitting and the molecular zzso of zzso state zzso might be forged out of well known molecular components of zzso
