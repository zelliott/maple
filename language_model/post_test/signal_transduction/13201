zzso for zzso have been reported on peripheral nerve zzso It is a widespread assumption that the zzso membrane does not possess this kind of zzso although zzso zzso have been found in isolated rat zzso zzso zzso in the present study, effects of zzso and zzso were tested on the zzso of zzso zzso in isolated rat zzso zzso mouse zzso roots, and human zzso zzso Bath application of zzso to all three types of zzso preparations increased zzso zzso but the underlying receptors appear to differ in the various zzso In rat zzso zzso zzso zzso produced the strongest zzso This effect was blocked by zzso acid and indicates the presence of zzso zzso In mouse zzso roots, differences were found between fast and slow zzso The latter responded to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, effects of zzso on zzso zzso seem to be caused exclusively by effects of zzso on zzso zzso Application of zzso also excited zzso in zzso of isolated human zzso The pharmacological profile indicates zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, we could not detect zzso receptors in this preparation with our zzso These data show that the zzso sensitivity of sensory zzso is not restricted to their zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors may contribute to the zzso of zzso including zzso zzso
