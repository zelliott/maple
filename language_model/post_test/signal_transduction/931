zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, is known as an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso Whether zzso also zzso in other signaling events is not zzso Here we show that zzso serves as an essential component of a signaling zzso that involves zzso of the zzso zzso and its downstream targets, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso eliminates zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we further demonstrate that zzso but not zzso is required for zzso zzso Moreover, this novel function of zzso appears to involve zzso and degradation of the zzso inhibitor zzso These findings suggest that zzso exerts its zzso functions by targeting different downstream signaling zzso
