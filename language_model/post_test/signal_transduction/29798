Juvenile zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso dominant disorders with distinct and zzso clinical zzso The former, an inherited gastrointestinal zzso zzso is caused by zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso and the latter is a vascular zzso disorder caused by zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso All four genes zzso proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso Although there are reports of patients and families with zzso of both disorders combined, the genetic zzso of this association is zzso 

Blood samples were collected from seven unrelated families segregating both zzso DNA from the zzso of each family was zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were examined for familial zzso with zzso and presence or absence in population zzso zzso No patient had zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso all had zzso zzso Three cases of zzso zzso zzso were zzso In one, the zzso was passed on to a similarly affected zzso Each zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in other affected family zzso 

zzso in zzso can cause a syndrome consisting of both juvenile zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Since patients with these disorders are generally zzso through distinct medical zzso genetic testing is recommended for patients presenting with either zzso to identify those at risk of this zzso Patients with juvenile zzso who have an zzso zzso should be screened for the vascular zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso in visceral zzso that may otherwise present suddenly with serious medical zzso
