zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso protein that positively mediates zzso signaling in zzso Here we report that zzso an zzso of zzso that forms a zzso with zzso can interacts with both zzso and zzso and acts as a negative regulator of zzso signaling in muscle zzso zzso of zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso leading to zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso In contrast, suppressing zzso expression by zzso significantly enhances zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso In addition to targeting directly to and competing with zzso in binding with the zzso zzso zzso also suppresses zzso and insulin signaling by zzso zzso from these two zzso In addition to zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results reveal that zzso zzso function as an integrated zzso regulator of zzso signaling and mediate the zzso between zzso and insulin signaling pathways in muscle zzso
