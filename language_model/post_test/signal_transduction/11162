The control of zzso degradation is an important component of the regulation of gene expression since the zzso concentration of zzso is determined both by the rates of synthesis and of zzso Two general pathways of zzso zzso have been described in zzso Both pathways share the zzso removal of the zzso tail zzso as the first zzso In one pathway, zzso is followed by the zzso of the cap and zzso degradation of the zzso body by a zzso zzso In the second pathway, the zzso body is zzso by a complex of 3' zzso before the remaining cap structure is zzso This review discusses the proteins involved in the zzso and control of both zzso zzso
