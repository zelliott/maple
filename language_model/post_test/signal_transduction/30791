There is an emerging body of evidence implicating iron in zzso and in particular zzso cancer, but whether this involves zzso zzso a major zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso We aimed to determine the effect of iron loading on zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and human primary zzso containing cell zzso zzso cellular iron levels in zzso and zzso cells caused increased zzso zzso as indicated by increased zzso reporter activity, increased zzso expression of two known targets, zzso and zzso and increased cellular zzso In contrast zzso zzso and zzso lines, zzso zzso and human primary zzso were not responsive to iron zzso This was verified in zzso cells that no longer induced zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso The cell line zzso wild type for zzso but zzso for zzso was also responsive suggesting that the role of iron is to regulate zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso status has no influence on zzso zzso zzso We thus speculate that excess iron could exacerbate zzso in the background of zzso loss, a common finding in zzso
