The vitamin A zzso zzso acid zzso plays important roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso can produce zzso thereby zzso zzso specificity on T cells and enhancing transforming growth factor zzso induction of zzso regulatory T cells upon zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso in cells and zzso are regulated by its degradation as zzso However, it remained unclear if T cells could actively zzso zzso 

We assessed the expression of known zzso zzso in T cells from mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso selectively expressed zzso a member of the zzso zzso family zzso However, T cells in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not significantly express zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso expression in zzso T cells upon zzso in zzso but could not do so in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso significantly suppressed the zzso effect to induce expression of the zzso zzso zzso on T zzso On the other hand, knocking down zzso gene expression with small interfering zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity led to enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate a role for zzso in regulating zzso signals in activated T cells but not during zzso differentiation to zzso regulatory T zzso zzso expression of zzso may disturb T cell trafficking and differentiation in the gut and its related zzso zzso
