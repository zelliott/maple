zzso zzso growth zzso plays a critical role in modulating the inflammatory response and other biological processes through its regulation of the production of zzso zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso increases in the zzso activity and zzso level of zzso A zzso of the human zzso promoter was used to characterize its regulation by zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso or its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso inhibited zzso promoter zzso The zzso activity of zzso on the zzso promoter was zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter contains a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso However, neither zzso nor deletion of the zzso had any effect on the zzso activity of zzso on zzso transcription, indicating that the consensus zzso is not required for this effect of zzso Analysis using a series of deletion zzso of the zzso promoter revealed that a region containing a consensus zzso zzso zzso site is required for the zzso activity and zzso suppression of the zzso zzso of the putative zzso site not only markedly reduced the zzso zzso activity of the promoter, but also zzso the responsiveness of the promoter to zzso In addition, a minimal promoter containing one copy of the zzso sequence was responsive to zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso mobility shift zzso was performed with the nuclear extracts from zzso cells, and it was found that zzso treatment did not disrupt the binding of zzso zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso zzso Taken together, these studies indicate that the zzso site is indispensable for the zzso activity of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
