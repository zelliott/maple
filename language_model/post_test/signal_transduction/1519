The zzso zzso zzso is involved in the survival signaling pathways in many cell zzso The present study examined zzso of zzso at zzso and DNA fragmentation after traumatic brain injury zzso in zzso zzso showed zzso was decreased in the injured zzso 1 h after zzso whereas it was temporally increased at 4 h in the zzso damaged zzso In the zzso region of the zzso zzso was increased after zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso was significantly decreased as early as 1 h after zzso however, the zzso was accelerated at 4 zzso Double zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso revealed the zzso of zzso and downstream zzso Double zzso with zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed different cellular zzso after zzso The present study implicates zzso zzso in the signaling pathways that are involved in cell survival after zzso
