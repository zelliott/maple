zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso or zzso is a member of the type C zzso zzso G zzso zzso family, and its zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso Although zzso expression has been demonstrated in various human zzso including zzso zzso brain and zzso the precise roles of this zzso in many of these zzso are zzso In an effort to better understand zzso systems in the zzso we cloned the full-length zzso zzso and investigated the presence and cellular zzso of zzso zzso expression in adult and developing rat zzso On the basis of these findings, we investigated the presence and distribution of zzso zzso human zzso sites and the nature of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso Thus, using in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso were observed in zzso of zzso zzso from adult rats and were tentatively identified as zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis of the zzso profile of zzso zzso expression in kidney revealed highest relative levels at late stage gestation zzso day zzso with a sharp decrease after birth and lowest levels in the zzso During development, silver grains associated with zzso zzso zzso were observed zzso putative zzso cells in mature zzso with little or no signal associated with zzso zzso In adult and developing zzso specific zzso sites were associated with zzso throughout the zzso zzso In primary cultures of zzso cells, synthetic human zzso specifically and zzso inhibited cell proliferation over a 48 h period, further suggesting the presence of functional zzso zzso on these cells zzso and zzso These findings suggest zzso zzso may be involved in the genesis and/or zzso maturation of zzso zzso and possibly in regulating zzso cell density in adult rat zzso
