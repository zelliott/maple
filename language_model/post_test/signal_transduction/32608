zzso zzso to zzso zzso was cloned as an zzso gene by zzso zzso a zzso compound and an zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel zinc zzso finger protein that consists of 113 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso during evolution, with identities of zzso between human and zzso zzso sequences and zzso between human and zzso zzso In human zzso zzso is zzso expressed at high levels in skeletal muscles, heart, and zzso zzso is localized in both the zzso and the nucleus of cells, and its gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso expressed and zzso human zzso binds to zinc and copper metal zzso and prevents zzso zzso induced by copper or a free radical zzso When zzso in several human cell lines, zzso protects cells from zzso induced by zzso agents (the metal zzso zzso and zinc or copper metal zzso zzso zzso appears to inhibit and/or delay metal zzso zzso c release and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a cellular protective zzso that appears to act as an zzso to inhibit zzso induced by metal zzso and zzso oxygen zzso
