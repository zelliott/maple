In this article, we review important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso 

The relative contributions of zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso the two major early independent cellular events in zzso have been investigated using novel genetic zzso zzso zzso has traditionally held the spotlight for many decades as the central zzso event of zzso However, recent experimental evidence points to the role of zzso zzso in early zzso cell damage but not in the inflammatory response of acute zzso which was shown to be induced by zzso zzso Further, chronic zzso developed independently of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not persistent zzso expression of active zzso was shown to result in chronic zzso zzso zzso factor of activated zzso signaling was shown to mediate downstream effects of zzso rise in zzso zzso zzso was identified as a key zzso zzso zzso lung zzso 

Recent advances challenge the zzso zzso understanding of zzso It is becoming increasingly clear that zzso of intense inflammatory signaling mechanisms in zzso cells is crucial to the zzso of zzso which may explain the strong systemic inflammatory response in zzso
