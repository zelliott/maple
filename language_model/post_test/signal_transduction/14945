In the majority of neurodegenerative storage disorders, zzso death in the brain is followed by zzso of zzso cells zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso for the efficient removal of cell zzso However, it is increasingly evident that these zzso may also cause death of adjoining viable zzso contributing to rapid progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso storage disorder caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso linkages in zzso zzso proteins and its zzso leads to abnormal zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso causing zzso zzso zzso zzso mice mimic the clinical and pathological features of human zzso including rapid zzso death by zzso and zzso zzso We previously reported that in zzso mice, the zzso undergo zzso zzso stress zzso unfolded protein response, which mediates zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular zzso by which the zzso cells are recruited in the zzso mouse brain remains poorly zzso We report here that increased production of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mouse brain, is a zzso zzso for zzso zzso We also report that an zzso increase in zzso levels in the zzso mouse brain positively zzso with elevated expression of the genes characteristically associated with zzso We propose that increased zzso zzso production in the brain is at least one of the mechanisms that mediate zzso zzso contributing to zzso zzso
