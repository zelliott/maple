The fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso and zzso zzso of the scalp in certain regions of zzso and zzso Human innate immune system plays an important role in combating with various pathogens including zzso The zzso is one of the most critical arms of host innate zzso which is a protein complex controlling maturation of zzso To clarify whether zzso zzso is able to activate the zzso we analyzed human zzso cell line zzso for zzso production upon infection with zzso zzso strain isolated from zzso zzso patients, and rapid zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso Moreover, applying competitive zzso and gene specific zzso with zzso we found that zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso formation as well as zzso zzso were all dependent on zzso zzso B activity, zzso production and zzso zzso were required for the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Our data thus reveal that the zzso zzso plays an important role in host defense against zzso zzso and suggest that manipulating zzso signaling can be a novel approach for control of diseases caused by zzso zzso zzso
