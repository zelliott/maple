A zzso complex encompassing a zzso regulator, cardiac zzso repeat protein zzso and the zzso 3 zzso was identified in the zzso elastic region of the giant zzso protein zzso The present study aimed to investigate the zzso of this complex in the skeletal zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is controlled by the activity of zzso zzso the higher the zzso 3, the more important the zzso retention of zzso This regulation would occur through zzso of the zzso end of zzso by the zzso We show that, upon zzso zzso the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso activity zzso Taken as a whole, zzso and its regulator zzso 3 appear to occupy a central position in the important cell zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of the zzso protein zzso one of zzso main targets, remains unchanged in presence of zzso suggesting that the zzso encompassing zzso zzso does not play a role in muscle zzso With zzso also having zzso effects, the inability of zzso 3 to lower zzso zzso of zzso could reduce muscle cell survival, hence partly accounting for the zzso pattern observed in limb zzso muscular zzso zzso a pathology resulting from the zzso zzso
