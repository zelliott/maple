zzso zzso receptors signal through the zzso toxin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as through a G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these receptors in zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that this zzso occurs through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso production and/or zzso zzso zzso of inward zzso zzso channels and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso of spontaneous zzso influx and release of zzso zzso was preserved when zzso levels were elevated by zzso zzso We further observed that zzso zzso inhibited both spontaneous and zzso zzso influx in zzso but not in zzso zzso This zzso was also observed in cells with blocked inward zzso zzso channels, suggesting that the zzso effect on zzso zzso channel gating is sufficient to inhibit spontaneous zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso release was only partially relieved in zzso cells, indicating that zzso receptors also inhibit zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso The zzso step in zzso zzso of zzso release was not affected by the addition of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and lithium, an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but was attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso signaling zzso in a protein zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso release by blocking zzso zzso influx through the zzso signaling zzso and by desensitizing zzso zzso zzso through the zzso and protein zzso zzso signaling zzso
