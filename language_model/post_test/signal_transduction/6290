Using a zzso zzso screening approach, we have identified seven novel zzso genes in human zzso vein zzso cells that were verifiable by Northern zzso zzso Among them zzso a zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso showed greatest induction by zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso induction by zzso peaked at 1 h and declined rapidly zzso approximately 45 zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeling followed by zzso verified that the zzso zzso zzso was translated into zzso We found that both zzso and zzso zzso activity are critical for zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and protein zzso C activity were not zzso zzso zzso of zzso was shown to prolong zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, zzso with an zzso in zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso gene expression and an zzso in zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells was shown to zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression by 60 and zzso zzso These results suggested that induced expression of the zzso zzso and its subsequent regulation of zzso activity play a key regulatory role in the zzso signaling zzso and in the zzso regulation of zzso important zzso cell zzso zzso
