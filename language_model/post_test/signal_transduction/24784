The zzso hypothesis, suggesting that cancer cells express zzso zzso zzso and are able to kill zzso zzso activated T cells, was supported by reports of the killing of zzso cells by zzso human colon cancer cell zzso Through the use of an improved zzso zzso in which soluble zzso and zzso zzso cells were used as positive controls, we show that none of seven human colon cancer cell lines induce zzso of two zzso target cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso experiments, cancer cell zzso do not inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and protein were detected in the extracts of the colon cancer cell lines, flow zzso and zzso zzso failed to detect the protein on the surface of tumor zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso T zzso by cancer cells may not account for immune tolerance toward tumor zzso
