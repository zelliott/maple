Regulatory T cells zzso and zzso protein zzso a regulatory protein often found expressed at sites of zzso privilege, have similar zzso Their presence affects the outcome of harmful zzso and zzso including experimental zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report a novel zzso by which zzso express and zzso zzso to control zzso T cell responses partially zzso zzso signaling but blocking zzso zzso As a result, this leads to a loss of zzso zzso and zzso activities despite zzso of zzso zzso signals, such as zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso signaling often leads to cell zzso zzso did not affect cell zzso Instead, zzso zzso prevented zzso of zzso T cells with zzso while keeping their responses to zzso zzso zzso
