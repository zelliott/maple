Cell signaling zzso by the G zzso zzso hormone zzso type 1 zzso is fundamental to bone and kidney zzso It has been unclear how the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively operate with only one zzso and trigger different zzso of the zzso zzso Here we analyze the zzso response by measuring the zzso of zzso and zzso for each individual reaction step along the zzso signaling zzso We found that during the time frame of G protein zzso and zzso production, zzso action was restricted to the cell surface, whereas zzso had moved to zzso compartments where it remained associated with the zzso and zzso potentially as a persistent and active zzso zzso Such marked differences suggest a mechanism by which zzso and zzso induce differential responses, and these results indicate that the central zzso that zzso production originates exclusively at the cell membrane must be zzso
