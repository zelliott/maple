zzso and zzso circuits within cancer signaling networks limit the activity of most targeted zzso For example, altered signaling in the networks activated by the zzso family of zzso particularly in zzso zzso contributes to drug zzso We developed a zzso systems model of signaling networks in zzso breast cancer to zzso investigate relationships between zzso zzso of network zzso and combination drug zzso This model linked zzso zzso family signaling to breast tumor growth through two zzso zzso the zzso survival zzso and the zzso growth and proliferation zzso The model predicted molecular mechanisms of resistance to individual zzso In particular, zzso breast cancer cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso were resistant to growth arrest induced by zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso of two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used model simulations to predict the response of zzso breast cancer zzso to combination therapies and verified these predictions in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso was more effective in zzso tumor growth than the combination of zzso and zzso zzso and even induced tumor regression, indicating that targeting both zzso and zzso may be an improved therapeutic approach for zzso breast cancer zzso
