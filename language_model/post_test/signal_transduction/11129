zzso zzso zzso exerts multiple functions in animals and plants, but the mode of zzso action is not well zzso In this paper, we provide evidence that zzso stimulates a cascade of zzso signaling events to regulate zzso zzso Analysis of the changes of zzso free zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso guard cells combined with zzso strip zzso suggests that zzso zzso an increase in both zzso levels and zzso leading to a reduction in zzso zzso zzso studies zzso zzso G protein in zzso the zzso zzso acting upstream of zzso zzso and generating zzso in guard cell zzso To further test the role of zzso G protein in zzso signaling in zzso closure, we checked guard cell responses in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso were insensitive to zzso stimulation of zzso closure, whereas zzso zzso enhanced the guard cell response to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso are impaired in zzso induction of zzso generation in guard zzso Taken together, our results strongly suggest that zzso activates an zzso signaling zzso involving zzso of a zzso G zzso zzso generation, and changes in zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
