The zzso zzso channel zzso plays important roles in cellular zzso and zzso zzso In the heart, zzso is found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes one of the three types of zzso To date, there is no report regarding the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso which is the topic of this zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso double transgenic zzso mice and SAN cells from wild type, zzso zzso or zzso knockout mice were used to study zzso regulation of zzso or native zzso zzso zzso current zzso zzso was not found in control zzso but was robust in all examined zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso analog zzso significantly increased zzso as well as zzso in zzso at both zzso and room zzso The zzso effect on zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso was detected in control zzso SAN cells but not in zzso knockout SAN cells, indicating the identity of zzso in normal SAN cells is zzso by zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso but not zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in SAN cells from wild type or zzso knockout mice was significantly increased by zzso suggesting native zzso channels can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulation increases zzso in zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by the zzso system could play important roles in cellular functions involving zzso
