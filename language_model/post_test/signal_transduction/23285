zzso is defined as the ability of a cell to acquire full functional zzso For instance, the function of zzso zzso is to act as a barrier to the diffusion of zzso into or out of the urine after zzso by the zzso The zzso also serves to protect the zzso muscle from toxins present in stored zzso A major event in the initiation and progression of zzso cancer is loss of zzso zzso This is important because less differentiated zzso tumors zzso zzso tumor zzso are typically associated with increased zzso and clinical zzso The differentiation status of zzso zzso can be assessed by zzso examination and is reflected in the assignment of a zzso grade zzso or zzso Although typically limited to zzso evaluation in most routine diagnostic practices, tumor grade can also be assessed using zzso zzso Indeed, current pathological analysis of tumor specimens is increasingly zzso on molecular zzso Thus, high priorities for zzso cancer research include identification of zzso zzso that will enable the identification of high grade zzso tumors that pose the most threat and require the most aggressive zzso zzso zzso that predict the likelihood that a low grade, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage zzso zzso tumor will progress into an invasive zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso that indicate which zzso tumors are most likely to zzso thus enabling clinicians to zzso identify patients who require aggressive zzso and zzso how these markers might contribute to biological processes that zzso tumor progression and zzso potentially through loss of terminal zzso This review will discuss the proteins associated with zzso cell zzso with a focus on those implicated in zzso cancer, and other proteins that may be involved in zzso zzso It is hoped that ongoing discoveries associated with the study of these zzso proteins can be translated into the clinic to positively impact patient zzso
