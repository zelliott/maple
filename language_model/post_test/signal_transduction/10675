Compared to research in the animal field, the plant zzso has been clearly zzso The available data so far indicate similarities as well as striking differences that raise interesting questions about the function and evolution of the zzso in different zzso Despite a seemingly similar structure and organization of the NE, many of the proteins that are integral components of the animal zzso appear to lack zzso in plant zzso The sequencing of the zzso zzso has not led to the identification of zzso of animal zzso zzso but has indicated that the plant zzso must have a distinct protein composition different from that found in zzso zzso Besides providing a selective barrier between the zzso and the zzso the plant zzso functions as a scaffold for zzso but the scaffolding components are not identical to those found in animal zzso The zzso comprises an zzso in higher plant cells, a striking difference to the organization of zzso nucleation in other zzso zzso Nuclear pores are present in the plant NE, but identifiable zzso of most animal and zzso zzso are presently zzso The transport zzso through the nuclear pores via the action of zzso and the Ran cycle is zzso in plant zzso Interestingly, zzso is zzso to the zzso in plant cells and animal cells, yet the targeting zzso and mechanisms of attachment are different between the two zzso At present, only a few proteins localized at the plant zzso have been identified zzso Future research will have to expand the list of known protein components involved in building a functional plant zzso
