zzso cells are critical in the development of the cerebral cortex, but little is known about the mechanisms controlling their zzso Three focal sources of zzso cells have been identified in zzso cortical zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso where they migrate zzso to populate the cortical zzso Using a variety of tissue culture zzso and in zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso migration of cortical zzso zzso cells is controlled by the zzso We show that the zzso zzso are a necessary and sufficient zzso for the zzso migration of zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso enhances the zzso of zzso cells along the cortical surface, while retaining them within the marginal zone in a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso are fundamental in the development of zzso cells and, zzso in the normal development of the cerebral zzso
