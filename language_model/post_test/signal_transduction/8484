Although chronic liver disease has many zzso including chronic viral zzso alcohol abuse, zzso syndrome, and zzso disorders, the cellular and pathological mechanisms leading to zzso zzso and - as an zzso - zzso are relatively common and zzso Liver zzso is characterized by an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso cells zzso portal zzso and zzso have been identified as major zzso cells in the injured zzso Experimental models of liver zzso highlight the importance of zzso zzso so-called zzso cells, for perpetuating an inflammatory phase resulting in the massive release of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso Recent studies demonstrate that these actions are only partially conducted by zzso zzso but largely depend on recruitment of zzso into the liver, namely of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso subset as precursors of tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso participate in regulating zzso subset zzso zzso on the other hand, display a remarkable plasticity and can differentiate into functionally diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Experimental animal models indicate that zzso are not only critical for zzso zzso but also for zzso regression, because zzso can also degrade zzso zzso proteins and exert zzso zzso The recently identified cellular and molecular pathways for zzso subset zzso zzso differentiation and interactions with other zzso cell types in the injured liver may therefore represent interesting novel targets for future therapeutic approaches in liver zzso
