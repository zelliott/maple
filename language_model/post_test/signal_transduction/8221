To identify the effect of zzso zzso on acute rejection of zzso zzso 

The mice zzso transplant models were zzso The mice were divided into three groups including saline group, zzso zzso group and mismatch zzso zzso In zzso the proliferation capability of T cell was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was applied to determine the expression level of zzso in zzso zzso T zzso 

Compared with saline zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recipients demonstrated statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in functional zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression level of zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso compared with saline zzso zzso zzso and zzso mismatch zzso zzso zzso group at the 7th day after zzso The date showed that zzso protein and zzso proliferation capability was significantly zzso in zzso zzso group compared with saline and zzso mismatch group zzso 

The present study indicates that zzso zzso can inhibit T cell zzso and zzso the survival time of zzso zzso and has a substantial therapeutic effect on zzso acute zzso zzso
