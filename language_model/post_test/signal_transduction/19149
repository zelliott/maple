We have been investigating the function and gene expression of zzso by vascular wall cells, especially zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso cells zzso In this study, we tested the effects of zzso zzso a gap junction communication zzso blocker on the zzso transfer of zzso yellow in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso extract zzso zzso zzso rapidly abolished zzso in the zzso transfer zzso (a measure of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso We then asked whether the zzso might somehow compensate for the loss of zzso communication by altering the expression of zzso Thus, we treated zzso with 100 zzso zzso in serum free medium and determined the total zzso cellular distribution zzso and protein content zzso Besides changes in distribution, by 6 zzso zzso content levels increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso data showed zzso fold increases in zzso message in zzso after 6 h of zzso treatment, suggesting zzso zzso Since zzso has structural similarities to zzso we tested both zzso and zzso but neither drug increased zzso levels, suggesting that the zzso response was not due to a generalized steroid zzso zzso inhibited the zzso increase in zzso content, suggesting a role for zzso in the signaling zzso Further studies with zzso indicated that zzso but not zzso was zzso In zzso zzso blocks zzso communication and zzso zzso expression in zzso These results suggest a feedback mechanism for control of zzso expression based on zzso zzso
