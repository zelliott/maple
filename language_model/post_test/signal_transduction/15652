The ability of a bacterial cell to monitor and zzso respond to its environment is crucial for zzso After one- and zzso systems, zzso function zzso zzso factors - the largest group of alternative zzso factors - represent the third fundamental mechanism of bacterial signal zzso with about six such regulators on average per bacterial zzso Together with their zzso zzso factors, they represent a highly modular design that primarily zzso zzso signal zzso A comprehensive analysis of the zzso zzso factor protein family identified more than 40 distinct major groups of zzso zzso zzso The functional relevance of this zzso is supported by the sequence similarity and domain architecture of zzso zzso factors, zzso context zzso and potential target promoter zzso Moreover, this zzso analysis revealed unique features indicating novel mechanisms of zzso signal zzso This zzso together with the web tool zzso and the information stored in the zzso Signal zzso zzso database, provides a comprehensive resource for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
