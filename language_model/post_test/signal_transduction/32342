Our previous studies on simultaneous zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso have been shown to induce zzso stress zzso selective zzso in wide range of human zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso induced by this combination zzso is not completely zzso Since zzso of zzso signal regulating zzso zzso and subsequent zzso are implicated in zzso stress response, the role of zzso zzso in zzso by this combination was investigated in the present zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso induced by this combination activated zzso and subsequent zzso during zzso of head and neck zzso cells zzso In addition, zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso decreased significantly under similar treatment zzso Further, the downstream targets such as zzso and zzso were also activated by this zzso and their pharmacological zzso by zzso and zzso respectively resulted in suppression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso was zzso by hydrogen zzso rather than zzso zzso as zzso but not zzso suppressed its zzso Our observations clearly suggest that zzso zzso by zzso of zzso metabolism serves as a molecular switch that activate zzso signaling in zzso cells during zzso by zzso The present study emphasizes the importance of zzso zzso in determining zzso of tumor cells that may greatly influence the outcome of radiation zzso
