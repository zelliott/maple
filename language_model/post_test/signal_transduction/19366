The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is considered a key protein in the control of smooth muscle tone in the cardiovascular zzso There is evidence that zzso dysfunction might be linked to systemic vascular disorders and zzso zzso subsequently resulting in structural changes in the penile zzso The expression and significance of zzso in human cavernous arteries zzso have not been zzso 

To evaluate the expression of zzso zzso in zzso and examine the role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso control of penile vascular smooth zzso 

The expression and distribution of zzso type 4 zzso and zzso zzso in sections of zzso were investigated by means of zzso and Western zzso zzso The effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on the relaxation of isolated preparations of zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied using the organ bath zzso 

zzso the expression of zzso in relation to zzso and zzso in zzso and evaluate the effects of an zzso of zzso on the relaxation induced by zzso of zzso and zzso of isolated penile zzso 

zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso were observed within the wall of zzso Double zzso revealed zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso The zzso of tension induced by zzso of zzso and zzso of isolated penile vascular tissue were attenuated significantly by zzso 

Our results demonstrate the expression of zzso zzso in the smooth zzso of zzso and its zzso with zzso A significant role for zzso in the regulation zzso by zzso and zzso of vascular smooth muscle tone in zzso can also be zzso
