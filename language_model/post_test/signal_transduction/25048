Identification of the first zzso zzso zzso cloned by way of zzso analyses on the embryonic cerebral cortex, has led to the realization and demonstration that there exist zzso zzso LP zzso including those zzso by a number of orphan zzso genes known as zzso all of which are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These receptors interact with apparent high affinity for zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso or zzso and are referred to based upon their functional identity as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with the expectation that additional zzso will be identified zzso zzso zzso Here an update is provided on insights gained from analyses of these zzso genes as they relate to the nervous system, particularly the cerebral cortex, and zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso
