The effects of lead zzso on zzso zzso oxide zzso generation, the role of NO in zzso zzso and the origin of zzso NO production in zzso zzso root cells were zzso zzso treatment induced rapid NO generation, showing that zzso exposure triggered zzso NO signaling of the zzso zzso of the cells with the zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso not only abolished the zzso NO burst but also reduced zzso contents of the zzso Moreover, zzso exposure enhanced nitrate zzso zzso activity of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso not only suppressed the zzso zzso activities but also reduced the zzso NO zzso zzso of the cells with zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso and the suppression could be restored by application of zzso NO via its donors sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, our results indicated that zzso exposure enhanced zzso activity and triggered the NO burst of zzso zzso root zzso Furthermore, the data demonstrated that zzso was responsible for the zzso NO burst and that zzso NO generation played a critical role in zzso zzso by zzso zzso root zzso Thus, our results suggest a potential strategy for controlling zzso zzso by plants by targeting zzso as a source of zzso NO zzso
