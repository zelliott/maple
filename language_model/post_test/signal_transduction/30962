zzso signaling provides cells with information about multiple parameters of their zzso including mechanical zzso Often, such signaling is based on a unique feature of zzso zzso their ability to grow and strengthen when force is applied to them, either from within the cell or from the zzso Such zzso reinforcement is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso but may also operate in other types of zzso zzso Though the amount of knowledge about zzso signaling is growing zzso the mechanisms underlying zzso regulation of junction assembly are largely zzso zzso have been carried out that have started to uncover the major signaling pathways involved in the response of zzso sites to zzso zzso models have also been used to address the physical mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
