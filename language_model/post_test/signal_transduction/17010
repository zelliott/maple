High density zzso zzso cholesterol has direct effects on numerous cell types that influence cardiovascular and zzso zzso These include zzso cells, vascular zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso The effects of HDL or zzso its major zzso occur through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso production, numerous zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and HDL also influence gene zzso particularly genes zzso zzso of inflammation in vascular zzso In many zzso the change in zzso signaling occurs as a result of cholesterol zzso with the cholesterol zzso zzso often zzso responses identical to HDL or zzso The ABC zzso zzso and zzso and scavenger zzso class B, type I zzso frequently participate in the cellular zzso zzso relationships are emerging for signal initiation by zzso and zzso with plasma membrane cholesterol binding by the zzso zzso domain of zzso uniquely enabling it to serve as a sensor of changes in membrane zzso Further investigation of the processes underlying HDL and zzso zzso of zzso signaling will potentially reveal new zzso and therapeutic strategies to zzso both cardiovascular and zzso zzso
