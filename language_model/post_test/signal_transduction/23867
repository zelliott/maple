To investigate the initiation of a complex inflammatory response within the human zzso zzso zzso so as to determine the clinical zzso of the inflammatory hypothesis of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso manipulation in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and increases the release of zzso active zzso zzso oxide and zzso all of which results in the recruitment of zzso and a suppression in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Human small zzso specimens were harvested during abdominal procedures at various times after zzso zzso and zzso techniques were applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed for zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso was determined by zzso shift zzso zzso bath experiments were performed on zzso circular smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso were used in zzso as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso contained numerous zzso that expressed increased zzso function associated zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso extracts after zzso zzso were localized to zzso with zzso protein zzso in protein extracts demonstrating local zzso functional zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso increased circular muscle zzso zzso harvested after zzso developed zzso infiltrates and displayed diminished in zzso muscle zzso 

These human data demonstrate that surgical trauma is followed by resident zzso zzso zzso and the zzso release, and functional activity of zzso zzso and zzso active zzso
