The balance between zzso and zzso response determines the outcome of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an zzso role in gastric zzso whereas zzso zzso counterbalances zzso response and suppresses the development of zzso zzso cell response is regulated by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso plays an zzso role in zzso cell growth and mediates an optimal zzso signal to zzso and zzso zzso We administered zzso zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso to examine the relative role for this zzso during maturation of zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso infection in zzso Mice treated by zzso zzso within the first week of infection showed an zzso of gastric zzso accompanied by an increasing ratio of zzso zzso zzso in serum following zzso Furthermore, the treatment resulted in the higher ratio of zzso by zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso at 6 weeks after infection, compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that the predominance of zzso response by zzso blockade leads to an zzso of the development of gastric zzso zzso zzso could contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso and the development of gastric inflammation in zzso zzso zzso
