zzso tuberculosis possesses six genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso factor zzso or stress signaling molecules zzso We have previously shown that the products of these genes physically interact between themselves and with zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In order to understand whether zzso respond to stress, we analyzed the expression of these genes in zzso tuberculosis exposed to stress at message level using real time zzso The results revealed that most zzso of zzso tuberculosis responded to stress and zzso was the most prominent zzso zzso showed elevated expression for zzso zzso and zzso stresses and this was followed by zzso which exhibited zzso towards stationary phase, heat and zzso zzso While zzso and zzso responded significantly to cold and zzso zzso zzso responded only to heat zzso Further, studies on the response of zzso and zzso to stress revealed that only zzso significantly responded to heat, cold, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The response of zzso and zzso to different stresses may be an indication for the stress zzso and regulation of zzso by these zzso
