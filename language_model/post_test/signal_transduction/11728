The zzso complex is a ubiquitous and important regulator of the zzso zzso Here we identify this complex from zzso and investigate its dynamics in live zzso The predicted sequences of the zzso show a strong zzso to the members of the zzso complex, with the larger zzso generally better zzso than the smaller zzso In the highly zzso cells of zzso the zzso complex is rapidly zzso to the zzso in response to external zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso reveal that in zzso zzso and zzso the complex is recruited within seconds to sites where zzso zzso is zzso In contrast, there is little or no zzso to the zzso zzso during zzso Rather the zzso complex is enriched in zzso at the polar regions of zzso cells, which suggests a role in zzso zzso in these zzso
