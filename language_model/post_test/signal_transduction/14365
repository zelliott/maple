Signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes tissue growth during zzso development and is increased in many zzso zzso It is still not understood precisely how this zzso promotes cell growth zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso also functions in cell survival, zzso zzso terminal zzso and progression through zzso zzso An important question is how the same zzso zzso can elicit zzso different responses in different cell zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso restricts cell growth in zzso zzso discs, and its levels are, in turn, zzso by Ras zzso Moreover, unlike normal cells, the growth of zzso zzso cells is undiminished in the complete absence of a Ras zzso In addition to a general role in growth regulation, the importance of zzso in regulating zzso determination downstream of Ras appears to vary from tissue to zzso In the developing eye, the analysis of zzso zzso shows that the functions of Ras in regulating growth and zzso determination are zzso Thus, the zzso protein zzso is a key downstream component in the zzso by which Ras regulates growth in zzso zzso
