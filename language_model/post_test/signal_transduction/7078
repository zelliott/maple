Development and repair of the skeletal system and other zzso are highly dependent on precise regulation of the bone zzso protein zzso zzso The use of zzso clinically to induce bone formation has been limited in part by the requirement of much higher doses of zzso proteins in primates than were needed in cell culture or zzso zzso increasing cellular responsiveness to zzso has become our zzso We determined that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor 1) and prevents zzso of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso In the region of zzso responsible for bone formation, there is a motif that directly interacts with the zzso zzso domain and thus effectively competes for binding with zzso and zzso key signaling proteins in the zzso zzso Here we show that the same region also contains a motif that interacts with zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which targets a common zzso zzso shared by both the zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was first identified as a zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso key zzso signaling molecules of the zzso zzso and causes zzso and/or degradation of these zzso We confirmed a direct interaction of zzso with zzso using zzso expressed zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso binding to zzso prevents the binding and subsequent degradation of these zzso causing increased zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We identified a sequence motif in zzso that was predicted to interact with zzso based on the zzso sequence analysis of several cellular signaling molecules that are known to interact with zzso We further zzso the potential key interacting zzso in zzso and showed loss of binding to zzso in binding zzso in zzso The activities of various zzso and zzso zzso proteins were evaluated using a zzso zzso reporter and alkaline zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells that were differentiated toward the zzso zzso Finally, to strengthen zzso relevance of zzso and zzso interaction, we showed that zzso of zzso caused nuclear zzso of zzso upon zzso treatment which is reflective of increased zzso signaling in zzso
