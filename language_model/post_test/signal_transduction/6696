The zzso 2 zzso zzso is composed of at least two zzso that is, a 55 zzso L chain zzso alpha zzso and a 75 zzso H chain zzso beta zzso The zzso binding of zzso results in the formation of the zzso complex consisting of zzso the L chain and the H zzso zzso studies on the zzso binding to the zzso zzso have shown that the association of zzso to the L chain is the first step of the zzso complex formation and that expression of a larger number of L chains zzso the association of zzso to the zzso zzso in agreement with the zzso zzso conversion zzso This conclusion was supported by experiments using several zzso zzso directed to either H or L chain and zzso T cell lines which was zzso by the human L chain zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso is also consistent with the above zzso Signal zzso by the zzso appears to involve the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso seems to require the H chain and another yet unidentified zzso which might have the zzso zzso
