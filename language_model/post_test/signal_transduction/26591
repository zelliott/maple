zzso cells zzso a large number of small zzso but their mode of zzso into the zzso zzso is not fully zzso zzso zzso was expected to be inefficient due to the small time window for signal sequence recognition by the signal recognition particle zzso zzso the zzso zzso and reducing cellular levels of the zzso component zzso by zzso zzso we found an zzso zzso zzso path in zzso cells required for the efficient zzso of small proteins with zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso occurs zzso via the zzso zzso and requires zzso We classified zzso into three groups: 1) those that comprise zzso zzso acids are strongly dependent on zzso for efficient zzso 2) those in the size range of zzso zzso acids use the zzso pathway, albeit zzso and therefore rely on zzso for efficient zzso and 3) those larger than 160 zzso acids depend on the zzso zzso to preserve a transient zzso competence independent of zzso Thus, unlike in zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells serves mainly as a zzso mechanism to ensure efficient zzso of small proteins and provides cells with an opportunity to regulate zzso of small proteins independent of the zzso zzso
