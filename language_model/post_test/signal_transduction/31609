zzso 1 zzso is one of only six genes implicated in human zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso factor is associated with zzso obesity and increased linear growth in both humans and zzso Additionally, zzso zzso mice show enhanced zzso and obesity in response to a high-fat zzso Thus the zzso of zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso yellow zzso and zzso 4 zzso zzso knockout mice, both of which are defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both expressed in the zzso nucleus zzso Here we report that zzso zzso mice, which have normal energy zzso are zzso despite having elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso In response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso they exhibit a blunted suppression of feeding yet increase their energy expenditure zzso They also fail to activate zzso zzso in response to the drug at a dose that zzso robust zzso expression in a subset of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The resistance to zzso signaling in zzso zzso is not due to a reduced number of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene expression is induced by zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso signaling and suggest that zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso but not energy zzso in response to zzso zzso
