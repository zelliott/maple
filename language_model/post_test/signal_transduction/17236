Transfer zzso zzso modifications enhance the efficiency, specificity and zzso of translation in all zzso The zzso modification zzso is required for normal growth and stress resistance in zzso zzso lacking this modification have numerous zzso zzso in the zzso human genes are linked to neurological zzso The zzso zzso can be ameliorated by zzso of specific zzso suggesting that the modifications are necessary for efficient translation of specific zzso We determined the in zzso zzso zzso at single zzso resolution in zzso strains lacking zzso We found zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that translation is slow when these zzso are in the zzso A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein zzso Instead, we observed zzso of the zzso stress response by a zzso zzso Thus, loss of zzso causes global effects on gene expression due to zzso of cellular zzso
