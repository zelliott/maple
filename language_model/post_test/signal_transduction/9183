zzso zzso are sensory zzso zzso that connect input and output zzso in diverse signaling proteins from zzso bacteria, and lower zzso Here, we employed in zzso zzso zzso to explore the structure of the zzso domain in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso model based on the structure of zzso zzso zzso the closest zzso pairs at the interface of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined and then replaced with zzso and zzso in zzso Except for a unique zzso in zzso the data suggest that the zzso zzso domain forms a parallel zzso bundle that is similar to the structure of zzso The zzso zzso was associated with a segment of zzso that was recently shown to interact with the zzso sensing zzso The zzso zzso bundle and its zzso were maintained in both the zzso and zzso states of zzso although differences in the rates of zzso formation also indicated the existence of different zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso state was accompanied by significantly increased zzso formation rates at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso signaling may be associated with a tilting of the zzso and zzso zzso which may be the signal that is transmitted to the zzso control region of zzso
