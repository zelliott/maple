The regulation of zzso gene expression is a major mechanism by which insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors or signal zzso molecules that are required for insulin regulated gene expression could contribute to insulin zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso genes are involved in zzso processes that represent opposing zzso of zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso The regulation of the zzso and zzso genes by insulin has been studied in great detail at the level of both zzso and signal zzso Recent work on the insulin signaling pathways that lead to zzso of zzso gene expression and zzso of zzso gene expression has shown that they both require zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the transmission of the insulin zzso However, the pathways diverge after zzso and lead to zzso of different downstream zzso In this paper we review the results of studies on the zzso regulation of these genes by insulin and the signal zzso pathways that mediate these zzso
