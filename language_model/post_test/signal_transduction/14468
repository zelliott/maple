In the head of zzso zzso neural crest cells migrate from the neural tube into the zzso facial region and zzso to form zzso zzso and skeletal elements in the zzso zzso We show that newly formed neural folds and zzso neural crest cells express the zzso 2 zzso zzso in a manner that is highly zzso in zzso The repulsive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a complementary pattern in the zzso Furthermore, mice carrying zzso zzso for either zzso or zzso have abnormal zzso neural crest zzso Most notably, zzso of zzso cells are observed crossing between neural crest zzso entering zzso arches 1 and zzso In addition, zzso zzso fail to form correctly in the zzso and are improperly condensed and loosely zzso These data show that zzso signaling is required for proper zzso neural crest development in the zzso
