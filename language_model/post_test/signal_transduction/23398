zzso disease zzso is an economically significant disease in chickens that is caused by the highly zzso zzso disease virus zzso A major unanswered question is the mechanism of zzso tumor zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor discovered in the 1990s, is critically involved in viral zzso but only a few of its host target genes have been zzso zzso our understanding of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, a zzso list of zzso binding sites in the chicken zzso and a global zzso of zzso genes were zzso zzso binding sites were found to be enriched in the promoter regions of zzso genes but not in those of zzso zzso zzso was also performed for zzso a known zzso partner of zzso The close location of binding sites of zzso and zzso was noted, suggesting zzso between these two factors in modulating zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso regulates many genes that are part of several signaling pathways including the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are critical for zzso and/or include signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso activates zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso major zzso in the zzso zzso and simultaneously zzso zzso as verified using zzso of zzso and zzso in a cell proliferation zzso This study provides significant insights into the zzso basis of zzso cell zzso
