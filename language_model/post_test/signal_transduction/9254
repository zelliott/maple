zzso zzso zzso are well known as potent zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in recent years it has been recognized that members of the zzso family possess additional biological activities independent of their ability to inhibit protein zzso zzso In this study, we examined the relationship between the structure of 49 zzso and related compounds, and their capacity to induce zzso zzso 1 zzso gene expression in zzso human zzso cells, to activate upstream signaling pathways and to protect cells against zzso zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso groups in zzso molecules and double zzso zzso increased the zzso gene zzso while the zzso groups in zzso position zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased zzso The magnitude of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with specific substitution patterns in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso required parallel increase in zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso can generate zzso with one or two zzso zzso This study supports the hypothesis that zzso induce the expression of protective genes by zzso sensitive zzso zzso of regulatory zzso
