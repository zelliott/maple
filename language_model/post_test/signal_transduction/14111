During the last three decades, zzso zzso a major zzso zzso product of zzso fatty acid zzso has been shown to be involved in a great number of zzso such as zzso diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and zzso These multiple zzso can be explained by the fact that zzso is a potent zzso of numerous cell processes such as zzso stress zzso cell zzso transformation or cell zzso The main objective of this review is to focus on the different aspects of zzso cell death, with a particular emphasis on zzso zzso is a special zzso zzso because of its abilities to form protein zzso and to zzso zzso zzso It can stimulate intrinsic and zzso zzso pathways and interact with typical actors such as tumor protein 53, zzso zzso or zzso zzso At the same time, due to its zzso status, it can also induce some cellular defense mechanisms against zzso stress, thus being involved in its own zzso These processes in turn limit the zzso potential of zzso These zzso can imbalance cell fate, either toward cell death or toward survival, depending on the cell type, the zzso state and the ability to zzso
