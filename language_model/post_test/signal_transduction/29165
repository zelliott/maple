zzso regulation by protein zzso is well zzso but relatively little is known about protein zzso control of zzso Increased protein zzso type 1 zzso activity observed in failing hearts underscores the need for investigation of this zzso zzso including the elements that regulate its zzso The zzso protein zzso controls protein zzso C zzso regulation of cardiac zzso but whether this effect is specific to zzso or zzso plays a general role in zzso zzso is not zzso We sought to determine how the alpha zzso of zzso zzso regulates zzso cardiac zzso and whether zzso influences zzso regulation of cardiac zzso zzso analysis showed zzso binding to cardiac zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso activity while zzso zzso binding protein C, zzso zzso zzso I, and zzso light chain zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso and attenuated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins was reduced with zzso zzso except for zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment allowed most of the zzso effects on zzso zzso to remain, indicating that zzso removal modestly zzso cardiac zzso to zzso Our results demonstrate zzso regulation by zzso and support the concept that cardiac zzso are vital components in zzso zzso
