Many cellular signaling processes are governed by zzso through the zzso of plasma membrane zzso This zzso clearance defines the quality with which a cell can react to zzso zzso However, growing evidence indicates that zzso also enables the formation of zzso signal zzso zzso Their activity is controlled by the balanced trafficking of receptors and signaling molecules through the zzso zzso These are commonly divided into early zzso recycling zzso and late zzso Recent progress has been made in the understanding of the zzso of these zzso highlighting their dynamic zzso maturation and also the generation of zzso zzso on their zzso These zzso compartments represent the physical basis for the assembly and turnover of signaling complexes, which in turn themselves can define specialized zzso zzso
