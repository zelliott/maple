Diagnosis of zzso breast cancer is associated with a very poor zzso New therapeutic targets are urgently needed, but their development is hampered by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms leading to tumor zzso zzso this is the fact that the approximately zzso of all breast zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso are characterized by high zzso potential and poor zzso but the signaling events downstream of zzso that drive cancer cell invasion and zzso remain incompletely zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso in human breast cancer cell lines leads to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This was required for zzso zzso of the zzso small zzso zzso and zzso and promoted invasive behavior of human breast cancer zzso In a mouse model of zzso breast cancer, zzso of the gene zzso zzso strongly reduced the occurrence of zzso Moreover, in human patients with zzso breast cancer, low levels of zzso expression correlated with good zzso Our data suggest that zzso represents a new candidate therapeutic target for treating patients with zzso breast zzso
