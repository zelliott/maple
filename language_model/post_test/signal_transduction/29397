zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso responsible for the metabolism of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso zzso in vascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso are implicated in zzso dysfunction of zzso This study was to examine changes in zzso zzso in zzso cells after exposure to zzso and investigate whether zzso gene transfer could reverse zzso zzso Human zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and incubated with 3 zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso were harvested for zzso of zzso transcription, zzso and zzso zzso The culture medium was collected for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment suppressed zzso zzso and zzso activity in parallel with increased zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and decreased NO zzso zzso zzso gene transfer not only prevented the suppression of zzso activity and the zzso of zzso zzso but also attenuated the zzso of zzso activity and the reduction of NO level induced by zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathway, and zzso gene transfer could improve the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
