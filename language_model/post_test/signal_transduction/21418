The zzso of acne has been linked to multiple factors such as increased zzso production, zzso zzso zzso and the action of zzso zzso within the zzso In an attempt to understand the specific genes involved in inflammatory zzso we performed gene expression profiling in acne zzso zzso zzso were obtained from an inflammatory zzso and from normal skin in six patients with zzso zzso were also taken from normal skin of six subjects without zzso Gene array expression profiling was conducted using zzso zzso zzso zzso comparing zzso to zzso skin in acne patients and comparing zzso skin from acne patients to skin from normal zzso Within the acne patients, 211 genes are zzso in zzso skin compared to zzso zzso A significant proportion of these genes are involved in pathways that regulate inflammation and zzso zzso zzso and they include zzso zzso 1 and 3, zzso human zzso 4, and zzso zzso These data indicate a prominent role of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso peptides in acne zzso These studies are the first describing the comprehensive changes in gene expression in inflammatory acne zzso and are valuable in identifying potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory zzso
