The zzso 3 zzso is essential for regulation of zzso transport in the zzso and zzso zzso Although changes in cell surface abundance control zzso function, the molecular signals that regulate zzso surface expression are not well zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso kidney cells increased zzso transport activity, surface protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by small interfering zzso had the opposite zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased both zzso transport activity and surface protein zzso confirming that zzso is downstream of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso enhanced these effects, whereas expression of an zzso zzso that could not be zzso prevented the downstream effects on zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reversed the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso increases zzso abundance and zzso function in a manner dependent on zzso zzso
