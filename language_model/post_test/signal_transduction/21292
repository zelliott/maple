zzso is a member of an emerging family of proteins containing a novel zzso interaction domain, the zzso domain, of as yet unknown zzso Recent findings of zzso association with zzso zzso complex zzso and its zzso in zzso pits have implicated zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso exists in several zzso states in zzso When zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and larger zzso zzso were detected in high zzso Large zzso zzso zzso with zzso at an efficiency higher than that of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso fraction of zzso in mildly zzso cells was as efficient as that of the zzso zzso zzso column zzso of zzso produced zzso and of total cell zzso was performed to examine the equilibrium ratio of the zzso versus the zzso forms of zzso These experiments showed that essentially all the zzso was zzso whereas zzso of zzso could be obtained only under strong zzso zzso To map the region of zzso responsible for zzso fusion proteins corresponding to the three structural zzso of zzso were zzso zzso analysis revealed that the central portion of zzso which possesses a zzso region zzso zzso serves as the interacting zzso The possibility that zzso complexes of zzso zzso and zzso function during the recruitment of proteins into coated pits is zzso
