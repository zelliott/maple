The interactions of three zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Tax zzso bound to zzso with the A6 T cell zzso have been studied using T cell zzso kinetic and zzso zzso and X-ray zzso The three zzso zzso include weak zzso and zzso with different affinities for zzso The three-dimensional structures of the three zzso complexes are remarkably similar to each other and to the zzso zzso complex, with minor adjustments at the interface to accommodate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The lack of correlation between structural changes and the type of T cell signals induced provides direct evidence that different signals are not generated by different zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso
