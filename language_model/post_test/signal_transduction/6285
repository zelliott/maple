Regulators of G protein signaling zzso zzso G protein activity by functioning as zzso proteins zzso for zzso of zzso G zzso zzso regulates G protein zzso exchange and zzso by acting as a GAP through its zzso domain and as a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso through its zzso zzso zzso exerts zzso activity on zzso but not zzso Selective interactions are zzso by contacts between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain and the zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) Nature zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso exist in zzso zzso In this study, we tested whether all three zzso were subject to zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange on zzso and zzso could, but not zzso zzso be rendered sensitive to zzso zzso activity by replacement of zzso within the zzso zzso In addition to the contact zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso previously identified, we found that the zzso and zzso zzso are important zzso of zzso zzso The striking selectivity observed for zzso zzso activity in zzso points to zzso and zzso as the likely targets of zzso regulation in zzso
