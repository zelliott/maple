The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, known to determine the fate and growth of various cell types, can enhance cardiac zzso survival in zzso and provide zzso in acute ex zzso heart zzso However, the relevance of these findings to chronic cardiac pathology has never been zzso We hypothesized that zzso signaling is impaired during chronic zzso of the zzso zzso during the evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and that a therapeutic enhancement of zzso signaling would zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity were measured in the remote, zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice subjected to coronary artery zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso was also measured, as was the zzso of the downstream zzso zzso zzso A zzso role for zzso zzso zzso was tested via the administration of the zzso zzso zzso during and after zzso As a result, the expression data suggested that a dramatic reduction in zzso activity in the zzso early after zzso may reflect a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity continued to decline gradually during chronic zzso zzso when zzso zzso zzso also fell below zzso The zzso zzso with oral zzso during the first zzso after zzso reduced zzso in the zzso and resulted in improved zzso function, as reflected in the zzso measurement of fractional zzso In conclusion, these results provide the first documentation of zzso in zzso signaling during the in zzso development of zzso and suggest a possible therapeutic role for the pharmacological zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
