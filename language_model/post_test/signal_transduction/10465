We show that multiple myeloma zzso the second most commonly diagnosed zzso zzso is responsive to zzso zzso in zzso and in a clinically relevant zzso in zzso model, even though this disease does not depend on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or other zzso zzso clients which are hallmarks of tumor types traditionally viewed as attractive clinical settings for use of zzso zzso such as the zzso analog zzso This class of agents simultaneously suppresses in zzso cells the expression and/or function of multiple levels of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso effects allow zzso zzso to abrogate bone zzso zzso zzso protection on zzso tumor cells, and sensitize them to other zzso agents, including zzso chemotherapy and the zzso inhibitor zzso These results indicate that zzso can be targeted zzso in zzso that may not express or depend on molecules previously considered to be the main zzso client zzso This suggests a more general role for zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso of client proteins with critical involvement in zzso and zzso cellular responses, and zzso the way for more extensive future therapeutic applications of zzso zzso in diverse zzso including zzso
