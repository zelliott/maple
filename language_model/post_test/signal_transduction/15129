Several peripheral mechanisms appear to be operational in limiting zzso damage of the zzso of zzso and zzso T zzso zzso in zzso These include zzso sensitive T regulatory cells zzso zzso and zzso derived zzso zzso We used the model of multiple low doses of zzso zzso induced diabetes in susceptible zzso mice and resistant zzso mice to study these regulatory zzso We show that low dose zzso zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso mechanisms can be demonstrated in zzso mice susceptible to zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso cell count, zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso did not overcome resistance to diabetes induction in zzso zzso However, in zzso mice, deletion of zzso an orphan member of the zzso family responsible for zzso cell signaling leads to enhanced zzso to diabetes induction as evaluated by level of zzso and zzso number of zzso cells and beta cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso transcripts of zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso and zzso was significantly enhanced in pancreatic zzso zzso by day 10 after diabetes induction in zzso mice in comparison with wild type zzso mice while zzso was detected only in zzso mice by day zzso Our results are compatible with the notion that zzso cells are involved in zzso diabetes in susceptible mice and demonstrate that zzso signaling may also be involved in limiting zzso zzso pathology in diabetes resistant zzso
