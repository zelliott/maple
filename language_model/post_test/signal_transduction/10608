Many G zzso receptors possess zzso motifs ideal for interaction with zzso scaffold zzso which can control zzso trafficking and signaling in a zzso zzso To gain a panoramic view of zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was screened against a newly developed zzso array of zzso zzso These screens confirmed zzso associations with several previously identified zzso partners, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to bind specifically to the first zzso domain of zzso with the last four zzso acids zzso of zzso being the key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso robustly associated with full-length zzso in cells, and this association was abolished by zzso of the zzso terminal zzso zzso to zzso zzso as determined by zzso experiments and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso profoundly impaired zzso zzso zzso but had no apparent effect on zzso zzso zzso generation or zzso zzso zzso These findings revealed that the interaction of zzso with zzso can selectively regulate specific aspects of zzso zzso Moreover, the screens of the zzso domain zzso array provide a comprehensive view of zzso interactions with zzso zzso thereby shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso signaling and trafficking can be regulated in a zzso zzso
