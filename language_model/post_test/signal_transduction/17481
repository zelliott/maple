Recent zzso studies have suggested that zzso cell death is the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso Using a sensitive zzso method for the detection of DNA zzso we studied zzso in zzso zzso cells or intact zzso placed in zzso culture as model systems to zzso the hormonal regulation of zzso zzso rats zzso days old) were primed for 2 days with 10 zzso zzso zzso to induce a homogeneous population of mature zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from these zzso contained predominantly intact high zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso spontaneous onset of zzso DNA fragmentation characteristic of zzso cell death occurred in zzso cells during zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso or basic zzso growth factor zzso inhibited the spontaneous onset of zzso DNA zzso found during culture by zzso In contrast, zzso growth factor I, insulin, zzso beta and tumor necrosis zzso were zzso Likewise, zzso of the protein zzso A or C pathways with zzso or zzso zzso zzso respectively, did not prevent the onset of DNA zzso although inclusion of a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso completely blocked the ability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to suppress zzso in zzso zzso Similar to cultured zzso cells, a spontaneous onset of zzso was also observed to occur in isolated zzso zzso during zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso with zzso or zzso inhibited the spontaneous initiation of zzso and the zzso effects of these growth factors were also attenuated by zzso with zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
