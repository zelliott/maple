zzso zzso zzso can signal either via zzso response element zzso pathways or via alternate pathways involving zzso or membrane zzso We previously demonstrated that, as compared to wild type zzso controls, mice expressing a zzso zzso lacking the ability to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display significant zzso in the skeletal response to zzso To zzso the zzso underlying these in zzso deficits, we generated zzso cells zzso expressing either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso Compared to cells zzso with the control zzso stable expression of zzso even in the absence of zzso resulted in an increase in zzso levels for alkaline zzso zzso by zzso P zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso levels for insulin growth zzso zzso (by zzso P zzso zzso with no effects on collagen I zzso I) or zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, stable expression of the zzso zzso resulted in the suppression of zzso levels for zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso (by 62, 89, 60, and zzso P zzso zzso While zzso increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso I, and zzso in zzso cells, zzso effects in the zzso cells on zzso and zzso zzso levels were zzso with a trend for zzso to inhibit zzso I zzso zzso In addition, zzso had no effects on zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso these findings indicate that zzso signaling plays a significant role in zzso effects of zzso on zzso differentiation markers and on zzso zzso zzso
