To test a fluid flow system for the investigation of the influence of zzso stress on expression of zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso (from zzso and zzso zzso and human zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso and zzso and normal human zzso zzso were cultured on type II zzso glass plates under zzso conditions or placed in a flow chamber to form a closed zzso system for exposure to different levels of zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to analyze zzso gene zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso and small interfering zzso were used to investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

There was a significant reduction in zzso expression in zzso zzso obtained from zzso sites compared with those obtained from zzso zzso In zzso zzso subjected to 2 hours of zzso flow, moderate zzso stresses (5 and 10 zzso generated significant zzso zzso which was regulated through zzso zzso and zzso zzso These levels of zzso stress also increased zzso expression in zzso zzso from zzso sites and from normal healthy cartilage through the zzso of zzso and zzso signal zzso but no effect of these levels of fluid zzso stress was observed on zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from zzso sites and those from zzso sites of human cartilage have differential responses to zzso stress with regard to zzso gene zzso and therefore diverse functional consequences can be zzso
