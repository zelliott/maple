zzso how nutrients affect gene expression will help us to understand the mechanisms controlling plant growth and development as a function of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to serve as a signal for the control of gene expression in zzso There is also evidence, on a zzso basis, that downstream products of nitrogen zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso might serve as signals of organic N status that in turn regulate gene zzso To identify zzso responses to such organic N signals, zzso zzso were zzso treated with ammonium nitrate in the presence or absence of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso resulting in a block of zzso zzso Genes that responded to organic N were identified as those whose response to ammonium nitrate treatment was blocked in the presence of zzso We showed that some genes previously identified to be regulated by nitrate are under the control of an organic zzso Using an integrated network model of molecular zzso we uncovered a zzso regulated by organic N that included zzso and target genes involved in zzso We validated some of the predicted interactions and showed that regulation of the master clock control gene zzso by zzso or a zzso zzso in turn regulates the expression of key zzso zzso Phase response curve analysis shows that distinct zzso can advance or delay the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by organic N signals may represent a novel input mechanism for zzso to affect plant zzso clock zzso
