zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso is implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso injury but can also prime zzso to enter the cell zzso zzso zzso protects against zzso zzso liver injury and is associated with zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso We examined the pattern of zzso release during zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso and we tested whether a single zzso injection of zzso could mimic the zzso effects of zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso and plasma levels of zzso rose during zzso zzso reaching high levels after 90 minutes; values remained elevated during zzso until 44 zzso Following the zzso zzso zzso there was an early rise in zzso and serum zzso levels, but, during a second prolonged zzso zzso peak, zzso values were lower than in zzso mice and declined to negligible levels by 2 hours zzso An injection with 1 zzso or 5 zzso body weight zzso 30 minutes prior to zzso zzso substantially reduced liver injury determined by liver zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso As in zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and cell cycle entry, determined by zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso effects of zzso can be simulated by zzso injection, which has identical downstream effects on cell cycle zzso We propose that transient increases in zzso levels may substitute for, as well as, mediate the zzso effects of zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso
