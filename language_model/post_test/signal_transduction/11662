All three major members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso N terminal zzso zzso have been shown to control cellular responses to inflammation in zzso Therefore these zzso have been designated suitable targets for zzso zzso However, the extent to which these zzso are actually activated during inflammation in humans in zzso has not been zzso We employed experimental human zzso a model of systemic zzso to address this zzso 

Male volunteers were zzso infused with 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso Directly before zzso infusion and up to 24 h thereafter, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in peripheral blood, using Western zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso induced a strong but transient zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity being reached after 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso or zzso was detected under these zzso 

These results suggest that both zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso are potentially useful for zzso zzso
