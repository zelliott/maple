zzso is an auxiliary zzso for the transforming growth factor beta zzso highly expressed on zzso zzso cells and adult zzso stem zzso Because zzso zzso expression was reported in the developing zzso region, we further characterized its expression profile in the zzso and examined the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cell clusters and the zzso cell fraction enriched in zzso stem cell activity expressed zzso zzso zzso short-term zzso zzso were highly enriched in the zzso population whereas more immature long-term zzso stem cells are contained within the zzso zzso This places zzso on the short list of molecules discriminating short-term versus long-term zzso in the zzso Furthermore, decreasing transforming growth factor beta signaling increases the number of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso expression level defines a hierarchy among zzso zzso cells allowing zzso of zzso versus more immature zzso zzso and that the transforming growth factor beta zzso plays a critical role in this zzso
