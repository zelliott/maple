Very recently a gene marker panel that allows the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The aim of the present study was to use the zzso marker panel covering the zzso and zzso zzso pathways to determine the percentage of sporadic zzso zzso zzso carrying at least one of the four zzso genes in a zzso form alone and/or in combination with zzso instability zzso and to compare the sensitivity of the gene marker panel used in this study with that of gene marker panels previously reported in the scientific zzso 

zzso and zzso were screened by zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso gene zzso by restriction zzso length zzso zzso For the zzso analysis of the zzso gene zzso cluster region zzso zzso direct DNA sequencing was zzso The zzso National Cancer Institute zzso panel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was used for zzso zzso 

It could be shown that about zzso of early stage zzso zzso stages I and zzso and over zzso of zzso in the zzso stage IV carried at least one zzso gene and/or showed zzso No significant increase in the gene zzso zzso could be determined when comparing zzso in the zzso stage I with those in zzso stage zzso 

When compared with previously published gene marker panels the zzso marker panel used in the present study shows an excellent performance, allowing to detect genetic zzso in zzso of human sporadic zzso samples zzso
