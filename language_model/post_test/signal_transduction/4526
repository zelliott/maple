During the process of B cell development, zzso factors, such as zzso and zzso have been known to play key zzso Although zzso factors and zzso regulators work in concert to direct the expression of B zzso zzso little is known about the involvement of regulators for zzso structure during B zzso In this article, we show that deletion of zzso a scaffold zzso of the zzso zzso complex, in the zzso lineage caused defects at both the common zzso zzso stage and the transition from zzso to early zzso cells due to failures in the expression of B zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and their downstream target zzso Moreover, mice that were deficient in the expression of zzso a zzso of the complex with zzso activity, also showed defects in early B cell zzso We also found that the expression of zzso and zzso is directly regulated by the zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that the zzso zzso complex zzso early B cell development by regulating the expression of B zzso zzso
