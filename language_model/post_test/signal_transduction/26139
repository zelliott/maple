zzso of zzso is directly correlated with the biological effectiveness of zzso radiation zzso zzso we investigated the efficacy of zzso leaf extract zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell death in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exposed to single dose zzso 10 zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso with or without zzso were examined for zzso zzso of 84 zzso zzso genes using quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso induced 55 and suppressed 10 zzso while zzso induced 49 and suppressed 5 zzso Of these, 46 and 4 genes were commonly zzso after zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

These data imply that zzso may exert zzso by zzso zzso signaling and zzso survival signaling and may thus zzso zzso in zzso
