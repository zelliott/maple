We have studied the interactions of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso alpha M beta zzso a zzso zzso found predominantly on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso of a zzso of zzso occurred on both the alpha M and beta 2 zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso for zzso was an excellent competitor of the binding of a zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression increased zzso binding of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and the increase in zzso binding was correlated with a three- to fourfold increase in zzso by zzso An zzso inhibited beta zzso migration through zzso but the production of zzso oxygen species in zzso adherent to zzso dramatically zzso Thus, our data demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso that can mediate their zzso and that this binding may have important functional zzso
