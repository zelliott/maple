The zzso zzso has been proposed as promoting zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso activate zzso zzso and increase nuclear zzso of zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso expression in the stem cell region of zzso during zzso growth in zzso zzso of zzso rats were humanely killed at 7, 14, 21, 35, and 72 days of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and image analysis with cumulative signal zzso zzso and nuclear expression of zzso peaked nearly zzso at day 14 zzso day 7) of life in the stem cell region of zzso zzso zzso nuclear expression peaked earlier at 7 days and was lower thereafter with zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso is activated in the stem cell region of zzso zzso during growth of the small zzso
