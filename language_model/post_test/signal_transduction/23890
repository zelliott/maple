zzso zzso is a leading cause of acute bacterial zzso in zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso interacts with host cells, however, is still poorly zzso Our previous study has shown that the zzso zzso surface zzso zzso mediates adherence of the zzso to zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso cell surface heat shock protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways leading to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso overlay and zzso pull down zzso showed that zzso interacts with zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly blocked the interaction between zzso and zzso suggesting a direct interaction between zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso initiated two zzso zzso one leading to the zzso and degradation of zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso and another one to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells suggest that zzso triggers zzso responses in host cells following zzso zzso zzso
