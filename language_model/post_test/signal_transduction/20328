Human zzso virus zzso primarily zzso zzso cells in the central nervous system zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso individuals who abuse drugs such as methamphetamine zzso have higher viral loads and experience more severe neurological complications than zzso individuals who do not abuse zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso on zzso expression from the zzso long terminal repeat zzso promoter and on an zzso integrated zzso in zzso cells, the primary host cells for zzso in the zzso zzso human zzso cells immortalized with zzso T zzso zzso zzso were zzso with an zzso zzso reporter and the zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of viral replication and gene zzso and exposed to zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso treatment induced zzso zzso an effect zzso in the presence of zzso We also found that zzso increased the nuclear zzso of the nuclear factor zzso B zzso a key cellular zzso regulator of the zzso promoter, and the activity of an zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso The presence of a zzso regulator of zzso blocked zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso infected zzso zzso cells with zzso induced zzso expression and nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso can stimulate zzso gene expression in zzso cells through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso This mechanism may outline the initial zzso events leading to the observed increased zzso in zzso individuals who use zzso
