zzso acid zzso is the most important hormone for plants to resist drought and other zzso zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso family of zzso zzso resulting in zzso of type zzso zzso zzso and zzso of downstream zzso zzso It is envisioned that intervention of zzso signaling by small molecules could help plants to overcome zzso stresses such as drought, cold and soil zzso However, chemical instability and rapid zzso by plant zzso limit the practical application of zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a small zzso zzso mimic zzso that acts as a potent zzso of multiple members of the family of zzso zzso In zzso zzso activates a gene network that is highly similar to that induced by zzso zzso with zzso inhibit seed zzso prevent leaf water loss, and promote drought zzso We solved the crystal structure of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which revealed that zzso mediates a zzso interacting network, a structural feature that is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that a single small zzso zzso mimic can activate multiple zzso receptors and protect plants from water loss and drought zzso Moreover, the zzso complex crystal structure provides a structural basis for designing the next generation of zzso small zzso
