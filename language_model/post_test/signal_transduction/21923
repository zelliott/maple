zzso plaques are often observed with zzso strands of vascular zzso cells but the molecular interaction and functional relationships between these two junctions remain zzso We zzso show that zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso with zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso barrier zzso zzso zzso Gap junction zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso did not influence expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or their zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, these zzso blocking agents inhibited the barrier function of tight junctions in cells, determined by measurement of zzso electrical resistance and zzso flux of zzso and zzso zzso also significantly reduced the barrier property in rat lung zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but did not change the interaction between zzso and either zzso or zzso nor their expression levels or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso and/or zzso gap junctions might be required to maintain the zzso barrier function without altering the expression and zzso of the zzso components zzso
