zzso tracing has shown that the different regions of the zzso heart of zzso zzso derive from zzso distinct precursor pools in a zzso and temporally tightly controlled zzso zzso of the first heart field differentiate early and form the linear heart tube of zzso zzso the future left zzso The right zzso zzso and zzso tract derive from the second heart field by recruitment and delayed local zzso zzso Finally, zzso precursors are added at the zzso cardiac pole after the chambers have been formed to generate the zzso aspects of the mature zzso return system, including the zzso parts of the zzso veins and the zzso zzso The zzso of the linear heart tube by second heart zzso cells requires the maintenance of highly zzso precursor pools by a number of signaling zzso including sonic zzso zzso growth factor, and zzso zzso The molecular circuits that operate during the addition of the most zzso components from zzso zzso have remained zzso It has emerged that at least one of the pathways required for proliferation of second heart field zzso zzso zzso zzso also operates in a subset of zzso cells for formation of zzso zzso zzso This argues for both zzso and specific regulatory zzso zzso the polar extension of the cardiac tube during zzso
