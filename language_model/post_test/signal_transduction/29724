In zzso studies using immortalized GT1 cells suggest that zzso zzso employ zzso to directly regulate the zzso of zzso the zzso that controls sexual maturation and adult zzso zzso However, whether such zzso zzso signaling occurs in zzso is not zzso In the present study, we used in zzso zzso and zzso to determine whether zzso and zzso zzso express the molecular components necessary to set in motion communication processes involving zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso in the male rat zzso region zzso expressed zzso zzso and that zzso zzso were often found in close association with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso cell bodies in the zzso expressed both type II zzso receptors zzso which selectively bind zzso and zzso one of the primary zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that they are fully capable of responding directly to zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, incubation of zzso zzso with zzso caused a zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso expression in individual zzso This effect was observed within 1 h after zzso and was inhibited by addition of the soluble form of zzso to the incubation zzso In contrast, whereas both zzso and zzso zzso were abundantly expressed in both zzso cells and zzso in the median zzso the projection field of zzso zzso zzso zzso was mainly restricted to the processes of zzso and did not zzso with zzso zzso This observation supports previous in zzso studies showing that zzso is unable to directly zzso zzso release from zzso nerve zzso Thus, zzso zzso may directly influence zzso expression and/or zzso in zzso by acting on the zzso but not the zzso of zzso zzso
