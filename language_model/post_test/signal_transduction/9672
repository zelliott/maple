zzso zzso zzso was identified as a positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso function in zzso zzso are a small gene zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso clones zzso putative zzso protein zzso and zzso were obtained from total zzso isolated from zzso zzso petals using zzso and zzso zzso The predicted proteins of zzso and zzso consist of zzso and 233 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the deduced zzso zzso like most other zzso includes two putative zzso zzso while the deduced zzso protein includes five putative zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso Northern blots showed that the level of zzso zzso in petals first decreased then increased remarkably after zzso production started, and zzso expression showed an increasing trend in zzso during natural flower zzso The amount of zzso transcripts increased gradually in both petals and zzso during natural zzso zzso zzso increased transcript abundance of zzso and zzso to various degrees in both petals and zzso zzso treatment decreased the level of zzso zzso in petals and zzso compared with the zzso zzso and zzso showed a rapid increase and then a decrease in zzso zzso in leaves after zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso could play important roles in flower zzso zzso zzso treatment did not remarkably affect the amount of zzso and zzso zzso
