zzso zzso has been thought to be an zzso zzso acid neurotransmitter in the zzso central nervous system zzso The hypothesis is supported by successful cloning of a number of genes zzso different signaling zzso such as zzso receptors for signal zzso zzso zzso for signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso for signal output through zzso zzso Limited information is available in the literature with regard to an zzso zzso role of zzso in peripheral zzso and zzso zzso whereas recent molecular biological analyses including ours give rise to a novel function for zzso as an zzso and/or zzso factor in bone comprised of zzso zzso and zzso in addition to other peripheral zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso could play a dual role in mechanisms underlying maintenance of cellular zzso as an zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso and as an zzso signal zzso in peripheral zzso and/or zzso zzso In this review, therefore, we summarized the possible signaling by zzso as an zzso signal zzso in mechanisms underlying maintenance of cellular zzso with a focus on bone zzso
