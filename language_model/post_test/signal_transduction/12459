zzso communication between the zzso and zzso zzso is vital for the timely manifestation of zzso that restrict systemic spread of zzso The zzso provides an important zzso for zzso of signals that contribute to long-distance communication within a zzso Airborne signals also contribute to this zzso In recent years, major advances have been made in identifying zzso that are candidate systemic signals in plant zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and a zzso have been implicated as mobile signals associated with the zzso of systemic acquired resistance zzso which zzso enhanced resistance against a broad spectrum of zzso By contrast, zzso probably contribute to negative regulation of systemic zzso
