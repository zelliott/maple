zzso is a zzso factor that plays an essential role in zzso and has been proposed to inhibit the late stages of zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of zzso maturation and zzso by zzso remain zzso In this study, we attempted to clarify roles of zzso in the late stages of zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso alone or zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the maturation and zzso of zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso expression in primary zzso and the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso the early stages of zzso proliferation and zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited maturation and zzso of zzso in organ zzso The zzso effects of zzso were rescued by treating with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso bound to the promoter region of the zzso gene and zzso zzso gene promoter zzso Interestingly, we also found that the zzso family members functionally collaborated with zzso signaling to regulate zzso expression and zzso zzso Our results provide novel evidence that zzso family members mediate zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression in association with zzso zzso
