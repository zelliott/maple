Recent studies demonstrate that rapid zzso response to zzso is zzso by zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling pathway, leading to increased synaptic proteins in the prefrontal zzso zzso of zzso Our zzso studies indicate robust deficits in prominent zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso density protein zzso zzso in the zzso in major depressive disorder zzso We zzso that deficits in the zzso translation initiation zzso contribute to the molecular pathology seen in the zzso of zzso subjects, and that a rapid reversal of these abnormalities may zzso zzso zzso The majority of known zzso regulation occurs at the level of zzso zzso regulates translation initiation via its downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso initiation factors zzso and zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we examined the expression of zzso and its core downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of 12 depressed subjects and 12 zzso healthy controls using Western zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 209 zzso and zzso zzso at zzso 504 zzso were also zzso zzso cortical tissue samples from both zzso of subjects were used in our previous zzso zzso There was a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in zzso subjects relative to zzso No group differences were observed in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our findings show deficits in zzso translation initiation in zzso particularly via the zzso pathway, and indicate a potential association between marked deficits in synaptic proteins and zzso of zzso signaling in zzso
