Using the zzso tail of the rat zzso zzso zzso as zzso in a zzso zzso screen resulted in the identification of zzso (a protein initially identified as a zzso of zzso as a putative zzso binding zzso More recently zzso has been shown to promote the degradation of a zzso zzso inhibitor and to be a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells revealed a punctuated zzso and zzso zzso while cell zzso studies showed that most of the zzso was in a high speed zzso zzso of zzso cells revealed that zzso binds to the immature zzso precursor of the zzso that resides in the zzso zzso and promotes its zzso It does not appear to interact with the cell surface zzso however, and it does not affect its zzso When zzso into zzso cells, zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso but zzso with zzso prevents this zzso We conclude that zzso interacts with the zzso precursor and promotes its zzso These results reveal a novel protein binding partner of the zzso and are consistent with current views of the functions of zzso
