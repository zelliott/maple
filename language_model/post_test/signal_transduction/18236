The zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso a zzso factor that regulates longevity in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of these zzso zzso factors causes growth suppression in a variety of cell lines, including a zzso cell line and a cell line lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocks zzso progression at phase zzso independent of functional zzso protein zzso but dependent on the zzso inhibitor zzso Indeed, zzso zzso activates zzso resulting in increased protein zzso We conclude that zzso proteins are involved in zzso regulation and that zzso of these proteins is an important step in zzso zzso
