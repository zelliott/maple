zzso restriction zzso is the most universal intervention known to extend animal zzso DR also prevents tumor development in zzso and this effect requires the tumor zzso zzso However, the zzso and cellular processes that zzso the beneficial effects of DR are poorly zzso We identified zzso in an zzso screen for genes that extend zzso zzso lifespan in a zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso which increases average lifespan by zzso mimics DR in worms fed ad zzso An zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso revealed lower zzso levels compared to zzso animals, as expected for zzso animals, but also higher zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso support a model in which the long lifespan of zzso zzso relies on increased zzso zzso metabolism coupled to an zzso response to zzso zzso This response requires zzso and the previously identified DR zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Overall, our data show that zzso zzso plays a central role in lifespan control in zzso and that the beneficial effects of DR results from a zzso mechanism involving the zzso Analysis of the zzso protein sequence predicts that zzso encodes a plasma membrane zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of this zzso zzso in zzso might also promote a DR zzso
