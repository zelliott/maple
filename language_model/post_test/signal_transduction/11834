The discovery of Toll in zzso and of the remarkable conservation in zzso composition and organization zzso a transformation in our understanding of innate immune recognition and zzso At the center of that picture is a cascade of interactions in which specific microbial cues activate Toll zzso which then transmit signals driving zzso factor nuclear zzso and zzso zzso gave substance to the vision of pattern recognition zzso linked phenomena in development, gene regulation, and immunity into a coherent whole, and revealed a rich set of variations for identifying zzso and responding zzso More recently, research in zzso has illuminated the positive and negative regulation of Toll zzso the organization of signaling events at and beneath zzso the sorting of information flow, and the existence of zzso signaling via zzso zzso Here, we provide an overview of the Toll zzso of flies and highlight these ongoing zzso of zzso
