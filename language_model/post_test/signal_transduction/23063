zzso serve as a pivotal component of the zzso cell death zzso However, cells that lack zzso DNA zzso zzso retain apparently normal zzso zzso In the present study, we examined zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso revealed that zzso cells maintained a normal zzso c distribution in zzso even though these cells were deficient in zzso Upon zzso treatment, zzso c was released zzso with zzso of zzso 3 and loss of zzso membrane potential zzso After zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso cells underwent little change in zzso zzso zzso potential whereas a dramatic zzso in zzso zzso zzso pool occurred in parental zzso zzso These results show that zzso signaling of zzso via zzso c release was preserved in cells lacking zzso However, zzso zzso that normally accompanies zzso was lost, indicating that the zzso respiratory chain provides the major source of zzso signaling in zzso
