zzso zzso zzso protects zzso against zzso An excessive release of zzso is widely considered to be one of the molecular mechanisms of zzso damage in several neurological zzso We investigated whether zzso affected zzso release in rat cerebral zzso nerve terminals zzso zzso inhibited the release of zzso that was evoked by exposing zzso to the zzso channel blocker zzso zzso and this phenomenon was zzso zzso of zzso release by zzso was prevented by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso but was insensitive to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the resting zzso membrane potential or zzso zzso zzso of the effect of zzso on zzso zzso revealed that diminution of zzso release could be attributed to a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso of zzso release was completely prevented by blocking the zzso and zzso zzso channels, but not by blocking zzso zzso release or zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect on zzso zzso release was abolished by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso I zzso or zzso IX zzso and zzso significantly decreased the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso C zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso release from rat cortical zzso through the suppression of zzso zzso zzso entry and zzso zzso
