zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular energy zzso and several natural compounds that activate zzso possibly enhance zzso zzso by muscle zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and these effects were significantly reduced by zzso zzso or compound C, suggesting that enhanced zzso zzso by zzso is predominantly accomplished via an zzso zzso zzso zzso An insulin resistance state was induced by exposing cells to zzso zzso as indicated by reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso Surprisingly, disrupted insulin signaling and decreased zzso activity by high zzso zzso were prevented by zzso Moreover, this treatment increased zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest a link between high zzso and insulin resistance in muscle cells, and provide further evidence that zzso zzso blockade of insulin signaling by enhancing zzso zzso zzso by the zzso the zzso zzso In addition, this study indicates the targeting of zzso represents a new therapeutic strategy for zzso insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
