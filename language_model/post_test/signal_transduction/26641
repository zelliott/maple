The zzso zinc finger protein zzso is a candidate zzso in breast zzso In this study, we showed that high levels of expression of zzso zzso are associated with poor prognosis and the development of zzso in breast zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells zzso migration and invasion in zzso and promoted the development of spontaneous lung or zzso zzso in mice in zzso zzso also promoted zzso transition zzso in human zzso zzso cells, and the zzso zzso signaling zzso was identified as a major driver of zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso loop sustained zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, most likely because of zzso direct zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso led to the reversal of zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso zzso expression may represent a novel zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso targeting of zzso of the zzso signaling zzso may benefit the subset of patients whose tumors express high levels of zzso
