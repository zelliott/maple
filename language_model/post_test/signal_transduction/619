To investigate the roles of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 4 zzso and zzso of zzso signaling 3 zzso in differentiation and zzso zzso of T helper zzso cells by separate zzso 

zzso cells were induced to differentiate to zzso or zzso cells by zzso 12 zzso or zzso 4 zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were silenced separately by small interfering zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells and then the zzso cultured in zzso or zzso medium with zzso or zzso for another 48 h before cells and zzso were collected for the detection of zzso and zzso type zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By comparing different amounts of zzso between before and after zzso the target zzso the roles of zzso and zzso in the differentiation and zzso zzso in T helper cells were zzso 

zzso type zzso significantly decreased and zzso type zzso increased after zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso minimal changes were detected in both zzso and zzso type zzso after zzso zzso 

zzso mediates the zzso differentiation of T cells to zzso subset and maintains the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso directly zzso the development and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso results in impaired development and zzso zzso of zzso cells and the enhanced development and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has minimal effects on zzso or zzso induced differentiation and zzso zzso of T helper zzso
