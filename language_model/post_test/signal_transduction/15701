It is well known that zzso zzso zzso factor zzso promotes cell migration in an zzso manner in various tumor zzso However, it remains unclear whether certain zzso zzso the effects of zzso on tumor cell zzso Because zzso zzso a zzso zzso is produced by melanoma cells and has been correlated with melanoma migration, the migratory ability of melanoma cells induced by zzso may also involve induction of zzso zzso In the present study, we assessed whether zzso promotes melanoma cell migration through zzso production of zzso We found that zzso stimulation increased zzso production through zzso of zzso zzso transcription, especially in biologically early stage melanoma zzso zzso migration of these cells was inhibited by a specific zzso zzso against zzso The zzso production induced by zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso These findings suggest that melanoma migration induced by zzso is zzso by zzso production of zzso as a novel downstream zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
