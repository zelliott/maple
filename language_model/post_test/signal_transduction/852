Historically, it has been assumed that the functional roles of G proteins in zzso recognition and zzso regulation are specified by their diverse alpha zzso However, the discovery of similarly diverse zzso zzso that participate in both of these functional processes has called this assumption into zzso recent work suggests that G proteins function as zzso whose roles in particular zzso signaling pathways are determined by their specific zzso zzso zzso Although much remains to be learned, the assembly of specific zzso zzso combinations seems to involve both structural and spatial zzso
