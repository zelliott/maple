A new family of zzso zzso networks, with optimal properties in many respects, is zzso By definition, their zzso is such that it zzso zzso for many zzso zzso These networks are shown to have an extremely homogeneous zzso degree, zzso distance, zzso and loop zzso are all very zzso Also, they are characterized by a very interwoven zzso structure with short average zzso large zzso and no zzso community zzso This family of nets exhibits an excellent performance with respect to other flow properties such as zzso against errors and attacks, minimal zzso time of random walks, efficient communication, zzso These remarkable features convert zzso networks in a useful concept, optimal or almost optimal in many zzso and with plenty of potential applications in computer science or zzso
