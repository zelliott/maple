The zzso zzso zzso commonplace in aquatic organisms, is used as the terminal electron zzso for zzso in many bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso for respiratory zzso is controlled by a zzso system that comprises the zzso protein zzso the sensor zzso zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso Here we study the zzso sensor system to gain zzso insight into signaling by zzso zzso zzso We determined crystal structures for complexes of zzso sensor zzso with zzso zzso and with zzso zzso we characterized zzso sensor associations with zzso in zzso we analyzed the thermodynamics of zzso binding to zzso zzso and we analyzed in zzso responses to zzso through the zzso system to test zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso complex that binds zzso with negative zzso to form a zzso active zzso
