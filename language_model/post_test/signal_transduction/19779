A commonly accepted model of zzso signaling involves target gene zzso zzso complex of zzso with a zzso factor zzso family zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been implicated in zzso signaling and plays key roles in embryonic axis zzso and stem cell zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso proteins stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso event involves zzso recruitment of zzso protein zzso 2 zzso to zzso and culminates in the zzso of zzso from a target gene zzso zzso zzso proteins resistant to zzso zzso function as zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso during zzso axis zzso These findings reveal an alternative zzso mechanism of zzso signaling that involves zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of target genes and link this molecular event to a specific zzso zzso
