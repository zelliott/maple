Cell migration requires establishment of a single zzso in the direction of zzso Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms that regulate formation of zzso We discuss how signal zzso processes are zzso and temporally organized to establish cell polarity through directed extension and stabilization of dominant zzso We also highlight recent advances in technology that will further the understanding of signaling dynamics specific to zzso extension and cell zzso
