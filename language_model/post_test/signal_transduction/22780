We have characterized the cell movements and prospective cell identities as neural folds fuse during neural tube formation in zzso zzso A newly developed zzso zzso fluorescent zzso in zzso zzso method, zzso with zzso zzso shows that the zzso neural tube gene zzso and the zzso gene zzso are expressed far lateral to the zzso site of neural fold fusion and that expression moves zzso after zzso To determine whether cell movements or dynamic changes in gene expression are responsible, we used zzso zzso followed by fluorescent in zzso and zzso zzso These methods revealed that populations of prospective neural crest and zzso neural tube cells near the lateral margin of the neural plate at the start of zzso move to the zzso zzso using distinctive forms of zzso Before fold fusion, superficial neural cells zzso contract, roll the neural plate into a trough and appear to pull the superficial zzso cell sheet zzso After neural fold fusion, lateral deep neural cells move zzso by zzso zzso between other neural cells using two types of zzso The neural crest cells migrate as individual cells toward the zzso zzso using zzso directed zzso zzso These movements combine the two lateral populations of neural crest into a single zzso population that form the roof of the neural zzso The remaining cells of the zzso neural tube extend zzso both zzso and zzso bringing about zzso zzso of deep and superficial cells to form a zzso zzso neural zzso While ours is the first description of zzso directed cell migration during neural fold fusion and zzso of the neural tube, these complex cell behaviors may be involved during zzso of the zzso neural zzso and secondary zzso in the zzso axis of chicken and zzso
