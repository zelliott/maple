zzso zzso virus zzso directly kills cancer cells by inducing zzso through a mechanism zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso However, whether other signaling pathways are involved remain largely zzso This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying zzso zzso in zzso zzso melanoma zzso We found that zzso induced zzso cell zzso via the zzso pathway, particularly zzso which mediates the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso also contributed to zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso involvement depended on both zzso promoter zzso zzso and type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of type I zzso but involved zzso In addition, zzso zzso treatment displayed a direct zzso effect in an in zzso zzso nude mouse melanoma zzso zzso our data provides new insights into the mechanism underlying zzso zzso in tumor zzso
