A potential role for zzso light chain zzso zzso in regulating zzso pressure and zzso function has recently been reported in living monkey eye and rabbit zzso There is little information about the effects of the zzso zzso agents, zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this signaling zzso in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso in isolated bovine iris zzso and zzso to investigate the existence of the zzso zzso in this zzso In the present studies on the zzso zzso four signal zzso mechanism zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the studies on the existence of the zzso zzso in the bovine iris zzso the pharmacology and expression of the zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, were zzso The data obtained on the zzso zzso showed that the three zzso zzso the zzso and pharmacological responses in a concentration and zzso manner and that the order of potency and efficacy is zzso The zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contraction zzso were for zzso 9, 42, 200 and 140 zzso respectively, for zzso 13, 59, 250 and 828 zzso respectively, and for zzso 22, zzso 630 and 910 zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and contraction induced by zzso demonstrating a close relationship between zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso The pharmacological studies showed that in the concentration range of 1 zzso to 10 zzso the zzso zzso caused zzso zzso with the following order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso demonstrated expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein in this smooth zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso signaling zzso is involved in the zzso function of the bovine iris zzso and zzso demonstrate that functional zzso receptors exist and are expressed in this zzso
