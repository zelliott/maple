The ability of zzso of the zzso zzso to elevate zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso is enhanced upon zzso of avian zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso To investigate the molecular basis for this effect, we prepared particulate zzso from control and zzso zzso zzso zzso and assessed the relative abilities of several zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso to stimulate the zzso zzso zzso to zzso increases in both the sensitivity and maximum responsiveness of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso were consistently observed in zzso prepared from the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso response to two agents believed to act directly at the level of the G protein were either enhanced zzso or unaffected zzso gamma zzso by zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso was associated with a reduced ability of both zzso and zzso to activate zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of wild type zzso may affect two distinct steps in the regulation of zzso exerting a positive effect at the level of zzso zzso and a negative effect on zzso zzso As no differences in the relative number or affinity of zzso zzso or in the level of zzso zzso alpha or G zzso were detected between control cells and those zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso results in a modification of one or more components in this signal zzso zzso
