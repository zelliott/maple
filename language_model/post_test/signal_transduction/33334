In the budding zzso zzso zzso components of a single zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso two distinct signals, each of which activates an independent zzso zzso zzso mating zzso initiate the mating response, whereas zzso limitation zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso in this pathway, zzso triggers mating but zzso zzso growth, while the other, zzso 1, zzso triggers zzso zzso Both zzso activate the same zzso factor, zzso 12, which can stimulate gene expression specific to each of the zzso zzso The precise mechanism by which these zzso zzso activate zzso 12, however, is not zzso 

Two newly identified zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 (also known as zzso and zzso were found to associate physically with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were prominent zzso in zzso reactions of zzso immune complexes from zzso zzso Association of zzso with zzso required zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso caused release of zzso from the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso single zzso had no obvious zzso both zzso growth and zzso gene expression were zzso in zzso zzso double zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells required zzso function, but did not require the function of upstream zzso zzso with zzso and zzso having a role in zzso regulation, both proteins were localized to the zzso 

zzso and zzso repress the mating and zzso growth responses of zzso zzso by directly zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso may cause zzso release of zzso from zzso and thereby activate zzso zzso
