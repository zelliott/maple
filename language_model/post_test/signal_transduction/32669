With an annual zzso of about ten in zzso people, chronic zzso leukemia zzso accounts for most cases of zzso disease and for zzso of all zzso While novel therapies such as treatment with zzso or bone zzso transplantation have successively improved the outcome of zzso treatment, hope for future progress in the therapy of zzso lies in an almost unique feature of this zzso zzso In contrast to many other forms or zzso of zzso which display a great diversity in zzso zzso most cases zzso of zzso seem to be caused by an almost invariably found zzso zzso the so-called Philadelphia zzso zzso resulting in the zzso fusion zzso Its gene product, zzso zzso is believed to be essential for zzso cell transformation and seems to exert its effects by interfering with cellular signal zzso zzso normally involved in the control of cell death and zzso Several partially interacting pathways have been shown to be induced by zzso The role of most of them is still unclear and, as understanding their biological functions should lead to novel therapeutic strategies on a molecular basis, much effort is spent on identifying their precise roles in zzso This review focuses on our current understanding of zzso signal zzso and outlines its importance for the biological effects of zzso
