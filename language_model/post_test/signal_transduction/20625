Although genetic variations in several genes zzso for synaptic zzso proteins have been found to be associated with zzso spectrum disorders, one of the most consistently zzso genes has been zzso zzso for zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and complementary zzso techniques, we compared zzso zzso to 12 point zzso identified in individuals with zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso localized to the cell surface, some of the zzso show altered cellular zzso In particular, zzso is largely retained in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso key zzso zzso appear to be responsible for retention of this zzso and zzso of one signaling zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso The presence of this zzso also lowers expression and activates zzso zzso A zzso zzso that causes a form of zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso protein with seemingly normal folding and zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso has severe trafficking abnormalities and zzso is a zzso soluble zzso suggesting that the structural or signaling functions of the membrane zzso form are zzso Our data support a complex genetic architecture in which multiple distinct risk factors interact with others to shape zzso risk and zzso
