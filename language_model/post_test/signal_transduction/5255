Signaling through the zzso zzso on zzso cells has been shown to play an important role in normal and zzso vascular zzso We generated zzso zzso melanoma tumor cells that zzso express soluble zzso zzso zzso to study the effects of zzso zzso signaling on tumor zzso zzso induction rapidly decreased zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso cells as detected by zzso This was accompanied by an increase in zzso cell zzso zzso but no change in zzso zzso Together with a decrease in the percentage of zzso vessels, this suggested that tumor vessel zzso and impaired vascular function rather than zzso zzso was responsible for the delay in tumor growth following zzso zzso However, zzso failed to inhibit the growth of larger, more established zzso zzso These tumors were additionally treated with zzso a zzso inhibitor that zzso tumor zzso cell zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso decreased both zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso cell survival and zzso and significantly inhibited growth of the more established zzso These studies indicate that activity of specific signaling pathways and zzso effects are brought about by zzso zzso in tumor zzso cells, and knowledge of the effects of zzso zzso can lead to development of more effective therapeutic regimens for zzso tumor zzso
