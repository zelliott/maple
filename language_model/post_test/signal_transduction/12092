Upon zzso zzso the zzso zzso a signal culminating in proliferation or in zzso of the B zzso zzso engagement and subsequent modification of the zzso signal zzso are mechanisms that guide the B cell to its appropriate zzso For example, in the absence of zzso engagement, zzso zzso induce zzso in the human zzso B cell zzso cell zzso zzso B cell zzso that potentially may act as negative zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the role of zzso as an zzso zzso in T cells has been established, its role in B cells is poorly zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso are reduced significantly in zzso zzso clones compared with zzso zzso cells and that zzso treatment induced zzso zzso zzso and association with zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso does not induce zzso and has reduced zzso zzso and zzso recruitment to zzso Thus, similar to its function in T cells, zzso may act as an zzso B cell zzso most likely through recruitment of zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of B cells by zzso or zzso zzso also leads to cell zzso that is promoted by zzso also in a zzso zzso
