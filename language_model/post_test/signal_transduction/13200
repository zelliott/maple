zzso and zzso zzso interact with a high degree of zzso the molecular basis of which is only partially zzso In the present study, we analyzed the influence of different zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso were infected with zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso or zzso and various zzso and zzso The ability of different zzso and zzso to correctly zzso was assessed by limited zzso of proteins expressed in zzso and additionally by analysis of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was significantly higher than to zzso when zzso zzso or zzso were zzso Because zzso did not support zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso the 87 zzso zzso acids of zzso assumed to zzso the zzso interface with the zzso were zzso by the corresponding sequence of zzso Whereas this zzso did not promote zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was supported by this zzso zzso and by zzso zzso Our findings argue that the zzso composition contributes directly to the specificity of zzso zzso zzso
