zzso zzso infection is the major cause of common zzso and of asthma zzso Because the zzso cell layer is the primary target of RV infection, we zzso that zzso airway disease is associated with the zzso of airway zzso gene zzso In this study, well differentiated primary human airway zzso cells were infected with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso gene profiles from zzso and zzso control cells were analyzed by zzso zzso and changes of the gene expression were confirmed by real-time zzso zzso At 24 h after infection, 48 genes induced by both viruses were zzso Most of these genes are related to the zzso pathway, and have been documented to have zzso zzso Indeed, a significant stimulation of zzso zzso was detected after zzso zzso zzso zzso specific to zzso and a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso both significantly blocked the induction of zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso a specific inhibitor zzso zzso protein zzso could block both zzso production and zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a part of the zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso gene zzso zzso with its indispensable role in the induction of zzso zzso zzso of this signaling zzso significantly enhanced viral zzso Because increase of viral yield is associated with the severity of zzso airway illness, the discovery of an zzso zzso signaling zzso in this study will contribute to our understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso and asthma zzso
