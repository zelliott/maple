Evidence suggests that an impaired zzso response against zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 has been shown to inhibit the production of zzso zzso 1 zzso This study aimed to ascertain whether zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in human gastric zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso production were determined in total proteins extracted from freshly obtained gastric zzso of zzso zzso and zzso patients by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso production were also determined by Western zzso and zzso respectively, in total protein extracts from gastric biopsy cultures of zzso zzso patients treated without and with zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso expression of zzso and production of zzso was found in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased expression of zzso zzso factors along with production of zzso and zzso By contrast, no changes in the expression of zzso and production of zzso were zzso 

This study provides a mechanism by which zzso zzso may actually interfere with normal zzso zzso in human gastric zzso possibly enhancing its zzso The use of zzso selective zzso as zzso in the course of zzso zzso infection deserves zzso
