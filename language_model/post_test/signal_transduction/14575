Recent reports devoted to the field of oxygen sensing outline that zzso molecules such as zzso zzso oxide derived species as well as zzso and other inflammatory zzso participate in hypoxic signal zzso In the present review, we zzso the current knowledge about the role of zzso oxide and zzso nitrogen species zzso derived from it in hypoxic signal zzso and particularly in zzso of zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso which is critical not only for cellular adaptation to low oxygen availability but also for generation of inflammatory and innate immune zzso After brief description of zzso oxide and other zzso as zzso zzso we zzso and discuss the zzso zzso of zzso protein under zzso followed by discussion of the mechanisms of zzso oxide zzso zzso degradation of zzso protein under low oxygen zzso
