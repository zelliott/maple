The signaling zzso involved in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was further studied in human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was inhibited by a protein zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by these zzso which slightly reversed zzso but completely reversed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso family, were abundantly expressed in zzso cells, and their zzso by zzso or zzso was inhibited by the same zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited induction of zzso promoter activity by zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso or zzso zzso plasmids induced zzso promoter activity, this effect being inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso failed to block induction of zzso promoter activity caused by zzso of zzso zzso In zzso and zzso experiments, zzso was found to be associated with zzso and to be zzso on zzso zzso after zzso or zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso near the zzso loop of zzso were identified as being important for zzso zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso abolished zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso or zzso These data suggest that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso also activates zzso zzso These two pathways zzso at zzso and go on to activate zzso via zzso zzso and degradation of zzso and, finally, to initiate zzso zzso
