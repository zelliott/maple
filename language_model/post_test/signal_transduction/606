zzso that zzso an zzso layer zzso generates zzso electric fields zzso which were detected at human skin wounds over 150 years zzso Recent researches combining zzso genetic and imaging techniques have provided significant insights into cellular and molecular responses to this zzso zzso One unexpected finding is that the zzso play an overriding guidance role in directing cell migration in zzso wound zzso In experimental models where other directional cues zzso contact zzso release, population pressure zzso are present, electric fields of zzso strength override them and direct cell zzso The zzso or zzso is zzso by polarized zzso of multiple signaling pathways that include zzso zzso membrane growth factor receptors and zzso zzso manipulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated the importance of those zzso The electric fields are therefore a fundamental signal that directs cell migration in wound zzso One of the most challenging question is: How do cells sense the very weak electric zzso zzso it is highly desirable to develop practical and reliable technologies for wound healing management exploiting the electric zzso
