zzso belongs to a family of zzso between zzso zzso zzso domain proteins with zzso zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso The zzso zzso codes for 14 zzso genes and two zzso zzso et zzso zzso Under standard growth conditions zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso In addition, zzso is strongly induced in leaves following exposure to ultraviolet zzso radiation at zzso similar to those in areas under a reduced ozone zzso With quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction analyses and zzso zzso we show that the expression of zzso zzso 2-4 h after zzso radiation zzso To test if zzso zzso zzso depends on key players of the zzso signaling pathway, zzso expression was zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso double zzso but not in zzso zzso However, under low zzso rate zzso conditions zzso is not induced in these zzso Our results show that zzso represents a downstream target of the low zzso rate zzso zzso signaling zzso while under high zzso rates its expression is regulated by the two zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso
