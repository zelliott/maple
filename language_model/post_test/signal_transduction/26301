zzso trafficking involves large zzso of cargo and membrane across separate zzso These zzso must be regulated by control systems to maintain zzso While control systems for other key functions such as protein folding or the cell cycle are well known, the mechanisms that control zzso transport are poorly zzso We have previously described a zzso circuit operating at the zzso complex that regulates zzso trafficking and is initiated by the zzso zzso zzso a protein previously known to mediate protein recycling from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso is predicted to fold like a zzso zzso zzso and that it binds and activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, regulates transport through the zzso zzso These findings reveal an unexpected zzso mode of action of the zzso and shed light on a core molecular control mechanism of zzso zzso
