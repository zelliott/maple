The protein zzso zzso and zzso are central components of the checkpoint mechanisms that signal the presence of damaged DNA and stalled replication zzso Recent studies have provided important new insights into how these zzso work together with their regulatory zzso DNA repair proteins and zzso proteins to sense abnormal DNA structures and implement the appropriate DNA damage zzso These advances have provided a more detailed understanding of the interface between damaged DNA and the checkpoint sensor zzso
