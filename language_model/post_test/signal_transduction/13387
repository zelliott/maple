zzso factor is a cellular zzso for plasma zzso factor zzso In health, tissue factor is zzso expressed in many cells, such as zzso and zzso but is absent in vascular cells that come in contact with zzso However, tissue factor is induced in vascular cells in certain zzso zzso Thus, vessel wall injury or a disease condition allows blood to come in contact with tissue factor, resulting in factor zzso binding to tissue zzso Once native factor zzso zzso with tissue factor is converted to the zzso factor zzso the complex triggers the zzso cascade that ultimately leads to zzso zzso In addition to its established role in zzso molecular links between factor zzso factor and various biological zzso such as development, zzso and tumor zzso are also zzso Recent studies suggest that factor zzso factor affects various cellular processes by inducing zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggest that factor zzso factor zzso in cell signaling by two distinct zzso zzso signaling via the zzso domain of tissue factor, and zzso zzso which is independent of tissue zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso 1 is recruited to tissue factor upon its zzso and this probably provides an essential zzso link in zzso signals from tissue zzso In zzso zzso factor zzso factor activates one or more zzso zzso which couple to G zzso to impact multiple signaling zzso In this chapter, we review various zzso functions attributed to factor zzso and tissue factor, describe signaling mechanisms initiated upon factor zzso binding to tissue factor, and discuss how factor zzso zzso signaling could contribute to various zzso zzso The relationship between increased zzso and manifestation of various diseases is well zzso Although zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is primarily the consequence of a disease, zzso of the zzso zzso during the disease process, in turn, could contribute to zzso of the zzso Further, recent transgenic studies in mouse suggest that the zzso system also plays a role in zzso and zzso Then the question zzso how do proteins involved in the zzso regulate cellular zzso The zzso zzso can regulate cell behavior in a number of zzso They can function like hormones, zzso multiple signaling zzso as well as release zzso fragments and growth factors by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This chapter reviews our current understanding of the role of factor zzso factor zzso an zzso complex that triggers the zzso zzso in affecting various cellular functions not related to the zzso and discusses potential mechanisms by which it regulates cellular zzso
