We adopt a control theory approach to reverse engineer the complexity of a known zzso bacterial heat shock zzso Using a zzso dynamic model, we explore the organization of the heat shock system and zzso its various regulation zzso We show that these strategies are behind much of the complexity of the zzso We propose that complexity is a necessary outcome of zzso and performance requirements that are achieved by the heat shock system's exquisite regulation zzso The techniques we use rely on dynamic zzso models and principles from the field of control zzso
