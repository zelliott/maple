A pathological zzso zzso zzso by inflammatory zzso zzso or brain zzso is discussed as a common zzso factor for progressive nerve cell damage in vascular and zzso zzso A critical point seems to be reached, if the zzso zzso zzso causes a secondary zzso of zzso which loose the negative feedback control, are forced to give up their zzso zzso function, and may add to zzso damage by the release of zzso oxide zzso and by promoting toxic zzso zzso A strengthening of the zzso zzso zzso signaling exerted a differential zzso of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso released from cultured rat zzso but maintained the negative feedback signal zzso zzso inhibited also the release of free oxygen zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase by blockade of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the toxic NO action that causes with OR zzso damage by zzso zzso In rat cultured zzso a prolonged zzso zzso favored cell zzso the expression of a mature zzso channel zzso and an improvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling could be strengthened by zzso blockade and by raising zzso zzso which stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso Via an A1 zzso effect, elevated zzso was found to overcome a deficient zzso calcium zzso resulting from an impaired zzso signaling at zzso decreased zzso zzso We suggest that zzso which elevate zzso zzso and/or block the degradation of zzso zzso may be used to counteract zzso zzso damage in zzso zzso
