zzso zzso zzso promotes cell survival and the activity of this zzso is elevated in several zzso including chronic zzso zzso We have shown previously that zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso the zzso activity of this zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso of multiple genes zzso components of the zzso zzso and thereby influences cell zzso Here we show that the zzso effects of zzso on cell proliferation are zzso by zzso and that zzso zzso the binding of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso also decreases the nuclear association of zzso and zzso its zzso by the zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso produces a stable truncated zzso product which we have termed zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso negative regulator of full-length zzso by zzso zzso proteins that function as zzso zzso We show that this novel regulatory mechanism results in the zzso of zzso repression of zzso We suggest that the zzso of zzso function through zzso of zzso could be of value in treatment of zzso zzso as well as other zzso types in which zzso is zzso by zzso
