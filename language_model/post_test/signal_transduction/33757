zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso channels that set the resting membrane potential and function zzso in the physiology of cortisol zzso zzso of these zzso channels by zzso hormone zzso or zzso is coupled to zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was explored in whole cell patch clamp recordings from zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso was not affected by the addition of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso solution at zzso that completely blocked zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso that produced little or no zzso of zzso inhibited zzso by a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that bovine zzso cells robustly express zzso for zzso a zzso zzso exchange protein activated by zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso applied zzso through the patch zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso that did not activate zzso zzso by this agent was unaffected by zzso zzso including zzso but was eliminated in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso markedly reduced the expression of zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso current in zzso cells that had been treated with zzso for zzso d while zzso by zzso was not zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso expressed in zzso cells, which express little or no zzso These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also inhibit these zzso channels by a zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso of zzso through parallel zzso and zzso mechanisms may provide for zzso membrane zzso by zzso
