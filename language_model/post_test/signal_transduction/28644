The zzso differentiation and sorting out of zzso zzso and zzso cells requires the zzso signaling zzso zzso and provides an example of a spatial zzso patterning zzso To further understand this patterning process, we used genetic selection to isolate zzso in the zzso response zzso The disrupted gene in one such zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor, which is required for every zzso response zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso shows zzso similar zzso defects to the zzso zzso which is specifically defective in zzso zzso However, key differences zzso zzso the zzso zzso responds to zzso but does not produce zzso zzso the zzso zzso produces zzso but does not respond to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso exhibits cell autonomous defects in cell type zzso These results suggest that zzso encodes the key zzso regulator required to integrate zzso signaling and subsequent patterning in zzso
