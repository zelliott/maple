Prior to the onset of human zzso there is an increase in the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso in the fetal zzso particular the zzso This is associated with zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso In this study we zzso the level of zzso activity in zzso zzso cells as a measure of zzso zzso in samples collected from women undergoing zzso section at 39 weeks gestation prior to the onset of zzso 

We found that a proportion of women exhibit low or moderate zzso activity while other women exhibit high levels of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso This zzso process does not appear to involve classical pathways of zzso zzso but rather is correlated with an increase in nuclear zzso zzso To identify the full range of genes zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on carefully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) samples and compared to activated samples zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso genes were zzso in response to zzso zzso including numerous inflammatory genes such zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso accessory protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and, unexpectedly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso data reveal the two main gene networks activated zzso with zzso zzso are zzso cell death, cancer and zzso and zzso cell cycle, embryonic development and tissue zzso 

Our results indicate that assessment of zzso zzso zzso is critical for accurate sample zzso and subsequent interpretation of zzso zzso our data suggest zzso zzso is largely an inflammatory event that occurs in the zzso zzso layer as a prelude to the onset of zzso
