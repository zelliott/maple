A contemporary goal of researchers in zzso zzso has been to uncover how cells physically organize and zzso zzso molecules into efficient, regulated zzso zzso This work has revealed important roles of membrane zzso that are characterized by their distinctive protein and zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that besides typical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are equipped with a different type of zzso made up of zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in the organization of zzso zzso by virtue of their capacity to specifically associate with key zzso including zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso The aspects of zzso function influenced by zzso zzso include zzso proliferation and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso complexes link to zzso zzso zzso are still largely zzso This review discusses how zzso zzso might function to regulate zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and how they relate to zzso zzso In addition, we discuss new insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso
