zzso and zzso zzso are rare zzso zzso that can be invasive and zzso to conventional zzso Because these tumors both originate from the zzso they are often grouped together zzso However, whether the underlying biology of these tumors warrants such zzso is zzso and the optimum treatment of either entity is zzso 

All zzso tumors were zzso for zzso in genes zzso components of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso assessed for zzso and zzso expression by zzso and analyzed by zzso comparative zzso zzso Previously zzso tumors were subjected to global gene expression zzso 

We analyzed 45 zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso A, zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and one zzso had a zzso zzso zzso Three tumors displayed strong zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In cell viability zzso the zzso zzso was associated with similar sensitivities to zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso displayed greater sensitivity to zzso zzso profiling revealed distinct differences between type A to B2 zzso versus type B3 and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso comparative zzso zzso could readily distinguish zzso cell zzso of the zzso versus the zzso which can often present a diagnostic zzso 

Comprehensive zzso analysis suggests that zzso zzso are zzso distinct from zzso These data have clinical, zzso and therapeutic implications for the treatment of zzso zzso
