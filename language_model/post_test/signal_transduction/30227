The zzso zzso finger proteins zzso and zzso have been proposed to regulate protein degradation and gene expression in muscle zzso We have tested the in zzso roles of zzso and zzso for muscle metabolism by using knockout zzso mouse zzso Single zzso and zzso zzso mice are healthy and have normal zzso Double knockout zzso mice obtained by the zzso of all four zzso and zzso zzso developed extreme cardiac and milder skeletal muscle zzso Muscle zzso in zzso mice was maintained throughout the zzso life span and was associated with chronically activated muscle protein zzso During zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle mass remained stable, whereas body fat content did not increase in zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso Other zzso factors such as zzso were expressed at normal levels and did not respond to or prevent muscle zzso in zzso zzso Thus, combined zzso of zzso could provide a potent strategy to stimulate zzso muscles zzso and to protect muscles from zzso during zzso
