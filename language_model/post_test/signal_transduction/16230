Gene expression analysis has become a ubiquitous tool for studying a wide range of human zzso In a typical analysis we compare distinct zzso groups and attempt to identify genes that are, on average, significantly different between zzso Here we describe an innovative approach to the analysis of gene expression data, one that identifies differences in expression zzso between groups as an zzso metric of the group zzso We find that genes with different expression zzso profiles are not randomly distributed across cell signaling zzso Genes with zzso zzso or higher zzso are significantly more connected to other network members and tend to function as core members of signal zzso zzso Genes with higher expression zzso have fewer network connections and also tend to sit on the periphery of the zzso Using neural stem cells derived from patients suffering from zzso zzso Parkinson's disease zzso and a healthy control group, we find marked differences in expression zzso in cell signaling pathways that shed new light on potential mechanisms associated with these diverse neurological zzso In particular, we find that expression zzso of core networks in the zzso patient group was considerably zzso while in contrast the zzso patient group demonstrated much greater zzso than zzso One hypothesis is that diminished zzso in zzso patients zzso to an increased degree of constraint in these pathways and a corresponding reduction in zzso of the stem cell zzso These results underscore the role that variation plays in biological systems and suggest that analysis of expression zzso is far more important in disease than previously zzso Furthermore, modeling patterns of zzso in gene expression could fundamentally alter the way in which we think about how cellular networks are affected by disease zzso
