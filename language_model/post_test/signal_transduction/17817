The present review focuses on recent studies that might be considered as the most relevant advances in the zzso zzso protein field, with special emphasis on proven functions in zzso and cardiovascular systems, in zzso as well as pathological zzso Thus, the questions as to whether and how zzso zzso protein intervenes in vascular development and zzso and in vascular diseases such as hypertension, zzso zzso and heart failure have begun to be zzso 

Since its discovery from zzso tumors in 1987, it has become clear that zzso zzso protein is a zzso expressed zzso and plays crucial roles in normal zzso The early zzso to zzso zzso protein knockout mice emphasizes the crucial roles of the protein in development but has limited the use of these zzso However, data accumulated from transgenic animals zzso the protein in particular cells have provided considerable support to its zzso and pathological zzso The recent demonstration that nascent zzso zzso protein not only follows the zzso zzso but also directly zzso to the nucleus, is beginning to uncover new actions for the protein in a number of zzso systems such as bone, zzso zzso and vascular smooth muscle, as well as in pathological situations, such as cancer, zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The development of mice with zzso deleted zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso zzso will allow the creation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein knockout mice which will greatly facilitate the determination of the biological relevance of this protein in a specific cell or tissue type, particularly in the cardiovascular zzso
