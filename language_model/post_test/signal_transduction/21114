Among its known functions, tumor zzso gene zzso serves as a zzso regulator and mediates various signals through zzso of downstream zzso We recently identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression is specifically induced by zzso zzso To characterize the zzso gene further, we determined zzso zzso of DNA sequence that included a consensus binding sequence for zzso and the entire zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of four zzso and the zzso sequence is present in the zzso zzso In zzso organization this gene resembles genes zzso zzso zzso zzso a human zzso of the zzso family called zzso and zzso products of these zzso known as zzso zzso are variously involved in signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso FISH analysis revealed that the zzso gene is located on human zzso zzso Genes zzso at least two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also located in this zzso
