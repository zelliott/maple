Several families of G zzso receptors zzso have been shown to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Because zzso is an important component in the regulation of synaptic zzso in this study we examined zzso zzso by three families of zzso that respond to major zzso zzso in the zzso We used an zzso approach to examine zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso Because these zzso families comprise receptors zzso to each of the major zzso G zzso we examined whether zzso zzso differs according to zzso zzso By using zzso we were able to examine not only whether each family of receptors activates zzso but also the cellular populations and zzso zzso of activated zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso and group I zzso both of which are zzso zzso activate zzso in zzso zzso zzso although zzso in response to zzso is more zzso The zzso group II zzso activate zzso in zzso scattered throughout zzso and zzso zzso receptors activate zzso in scattered zzso Thus, we demonstrated that zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso all activate zzso in the zzso although each does so with unique properties and zzso
