The zzso hormone zzso signals the status of body energy stores by zzso the long form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in the zzso of the associated zzso zzso zzso and the transmission of downstream zzso zzso We have investigated the signaling function of zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso By using this system, we confirm that two zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso become zzso to mediate zzso zzso zzso controls the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso We zzso investigated the mechanisms by which zzso controls downstream zzso zzso and zzso and zzso message zzso zzso recruitment of zzso does not alter zzso zzso of zzso or zzso but results in zzso binding to zzso zzso and is required for the majority of zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso similarly mediate zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso zzso that are zzso during zzso zzso mediate distinct signaling pathways as zzso zzso binding to zzso positively regulates the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and zzso binding to zzso mediates the zzso zzso zzso
