T zzso circulate between the blood, zzso and zzso These T cells carry out immune functions, using the zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso to enter and travel through the zzso zzso zzso roles for each zzso in regulating T zzso trafficking have remained zzso We report that in the human T cell line zzso and in primary zzso T zzso signaling from zzso leads to increased expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso within eight hours of zzso Within zzso h we observed peak levels of zzso differentiation gene 1 zzso which mediates the zzso of T zzso from zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso was preceded by zzso of its zzso factor, zzso factor 2 zzso To determine the cellular effect of zzso zzso signaling from zzso we examined the migration of zzso zzso T cells to zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso T cells showed increased migration to zzso zzso at 48 zzso the migration of zzso T cells remained at a zzso zzso zzso we define a novel signaling zzso that controls zzso zzso following stimulation of T cells by zzso This is the first report to link the two signaling events that control migration through the zzso zzso zzso mediates entry into the zzso zzso and zzso signaling controls their subsequent zzso
