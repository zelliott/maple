zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso is characterized by zzso of mature zzso zzso B zzso The disease results mainly from a failure of cells to undergo zzso a process largely influenced by the existence of zzso activated components of zzso zzso signaling and the zzso expression of zzso zzso Recent evidence pointing to a critical role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso signaling prompted us to examine its role in primary zzso cell zzso We demonstrate that pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso by zzso led to a dramatic decrease of cell viability in zzso samples zzso regardless of clinical and biological status and induced typical zzso cell death with zzso failure followed by zzso zzso cell zzso We also provide functional and zzso evidence that zzso regulated zzso cell survival through a novel zzso involving zzso and a zzso regulation of the zzso protein zzso Together, our observations are consistent with a model wherein zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso of zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso constitutes a key regulator of zzso cell survival, emphasizing the clinical utility of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
