The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso gated channel that releases calcium from zzso stores in response to zzso zzso To identify and understand zzso processes and behavior that depends on the zzso signaling zzso at a systemic level, we are studying zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that growth defects zzso zzso zzso and both are a consequence of the inability to feed zzso Moreover, restoring zzso function in insulin producing cells zzso in the zzso brain zzso the feeding deficit, growth and zzso in the zzso zzso to a significant zzso We have previously demonstrated a critical requirement for zzso activity in zzso cells, specifically in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso domain are closely zzso in the third zzso zzso brain with no visible cellular zzso zzso depletion of zzso by zzso results in feeding deficits leading to zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso is depleted specifically in zzso or zzso zzso the larvae are zzso These data support a model where zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso independently zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso autonomous zzso
