Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso family members direct the differentiation of T helper cells, with specific zzso proteins promoting distinct zzso zzso zzso is required for the development of T helper 2 zzso cells, whereas zzso promotes differentiation of zzso and zzso helper zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso was also activated during zzso cell development and was required for the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound directly to zzso zzso gene zzso and was required for the ability of zzso to bind target zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso eliminated the allergic inflammation in mice zzso and challenged with zzso or transgenic for zzso active zzso Thus, zzso zzso with zzso in promoting zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso T helper zzso multiple zzso protein signals during zzso zzso
