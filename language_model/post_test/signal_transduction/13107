Members of the protein zzso C zzso zzso family are important signal zzso in virtually every zzso cell zzso Within the heart, zzso zzso are thought to participate in a signaling network that programs zzso and pathological zzso zzso zzso To investigate the function of zzso signaling in regulating zzso growth, zzso gene transfer of zzso and dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso beta II, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in cultured zzso rat zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta II, zzso and zzso revealed distinct zzso zzso upon zzso suggesting unique functions of each zzso in zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso I, zzso zzso or zzso induced zzso growth of zzso characterized by increased cell surface area, increased zzso zzso and increased expression of the zzso marker gene zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of dominant negative zzso zzso beta II, zzso and zzso revealed a necessary role for zzso alpha as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas dominant negative zzso zzso reduced cellular zzso A mechanism zzso zzso alpha might regulate zzso was suggested by the observations that zzso zzso alpha induced zzso zzso zzso zzso that dominant negative zzso alpha inhibited zzso zzso zzso and that dominant negative zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso zzso alpha as a necessary zzso of zzso zzso growth, in part, through a zzso signaling zzso
