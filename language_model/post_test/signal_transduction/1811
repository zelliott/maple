zzso zzso is a key zzso of pulmonary zzso during zzso zzso transition, at a time when fetal plasma zzso levels are zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso rapidly stimulates zzso oxide production by zzso fetal pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso and that this occurs through zzso mechanisms which are zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In the present study, we determined if zzso acutely activates zzso production in zzso zzso zzso M for 15 zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso the threshold concentration was zzso M zzso the effect occurred within 5 zzso and it was not related to changes in zzso type 1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta proteins and zzso were found to be zzso expressed in zzso and zzso stimulation with zzso was fully blocked by both zzso antagonism with zzso zzso which is not selective for either zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The rapid response to zzso was also inhibited by calcium zzso whereas zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, had no zzso Thus, zzso causes rapid stimulation of zzso synthesis in fetal zzso this process is zzso by zzso zzso and it is zzso and zzso zzso zzso These mechanisms may play a role in pulmonary zzso in the zzso zzso
