The zzso basis for the functional zzso of human blood zzso was investigated in terms of protein zzso zzso calcium zzso the ratio of 46 and 50 zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso were zzso by zzso Comparing resting zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso revealed higher zzso of proteins in the 47, 31, and 24 zzso zzso A higher zzso of the 20 zzso protein in zzso compared to zzso was related to an enhanced zzso an increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a decreased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The differences in the zzso patterns of the zzso were not influenced by zzso stimulation or exposure to zzso E1 zzso An 18 zzso zzso was more highly zzso in resting zzso than in zzso zzso exposure caused zzso of the 18 zzso zzso in the zzso but generally increased zzso of both zzso and zzso in the 47, 31, 24, and 20 zzso zzso zzso with zzso E1 or sodium zzso diminished the subsequent zzso increase in zzso particularly in zzso In zzso zzso the 50 zzso zzso zzso form was zzso whereas in zzso zzso the 46 zzso zzso zzso form was zzso Our findings suggest that the functional zzso of zzso is partly derived from differences in signal zzso mechanisms reflected in varying zzso patterns and zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
