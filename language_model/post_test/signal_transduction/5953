zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso has been shown to promote long-term zzso zzso and stabilization of zzso during early zzso Here, we searched for the mechanisms of zzso activity of zzso focusing on the role of zzso acid zzso an unusual zzso zzso associated with zzso We show that zzso removal of zzso with zzso zzso abolished preferential formation of zzso on zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with either of three major zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but identical in zzso zzso and carrying zzso zzso preferential zzso formation on zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of zzso zzso from cultured zzso and a zzso in the zzso domain of zzso diminished zzso activity of zzso expressed zzso suggesting that interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso mediates this zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by zzso to zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso of zzso receptors but not by zzso of zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of zzso and zzso zzso also blocked the increase in the number of zzso spine zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
