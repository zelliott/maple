The snake zzso zzso has been reported to bind to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso but it is also able to induce zzso independent of the 2 receptors and of zzso Using zzso affinity zzso we have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso that zzso signaling responses to zzso when expressed in a cell zzso zzso has a single zzso zzso in a zzso motif in its zzso tail, which zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso by zzso or an zzso to zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and other signaling proteins by zzso is inhibited by the zzso family zzso inhibitor zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is abolished in the absence of zzso and zzso and partially reduced in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso These findings define a novel signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to zzso zzso of its zzso tail, binding of zzso and initiation of downstream zzso zzso events, and zzso of zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso to be found on zzso which signals through this novel zzso
