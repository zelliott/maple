This paper compares zzso processing in synthetic and biological zzso The role of zzso zzso mechanisms and zzso interactions in molecular recognition is zzso In biological electron transfer, the zzso zzso mechanism is contrasted with the mechanism based on zzso zzso zzso While biological information processing is thought to be more distributed (less zzso an example of molecular switch is zzso visual zzso We further speculate that visual zzso may be implemented in the form of a switch based on zzso zzso The concept of intelligent materials is discussed with the well-known zzso effect of zzso zzso Based on these examples, we argue that there are no fundamental differences between synthetic and biological molecules in their mode of information zzso In the pursuit of novel zzso of molecular information processing, we also perceive no conflicts in developing molecular devices that emulate the switching function of conventional zzso zzso
