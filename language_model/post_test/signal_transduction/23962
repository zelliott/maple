The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the progression of human gastric zzso The zzso factor vascular zzso growth factor zzso has been shown to be induced by zzso in various cancer cell zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso for zzso and increases its affinity for zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso has been found to be expressed by zzso cells and has been shown to enhance zzso zzso and growth in zzso zzso We examined the expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein in seven human gastric cancer cell zzso zzso expression was expressed in five of seven cell lines, and zzso expression closely mirrored zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells in a zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in increases in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso pathways in this cell line prevented zzso induction of zzso and zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso expression in human gastric cancer is intimately associated with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso might contribute to gastric cancer zzso by a mechanism that involves zzso of zzso and zzso expression via multiple zzso zzso
