zzso migration zzso factor zzso has a key role in regulation of innate and zzso immunity and is implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso leads to protection against fatal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso effects in other experimental models of inflammatory zzso We report a novel regulatory role of zzso in type 1 zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso Compared with zzso cells, zzso cells were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso activity, zzso activity, and cellular zzso while zzso function was zzso zzso of zzso cells was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was restored by zzso of either an upstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso regulatory zzso defines an important amplifying role of zzso zzso in zzso immune and inflammatory diseases and provides further molecular evidence for the critical role of zzso in cellular zzso
