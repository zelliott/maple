Plant zzso zzso zzso factors are key regulators in certain zzso zzso A number of studies have suggested that zzso genes may mediate seed zzso and zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso genes mediate zzso seed zzso and zzso growth zzso 

To determine directly the role of zzso zzso zzso factor during zzso seed zzso and zzso growth arrest, we isolated zzso zzso zzso Two independent zzso zzso zzso for zzso were hypersensitive to zzso responses only during seed zzso and zzso early zzso zzso zzso displayed delayed or decreased expression of zzso and zzso but increased or prolonged expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and wild type showed similar levels of expression for zzso and its target genes zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso expression level in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso further indicated that zzso zzso zzso during zzso and zzso early growth requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso hypersensitivity of the zzso zzso during seed zzso and zzso early zzso establishment is attributable to elevated zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso responses are independent of zzso and its target genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important regulators of the transcripts of zzso by zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso factor mediates seed zzso and zzso zzso arrest by zzso
