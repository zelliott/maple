Cellular responses often involve a transition of cells from one state to zzso A transition from a stem cell to a differentiated cell state, for example, might occur in response to gene expression changes induced by a zzso factor, or to signaling zzso triggered by a hormone or zzso Regulatory networks are thought to control such cellular zzso Thus, many researchers are interested in reconstructing regulatory networks, not only with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of cellular zzso but also of using networks to predict and potentially manipulate cellular transitions and zzso In this review, we highlight approaches to the reconstruction of regulatory networks underlying cellular zzso with special attention to zzso regulatory zzso We describe recent regulatory network reconstructions in a variety of organisms, and discuss the success they share in identifying new regulatory zzso shared relationships and zzso zzso
