The aim of the present report was to investigate the zzso selectivity of the human orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso recently identified as a novel zzso zzso zzso as compared with that of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso BK was able to inhibit the zzso production induced by zzso with a potency zzso lower at the zzso zzso zzso zzso than that measured at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both effects were inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did inhibit the zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso at the zzso whereas it was not able to exert any effect at the zzso The human zzso zzso zzso 3 did inhibit the zzso production at the zzso zzso zzso zzso at a greater extent than zzso and was devoid of any effect at the zzso zzso and zzso 3 responses at the zzso and zzso respectively, were not inhibited by zzso (1 zzso These data indicate zzso and zzso 3 as selective zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, and support the concept that different zzso may specifically bias the zzso states of a zzso to result in a final common G protein zzso which is zzso recognized by zzso
