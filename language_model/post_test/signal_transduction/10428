zzso zzso has been widely used in many biological applications including gene regulation and DNA repair, but, so far, little attention has been paid to cellular responses induced by the zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso DNA introduced into zzso cells induced expression of a variety of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and DNA zzso The expression profile of the induced genes was highly dependent on the cell type, suggesting interactions between zzso zzso and cellular zzso Moreover, each cell line zzso a markedly different level of intrinsic cellular responses to the introduced zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso zzso or short duplexes consisting of two complementary zzso did not affect cellular response, indicating that the induction was highly dependent on the structure and length of zzso zzso The extent of induction of DNA damage, signaling and DNA repair activities correlated to zzso and zzso gene correction zzso In addition, the presented data indicate that the presence of zzso zzso triggered a DNA damage response by zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
