Previous studies have shown that large doses of zzso zzso cause liver injury in rats and the zzso of this injury zzso in part, release of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate if zzso was able to stimulate other potentially toxic zzso such as zzso oxide zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso using isolated rat zzso zzso zzso alone did not stimulate the release of NO and zzso by zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the production of both NO and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso we further studied how zzso modulated the response of zzso cells to zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso increased the amount of zzso NO zzso and zzso protein in zzso cells after their exposure to zzso The enhanced effects of zzso on the release of NO and zzso from zzso cells was inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso factor zzso zzso By using a specific zzso for zzso it was found that zzso enhanced the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso stress following either zzso alone or zzso + zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on both NO and zzso release was inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso but not zzso (an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso enhances the production of NO and zzso by zzso zzso cells and suggest that protein zzso C plays a critical role in zzso these effects of zzso
