zzso zzso protein 1 zzso factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso response elements zzso zzso represents one of the most important cellular defense mechanisms against zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso the zzso regulation of zzso expression of various detoxifying and zzso defense zzso and zzso zzso signaling has become an attractive target for the prevention and treatment of zzso stress-related diseases and conditions including cancer, zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso Over the last few decades, numerous zzso zzso have been developed and some of them are currently undergoing clinical zzso Recently, zzso of zzso has been implicated in cancer progression as well as in drug resistance to cancer zzso Thus, zzso zzso could potentially be used to improve the effectiveness of cancer zzso zzso we review the signaling mechanism of zzso pathway, its disease zzso and currently known classes of small zzso zzso We also discuss several aspects of zzso interaction, zzso zzso inhibitor design, and the screening zzso currently used for the discovery of direct zzso of zzso zzso
