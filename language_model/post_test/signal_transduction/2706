zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso basic zzso zzso factors that share the ability to activate the expression of skeletal muscle genes such as those zzso zzso zzso heavy chain, and the zzso zzso zzso The muscle regulatory factors zzso also exhibit the unique capacity to initiate the zzso program when zzso expressed in a variety of zzso cell types, most notably zzso zzso zzso zzso The commitment of zzso to terminal zzso although positively regulated by the zzso also is controlled zzso by a variety of agents, including several growth factors and zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1), and Ras zzso The molecular mechanisms by which these varied agents alter zzso terminal differentiation events remain zzso In an effort to establish whether Ras zzso zzso zzso activity by directly targeting the zzso zzso we examined the DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso when expressed in zzso cells or in zzso cells expressing Ras zzso Our results demonstrate that Ras zzso zzso terminal differentiation events by targeting the basic domain of the zzso and yet the mechanism underlying this zzso does not involve altering the DNA binding or the inherent zzso activity of these regulatory zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso 1 block terminal differentiation by zzso the zzso activity of the zzso We conclude that the Ras zzso block in differentiation operates via an zzso signaling zzso that is distinct from the zzso and zzso 1 zzso
