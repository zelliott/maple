zzso stationary night zzso zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso group of retinal disorders characterized by zzso impaired night vision and variable decreased visual zzso We report here that six out of eight female zzso with zzso complete zzso zzso had zzso in zzso a retinal transient zzso potential zzso zzso channel zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso are a major cause of zzso zzso in individuals of European zzso We localized zzso in human zzso to the ON bipolar cell zzso in the outer zzso zzso Our results suggest that in humans, zzso is the channel gated by the zzso zzso signaling zzso which results in the zzso response of ON bipolar zzso Finally, we showed that detailed zzso is an effective way to discriminate among patients with zzso in either zzso or zzso another zzso zzso disease zzso These results add to the growing importance of the diverse group of zzso channels in human disease and also provide new insights into retinal zzso
