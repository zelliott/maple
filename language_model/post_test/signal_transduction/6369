The mechanism by which zzso zzso exerts its zzso is likely to be zzso A 58 zzso zzso was zzso and characterized from the zzso product zzso of the zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the present study an attempt has been made to zzso the mechanism of action of the zzso a potentially important zzso A 41 zzso zzso was identified in the mouse zzso membrane fraction with which the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso activity was reduced in zzso zzso with the zzso resulting in an increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of protein zzso A zzso in the zzso was also zzso after zzso zzso Ultimately, a significant increase in zzso zzso concentration and decrease in zzso zzso level were noticed in zzso mouse zzso Thus it is possible that the zzso zzso could bind to the 41 zzso zzso zzso on the zzso and activate the zzso signal zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso
