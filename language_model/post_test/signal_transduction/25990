More than 400 genes have been noted to zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies testing the role of proposed zzso zzso proteins unexpectedly revealed a potent role for the zzso signaling zzso in promoting healthy aging and longevity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased mean and maximum zzso maintained zzso zzso extended zzso function, and low zzso and advanced zzso end product zzso zzso reducing the activity of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso evidence of zzso The zzso zzso appears to work in a manner largely independent of the zzso pathway, in that effects are additive with reduction of zzso activity and are not affected by zzso zzso factor zzso Two novel regulators of zzso zzso called zzso and zzso (for the high performance in advanced age zzso zzso that their disruption zzso zzso regulate zzso action, possibly by binding and zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas zzso appears to control aging of the animal overall, zzso exerts an effect primarily on zzso zzso As such, zzso is an example of a protein with an effect on zzso but not zzso a gene class that may have been missed in screens focused on longevity zzso To date, roles for zzso signaling in adult maintenance zzso in zzso zzso have not been addressed in other zzso zzso signaling exert a zzso impact on healthy aging, testing this hypothesis could hold implications for zzso zzso
