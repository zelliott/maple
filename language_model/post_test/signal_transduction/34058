It is unclear how zzso zzso resistance and sensitivity zzso by the zzso zzso zzso contributes to the progression of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the roles of zzso zzso in zzso using an animal zzso We fed zzso mice a zzso and zzso zzso diet for up to 8 weeks and analyzed changes in liver pathology caused by either an zzso short hairpin zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression aggravated the pathological state of NASH at all zzso fatty changes, zzso and zzso In contrast, enhancement of zzso expression in the liver improved NASH at every stage, from the early stage to the progression of zzso zzso of zzso signaling in the liver diminished zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had the opposite zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso in liver increases zzso production of transforming growth factor zzso at all stages of zzso zzso signaling ameliorated zzso zzso zzso in primary cultured zzso by enhancing zzso activity and zzso zzso 

The zzso resistance and sensitivity zzso by zzso in zzso regulated zzso progression by changing zzso activity and zzso zzso a process in which zzso signaling is zzso Thus, the liver zzso signaling zzso could be a promising target in treating zzso
