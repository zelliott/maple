zzso zzso zzso is a zzso metal for normal plants and is toxic to plants at high zzso However, signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of its action on cell function and gene expression remain zzso In this study, we found that zzso induced zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation and zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso We investigated global zzso changes in rice roots by zzso zzso Gene expression profiling indicated zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling and zzso of zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso rice zzso Genes zzso signaling components such as the protein zzso domain of unknown function 26, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 and protein zzso zzso as well as zzso factors zzso and zzso response factor were zzso during zzso zzso Genes involved in zzso trafficking were subjected to functional zzso zzso rice roots with a zzso trafficking zzso zzso A, effectively reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso trafficking zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso strategies revealed that zzso trafficking is required for mediation of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms in signaling pathways and zzso regulation in response to zzso stress in zzso
