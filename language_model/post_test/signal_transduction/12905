The effect of zzso growth factor zzso on mature zzso the cells responsible for zzso skeletal development, is growth zzso rather than zzso This singular response has been linked to signaling via zzso zzso 3 zzso partly because zzso causing chronic zzso zzso lead to various human disorders of bone zzso In order to study how zzso zzso growth, we analyzed its effect on a rat zzso cell zzso We show that the zzso growth arrest occurs at the zzso phase, accompanied by profound changes in gene expression and zzso zzso Within minutes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the focal zzso zzso where it zzso with zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso is selectively removed from the focal zzso which is followed by their zzso and disruption of the organized zzso Multiple genes are induced following zzso stimulation in zzso which has been shown by DNA array screening and confirmed for some by zzso These genes include regulators of cell differentiation and proliferation such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso The zzso factor zzso is zzso consistent with the zzso exit from the zzso zzso Moreover, following zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein decline, as does downstream signaling through the zzso zzso The importance of this zzso zzso control is illustrated in transgenic mice expressing zzso zzso zzso where zzso high levels of zzso are expressed throughout their bone zzso A working model is presented of the signaling network involved in regulating zzso zzso differentiation and zzso zzso
