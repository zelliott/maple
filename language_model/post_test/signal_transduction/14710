Data obtained from animal models, and partially confirmed in zzso studies, have provided clear evidence of the importance of zzso for the growth of solid zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso the role of zzso has been under intense zzso However, the molecular zzso of zzso namely its cellular origin, have suggested a putative role for zzso in these tumors may have distinct zzso We and others have shown acute leukemia cells use zzso growth factor signaling zzso namely those activated by vascular zzso growth factor zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso of zzso results in cell zzso increased survival and zzso This review discusses recent advances in the field of leukemia zzso focusing on the role of zzso and its zzso acting in a zzso or zzso zzso We also briefly describe some of the novel zzso compounds, namely zzso blockers, and suggest their use to treat zzso of zzso zzso may have clinical zzso
