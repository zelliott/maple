zzso bone zzso is a source of significant morbidity in diseases affecting the skeleton such as zzso arthritis, zzso and cancer zzso to zzso Evidence indicates that elevated levels of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso play a role in this process by promoting the formation of zzso zzso Additionally, current studies have identified inflammatory zzso of the zzso inflammatory protein zzso family as potential zzso of pathological bone zzso where both zzso and zzso have been shown to enhance zzso zzso zzso In this study we provide evidence that zzso whose expression is associated with zzso cell zzso bone zzso and zzso arthritis, enhances zzso formation in zzso via a direct effect on zzso zzso zzso with this ability, exposure of zzso precursors to zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso two signaling pathways known to regulate zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced expression and nuclear zzso of zzso a master regulator of zzso which was dependent on zzso of both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Lastly, consistent with in zzso studies, in zzso administration of zzso significantly increased zzso number and zzso area as determined using a zzso zzso bone zzso zzso Taken together, these data highlight the potential of zzso as a zzso of pathological bone zzso and provide insight into the molecular mechanism through which zzso enhances zzso
