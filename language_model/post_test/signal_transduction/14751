zzso the overwhelming amount of data generated in zzso zzso experiments into biologically meaningful evidence, which may for example point to a series of zzso or hint at a relevant pathway, is a matter of great interest in zzso these zzso Genes showing similar experimental profiles, it is hypothesized, share biological mechanisms that if understood could provide clues to the molecular processes leading to pathological zzso It is the topic of further study to learn if or how a zzso information about the known genes may serve to explain zzso One popular method of knowledge discovery in zzso zzso experiments, enrichment analysis zzso seeks to zzso if an interesting collection of genes is zzso for a zzso particular set of a zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso For the purposes of statistical testing, the conventional methods offered in zzso software implicitly assume independence between the GO zzso Genes may be zzso for more than one biological zzso and therefore the resulting test statistics of enrichment between GO classes can be highly dependent if the overlapping gene sets are relatively zzso There is a need to formally determine if conventional zzso results are robust to the independence zzso We derive the exact zzso distribution for testing enrichment of GO classes by relaxing the independence assumption using well-known statistical zzso In applications with publicly available data sets, our test results are similar to the conventional approach which assumes zzso We argue that the independence assumption is not zzso
