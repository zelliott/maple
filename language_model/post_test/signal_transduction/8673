zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a functionally zzso group of neural cell zzso molecules that are implicated in many aspects of nervous system zzso In many zzso cells the adhesive function of zzso zzso zzso cellular signaling processes that involves the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and among other functions regulates zzso growth and zzso zzso in the human zzso gene are responsible for a complex zzso condition, generally referred to as zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso have been identified in humans that cause zzso syndrome in affected individuals without affecting the level of zzso zzso cell zzso when tested in zzso In this study, an analysis of two different zzso human zzso molecules indicates that although both induce normal zzso cell zzso they are defective in stimulating human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and are unable to rescue zzso zzso conditions in a zzso transgenic model in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso might involve the disruption of zzso functions at different zzso Either by reducing or abolishing zzso protein zzso by interfering with zzso cell surface zzso by reducing zzso adhesive ability or by zzso further downstream zzso signaling zzso
