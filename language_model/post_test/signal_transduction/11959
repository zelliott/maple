zzso are well-known regulators and zzso of G zzso zzso zzso and accumulating evidence reveals that they are functionally involved in inflammation and zzso zzso Of the two zzso zzso 1 is documented to play regulatory roles in an animal model of multiple sclerosis zzso whereas the role of zzso 2 is less zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso mice displayed the exacerbated and sustained symptoms of experimental zzso zzso zzso an animal model of zzso At the cellular level, zzso of zzso 2 led to a decreased number of zzso zzso regulatory T zzso cells in peripheral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso our in zzso observations also revealed that loss of zzso 2 impaired the conversion of zzso zzso T cells into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso 2 plays a regulatory role in zzso that is opposite to that of zzso 1, in zzso diseases such as zzso which is at least partially through regulation of zzso cell zzso
