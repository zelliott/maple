In comparing the pathological state of cardiac zzso with early embryonic growth and development of the primitive heart, important and zzso aspects of mechanisms that zzso zzso of the gene expression pattern become zzso Interestingly, in both cases the muscle zzso share the expression of a zzso gene expression program, raising the question whether the same genetic mechanism is being called upon by signals associated with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso A cell specific zzso factor, zzso was recently identified in our laboratory that is likely to play a crucial role, in conjunction with other known regulatory factors, in early cardiac events leading to zzso cell zzso and zzso We have also identified a novel mechanism that involves zzso of the zzso signaling zzso that is linked to the zzso zzso loop associated with the zzso response in zzso Since early cardiac cell development and the zzso state involve the expression of the same battery of zzso one may speculate that common zzso factors may account for assembling a competent apparatus responsible for zzso the zzso Our present studies are designed to investigate the potential role of these factors in control of both zzso
