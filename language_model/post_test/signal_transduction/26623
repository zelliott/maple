zzso vitamin D3 zzso acts on cells through traditional steroid hormone zzso gene zzso and by initiating rapid zzso signaling zzso Two receptors have been implicated in rapid signaling by zzso the classical nuclear vitamin D zzso zzso and the more recently identified protein zzso zzso family A, member 3 zzso Our lab along with other groups has established various tools to investigate the role of these two zzso including gene zzso conditional zzso zzso and zzso in various model systems zzso plate zzso zzso cells, chick zzso zzso cells, mouse zzso bodies, zzso zzso zzso and isolated cell zzso The data demonstrate the requirement for zzso in zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso mice also exhibit both cartilage and bone zzso zzso is present on the plasma membrane and one zzso mouse strain lacks zzso although zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso are not affected in another zzso mouse zzso In the context of zzso zzso both receptors are expressed during zzso commitment of zzso bodies and zzso of each causes a more mature zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso exists in zzso where it interacts with zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso to initiate rapid signaling via zzso zzso C zzso zzso and ultimately the zzso family of zzso activated protein zzso zzso Using the growth plate zzso and zzso zzso models, we have demonstrated that zzso signaling in response to zzso regulates growth plate zzso
