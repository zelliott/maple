zzso respond to zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso the unfolded protein response zzso signaling zzso The zzso restores zzso zzso by degrading zzso zzso zzso translation, and increasing expression of zzso that enhance zzso protein folding zzso Although zzso stress and protein zzso have been implicated in aging, the role of zzso signaling in regulating lifespan remains zzso Here we show that deletion of several zzso target genes significantly increases zzso lifespan in zzso This extended lifespan depends on a functional zzso stress sensor zzso zzso and is associated with zzso zzso of upstream zzso zzso We applied zzso profiling coupled with next generation sequencing to zzso examine zzso changes associated with increased zzso activity and identified a set of stress response factors zzso in the zzso zzso Besides known zzso targets, we uncovered zzso of components of the cell wall and genes involved in cell wall zzso that zzso resistance to multiple zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso is an important zzso of lifespan that zzso zzso stress and identify a signaling network that couples stress resistance to zzso
