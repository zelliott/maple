Although the role of the zzso zzso in the development of cardiac zzso has been zzso zzso little is known of its role in vascular inflammatory diseases such as zzso and zzso after zzso To help zzso the role of zzso in vascular zzso we infected cultured vascular smooth muscle cells zzso with an zzso construct expressing a zzso active zzso of zzso and examined its effect on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also examined the role of zzso in zzso using a zzso wire injury model of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso both at the zzso and protein zzso zzso II zzso zzso also significantly zzso zzso zzso and this increase was significantly inhibited by zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso stabilized zzso zzso without enhancing zzso promoter zzso In accordance with the results, zzso zzso increase of zzso promoter activity was not suppressed by zzso zzso II stabilized zzso zzso and this effect of zzso II was diminished by zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression in the zzso artery after the zzso mechanical zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso and zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso mediates vascular inflammation via stimulation of zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso
