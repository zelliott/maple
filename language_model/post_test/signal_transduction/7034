zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with poor clinical outcome and resistance to chemotherapy in a wide variety of human zzso So far, their expression and zzso significance in zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of our study was to investigate their expression in zzso and to correlate this to clinical, pathological and molecular zzso zzso and zzso expression was first evaluated by zzso analysis in a series of 60 zzso and five zzso liver tissue zzso Our findings related to zzso were further validated by zzso in a series of 81 zzso and 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed no difference in zzso expression between zzso and zzso liver zzso In contrast, zzso was strongly zzso in a subset of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso we confirmed that high zzso expression is associated with nuclear zzso for zzso and strong homogeneous zzso for zzso zzso two classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this finding, in zzso liver zzso zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is known to be zzso zzso We also observed higher zzso expression in zzso zzso when compared with other zzso No correlation between zzso expression and patient survival or zzso recurrence was zzso conclusion, zzso is a marker of zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso liver zzso Further studies may help to zzso the potential role of zzso in zzso development and resistance to zzso
