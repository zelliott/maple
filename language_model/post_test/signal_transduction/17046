zzso zzso zzso and their host cells constitute complex, zzso cellular interaction systems that frequently cause zzso Among them, zzso zzso cause a significant health burden in humans, killing up to one million people zzso To succeed in the zzso host after transmission by zzso zzso zzso must complete zzso replication within zzso and then release new infectious forms into the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso malaria zzso we show that some liver stage zzso zzso undergo zzso without external zzso but the majority of infected cells do not, and can also resist zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is dramatically increased in zzso infected with attenuated zzso Furthermore, we find that blocking total or zzso host cell zzso increases zzso zzso burden in mice, suggesting that an zzso host environment fosters zzso zzso zzso although zzso infection zzso strong resistance to zzso host zzso zzso infected zzso lose their ability to resist zzso when zzso zzso proteins are zzso This is demonstrated by our finding that zzso zzso 2 family zzso zzso induce zzso in zzso zzso and significantly reduce zzso zzso burden in zzso Thus, targeting critical points of zzso in the zzso host cell might provide new avenues for malaria zzso
