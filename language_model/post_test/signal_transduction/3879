Nerve zzso present in the zzso cortical bone and bone zzso are proposed to be involved in the regulation of bone metabolism by the release of zzso acting locally on bone zzso The present study describes the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso shown to be present in the vicinity of bone, and the two related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on bone zzso in zzso induced by zzso isolated from zzso zzso Bone zzso was measured as the number and total area of pits formed by zzso acid zzso zzso cells zzso + zzso cultured for 3 days on zzso slices of bovine cortical zzso All three zzso had significant zzso effects on both the number and area of pits zzso At a high concentration zzso zzso the mean zzso zzso reductions in the total area zzso compared with controls were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding values for the apparent zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso + zzso was unaffected by application of zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso binding sites on some zzso cells, whereas zzso had no binding sites for zzso A high number of zzso binding sites was demonstrated on zzso in the same zzso The signal zzso zzso remains to be fully zzso but seems to be partly dependent on changes in zzso calcium zzso since a number of zzso cells responded to application of zzso M zzso or zzso and at least partly independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso two selective zzso zzso failed to block the zzso zzso of bone zzso Our results demonstrate a zzso and probably zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso on isolated rabbit zzso resulting in a potent zzso of bone zzso in zzso The signal zzso zzso for zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso may be zzso partly by changes in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
