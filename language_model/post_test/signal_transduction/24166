zzso zzso plays a critical role in the normal development of the zzso brain and is thought to contribute to the zzso of several zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso of zzso remain incompletely zzso In the present study, we characterized a zzso mechanism by which zzso activity deprivation zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not growth factor withdrawal, was found to induce zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the developing rat zzso We found that activity deprivation zzso zzso zzso in zzso via an zzso element zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso that is expressed in zzso zzso was found in DNA binding zzso to bind to the zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso forms a complex with the promoter of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is poised to activate zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso with this conclusion, a dominant interfering form of zzso when expressed in zzso zzso blocked activity zzso zzso zzso In other experiments, we found that the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and promotes zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to inducing the zzso expression and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso activity deprivation fails to stimulate the expression of zzso genes that trigger DNA synthesis and zzso Together, our findings define a novel zzso mechanism zzso zzso selectively couples an activity zzso signal to zzso zzso in the absence of stimulating DNA synthesis and thus culminating in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
