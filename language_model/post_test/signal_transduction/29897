The zzso immune system discriminates between different classes of infectious microbes and responds with zzso defense reactions via the selective zzso of the Toll and the immune zzso zzso signaling zzso The Toll zzso mediates most defenses against zzso bacteria and zzso whereas the zzso zzso is required to resist zzso bacterial zzso zzso recognition is achieved through zzso recognition proteins zzso zzso bacteria activate the Toll zzso through a circulating zzso zzso and zzso bacteria activate the zzso zzso via zzso a putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding proteins zzso were originally identified in zzso zzso for their capacity to bind various microbial zzso Three zzso and two related proteins are zzso in the zzso zzso but their function is not zzso Using zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso we now demonstrate that zzso is required for Toll zzso in response to zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso expression renders flies susceptible to zzso bacterial infection and reduces the induction of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso after infection by zzso bacteria but not after zzso zzso This zzso induced by zzso zzso is identical to a zzso zzso in zzso and our genetic studies suggest that zzso acts upstream of the Toll zzso zzso Altogether, our results demonstrate that the detection of zzso bacteria in zzso requires two putative pattern recognition zzso zzso and zzso
