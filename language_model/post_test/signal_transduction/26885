The discovery of a specific zzso zzso zzso suggests a biological function of zzso that is independent of zzso I zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso on smooth muscle cell zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in human zzso arteries and in cultured human zzso zzso zzso induced zzso migration in a zzso manner, as assessed by zzso chamber zzso zzso and increased zzso random zzso as determined by video zzso The zzso decoy zzso inhibited zzso migration in response to zzso and zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso completely inhibited the migratory response to zzso demonstrating that the zzso action of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso induced zzso reorganization and zzso formation and increased the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso through zzso These effects were required for zzso migration, because the suppression by small interfering zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso forms completely blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced the formation of larger focal zzso and zzso of the focal zzso zzso zzso into two main fragments with molecular weights of 50 and 90 zzso The generation of these two fragments of zzso was reduced by the zzso inhibitor zzso which also inhibited zzso migration in response to zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso is a zzso factor for human zzso zzso expressing zzso This effect is zzso through reorganization of the zzso and focal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
