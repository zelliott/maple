The concept that zzso of cellular pathways of programmed cell death zzso may lead to the death of zzso has been an important hypothesis for adult neurodegenerative zzso For Parkinson's disease zzso up until now, the evidence for this hypothesis has largely been of two zzso clear evidence of a role for zzso in zzso models of the disease, and somewhat controversial evidence from human zzso zzso With the rapid pace of discoveries in recent years of the genetic basis of zzso a new form of evidence has zzso The prevailing concept of the role for zzso in zzso has been that its zzso are zzso zzso of more zzso and specific causes related to genetic or environmental zzso However, recent studies of three genes which cause zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that they may have more intimate relationships with the zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso may result in an increased propensity for zzso to zzso zzso independent studies of the function of these genes have suggested that they may share roles in regulating survival signaling zzso such as those zzso by the survival signaling zzso zzso Further zzso of these relationships will have implications for the zzso and zzso treatment of zzso
