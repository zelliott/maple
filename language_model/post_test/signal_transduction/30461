The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso controls zzso near zzso zzso and behavioral rhythms in zzso neuroendocrine function, and locomotor zzso Recently, we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are critical to the zzso communication between individual zzso zzso and appropriate synchronization and phasing of these zzso zzso Mice defective in zzso signaling manifest zzso impaired zzso rhythms of zzso zzso firing activity and are typically unable to maintain rhythmic zzso behavior in the absence of external time zzso Here we report that daily rhythms of metabolism and feeding behavior are also overtly altered in these zzso Under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso and feeding rhythms are advanced in mice lacking either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the late day, rather than early night, as observed in zzso zzso When placed in constant light zzso both zzso and zzso zzso mice exhibit zzso of zzso and feeding zzso which deteriorate after a few zzso In addition, overall zzso rate is greatly reduced in zzso mice, when compared with zzso mice, regardless of lighting zzso The advancement of zzso and feeding rhythms in these mice under zzso suggests that these rhythms are less sensitive to masking by zzso These results demonstrate that altering zzso function not only affects zzso and zzso activity rhythms but also dramatically zzso zzso regulation of metabolism and zzso
