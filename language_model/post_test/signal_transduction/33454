We have been investigating the relationships between genes and behaviors by conducting a systematic and zzso behavioral test battery with mice that have a zzso on a gene of zzso The behavioral test battery covers a relatively broad range of various behavioral zzso such as learning and memory, zzso functions, emotion, zzso and drug zzso Recently, we subjected mice lacking zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso to the comprehensive behavioral test zzso The zzso mice had a severe working memory deficit, increased locomotor activity, decreased social interaction, and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The abnormalities of zzso zzso mice were zzso similar to those described for schizophrenic zzso zzso with these findings, human zzso studies in a large sample of affected families detected a significant association of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso gamma zzso zzso with zzso The idea that abnormalities in the zzso signaling zzso are involved in schizophrenia zzso is consistent with traditional theories of schizophrenia and with many facts known about zzso A tremendous amount of knowledge about zzso has accumulated and, by utilizing this information, the studies on the zzso of schizophrenia and its related mental disorders will be potentially zzso We discuss the potential impact of a large-scale mouse zzso project on the study of psychiatric zzso
