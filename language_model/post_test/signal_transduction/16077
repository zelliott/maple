zzso cells zzso are distinct zzso cells zzso that populate zzso zzso zzso Despite extensive studies, our understanding of zzso development is zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is required for zzso development, but other zzso influences may also be zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been identified as a cell surface protein discriminating zzso from zzso zzso zzso and other zzso in the zzso zzso is a known zzso target of the zzso signaling zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso signaling might influence zzso zzso zzso of zzso into cultures of zzso cells in combination with zzso zzso and zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, addition of the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso decreased the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice to test the in zzso relevance of our in zzso zzso Feeding zzso to nursing mothers induced expression of zzso in the skin of transgenic zzso causing an obvious hair zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso proliferation zzso zzso on zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and decreased zzso expression zzso on zzso as well zzso In aggregate, these data suggest that zzso signaling in skin influences zzso zzso
