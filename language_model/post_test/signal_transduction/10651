With the aid of zzso and zzso analysis, this investigation sought expression profiles of zzso genes in cultured mouse zzso zzso cells and addressed their relevance to gene regulation in developing zzso cells in zzso Many of the zzso and zzso genes identified were zzso and zzso respectively, during zzso zzso This zzso change was, at least partly, prevented in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes were distributed in either zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso cells at zzso day 8 zzso and were still present in mature zzso cells at zzso In contrast, the zzso genes were predominantly expressed in zzso zzso cells at zzso and disappeared at zzso Furthermore, many of the zzso gene products are implicated in signaling zzso of zzso receptors and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in promoting gene expression in zzso cell development and zzso
