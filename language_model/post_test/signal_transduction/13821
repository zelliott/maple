Transition metals such as Iron zzso and zzso zzso are essential for plant cell zzso At the same time, due their capability to generate zzso zzso they can be potentially toxic to plant zzso Recent works on zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso generated by transition metals could play an important role in plant growth and adaptation to zzso zzso In this zzso the relation between transition metals zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport in plant cells is zzso and a new model depicting both zzso and zzso mode of zzso signaling to plasma membrane zzso is zzso
