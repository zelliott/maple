The major causes of death and disability in zzso zzso zzso may be early brain injury zzso and cerebral zzso Although cerebral zzso has been studied and treated by a lot of drugs, the outcome is not improved even if zzso is zzso Based on these data, zzso is considered a primary target for future research, and zzso may be involved in zzso after experimental zzso 

We reviewed the published literature about the relationship between zzso induced zzso and zzso in zzso 

Most available information can be obtained from the zzso filament zzso animal zzso After onset of zzso zzso pressure is increased and then cerebral blood flow is zzso Many factors are involved in the mechanism of zzso cell death in zzso after zzso In the zzso cells, both intrinsic and zzso pathways of zzso can zzso Some zzso drugs were studied and demonstrated a protective effect against zzso after zzso However, zzso in zzso after zzso has been little studied and further studies will provide us more beneficial zzso 

The study of zzso in zzso after experimental zzso may give us new therapies for zzso
