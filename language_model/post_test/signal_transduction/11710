Signal zzso pathways are the molecular mechanisms responsible for detecting and zzso changes in the surrounding environment to the nucleus where appropriate responses are zzso The cell wall is the most external structure of the zzso cell and, in zzso zzso is responsible for specifically interacting with the zzso host cell in a highly dynamic zzso Recent work has shown the role that some signal zzso zzso involving members of the zzso zzso family, have in this process in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso However, as yet little is known about these phenomena in zzso zzso The aim of this review is to characterize the existing signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso and their relationship with the zzso zzso
