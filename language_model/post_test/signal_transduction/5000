The zzso zzso zzso zzso - 1 zzso has been implicated in the cellular response to stress in many zzso and zzso zzso is known to play a role in a variety of signaling zzso including those involved in lung disease zzso Recently, a role for zzso signaling in immune cell function has zzso The goal of the present study was to determine the role of zzso in host defense against both bacterial and viral pneumonia, as well as the impact of zzso signaling on zzso zzso zzso Wild type zzso and zzso zzso mice were challenged with zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso mice and zzso cells were zzso with zzso The impact of zzso deletion on pathogen zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was required for clearance of zzso coli, inflammatory cell zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso deletion had only a small impact on the host response to zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had decreased zzso A burden in viral pneumonia, yet displayed worsened zzso Finally, zzso was required for zzso zzso induction of inflammatory zzso and zzso peptides both in zzso cells and the zzso These data identify zzso as an important signaling zzso in host defense and demonstrate a pathogen specific role in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may represent a novel therapeutic target in zzso
