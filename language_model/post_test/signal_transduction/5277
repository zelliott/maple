To determine the molecular mechanisms linking zzso growth restriction zzso to adult type 2 diabetes zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in the adult zzso 

The zzso model was prepared by maternal zzso Western zzso analysis was undertaken to assess zzso expression of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 in zzso male zzso zzso 

The zzso levels of zzso protein decreased in zzso rats compared with normal controls zzso whereas zzso protein level significantly increased in zzso rats zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso protein levels significantly decreased in the liver of zzso rats compared with normal controls zzso After insulin administration, zzso zzso significantly increased to zzso of zzso level in control zzso However, zzso of zzso which responded to insulin was markedly blunted in zzso rats compared with controls and only increased to zzso of zzso level zzso 

The level of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso expression decreased in the liver of zzso rats, whereas the levels of zzso protein zzso It may contribute to the zzso of insulin resistance in the zzso zzso
