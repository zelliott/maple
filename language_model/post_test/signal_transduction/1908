Human zzso zzso zzso do not divide indefinitely and eventually lead to an arrest of cell division by a process termed cellular or zzso zzso zzso growth arrest of zzso cells is strongly related to the attenuated response to growth zzso Recently, we reported that zzso of zzso in the zzso cells is responsible for the attenuated response to growth zzso zzso cells did not zzso zzso after zzso zzso whereas young cells zzso In those zzso cells, we found an increased level of zzso proteins and strong interactions between zzso and zzso When we zzso zzso in young zzso the zzso of zzso on zzso stimulation was significantly zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso stimulation might be due to the zzso of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso system plays the more active and dominant role over the zzso zzso zzso we monitored the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells in order to zzso the exact mode of the attenuated response to growth factors in the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso we found a significant decrease of zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso By adjusting the level of zzso we could zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso either in young or old cells toward growth factors: that is, a dominant negative zzso of zzso blocked the zzso in the young cells, while zzso of the gene resumed its activity in the old zzso Taken together, we conclude that the loss of zzso activity of zzso cells is directly related to the zzso of zzso and/or zzso of zzso This opens a new field of functional recovery of the zzso cells simply through adjusting the zzso zzso zzso
