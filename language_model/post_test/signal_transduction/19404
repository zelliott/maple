We show here that similar to zzso zzso of the bacterial product zzso zzso interferes with egg production in female zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso cells zzso in stage zzso egg chambers losing zzso zzso after which zzso invade and zzso the zzso Nurse cell zzso then occurs, followed by total egg chamber zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso and also the laying of zzso that develop into normal offspring in flies fed zzso Thus, zzso cells can be induced to destroy intact zzso without a requirement for earlier zzso zzso Genes that control zzso zzso polarity were found to be involved in egg chamber zzso In flies bearing zzso zzso for discs large, zzso or zzso zzso zzso fail to lose polarity on zzso zzso zzso laying and offspring development to adulthood are rescued in all of these zzso when housed on zzso zzso that block zzso in zzso zzso The response to zzso was found to be zzso in zzso as mouse zzso zzso cultured in zzso with zzso show the rapid destruction of the zzso by adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso destruction is thus implicated in controlling egg survival in insects and zzso
