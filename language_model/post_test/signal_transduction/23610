The zzso zzso family of proteins zzso zzso converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso which can be further oxidized and repaired by zzso DNA zzso zzso to influence gene zzso in embryonic and adult zzso However the mechanisms of how zzso and zzso levels are regulated are zzso We show that zzso can directly regulate zzso and zzso zzso levels through binding to their zzso zzso mimic decreases global zzso levels, a hallmark of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso levels for zzso and zzso are zzso correlated with the levels of zzso in aged mouse zzso zzso that aging may affect zzso patterns via zzso In zzso our data show that zzso and zzso are direct targets of zzso and unravel a novel regulatory role for this zzso in zzso DNA zzso zzso
