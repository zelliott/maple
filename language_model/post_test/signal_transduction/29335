It is largely accepted that zzso are more susceptible to chemical insult during the early life zzso It is implied that if a chemical such as ethanol is zzso toxic, it must interfere with, or zzso critical signaling zzso The probable molecular explanation for increased embryonic zzso is that collectively there is no other period of an zzso lifespan when the full repertoire of molecular signaling is zzso zzso the mechanism by which ethanol exposure zzso zzso embryonic development is enormously zzso it requires a thorough understanding of the normal molecular program to understand how transient ethanol exposure zzso signaling and results in zzso long-lasting zzso During the past several years, investigators have recognized the advantages of the zzso model to discover the signaling events that choreograph embryonic zzso External development coupled with the numerous molecular and genetic methods make this model a valuable tool to unravel the mechanisms by which ethanol zzso embryonic zzso In this chapter we describe procedures used to evaluate and define the zzso cellular and molecular responses to ethanol in zzso
