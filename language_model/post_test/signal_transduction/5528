The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a new synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso and its resistant zzso zzso In parental cells, in comparison to zzso cells, sequential administration of both compounds led to higher zzso dye zzso Green zzso retention and to zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso accompanied by changes in several zzso and zzso molecules and zzso protein zzso as detected by Western zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso cells were resistant to zzso or to combined zzso zzso zzso zzso induction and exerted minor changes in the levels of these zzso
