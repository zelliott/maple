zzso tissue growth factor zzso plays a central role in stimulating zzso zzso deposition in the liver, and hence is considered a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are known as the major source of zzso in damaged zzso However, previous studies revealed that zzso rather than zzso represents the zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso We now dissected zzso downstream signaling that zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso increase of zzso in a zzso zzso This process requires participation of different zzso proteins and their upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the key zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but zzso was not involved in zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso was found to be responsible for zzso early zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling via the zzso zzso rather than via its zzso zzso zzso These results provide an improved new insight into the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso activities in the zzso
