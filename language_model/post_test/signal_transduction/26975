The zzso beta family is comprised of at least six distinct zzso that regulate trafficking of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso at least one of these, zzso inflammatory protein 1 alpha zzso zzso also regulates the growth of zzso stem zzso We now show that zzso alpha and the related beta zzso zzso induce transient zzso in zzso zzso concentration in zzso zzso that can be zzso and specifically zzso suggesting a common zzso Moreover, we have now cloned both the zzso and the gene for this zzso functionally expressed the zzso in zzso zzso and mapped the gene to human zzso zzso zzso for the zzso were found in mature and immature zzso cells as well as B zzso The zzso is a member of the G zzso zzso zzso It has approximately zzso zzso acid identity with receptors for the alpha zzso zzso 8, and may be the human zzso of the product of zzso an open reading frame of human zzso
