zzso zzso zzso factor action is zzso by a zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso and the zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso zzso We used zzso receptors containing the zzso domain of either the zzso or zzso to identify regions of the receptors required for induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso receptors containing the zzso domain of zzso were able to induce zzso from both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso receptors containing the zzso domain of the zzso were incapable of zzso induction of the zzso gene despite being able to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies identified two zzso zzso and zzso which were required for zzso induction of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso are reported to be the only zzso zzso in zzso that bind zzso these results suggest that this zzso factor plays a key role in the induction of zzso of both the zzso and the zzso zzso
