Summer zzso zzso as seeds in the soil seed zzso This is facilitated by a zzso increase in dormancy during seed maturation followed by a switch to a state during seed zzso in which cold instead promotes zzso Here, we show that the seed maturation zzso in zzso zzso is highly temperature sensitive and reveal that low temperature during seed maturation zzso several genes associated with zzso including zzso OF zzso zzso and influences zzso and zzso acid levels in mature zzso zzso lacking zzso or with altered zzso or zzso acid synthesis or zzso in turn show reduced ability to enter the deeply dormant states in response to low seed maturation zzso In addition, we find that zzso promotes zzso zzso during zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso are necessary for regulation of dormancy and of zzso and zzso expression caused by low zzso However, the temperature sensitivity of zzso zzso is markedly reduced in seeds and is absent in zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso of zzso expression is likely a critical feature allowing cold to promote rather than inhibit zzso and support a model in which zzso act in parallel to a zzso signaling zzso in the regulation of zzso
