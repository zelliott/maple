zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso factor 6 zzso is a key signaling zzso protein not only for the zzso zzso but also for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate zzso function in zzso innate immune responses, zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso long, with an open reading frame zzso zzso a putative protein of 594 zzso zzso including a zzso zzso finger, two zzso zzso fingers, a zzso region, and a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso acid sequence identity between zzso and other known zzso is zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso could activate the promoters of zzso zzso genes zzso including zzso zzso A and zzso and shrimp zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso expressed in various zzso of zzso zzso After zzso zzso and white spot syndrome virus zzso challenge, zzso was zzso though with different expression patterns in the zzso compared to other zzso After zzso challenge, zzso was zzso zzso and zzso over the control at zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso may play a crucial role in zzso and zzso responses via regulation of zzso gene zzso
