In zzso zzso cells, mechanical forces produced from urinary obstruction serve as potential zzso of zzso by zzso specific zzso signaling zzso In this study, we sought to further define the role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines derived from the various components of the zzso were subjected to cyclical stretch and their differential zzso response was zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were used to assess the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed with zzso and by Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was dependent upon the cell zzso and the degree of zzso In zzso cells, it was zzso through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of either zzso reduced the degree of zzso zzso zzso cells showed increased activity of zzso and -9 but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso was modulated by zzso of zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso 

These findings suggest that stretch zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells through the specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso pathways and is dependent on the zzso of zzso and zzso
