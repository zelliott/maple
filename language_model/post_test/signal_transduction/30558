A gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso of zzso zzso strain 7 by screening a database of zzso likely to contribute to zzso zzso in zzso zzso After expressing the gene in zzso coli, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was obtained using conventional zzso steps, though during the zzso an unexpected decline in zzso activity was observed if the zzso was stored in plastic tubes, but not in glass zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso with a zzso molecular mass of about zzso and was highly zzso It preferably acted as an zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso had no activity as the electron zzso both zzso and zzso acted as electron zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso reaction proceeds via a zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso In addition, both the zzso zzso zzso and the reverse reaction were enhanced by zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso reduction was zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso appears to be subject to a novel regulatory mechanism not seen zzso A database analysis showed that zzso gene forms a cluster with zzso zzso and a functional analysis of the zzso product expressed in zzso coli revealed that it possesses zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our findings represent the first example of a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
