Natural killer zzso cells are key components of innate immune responses, providing surveillance against cells undergoing zzso or infection, by viruses or internal zzso zzso cells can directly eliminate compromised cells and regulate downstream responses of the innate and acquired immune systems through the release of immune zzso zzso zzso The importance of the role zzso cells play in immune defense was demonstrated originally in zzso viral infections, usually mild or zzso which become severe and life threatening in zzso patients zzso zzso cell zzso functions are governed by balancing opposing signals from a diverse array of zzso and zzso zzso Many zzso receptors occur in paired zzso and zzso zzso and recognize major zzso complex zzso class I proteins with varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso studies have made considerable inroads into understanding the molecular mechanisms employed to broadly recognize multiple zzso zzso or specific zzso zzso and the strategies employed by viruses to thwart these zzso Although many details of zzso development, zzso and integration remain mysterious, it is clear that zzso receptors are key components of a system exquisitely tuned to sense any zzso in zzso class I zzso or the expression of certain viral zzso resulting in the elimination of affected zzso
