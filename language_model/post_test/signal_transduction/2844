zzso zzso was originally identified as a factor produced by human zzso zzso B cell zzso It was detected by one group as zzso zzso maturation factor, a zzso that zzso with zzso in the induction of zzso killer cells and zzso T zzso A second group characterized it as a natural killer zzso cell zzso factor, due to the enhancement of zzso and zzso synthesis by zzso zzso Human zzso was zzso to zzso and cloned by both zzso We had identified a zzso factor, zzso termed T zzso factor zzso which was involved in the zzso synthesis of zzso and cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in the zzso interaction between zzso cells and zzso as zzso cells, partially zzso from zzso of such cultures, and shown to be identical to zzso zzso appear to be the major source of zzso It is rapidly produced by zzso cells after stimulation with several zzso products and other zzso In the light of its effects on zzso cells as well as zzso and zzso T cells, zzso can be regarded as a zzso that connects the innate immune system with the acquired zzso zzso has a broad range of activities already reviewed in three zzso These include the regulation of zzso synthesis and proliferation of T and zzso cells, the promotion of zzso cell development, the differentiation of zzso T cells and effects on zzso When applied in zzso zzso was shown to enhance the resistance to bacterial and zzso infections, to promote zzso zzso and to influence zzso responses including zzso in zzso or in zzso This review will briefly zzso these effects, but mainly focus on recent results concerning the regulation of the production and the activity of zzso its role in the differentiation of zzso cells and the implications for zzso and zzso hypersensitivity zzso its importance for zzso zzso diseases, and the possible role of the zzso zzso as a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso
