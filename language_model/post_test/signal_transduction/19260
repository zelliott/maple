zzso have an internal compass that enables them to move along shallow chemical zzso As zzso cells zzso signaling events such as Ras and zzso zzso occur spontaneously on zzso Uniform stimuli trigger a zzso response, zzso cells stop and round up; then localized patches of activity appear as cells zzso Finally cells adapt and resume random zzso In contrast, zzso zzso continuously direct signaling events to the front of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso models have captured some of these features of zzso cells, but no system has explained the complex response zzso sensitivity to shallow zzso or the role of recently observed zzso waves within the zzso zzso We report here that Ras and zzso zzso move in phase with the zzso events and, drawing on all of these zzso propose the zzso excitable network zzso We formulate a model that simulates most of the behaviors of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso there are spontaneous spots of zzso zzso increments trigger an initial burst of patches followed by localized secondary zzso After a few minutes, the system adapts, again displaying random zzso In zzso the activity patches are directed continuously and selectively toward the zzso providing an extraordinary degree of zzso zzso by zzso model zzso we generate distinct behaviors consistent with known classes of zzso Our study brings together zzso diverse observations on spontaneous zzso activity, signaling responses to zzso zzso and spatial zzso sensing into a unified zzso
