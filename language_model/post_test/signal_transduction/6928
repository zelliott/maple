To explore whether combining zzso that target the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso can improve treatment efficacy for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines (including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The molecular targeting therapy agents tested included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Potential synergistic zzso effects were tested by median zzso analysis in zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by flow zzso zzso fraction zzso and Western zzso The activities of pertinent signaling pathways and expression of zzso proteins were measured by Western zzso 

zzso blockade induced a more sustained zzso of zzso signaling activities in all the zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects, however, varied among different cell lines and drug combinations and were most prominent when zzso was combined with zzso Using an zzso zzso we identified zzso as a potential downstream zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells abolished the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso improved the zzso effects of all drug combinations zzso In zzso by zzso studies confirmed the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and exhibited acceptable toxicity zzso 

zzso blockade of the zzso zzso has promising zzso activity for zzso zzso expression may serve as a zzso to predict treatment zzso
