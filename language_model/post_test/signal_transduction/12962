To clarify functional zzso among the zzso zzso we generated truncated forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso and investigated their zzso activities for zzso and zzso promoters driving the zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso The reporter zzso demonstrated that the zzso activities of zzso were markedly different from each other and dependent on the promoters zzso Furthermore, relative activities between some zzso and another for each promoter were altered by the expression level of zzso zzso We also found that the activities of zzso and zzso were reduced by zzso of zzso These observations suggest that each zzso zzso has a diverse role in the downstream gene expression and that the levels of zzso and zzso gene expression are zzso determined by various factors, such as the type and combination of the zzso receptors which zzso the downstream signals and the expression level of zzso zzso
