zzso of zzso and subsequent release of toxic zzso proteins play a key role in allergic diseases such as zzso zzso However, little is known about the zzso signaling mechanism of zzso zzso In this report, we investigated the role of protein zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of human peripheral blood zzso zzso of zzso with zzso beads coated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso triggered the zzso of zzso zzso in several zzso including zzso 73, 78, 100, 105 and 113 zzso In addition, zzso beads induced a rapid increase in the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, inhibited both the zzso zzso and zzso responses of zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso was not affected by zzso These findings suggest that a zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in triggering the zzso zzso induced by immobilized zzso
