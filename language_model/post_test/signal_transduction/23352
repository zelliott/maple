The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a regulatory factor of the cell zzso Its zzso zzso and protein stability are tightly controlled by several distinct zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso proteins involved in several biological zzso including cell cycle progression and signal zzso In the present study, we show that zzso of zzso results in the reduction of zzso protein in human zzso zzso It appears that a zzso zzso degradation process is involved in zzso degradation in zzso zzso zzso The application of a zzso inhibitor stabilized zzso protein in these zzso Analysis of distinct signal zzso pathways revealed a disturbed zzso zzso after zzso zzso We determined that the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso zzso was activated in cells possessing zzso zzso and appears to be involved in zzso protein zzso The application of a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 3 resulted in an increase of the zzso protein level in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 is able to zzso zzso at zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 3 site zzso 57 into zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells lacking zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso triggered the induction of zzso in zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is involved in the maintenance of zzso protein stability and appears to function as an inhibitor of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Thus, the data shed light on a novel zzso regulating zzso protein zzso
