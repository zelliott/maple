Recent data have shown that the zzso gene is zzso at a high frequency in human zzso We have analyzed the migratory characteristics of zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso and compared these with the organization of the zzso zzso and the activity of signaling pathways that are known to influence this zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the levels of zzso and, surprisingly, induced an approximately zzso increase in cell zzso zzso with these findings, the high level of zzso stress fibers normally present in zzso was considerably reduced following disruption of zzso and the zzso content of zzso cells was less than half that of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso light chain on zzso zzso was not reduced in zzso zzso Rather, reduced zzso expression and attenuated zzso of zzso on zzso 3 zzso zzso stress fiber and zzso levels were restored by the expression of human zzso and zzso active zzso and by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results have important implications for the role of the zzso signaling zzso in regulating cell zzso in normal and zzso zzso They suggest that zzso is involved in zzso by regulating the proper assembly of zzso stress fibers and zzso through a zzso signaling zzso
