As an attempt to analyze the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso in rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of Lyn at the zzso state was decreased in zzso cells, and further decreased in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso specific activity of Lyn was increased, thereby indicating that zzso functioned as a dominant negative zzso The onset of zzso Lyn zzso was delayed in zzso cells, and further delayed in zzso zzso In zzso cells, Lyn zzso was rapid and quite long zzso These findings indicate zzso zzso zzso regulates rapid zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity is potentially required for its zzso The zzso of the series of events including zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso calcium concentration zzso and zzso release were all zzso delayed in zzso cells and in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also closely correlated with those of Lyn zzso but zzso zzso and zzso release followed different zzso zzso the delayed responses in zzso cells and in zzso cells led to sustained zzso zzso and zzso release, while the prompt responses in parent cells and zzso cells rapidly zzso These findings provide further evidence that the zzso of the zzso signals are zzso regulated by zzso family protein zzso zzso and revealed that their zzso are regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
