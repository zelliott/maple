Mice deficient in the zzso protein zzso (also known as zzso have reduced numbers of mature B cells, but an increased zzso cell zzso We show here that compared to zzso cells, zzso zzso cells show an enhanced ex zzso zzso zzso This proliferation requires zzso 7 and expression of the zzso cell zzso zzso In addition, zzso mice have a high zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso cells led to zzso zzso and enhanced zzso Our results indicate that zzso regulates a zzso program that promotes differentiation and limits zzso cell expansion, thereby acting as a tumor zzso
