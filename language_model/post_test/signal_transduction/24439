The B cell zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating signal zzso via the B cell zzso zzso Studies have shown that surface expression of zzso can be modulated in response to binding of zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso in the level of zzso expression following binding of natural zzso may affect its ability to zzso the zzso zzso signaling threshold at specific points during B cell development and zzso zzso it is important to delineate the zzso mechanism by which zzso expression is zzso In the current study, zzso zzso analysis was used to demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso the medium chain zzso of the zzso complex, via zzso zzso motifs in its zzso zzso This interaction was further characterized using zzso zzso analysis revealing that zzso and surrounding zzso acids in the zzso tail of zzso comprise the primary binding site for zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso or zzso forms of zzso demonstrated that either zzso or zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso and that these motifs are involved in its interaction with the zzso complex, as determined by zzso of zzso Finally, experiments were performed demonstrating that treatment of B cells with either intact zzso zzso or zzso blocks zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that zzso of zzso is dependent on its association with the zzso complex via zzso zzso zzso
