zzso deletion of fragile X mental zzso protein zzso has been shown to enhance zzso long-term depression zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso zzso increase in zzso that is rapidly zzso by the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso abolished zzso and zzso was absent in mice that zzso human zzso Neither translation nor zzso zzso blocked the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso is associated with rapid increases in the protein levels of zzso target zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso levels of these proteins were elevated and their synthesis was improperly regulated during zzso in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso requires the rapid synthesis and degradation of zzso and that zzso triggers the synthesis of zzso binding zzso These findings indicate that the translation, zzso and zzso of zzso functions as a dynamic regulatory system for controlling synaptic zzso
