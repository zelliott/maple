To explore the role of zzso II Type 1 zzso protein zzso in vascular zzso we developed transgenic mice for mouse zzso zzso and examined zzso after inflammatory vascular injury induced by zzso cuff zzso In zzso transgenic zzso mice, zzso zzso was increased 3- to zzso in the heart, zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice showed no significant change in body weight, zzso blood pressure, heart rate, and zzso weight zzso However, cell proliferation and zzso formation in the injured artery were attenuated in zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso activity and the expression of zzso a reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after cuff placement was also attenuated in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1, and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 after cuff placement was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso response and cardiac zzso induced by zzso II infusion and pressure overload were also attenuated in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in vascular zzso as a negative zzso
