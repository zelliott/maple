This study examined the events associated with the zzso disruption of the structural and functional integrity of the zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso It shows that loss of the zzso after zzso depletion is associated with the withdrawal of zzso zzso and zzso probably as intact zzso complexes from the zzso membrane of zzso zzso The relative amounts of all three proteins increased in the zzso zzso fraction of cell zzso and decreased in the zzso zzso zzso These changes were reversed with zzso of cell zzso It is additionally shown that zzso depletion zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and T cell factor zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor with which zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso proteins as intact zzso complexes from the plasma membrane zzso the rapid recovery of the zzso after zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso to the nucleus indicates that zzso depletion may activate the zzso signal zzso zzso Thus, entirely novel evidence is provided that both of the known roles of zzso as a structural part of the zzso and as a component of the zzso pathway, play a role after zzso zzso injury to zzso zzso It is also speculated that the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso gene expression after zzso injury and may contribute to events necessary for zzso zzso and repair after zzso zzso
