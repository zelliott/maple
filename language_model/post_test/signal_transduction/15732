The zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso is a critical regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress in human zzso The variety of zzso zzso and zzso agents that activate this signal zzso zzso do so primarily through the formation of bulky zzso in DNA and subsequent effects on DNA replication fork zzso Because there are many zzso and zzso interactions proposed to be involved in zzso and/or maintenance of zzso signaling in zzso we systematically analyzed the association of a number of zzso zzso proteins with relevant zzso DNA structures in zzso These DNA zzso included zzso DNA, zzso DNA, and bulky zzso zzso We found that many checkpoint proteins show a preference for zzso zzso and bulky zzso DNA in comparison to zzso zzso zzso We additionally found that the association of checkpoint proteins with bulky DNA damage relative to undamaged DNA was strongly influenced by the zzso strength of the binding zzso Interestingly, among the checkpoint proteins analyzed the checkpoint zzso proteins zzso and zzso showed the greatest differential affinity for zzso DNA zzso We conclude that the association and zzso of multiple checkpoint proteins with DNA structures indicative of DNA damage and replication stress likely contribute to optimal zzso DNA damage checkpoint zzso
