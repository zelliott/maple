The induction of root zzso by the majority of zzso has a strict requirement for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors zzso The nature of the chemical substitution on the zzso depends on the particular zzso and contributes to the host specificity imparted by the zzso We present here a description of the genetic organization of the nod gene cluster and the characterization of the chemical structure of the zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso a zzso capable of zzso at least zzso zzso and zzso zzso The nod gene cluster was located on the zzso zzso The organization of the cluster showed zzso with those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the strongest sequence similarity observed was between the partial nod sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso nod genes zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso region zzso positions strain zzso and the type strain zzso zzso zzso in the same branch, which indicates that zzso zzso strain zzso might represent an early zzso zzso The zzso chemical structures obtained for the zzso strain consist of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso backbone that shares some zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso while in strain zzso most of the zzso were zzso in their reducing terminal zzso none of the zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso were zzso The evidence obtained supports the notion that the zzso decoration of zzso in zzso is not necessary for alfalfa zzso
