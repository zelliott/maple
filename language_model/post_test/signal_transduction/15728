Global gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cells zzso that differentiate into neural cells would help to further define the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso in zzso We performed a comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso differentiation at three different zzso early neural zzso neural zzso and differentiated zzso We identified and validated zzso gene expression patterns and showed that the gene expression patterns reflect early zzso zzso zzso of genes are induced in primary zzso lineages and then in differentiated zzso zzso consecutive waves of known and novel zzso zzso analysis revealed dynamic expression patterns of members of several signaling zzso including zzso zzso and Toll like receptors zzso during neural zzso An interaction network analysis revealed that the zzso family of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are possible key players in the proliferation and maintenance of neural zzso zzso these results enhance our understanding of the molecular dynamics underlying neural commitment and zzso
