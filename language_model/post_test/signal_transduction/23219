zzso are highly specialized zzso cells localized in the kidney zzso The distinct cell signaling events and unique zzso architecture tailor zzso to withstand changes in zzso pressure during zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to kidney disease and frequently zzso with zzso It has been increasingly recognized that cell signaling and zzso dynamics are coupled more tightly to membrane trafficking than previously zzso zzso trafficking coordinates the zzso between protein networks and signaling zzso in a zzso and temporally organized fashion and may be viewed as a communication highway between the cell exterior and zzso zzso trafficking involves transport of cargo from the plasma membrane to the cell interior zzso zzso followed by cargo trafficking to zzso for degradation or to the plasma membrane for zzso Yet, recent studies indicate that the conventional zzso does not fully reflect the complex and versatile nature of membrane zzso While the increasing complexity of elaborate protein scaffolds and signaling zzso is being recognized in zzso the role of membrane trafficking is less well zzso This review will focus on the role of membrane trafficking in zzso health and zzso
