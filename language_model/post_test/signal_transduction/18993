zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso are two closely related components of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is zzso regulated in breast zzso Despite the importance of zzso few studies have evaluated it as a potential target for cancer therapy compared with studies of zzso We hypothesized that zzso is a superior target in the zzso zzso To test this, we first used a mouse zzso cell line zzso infected to express human zzso or zzso for comparative studies of treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso similar resistance to treatment with zzso or zzso compared with control zzso However, the zzso cells were more resistant to zzso than were the zzso zzso We next correlated the expression and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with the zzso effects of the same agents in several human breast cancer cell zzso zzso with high levels of zzso zzso were more resistant to zzso zzso than cells expressing high levels of zzso zzso To further validate this zzso we used small interfering zzso zzso to selectively knock down zzso or zzso expression in zzso human breast cancer zzso We found that zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso more effectively than did zzso of zzso expression in the same zzso Our findings show that zzso may be a superior alternative to zzso as a target for zzso breast cancer cells to zzso agents, particularly zzso
