We recently identified zzso acid zzso as a potent zzso agent for the zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso zzso a novel rationally zzso metabolically stabilized zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

The receptors and signaling pathways activated by zzso were examined in zzso and zzso cell lines and zzso and zzso and zzso knockout mice exposed to different zzso zzso 

zzso was more zzso than zzso in reducing gamma zzso zzso or tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso and zzso activity in the zzso cell zzso In zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso selectively protected zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso In zzso and zzso knockout mice exposed to 15 zzso gamma zzso orally applied zzso reduced the number of zzso bodies and activated zzso cells but was ineffective in zzso knockout zzso zzso with higher efficacy than zzso enhanced zzso zzso survival in zzso mice but was without any effect in zzso knockout zzso zzso administered zzso reduced death caused by lethal dose zzso radiation by zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso is a highly effective zzso agent that engages similar zzso pathways to zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
