zzso zzso zzso are essential for cellular signaling in response to zzso signals and zzso to regulate zzso differentiation and zzso The three major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maintain signaling specificity by scaffolding proteins and by specific zzso interactions between zzso zzso The structures zzso these interactions include the domain of versatile zzso zzso responsible for zzso and the common zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso together with the various zzso zzso motifs in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several of these interactions have been studied in great zzso First approaches to use this knowledge to develop peptides that specifically inhibit zzso signaling in disease models have been zzso It becomes obvious that specificity of peptides competing with zzso is comparable to or even superior to small zzso zzso zzso In addition to specifically targeting zzso zzso the ultimate efficacy of these zzso zzso in zzso also depends on their delivery, stability and toxicity in living cells and in the whole zzso
