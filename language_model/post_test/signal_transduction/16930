zzso disease of bone zzso is characterized by focal areas of zzso and excessive bone zzso specifically increased bone zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene are common in zzso patients, with most zzso affecting the zzso domain of the zzso In zzso zzso precursor cells expressing zzso zzso protein are associated with increases in nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso Although the precise mechanisms by which zzso zzso contribute to disease zzso and progression are not well zzso it is apparent that as well as affecting nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso is a master regulator of zzso protein turnover via zzso and the zzso zzso Additional roles for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso that were recently reported are potentially relevant to the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso may serve as a molecular link or switch between zzso zzso and cell survival zzso The purpose of this review is to outline recent advances in understanding of the multiple zzso roles of zzso zzso with particular emphasis on their relationship to zzso including challenges associated with translating zzso research into clinical diagnosis and zzso
