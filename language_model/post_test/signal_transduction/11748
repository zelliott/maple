We have characterized the specific binding of zzso in the white and gray matter of normal human brain and in cerebral tumors as an index of the availability of protein zzso C zzso zzso White matter has less than 50% zzso capacity in comparison to gray zzso The binding is lower in tumors of zzso origin when compared with normal white zzso zzso of zzso origin such as zzso and zzso have a lower binding capacity than zzso zzso zzso zzso have the lowest binding zzso The analysis of binding parameters in tumors and in the corresponding normal zzso zzso confirms the decreased binding capacity of zzso zzso in comparison to zzso not undergoing zzso zzso These data suggest that brain zzso tumors have a low availability of protein zzso C zzso molecules and point to the potential involvement of this system in zzso transformation of human brain zzso
