zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in cell signaling of embryonic development and adult tissue zzso In zzso the zzso gene encodes three different unique zzso sonic zzso zzso desert zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso leads to severe disorders in the development of zzso whereas zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been associated with several zzso including zzso syndrome (a disorder zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic and breast zzso In zzso evidence suggests the antagonism of excessive zzso signaling provides a route to unique zzso zzso zzso Recently the small zzso zzso was identified as a potent zzso of zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso studies as well as biological evaluation of zzso and its zzso Fifteen zzso derivatives were zzso and analyzed for their interference with the expression of the zzso target gene zzso in a reporter gene zzso By comparison of structure and activity important molecular zzso for zzso zzso could be zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso that was slightly more potent than the parent compound zzso zzso compounds were tested for zzso related zzso effects in the small zzso model zzso zzso zzso expression has indicated a zzso higher zzso activity than observed for the plant zzso zzso none of the tested compounds were able to induce the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
