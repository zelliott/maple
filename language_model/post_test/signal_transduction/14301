Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is largely divided into two groups based on their zzso human zzso zzso and zzso Global DNA zzso changes are known to drive zzso and tumor zzso expression in primary zzso of both zzso However, significant zzso in DNA zzso within the groups results in different zzso profiles and clinical zzso We applied a zzso analysis to link gene expression changes to DNA zzso in distinguishing zzso zzso This approach isolated specific zzso changes controlling expression in zzso zzso that distinguish it from zzso zzso Analysis of genes identified zzso zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso the primary zzso target, showed higher expression in tumors compared to normal samples with zzso tumors having the highest zzso zzso suggesting that increased expression of zzso is a potential driver in zzso zzso Our zzso for integration of DNA zzso and gene expression can zzso biologically significant molecular pathways that may be exploited as zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso targeting the zzso zzso may be of benefit in zzso zzso Similar zzso analysis of zzso coupled DNA zzso and expression zzso may yield novel insights into zzso pathways in other zzso
