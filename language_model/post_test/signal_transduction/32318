This study focused on understanding the signaling mechanisms leading to zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso that follow zzso zzso supplementation in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso protein content presented a tendency to be higher zzso zzso zzso after zzso supplementation (5 zzso for zzso The changes in zzso protein content significantly related zzso zzso zzso to the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso signaling may be implicated in the effects of supplementation on zzso zzso in type 2 zzso
