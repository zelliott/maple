Stress protein responses have evolved in part as a mechanism to protect cells from the toxic effects of environmental damaging zzso zzso zzso zzso cells have evolved an zzso stress response that results in the synthesis of a 53 zzso protein of undefined function named zzso zzso stress protein of 53 zzso zzso Given the role of zzso acid zzso as a potential damaging agent in zzso zzso we developed zzso measuring the effects of zzso on zzso responses to zzso To achieve this, we cloned the human zzso zzso developed a panel of zzso zzso to the zzso and showed that zzso expression is predominantly confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to show that zzso can function as a survival factor in zzso cell lines, can zzso zzso zzso cell death, and can zzso zzso increases in zzso free zzso zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso the colony survival activity of the zzso zzso the protective effects of zzso after zzso exposure, and permits calcium zzso in response to zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso protein zzso can function as a modifier of the zzso calcium influx and identify a novel survival zzso whose study may shed light on mechanisms relating to zzso cell injury and associated cancer zzso
