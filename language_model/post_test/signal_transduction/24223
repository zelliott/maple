Both zzso growth zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso have been implicated in the zzso of early zzso dysfunction in zzso We investigated whether zzso affects zzso gene expression and protein zzso in human zzso zzso Furthermore, we studied the zzso signaling zzso involved and the interaction of zzso with mechanical stretch, a known zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells were exposed to zzso in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso a zzso zzso blocking the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso inhibitor (10 zzso and zzso zzso stretch zzso zzso zzso 

zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso protein levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso production rose by 6 hours with a peak at 12 hours, and declined by 24 hours zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso at 12 zzso A corresponding 50% increase in zzso zzso levels was seen at 6 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was not affected by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso increase over zzso P zzso zzso but was abolished by alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and significantly reduced by zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso + zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso exposure of human zzso cells to both zzso and stretch failed to further increase zzso production zzso zzso zzso zzso stretch, zzso zzso zzso and zzso + stretch, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso gene expression and protein zzso in human zzso cells via a zzso zzso
