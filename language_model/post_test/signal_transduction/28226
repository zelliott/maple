zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso signaling by zzso specific zzso zzso in their activated zzso zzso zzso signals are zzso by zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and its downstream targets, such as zzso and zzso zzso plays an especially important role in zzso zzso because it mediates some peripheral actions of insulin and promotes pancreatic zzso zzso To determine whether the deletion of zzso compensates for the absence of zzso we analyzed mice deficient in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso area decreased in zzso mice, consistent with decreased insulin requirements zzso to increased peripheral insulin zzso By contrast, peripheral insulin sensitivity and zzso area increased in zzso mice, which improved zzso tolerance in zzso mice and delayed diabetes until 3 months of zzso However, zzso function eventually failed to compensate for absence of zzso Our studies demonstrate a novel role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso and indicate that zzso zzso can partially compensate for lack of zzso
