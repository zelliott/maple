zzso zzso is the highest grade of primary adult brain tumors, characterized by a poorly defined and highly invasive cell zzso zzso these invading cells are attributed with having a decreased sensitivity to radiation and zzso zzso weak zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling is one mechanism in zzso that promotes cell zzso and survival and is dependent upon the activity of multiple zzso zzso including zzso Here we report that zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, is zzso in zzso tumors and promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso expression in zzso tumors zzso correlate with patient zzso zzso zzso expression is increased in zzso cells at the invasive rim relative to those in the tumor core, and zzso of zzso expression by zzso decreases zzso cell migration in zzso and invasion ex zzso Furthermore, we showed that, upon zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the zzso zzso tail via zzso zzso of the zzso domain site or depletion of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso expression by zzso zzso blocked zzso recruitment to zzso and inhibited zzso activity and subsequent zzso cell zzso We also showed that zzso of either zzso or zzso diminished zzso zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is an important downstream regulator of zzso zzso cell migration and zzso
