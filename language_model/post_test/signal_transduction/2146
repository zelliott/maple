zzso influx in zzso cells regulates such diverse processes as zzso contraction, zzso control, gene regulation, cell zzso and zzso The dominant zzso entry zzso in these cells is the zzso one, in which zzso entry is governed by the zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Only recently has a zzso current been described that is activated by store zzso The properties of this new zzso called zzso zzso zzso current zzso have been investigated in detail using the zzso zzso Despite intense research, the nature of the signal that couples zzso store content to the zzso channels in the plasma membrane has remained zzso Although zzso appears to be the most effective and widespread influx pathway, other zzso currents have also been zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso channel has not yet been zzso evidence continues to accumulate that the zzso zzso gene might zzso a zzso zzso zzso In this review, we describe the historical development of the field of zzso signaling and the discovery of zzso zzso zzso We focus on the zzso properties of the zzso zzso current zzso discuss the regulatory mechanisms that control it, and finally consider recent advances toward the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in this ubiquitous and important zzso entry zzso
