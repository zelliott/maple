zzso signaling by the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso is present in a cohort of breast zzso Because zzso is zzso zzso in some breast tumors, we speculated that, in these zzso zzso of zzso may occur via zzso zzso To test this possibility, we examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso against the zzso human breast tumor lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso with an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The specificity of zzso against zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso receptors activated by synthetic zzso without the interference of zzso zzso Treatment of all breast cancer cell lines (except zzso with 1 zzso zzso almost completely eliminated zzso zzso In contrast, the incorporation of zzso in zzso onto zzso receptors isolated from zzso cells was unaffected by 1 zzso zzso zzso is expressed by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso explained the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In zzso cells, zzso exhibited a greater zzso effect than zzso a zzso zzso against the zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, treatment with zzso plus zzso induced a greater zzso effect than either inhibitor zzso Finally, zzso completely prevented growth of zzso zzso established in nude mice and enhanced the zzso effect of zzso These data imply that zzso zzso zzso zzso will be effective against zzso breast tumor cells that also express zzso and support their use in combination with zzso zzso such as zzso against zzso zzso with high levels of the zzso zzso
