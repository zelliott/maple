Stem cell factor is essential to the migration and differentiation of zzso during zzso based on the observation that zzso in either the stem cell factor zzso or its zzso zzso result in defects in coat pigmentation in zzso Stem cell factor is also required for the survival of zzso precursors while they are zzso towards the zzso zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated in the regulation of both cellular proliferation and zzso zzso an zzso cloned cell line, was cloned from a mouse neural crest zzso zzso cells provide a model to study the specific stage of differentiation and proliferation of zzso They also express zzso as a zzso zzso Using the zzso cell line, we investigated the effect of transforming growth factor zzso on the differentiation and proliferation of immature zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed transforming growth factor zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso inhibited the cell growth, and zzso the zzso protein and zzso zzso To investigate further the zzso of zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso cells were incubated in zzso transforming growth factor zzso culture zzso zzso protein decreased with zzso growth factor zzso zzso concentration in a zzso zzso We concluded that in zzso cells, transforming growth factor zzso promotes zzso precursor proliferation in zzso and/or zzso zzso We further investigated the influence of transforming growth factor zzso in zzso using a neural crest cell primary culture system from zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso decreased the number of zzso positive neural crest zzso In addition, the zzso growth factor zzso zzso supplied within the zzso neural crest zzso abolished the growth of the neural crest zzso These results indicate that transforming growth factor zzso affect zzso precursor proliferation and differentiation in the presence of stem cell zzso in an zzso zzso
