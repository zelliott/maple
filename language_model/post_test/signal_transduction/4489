zzso controlled termination of proliferation determines when zzso zzso cells zzso can initiate differentiation and mature into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso but its role in proliferation is zzso Here we report that loss of zzso enhanced in zzso proliferation and survival and decreased cell cycle exit and growth factor dependence of zzso but not neural zzso zzso zzso mice have more zzso lineage cells in embryonic zzso and delayed zzso zzso On the molecular level, zzso mouse zzso and rat zzso cells have decreased zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, and reduced expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso was required to suppress Ras and zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells restored expression of zzso We propose that zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso proliferation by zzso Ras and zzso leading to zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Thus, zzso acts in zzso to limit zzso and facilitate zzso
