Both nuclear factors of activated T cells zzso and nuclear zzso zzso are zzso zzso domain zzso zzso factors whose independent activities are critically involved in regulating cardiac zzso and zzso 

To determine the potential functional interaction between zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso and its role in cardiac zzso and zzso 

We identified a novel zzso regulatory mechanism zzso zzso and zzso directly interact and zzso promote zzso zzso in zzso We show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and this interaction maps to the zzso within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the association between zzso zzso and zzso leading to reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso causes nuclear zzso of zzso and expression of a zzso nuclear zzso zzso similarly facilitated zzso nuclear zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso promotes synergistic zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso whereas zzso of zzso with zzso or dominant negative zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced in zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In zzso zzso deletion of zzso using a zzso system causes a zzso reduction in zzso activity in zzso reporter zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in the mouse heart decreases the zzso response after pressure overload zzso reduces the degree of pathological zzso and preserves zzso zzso 

Our results suggest a direct interaction between zzso and zzso that effectively zzso 2 disparate signaling pathways in promoting cardiac zzso and zzso zzso
