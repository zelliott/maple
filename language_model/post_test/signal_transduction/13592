The propagation of zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso is a key dynamic cellular event involved in signal zzso which is often zzso in disease states such as zzso zzso zzso dynamics is therefore crucial for understanding zzso zzso zzso function and finding ways to inhibit their zzso zzso methods combined with zzso labeling such as stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture zzso have already proven successful in deciphering zzso zzso zzso However, they are limited in terms of zzso and they also are time zzso because several experiments need to be performed zzso Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on zzso zzso that allows monitoring of zzso signaling zzso induced by a drug treatment in one single zzso Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored for zzso it was possible to generate the time profiles for zzso unique zzso belonging to 215 proteins from an zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso of the time profiles followed by zzso enrichment analysis highlighted zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso and zzso signaling as the major pathways affected by zzso thereby zzso the zzso Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to those of other proteins in the zzso zzso the zzso at zzso of protein zzso a recently described zzso of zzso was confirmed as tightly involved in the signaling zzso The present investigation also demonstrates the remote effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso sites such as zzso and zzso as well as a potential feedback effect on zzso of zzso Overall, the zzso zzso is a straightforward approach that extends sample zzso and builds up the arsenal of methods for zzso zzso zzso
