zzso zzso growth factors zzso activate three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the most prominent zzso in zzso signaling by zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso receptors consists of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Earlier studies showed that zzso 2 and 3 zzso mediate zzso zzso while structural analysis of zzso zzso complexes by electron zzso and zzso solution scattering revealed additional zzso contacts in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso and D7 are indispensable for zzso zzso To confirm the essential role of these zzso in zzso we isolated zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso that interact with zzso zzso or zzso zzso that interact with zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso specific for zzso or D7 did not prevent zzso binding or zzso zzso but effectively blocked zzso signaling and functional zzso These data show that zzso and D7 zzso regulate zzso zzso We propose that these zzso zzso represent a novel generation of zzso drugs for in zzso applications such as targeting of zzso in medical zzso and for treating vascular zzso
