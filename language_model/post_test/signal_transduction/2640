The zzso 2 zzso zzso consists of three zzso the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso gamma c zzso Two zzso family protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to associate with zzso beta c and zzso gamma zzso respectively, and their zzso activities are increased after zzso zzso A zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso domain lacks its intrinsic zzso activity but can still associate with zzso gamma zzso In a zzso cell line, zzso that responds to either zzso or zzso zzso of this zzso zzso results in selective zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of cell zzso Of the three target nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso were found to be zzso On the other hand, zzso of the dominant negative form of the zzso gamma c chain, which lacks most of its zzso domain, in zzso cells resulted in the zzso of all three zzso These results provide a further molecular basis for the critical role of zzso in zzso signaling and also suggest a zzso zzso signaling zzso for the zzso gene induction by zzso
