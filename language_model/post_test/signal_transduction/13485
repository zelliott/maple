A spontaneous zzso derived from a mouse lung zzso cell line exhibited decreased zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso column zzso demonstrated that this was caused by specific loss of the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that indeed several mouse lung zzso cell lines and spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso lung cell lines contained less zzso I regulatory zzso zzso protein than normal cell zzso zzso II regulatory zzso protein differed only slightly among cell lines and showed no conspicuous trend between normal and zzso zzso The decrease in zzso was apparently zzso with decreased zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells since no free zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso alpha and C alpha zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso alpha and C alpha zzso paralleled their zzso protein zzso zzso cell lines contained significantly less zzso alpha and C alpha zzso than the normal cell zzso The decreased expression of both zzso and C zzso therefore results in a net decrease of zzso I in zzso lung cells, an zzso difference which may account for the differential effects of zzso zzso on cell growth and differentiation in normal and zzso zzso
