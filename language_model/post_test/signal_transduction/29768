We have previously reported that zzso activates a zzso C that zzso zzso zzso which would release zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and that an zzso zzso from zzso zzso is able to inhibit zzso steroid production in zzso zzso In the present paper, it was found that zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso production, which indicates that an zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso On the other hand, we investigated the release to the zzso medium of the zzso zzso alkaline zzso by zzso We found that: zzso the released zzso appeared in the zzso phase after zzso zzso zzso consistent with loss of the zzso zzso the zzso C zzso zzso impaired the release of the zzso by the hormone and zzso two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 M zzso increased the amount of alkaline zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso releases alkaline zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to increase the release of alkaline zzso from zzso cells and this effect was inhibited by zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, it was found that a zzso sensitive zzso is required for zzso and zzso release of alkaline zzso and that incorporation of zzso zzso in zzso cells inhibited the release of alkaline zzso by zzso Our results suggest that zzso increases the release of alkaline zzso by zzso of a zzso C through zzso and zzso which would contribute to produce zzso It was also found that the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 2 M zzso increased the amount of alkaline zzso in the zzso medium of zzso cells more than in control cells, indicating that zzso also stimulates the zzso of zzso These data support a role of zzso and the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso
