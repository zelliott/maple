zzso of the terminal regions of the zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso pathway, which triggers expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso at the embryonic zzso However, it has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso does not directly activate expression of these zzso zzso rather, it zzso their expression by zzso at the embryonic zzso a zzso distributed zzso zzso In particular, it has been shown that zzso zzso regulates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso is zzso specifically at the poles of zzso stage zzso zzso the current model, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso can trigger zzso expression without eliminating zzso In addition, analysis of gene zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso unveil differences between the terminal and the central embryonic regions that are independent of zzso zzso zzso thought to be the only system responsible for zzso terminal zzso These data provide new insights into the mode of action of the zzso zzso zzso and on the events patterning the early zzso zzso
