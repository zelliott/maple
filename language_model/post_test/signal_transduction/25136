The initial phase of chronic zzso leukemia zzso is triggered by zzso protein zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A major zzso of zzso was recently identified as the zzso 62 zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we report complex formation between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso and the formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was also bound to zzso in zzso expressing zzso A small amount of zzso zzso complex was detected and this was due to binding of zzso to zzso that was bound to zzso In contrast, association of zzso with zzso or zzso was mutually zzso Both the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso were required for complex formation between the two zzso Neither the specific activity of zzso as an zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso of zzso appeared to be altered by zzso zzso However, the zzso complex was only detected in the zzso fraction of zzso transformed zzso zzso We propose that interaction between zzso and zzso zzso the ability of these two proteins to interact with other zzso binding zzso
