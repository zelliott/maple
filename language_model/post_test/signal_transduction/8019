zzso muscle zzso is mainly regulated by zzso of the 20 zzso zzso light chains zzso a process that is controlled by the opposing activities of zzso light chain zzso zzso and zzso light chain zzso zzso Recently, intensive research has revealed that various protein zzso networks including zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and have important roles in modulating smooth muscle zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we review the general background and structure of zzso and zzso our current understanding of its involvement in a number of cell processes including cell death zzso cell zzso and smooth muscle zzso zzso has been found to induce the zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso in a zzso manner and to regulate zzso activity directly through its zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso or indirectly through its zzso of the zzso zzso protein of zzso Future investigations of zzso function in smooth muscle will zzso focus on determining the mechanisms that regulate its cellular activity, including the identification of upstream signaling zzso the characterization of zzso zzso and regulatory zzso sites, and the development of specific inhibitor zzso
