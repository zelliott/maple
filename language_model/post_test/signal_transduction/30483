The deficits in zzso disease zzso stem at least partly from zzso zzso peptides generated from the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso may also be zzso zzso at zzso to yield a second zzso zzso zzso Previously, we showed that zzso of zzso at the zzso is required for the zzso seen in zzso transgenic mice, by comparing elements of the disease in animals modeling zzso with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso versus without zzso zzso a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the signaling zzso by which zzso contributes to these deficits remains to be zzso In this study, we identify a zzso zzso recently shown to bind zzso at the zzso and to contribute to zzso whose activity is modified in zzso mice, but zzso in zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we observed a significant increase in nuclear zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and or 3; zzso zzso in zzso of 3 month old zzso mice compared with zzso zzso an effect completely prevented in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, 13 month old zzso mice displayed a significant decrease in zzso activity, which was once again absent in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso of early and severe zzso subjects, there was a progressive and zzso reduction in active zzso compared with normal zzso Interestingly, total zzso protein was increased in early zzso subjects, but declined in moderate zzso and declined further, to significantly below that of control levels, in severe zzso These findings are compatible with previous suggestions that zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso and demonstrate that both early zzso and late zzso in the zzso zzso model require the zzso of zzso at zzso
