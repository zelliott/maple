We sought clinically relevant zzso zzso present in zzso zzso or in serum, that identified those patients with zzso arthritis zzso who subsequently develop zzso arthritis zzso 

Total zzso was isolated from highly zzso peripheral blood zzso T cells of 173 early arthritis clinic zzso zzso serum samples were also zzso zzso analysis of zzso samples was performed and differential transcript expression among 111 zzso zzso patients confirmed using real-time quantitative zzso zzso learning approaches tested the utility of a zzso model among an independent validation cohort presenting with zzso (62 zzso zzso zzso were performed using a highly sensitive zzso detection zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso identified zzso patients in the training cohort and predicted the subsequent development of zzso among zzso patients in the validation cohort zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso genes were zzso in the signature, particularly in zzso zzso zzso disease, providing a risk metric of similar zzso value to the zzso score in zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso levels of serum zzso 6 zzso (which signals via zzso were highest in zzso zzso zzso zzso and distinguished this zzso from zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso correlated strongly with zzso gene zzso 

The authors have identified zzso zzso zzso in zzso T cells during the earliest clinical phase of zzso which is most prominent in zzso zzso While highlighting potential zzso for early zzso the role of this zzso in disease zzso awaits zzso
