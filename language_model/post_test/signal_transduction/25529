zzso of zzso zzso can induce zzso and the growth and tube formation of vascular zzso cells zzso in zzso As the major zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso function, but its role in zzso zzso zzso proliferation and tube formation remains zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso proliferation and tube formation of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso A zzso zzso was delivered into zzso by zzso and zzso proliferation and tube formation capacity of zzso or control zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the changes in zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso as well as the expression of zzso and zzso were examined by Western zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso Our results demonstrated that 10 zzso zzso obviously induced the proliferation and tube formation in zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso which could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso functions to initiate zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso thus zzso zzso proliferation and tube formation in zzso
