zzso and zzso zzso factors are critical molecular zzso for terminal differentiation during zzso zzso zzso factor activity is often believed to drive commitment and zzso whereas zzso zzso signals have been implicated in the regulation of cell zzso survival, and zzso In zzso recent experimental findings provide direct evidence that zzso zzso can generate commitment cues via the zzso zzso zzso specifically, zzso signaling leads to zzso of the zzso factor zzso which then triggers zzso of zzso zzso In particular, activated zzso zzso two positive feedback zzso in the system through the enhanced expression of both inactive zzso and zzso the latter of which is zzso zzso by zzso Based upon this network architecture, we present a mathematical model of zzso zzso by zzso which zzso links a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our deterministic model offers insight into zzso relationships between zzso and several downstream zzso In addition to the survival signals that zzso provides, zzso analysis of our model suggests that zzso zzso during lineage commitment can also generate zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These zzso properties can induce a zzso characteristic during differentiation and provide zzso to the mature zzso The zzso also suggests a novel mechanism for achieving robust zzso in a purely deterministic manner without molecular zzso The zzso solution of a zzso minimal model is provided and the significance of each of the two positive feedback zzso is zzso through zzso zzso This network zzso or variations zzso may link other zzso factor pairs and may therefore be of general relevance in cellular zzso
