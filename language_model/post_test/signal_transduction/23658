Considering global climate change, the zzso of combined drought and heat stress is likely to increase in the future and will considerably influence zzso zzso Until now, little has been known about plants exposed to simultaneously occurring zzso and zzso zzso To shed some light on molecular plant responses to multiple stress factors, a versatile zzso test system, allowing simultaneous application of heat, drought, and virus stress, was developed in zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of single, zzso and triple stress responses by zzso and zzso analysis revealed that gene expression under zzso stress is not predictable from single stress zzso zzso cluster and principal component analyses identified heat as the major stress factor, clearly separating zzso from zzso zzso We identified 11 genes zzso regulated in all stress combinations as well as 23 genes specifically regulated under triple zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso plants displayed enhanced expression of defense zzso which was abolished in plants additionally subjected to heat and drought zzso Triple stress also reduced the expression of genes involved in the zzso disease response and increased the zzso protein response, which was not seen under single stress zzso These observations suggested that zzso stress factors significantly altered zzso mosaic zzso signaling networks, which led to a zzso of defense responses and a higher zzso of zzso zzso our zzso and zzso data provide a powerful resource to study plant responses during zzso stress and allow identifying zzso processes and functional networks involved in zzso interactions of plants with their zzso
