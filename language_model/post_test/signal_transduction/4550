zzso zzso multiple zzso of the zzso zzso system, acting at different levels and blocking the induction of host defense zzso Two viral gene products, zzso and zzso have been shown to act as decoy receptors of type I and type II zzso blocking the binding of zzso to its zzso Since zzso plays a major role in innate immune responses, in this investigation we asked to what extent the viral zzso of the zzso system impact the capacity of zzso zzso to activate immune zzso This was tested in a mouse model with single and double deletion zzso of the vaccine candidate zzso which expresses the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When deleted individually or in zzso the type I zzso and type II zzso zzso binding proteins were not required for virus replication in cultured zzso Studies of immune responses in mice after DNA zzso boost revealed that deletion of zzso and/or zzso genes improved the magnitude and quality of zzso zzso T cell zzso immune responses and impacted their memory phase, changing the contraction, the memory zzso the effect zzso and the functionality zzso For B cell responses, deletion of the viral gene zzso and/or zzso had no effect on zzso levels to zzso zzso These findings revealed that single or double deletion of viral factors zzso and zzso targeting the zzso zzso is a useful approach in the design of improved zzso zzso
