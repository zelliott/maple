Using a preparation of isolated rat zzso zzso at constant zzso artery pressure zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of three related zzso zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 10 zzso zzso tended to enhance zzso zzso zzso Higher doses zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of different zzso such as the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso inhibited zzso release and increased zzso vascular resistance with similar zzso These effects of zzso were blunted when calcium zzso were removed from the zzso zzso release activated by zzso (10 zzso zzso was also significantly reduced with zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective ETA zzso zzso only zzso whilst the zzso zzso zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso almost abolished the zzso zzso and zzso zzso action of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone did not affect either zzso flow or zzso zzso zzso rates in isolated zzso zzso These findings indicate that all three zzso peptides zzso inhibit zzso zzso from the zzso Most of the zzso and zzso zzso effect of zzso is zzso by zzso rather than ETA receptors involving a zzso signal zzso zzso Moreover, our results suggest that zzso released zzso do not contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso from isolated zzso rat zzso
