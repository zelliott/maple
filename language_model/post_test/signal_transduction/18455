In the last few years, several novel strategies have been proposed for the treatment of zzso arthritis zzso Among them, gene therapy is considered a promising concept bearing the potential of highly specific targeting of relevant zzso Early studies using gene transfer focused mainly on studying disease mechanisms, whereas recent research has put potential clinical applications to the forefront of zzso This has provided new answers to the question of how to deliver genes into the zzso zzso as well as which pathways to zzso Thus, significant progress has been made in the continued development of viral systems, including zzso and zzso as well as in the exploration of novel tools such as zzso zzso systems or zzso in combination with viral fusion zzso When potential targets for gene transfer in zzso are considered, two strategies have zzso the first focuses on the delivery of zzso zzso mainly zzso and zzso zzso to inhibit inflammation in zzso zzso Based on our growing knowledge about the zzso of zzso however, there has also been substantial progress in exploring approaches that aim at interfering specifically with signaling pathways involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The data from recent studies indicate the ability to selectively target specific disease processes by the differential expression of therapeutic genes in varying cell types and at different stages of disease, thus demonstrating the potential of gene transfer as an arthritis zzso
