zzso zzso is a highly regulated mechanism involving a complex zzso network of communication between zzso beta and delta zzso However, whereas the role of insulin in beta cells has been well zzso very little is known about its role in alpha and delta zzso Having recently demonstrated zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso expression in these three zzso cell types, our current study aimed to zzso the expression pattern of the multiple zzso involved in the insulin signal zzso cascade in human zzso beta and delta cells in zzso 

zzso samples prepared from single human zzso cells were subjected to zzso zzso 

Of zzso cells zzso zzso were alpha cells, zzso beta cells, zzso delta cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of expression of the insulin zzso cascade elements showed a zzso between zzso cell types, although at least one member of each protein family was expressed in the three populations of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso coding for zzso zzso protein zzso and the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso 1 zzso could not be detected in alpha cells, but were expressed by beta and delta zzso In addition, while the insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso were expressed with relatively low zzso in alpha and delta cells zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso their zzso of expression in beta cells were 50, 33, 33 and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that insulin zzso cascade elements in human zzso beta and delta cells have distinct expression zzso
