The small G protein zzso is a convergence point for multiple signals that regulate smooth muscle cell zzso NO plays a major role in the structure and function of the normal adult vessel wall, mainly through zzso of gene zzso This study was thus performed to analyze in zzso and in zzso the effect of NO signaling on zzso expression in zzso smooth muscle zzso In rat or human artery smooth muscle cells, sodium zzso or zzso induced a rise in zzso zzso and protein zzso which was inhibited by the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The zzso stimulation of zzso expression involved both an increase in zzso protein stability and stimulation of zzso gene zzso Cloning and functional analysis of the human zzso promoter revealed that the effect of zzso involved zzso of zzso and subsequent binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of NO synthesis in zzso rats induced a strong decrease in zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso and pulmonary artery associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso These effects were prevented by oral administration of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These results show that zzso signaling positively controls zzso expression and suggest that the zzso release of NO is necessary to maintain zzso expression and zzso functions in vascular smooth muscle zzso
