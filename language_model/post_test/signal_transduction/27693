The zzso signaling zzso is important for cellular zzso The current view is that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso upon zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain then zzso to the nucleus, binds to zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and acts as a zzso of zzso of zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso In this report we show that the zzso 3 zzso domain zzso in contrast to all other zzso zzso zzso is a poor zzso and in fact acts as a zzso by blocking the ability of the zzso 1 zzso to activate expression through the zzso and zzso zzso We present a model in which zzso 3 zzso interferes with zzso 1 zzso zzso at two zzso First, zzso 3 zzso competes with zzso 1 zzso for access to zzso and does not activate zzso when positioned close to a zzso Second, zzso 3 zzso appears to compete with zzso 1 zzso for a common zzso present in limiting zzso In conclusion, this is the first example of a zzso zzso that functions as a zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and shows that zzso zzso receptors have acquired distinct functions during zzso
