The zzso onset of zzso differentiation in the acknowledged zzso zzso zzso stem cell line zzso is accompanied by the immediate zzso of zzso Growth Factor zzso 3 zzso and a delayed response by zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso indicating an important role for zzso during the manifestation of the zzso lineage in this cell zzso zzso for zzso factors exhibiting a zzso capacity in zzso identified that the zzso containing zzso factor zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso was sufficient for differentiation into the zzso lineage in zzso and in zzso after transplantation into zzso A zzso zzso of zzso consisting of its zzso domain zzso interferes with zzso cartilage zzso These studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso a novel type of zzso factor for the onset of zzso in a zzso stem cell zzso A potential role for this zzso factor in zzso is further delineated from its expression profile in various skeletal elements such as zzso disks and the limb bud at late stages zzso zzso of zzso embryonic zzso
