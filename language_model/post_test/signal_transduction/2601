zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently zzso to zzso from human plasma and shown to be identical to zzso zzso stimulates zzso synthesis in human skin zzso and primary human zzso In zzso differentiation of human zzso to mature fat cells results in increased expression and zzso of zzso in the zzso These differentiated human zzso are also much more responsive to zzso than zzso The object of this study was to investigate the signal zzso zzso by which zzso causes zzso synthesis zzso to increase in human cultured zzso and zzso No evidence was found for a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso action was consistent with a protein zzso C zzso zzso in that: 1) the effect of zzso on zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) the effect of zzso and zzso were zzso with respect to zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 1 zzso both competitive zzso of the zzso site on zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso 4) zzso C zzso zzso which interacts with the regulatory domain of zzso also inhibited the zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso although in all cases the zzso of zzso zzso synthesis was zzso 5) zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and finally 6) stimulation by zzso caused an increase in zzso activity and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso effect at 30 zzso from the soluble zzso compartment to a zzso fraction zzso activity zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso Taken together, the data are consistent with the conclusion that zzso acts to stimulate zzso synthesis via zzso of the protein zzso C zzso
