Cell zzso is regulated by a variety of zzso pathways that depend on zzso zzso One such protein is zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso from within the zzso can affect processes outside the zzso such as expression of several zzso zzso most notably zzso and zzso In addition, changes in the expression level of zzso strongly affect zzso zzso of cellular zzso which is known to affect many zzso zzso While zzso has been localized to cellular compartments other than the zzso it appears that only the zzso zzso affects zzso zzso In contrast, zzso residing outside the zzso may be involved in contact zzso and other zzso zzso Here, we review the role of zzso in focal contact zzso stabilization, and zzso We propose that zzso may regulate zzso zzso by participating in an zzso zzso and in parallel zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso
