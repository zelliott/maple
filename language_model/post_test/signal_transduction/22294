The zzso cell responds to various forms of environmental stress by adjusting the rates of zzso translation thus zzso adaptation to the assaulting zzso One of the major pathways that control protein synthesis involves the zzso of the zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso at zzso zzso Different forms of DNA damage were shown to induce zzso zzso by using zzso zzso or zzso However, the specificity of the zzso zzso and the biological role of zzso zzso zzso in the DNA damage response zzso induced by zzso are not zzso zzso we show that zzso is the zzso zzso that responds to zzso induced by zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso two signaling pathways with opposing biological zzso More specifically, induction of zzso zzso has a zzso role, whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso promotes cell death in response to zzso We further show that the zzso effects of zzso zzso prevail over the zzso zzso by zzso zzso These findings reveal that zzso can be an important zzso of cell death in response to zzso through its ability to act independently of zzso zzso
