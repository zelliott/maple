zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from the zzso T cell line persistently infected with an isolate of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The infected zzso unlike zzso zzso zzso cells, no longer expressed the zzso marker and, after their zzso receptors were zzso had dramatically reduced zzso free calcium zzso zzso In one zzso zzso the zzso was not limited to the zzso zzso zzso of signaling since a reduction in zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso also was evident in this zzso zzso These results led us to test whether T zzso from animals infected with zzso had defective zzso responses prior to zzso changes in zzso levels or zzso The zzso responses to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso less in T cells from Walter Reed stage 2 animals than in healthy zzso This zzso was more pronounced in chronically infected animals progressing to Walter Reed stage zzso The responses of these animals could not be zzso even when combinations of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Both zzso T cells, which are not infected with zzso and the zzso T cell zzso previously shown to be the zzso of zzso infection in blood, had pronounced defective responses to zzso zzso Similarly, both zzso and zzso T cells were consistently unresponsive in chronically infected animals, again zzso that an indirect zzso rather than zzso infection per se, may be responsible for this immune zzso
