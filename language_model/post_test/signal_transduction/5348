zzso activated zzso 1 zzso signaling can play opposing roles in zzso either promoting zzso cell zzso zzso and inflammation or reducing zzso zzso due to activated protein C zzso zzso To further define this zzso paradox, we focused on the vascular effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso balance were combined with genetic mouse models to dissect the roles of zzso generated zzso and zzso during escalating systemic zzso Acute blockade of the zzso zzso with a potent zzso zzso revealed that zzso signaling increases zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso signaling and the zzso cell PC zzso zzso prevented vascular zzso and zzso or genetic blockade of this zzso zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued mice with defective PC zzso from vascular leakage and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were fully compensated by zzso 1 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso or by selective zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso indicating that zzso signaling contributes to setting the tone for the vascular zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and selectivity in zzso to zzso zzso zzso determine vascular zzso signaling specificity in systemic inflammatory response syndromes in zzso
