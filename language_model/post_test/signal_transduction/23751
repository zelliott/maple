zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key secondary zzso used in signal zzso in various types of sensory zzso The importance of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was deduced by the observation that multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and two presently known zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso We describe here specific zzso features of zzso signal zzso in the zzso zzso First, we assess the specificity of the sensory functions of individual zzso zzso We have previously shown that multiple zzso proteins are expressed in a zzso zzso manner in the functionally zzso zzso zzso and are required to sense distinct salt zzso Through domain swap experiments among three different zzso zzso we show here that the specificity of individual zzso proteins lies in their zzso zzso and not in their zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso proteins are also sufficient to zzso salt sensory responses to other zzso Both findings support the hypothesis that zzso proteins are salt zzso zzso Second, we identify a novel, likely downstream zzso of the zzso proteins in zzso signal zzso a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso show defects in zzso sensory zzso that are similar to defects observed in animals lacking the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso signal zzso which also requires zzso and zzso does not require zzso but requires another zzso zzso We propose that zzso may form together with two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso
