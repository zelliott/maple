zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell zzso We have previously shown that in T cells the zzso zzso zzso interferes with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after T cell zzso zzso zzso To further explore the involvement of zzso in T cell zzso we created a set of potentially dominant negative zzso zzso zzso individual or tandem zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like zzso zzso and zzso from an zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso element taken from the zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso of zzso was only inhibited by a previously described truncated form of zzso that cannot bind the zzso zzso but not by other zzso of zzso In contrast, several zzso zzso zzso had dramatic effects on zzso zzso Most interestingly, the zzso zzso domain had an zzso effect, whereas a zzso zzso containing only the two zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso induced synergistic zzso of zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso that contained the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins bound to truncated zzso zzso revealed cooperative binding of the two zzso zzso but no apparent differences between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not interfere with zzso zzso although it inhibited zzso and zzso zzso in the same zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso through a complex zzso function of its regulatory zzso and that its zzso zzso activity is zzso for this zzso
