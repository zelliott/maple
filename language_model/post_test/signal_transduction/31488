In previous studies we have shown that zzso growth factor zzso at zzso between 50 and 100 zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso event separates zzso zzso cell growth into a zzso zzso process, due to zzso of different signaling zzso 

zzso were incubated in zzso of zzso ranging from 5 to 250 zzso for 3 days, and cell proliferation was determined by the zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso 5, 100, or 250 zzso for 17 h were also zzso for zzso by DNA zzso Western zzso were performed on whole cell zzso prepared from cells incubated with zzso zzso zzso for 17 zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso 

A zzso zzso response was observed following incubation of cells with zzso Cell proliferation was increased by zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased by zzso 100 zzso and increased when incubated with zzso 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso only occurred after treatment with zzso 100 zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased at zzso zzso of zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso expression was at 50 zzso zzso At zzso zzso of zzso zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso cell growth induced by zzso exhibited a zzso zzso cell growth was increased at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but decreased at zzso zzso zzso was induced at zzso zzso zzso Each growth phase activated different signaling zzso
