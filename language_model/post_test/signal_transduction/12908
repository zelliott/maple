We have previously reported that lead zzso activates protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA synthesis in human zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the ability of lead to activate the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We found that exposure to lead zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso signal responsive zzso zzso as shown by increased zzso and increased zzso zzso This effect was significantly reduced by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso by a zzso to zzso and by selective zzso of zzso by prior lead zzso Lead was also shown to activate zzso zzso zzso and this effect was zzso by zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso DNA zzso as measured by incorporation of zzso into cell zzso The 90 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a zzso of zzso was also found to be activated by lead in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of DNA synthesis by lead in zzso cells may be of interest in light of the observed association between exposure to lead and an increased risk of zzso
