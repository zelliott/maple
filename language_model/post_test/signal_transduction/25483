We have previously shown that zzso signaling can promote melanoma zzso It has been shown that zzso signaling is antagonized by the protein zzso which has been implicated in zzso We show here that in melanoma cells, expressions of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso and signaling is decreased in high zzso zzso Moreover, in the presence of zzso we observe an increase in zzso remaining in the zzso zzso with an increase in zzso activity, and decrease in zzso zzso These effects can be inhibited using a zzso zzso In addition to its effects on zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso decreases melanoma cell invasive potential by a second mechanism that involves the zzso of zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso which we demonstrate is critical for melanoma cell zzso
