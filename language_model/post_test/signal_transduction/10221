zzso zzso a natural zzso product in plants of the zzso zzso including broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels zzso exhibits promising cancer protective activities, especially against zzso zzso in animal zzso We observed previously that zzso induced a zzso zzso arrest and strong induction of zzso inhibitor zzso expression and promoter activity in both zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso We showed recently that zzso zzso the expression of zzso gamma zzso in human zzso breast cancer zzso This novel effect may contribute to the zzso effects of zzso because zzso plays an important role in preventing the development of primary and transplanted zzso In this study, we observed that zzso activated the zzso signaling zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso activated the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso with zzso zzso produced an additive zzso of zzso zzso and of an zzso reporter and a synergistic zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso induced zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso factor 1, further evidence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced an additive zzso of cell proliferation and a synergistic increase in levels of major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso accompanied by increased levels of zzso of zzso proteins and zzso These results reveal novel immune zzso and zzso activities of zzso in human tumor cells that may contribute to the established effectiveness of this dietary zzso against various tumors zzso
