zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have evolved to zzso environmental and zzso signals zzso factors, zzso into zzso and programmed responses zzso zzso zzso Almost 20 years ago, it was discovered that zzso contain a zzso site in the zzso lobe that binds a zzso zzso zzso acid sequence known as the zzso or zzso zzso interaction zzso Recent crystal structures of zzso complexes are leading to a precise understanding of how KIM sequences contribute to zzso zzso In addition, new crystal and especially zzso studies are revealing how zzso outside the zzso KIM motif interact with specific zzso and contribute further to zzso selectivity and signaling zzso zzso In this review, we focus on these recent studies, with an emphasis on the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small angle X-ray scattering to investigate these zzso
