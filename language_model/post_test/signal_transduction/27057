The zzso zzso encodes a 95 zzso protein which is expressed exclusively in zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence has revealed the presence of a zzso 2 zzso domain, 2 zzso zzso a zzso region with similarity to protein zzso C, and a region highly similar to proteins with zzso zzso exchange activity on zzso zzso Recent work has shown that zzso is zzso zzso in response to stimulation of surface membrane receptors in a variety of zzso cell zzso zzso may play a role in zzso cell signaling by zzso zzso zzso pathways to zzso zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
