During spinal zzso development the zzso migration and survival of neural zzso and precursors is tightly controlled, generating the fine spatial zzso of the zzso In order to understand better the control of these zzso we have examined the function of an orphan zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in the developing chick spinal zzso zzso expression of zzso occurs zzso day 3 in the early zzso and is consistent with a potential role in either zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso approaches in zzso we show that zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso proliferation rates and zzso precursor numbers, resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso causes widespread suppression of zzso zzso zzso One potential target of zzso may therefore be zzso itself, since zzso can zzso it in zzso but alternative targets are also zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient to alter zzso zzso Instead, zzso leads to increased zzso and defective zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Furthermore, motor zzso precursor migration is specifically zzso zzso therefore regulates zzso during a window of spinal zzso development, with molecular targets most likely related to zzso zzso cell survival and cell zzso
