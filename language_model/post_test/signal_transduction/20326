Members of the zzso protein sorting 10 zzso family of receptors (including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play zzso functions in protein trafficking and zzso and zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been documented between zzso family members and the zzso coat complex, a key component of the zzso trafficking apparatus that sorts cargo from the early zzso to the zzso zzso In recent years, genes zzso several members of the zzso family of zzso as well as components of the zzso coat complex, have been implicated as genetic risk factors for sporadic and zzso dominant forms of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, zzso zzso zzso and Parkinson's disease, with risk for type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso In addition to their functions in protein trafficking, the zzso family proteins zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso can impact the zzso response to zzso zzso factor zzso by regulating zzso trafficking of zzso receptors to the zzso and direct control of zzso levels, while both zzso and zzso function as cell surface receptors to mediate acute responses to zzso This zzso and symposium will highlight the emerging data from this rapidly growing area of research implicating the zzso family of receptors and the zzso in zzso zzso trafficking signaling by zzso and in the zzso of zzso
