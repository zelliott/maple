Although the effects of zzso infection on snail host physiology or host responses on zzso development have been well described in the literature, very little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms and specific molecules responsible for zzso those zzso It is presumed that many zzso interactions are communicated through zzso events, in particular those involving zzso immune responses to invading zzso zzso zzso and migration through host zzso and zzso acquisition of host molecules either as nutrients or critical zzso zzso The intent of this chapter is to review current knowledge of molecules (both receptors and their zzso or zzso involved in molecular communication at the interface between zzso zzso especially the mother or primary zzso stage, and host zzso in intimate proximity to developing zzso Information to date suggests that the molecular exchange at this interface is a highly complex and dynamic process, and appears to be regulated in specific zzso Topics discussed will focus on snail cell zzso interactions with the zzso zzso and its secretions, host zzso and zzso zzso receptors and their related signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso surface receptors and zzso involved in the binding of soluble host zzso
