zzso is the primary fuel for most zzso Because the amount of available zzso can zzso zzso organisms must sense the amount available to them and respond zzso zzso gene expression is one of the major effects zzso has on zzso Two different zzso sensing and signal zzso pathways in the zzso zzso zzso for repression, and one for induction of gene zzso recently come into zzso What we have learned about these zzso sensing and signaling mechanisms might shed light on how other cells sense and respond to zzso
