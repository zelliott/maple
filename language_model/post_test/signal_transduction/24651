Since Ras proteins negotiate many zzso pathways leading to cell growth or zzso the regulation of Ras activity is vital to cellular zzso Ras activity, which derives from a collaboration between Ras and zzso is terminated by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a simple regulatory scheme zzso zzso signals control Ras activity via membrane receptors and zzso However, the zzso scenario is probably not so zzso In looking for factors which interpret Ras activity, researchers have been led to the same factors which also regulate Ras activity, namely the zzso zzso it may be that Ras proteins are actually regulators of zzso
