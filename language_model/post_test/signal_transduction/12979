Among the bacterial products known to activate the innate immune zzso is bacterial zzso This activity resides within the zzso zzso motifs of the DNA and is zzso using appropriate synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso zzso mice were shown to exhibit a zzso zzso DNA and zzso Here, we describe a model system to further characterize zzso and zzso interactions using zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cellular responsiveness to zzso but not to the other bacterial zzso Previous studies identified zzso zzso zzso here, we show that expression of zzso zzso favors responses to zzso motifs specific to mouse cells, and expression of human zzso favors zzso known to zzso activate human zzso Response patterns to various zzso motifs were parallel when cells containing an zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Here, we also show that zzso acts at the cell surface and engages an zzso signaling zzso that includes zzso zzso and zzso
