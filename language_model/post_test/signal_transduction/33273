The formation of zzso zzso was compared in zzso washed human zzso suspended in zzso solution containing 2 zzso calcium and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso (20 zzso and zzso (1 zzso resulted in zzso irreversible zzso and zzso zzso of dense zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused larger increases at 10 zzso than 20 zzso zzso in the formation of zzso zzso zzso measured as zzso zzso These increases were not significantly less than those caused by zzso (1 zzso However, whereas the labeling of zzso increased from zzso zzso with zzso with zzso it was much less at 60 zzso than that at 10 zzso The decrease was not due to degradation of zzso by zzso since it was not prevented by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso did not affect the zzso labeling of zzso zzso indicating that binding to zzso is not involved in the sustained zzso formation of zzso zzso The finding that the zzso formation of zzso was not dependent on zzso in the medium zzso zzso indicates that the transient zzso formation of zzso is not due to failure to cause zzso zzso The finding that formation of zzso was transient in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso indicates that the sustained zzso of zzso C caused by zzso may have roles related to later processes in which zzso zzso
