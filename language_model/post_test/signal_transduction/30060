zzso zzso zzso was recently suggested to be a possible zzso zzso in zzso zzso For the purpose of understanding its possible role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, we explored the potential effect of zzso on the proliferation of cultured zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso of rats and zzso protein zzso zzso as a signaling zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cells were cultured in zzso and the cells were divided into six groups: zzso control group, zzso serum group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso serum + zzso group, and zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso proliferation was measured by zzso zzso incorporation and zzso activity in the zzso was determined by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso increased zzso zzso incorporation zzso ( P zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso ( P zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso incorporation by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and reduced zzso activity by zzso ( P zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively ( P zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso could zzso suppress the proliferation of zzso through the zzso zzso
