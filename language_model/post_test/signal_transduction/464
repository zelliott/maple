zzso is a part of the zzso 4 signaling complex with an indispensable role in zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and thus a suitable target for the therapeutic zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso structure provides a foundation for rational design of zzso that bind to zzso and inhibit zzso zzso Since the zzso binding pocket of zzso provides little specificity for zzso we have investigated targeting the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso binding pocket of zzso zzso with affinity for the zzso pocket that contain a zzso group, which mediates zzso bond formation with the free zzso zzso of zzso were zzso Fluorescent compounds zzso acid and zzso zzso formed a zzso bond with zzso through zzso and inhibited zzso zzso Cell zzso was also inhibited by zzso compounds zzso originally targeted against cholesterol zzso transfer protein and zzso compound zzso zzso intake of zzso significantly inhibited zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha production in zzso The zzso group of zzso also represents the target of environmental or zzso zzso compounds that are produced in zzso
