To determine the pharmacology of zzso and zzso zzso recruitment and compare this to established human pharmacology of these receptors to identify evidence for zzso zzso biased zzso and zzso specific blockade by zzso 

The ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to activate zzso and zzso zzso recruitment was determined in zzso zzso zzso were obtained for zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso and mixed zzso zzso using zzso and compared to affinities obtained in competition experiments in human heart and by zzso analysis in human zzso zzso zzso dependence of affinities was compared for zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso order of potency was as expected for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were partial zzso zzso of zzso peptides by selective and mixed zzso appeared zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso was significantly more effective an inhibitor of zzso recruitment zzso by zzso compared to the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso full zzso and zzso tested behaved in a competitive manner, although affinities were lower than predicted from the competition binding experiments in left zzso 

These data suggest that the pharmacology of zzso and zzso receptors linked to zzso and zzso zzso responses was different and zzso appeared to show bias, zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso
