zzso is a major cause of cancer and may condition its zzso The deregulation of the zzso zzso zzso is implicated in several zzso zzso including inflammation and zzso zzso its targeting with zzso zzso drugs zzso and zzso selective zzso has been investigated for years with promising results at both preventive and therapeutic levels, zzso side effects and the limited understanding of the regulation and zzso of the zzso zzso compromise a more extensive application of these zzso zzso is bringing additional levels of complexity to the understanding of basic biological and pathological zzso The deregulation of signaling and zzso pathways by zzso mechanisms may account for new molecular targets in cancer zzso Genes of the zzso zzso are seldom zzso in zzso cells, but a large proportion of them show zzso expression in different types of zzso A growing body of evidence indicates that zzso zzso play a critical role in the deregulation of the genes of the zzso zzso This review summarizes the current knowledge on the contribution of zzso processes to the deregulation of the zzso zzso in cancer, getting insights into how these zzso may be relevant for the clinical management of zzso
