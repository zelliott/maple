The enlarged zzso in liver zzso is considered to play a role in the zzso of portal hypertension, but the zzso zzso and molecular mechanisms behind the phenomenon have not been zzso The present study aimed to examine the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and congestion, and to determine the status of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso of rats with liver zzso Liver zzso was induced by zzso duct zzso In rats with zzso duct zzso zzso zzso and control rats, zzso blood flow was measured using a laser zzso zzso and zzso blood volume was measured using a zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and its upstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso were also zzso zzso zzso blood flow was significantly decreased in zzso rats compared with control zzso zzso zzso blood volume was also decreased in zzso rats, while their total zzso blood volume, especially the zzso volume, was significantly zzso The expressions of zzso and total zzso and the zzso zzso ratio, were all significantly decreased in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso ratio and zzso concentration were also decreased in the zzso of zzso rats although the expression of zzso was zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is suppressed in the zzso of zzso rats, and may contribute to the measured decreases in specific blood flow and volume in the zzso of liver zzso zzso of the factors influencing the suppression of zzso in the zzso may shed light on how liver zzso results in zzso zzso zzso
