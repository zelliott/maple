zzso memory formation requires both gene expression and protein zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso is thought to be important in processes underlying long-term zzso To clarify the role of zzso in zzso aversive learning in young rats, we carried out behavioral pharmacology and Western zzso zzso On zzso day 11, zzso were infused directly into the bilateral zzso bulbs through zzso implanted prior to training in a classical conditioning paradigm with zzso odor and foot zzso On the following day the odor preference test was zzso After training, zzso animals spent significantly shorter time over the zzso odor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 6 h before or during training, however, prevented zzso aversive learning without affecting memory retention 1 h after zzso zzso scrambled zzso infusions had no effect on zzso zzso When infused 6 h after training, none of zzso had an effect on time spent over the odor zzso Using Western zzso we analyzed zzso in nuclear extracts obtained from the young rats after zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso were sustained from 10 to 360 zzso after the zzso pairing in animals which were subjected to both, in comparison with levels 30 zzso in animals which were subjected to odor only or no zzso Total zzso levels showed no differences among zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso and total zzso in the zzso zzso These results show that the synthesis and zzso of zzso are required for the acquisition of zzso aversive learning in young rats, and that this requirement for the zzso signaling zzso has a critical time zzso
