The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso and a major target of zzso The zzso gene encodes alternative transcripts that are initiated from at least two independent zzso The different transcripts of the zzso gene contain the same coding region and zzso region and different zzso regions that are highly zzso among zzso We report here that in addition to the production of the zzso zzso translation from an upstream, zzso zzso of the rat zzso gene produces a zzso acid protein zzso zzso An zzso zzso recognized a protein of the predicted size of zzso in zzso cells and rat zzso zzso of zzso transcripts by zzso led to increased levels of both the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, stimulation of zzso increased the level of the zzso protein via zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein suppressed the zzso zzso promoted by nerve growth factor and modulated the expression of several proteins that were implicated in the zzso zzso Taken together, our results show that the rat zzso gene encodes two distinct proteins zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso Our study reveals a new example of the complexity of the zzso zzso and provides novel insights into the function of zzso
