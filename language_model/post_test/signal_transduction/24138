Treatment of mice with a single zzso zzso zzso plus a brief course of zzso zzso to block zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso transplantation zzso Survival of zzso zzso in treated mice is zzso but skin zzso eventually fail unless recipients are zzso The nature of the cellular mechanisms involved and the basis for the difference in survival of zzso vs skin zzso are not zzso In this study, we used zzso knockout mice to investigate the role of zzso signaling in each component of the tolerance induction zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso When zzso signaling was eliminated in only the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso were rapidly zzso However, when zzso signaling was eliminated in the host, approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso signaling was eliminated in the zzso the zzso and the host, zzso zzso survived long term zzso zzso whereas skin zzso were rapidly rejected ( approximately 13 zzso We conclude that transplantation tolerance induction in mice treated with zzso and zzso zzso requires blockade of zzso signaling in the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso signaling is necessary and sufficient for inducing zzso zzso tolerance and is necessary but not sufficient for long-term skin zzso zzso We speculate that a requirement for regulatory zzso T cells in skin zzso recipients could account for this differential response to tolerance zzso
