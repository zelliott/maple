Our recent studies of zzso zzso expression signatures demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and were putative zzso zzso in human zzso Our aim in this study was to investigate the functional significance of zzso in cancer cells and to identify novel zzso cancer pathways and responsible genes in zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso studies using mature zzso were performed to investigate cell zzso migration and invasion in two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso To identify zzso molecular pathways and targets, we zzso gene expression analysis and in zzso database zzso zzso zzso were performed to investigate the functional significance of zzso target zzso 

Restoration of zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines revealed significant zzso of cancer cell migration and zzso Gene expression data and in zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso modulated the focal zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were candidate targets of the regulation of zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso directly regulated zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso was a frequent event in zzso The zzso acted as zzso zzso and directly targeted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cancer pathways provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for the zzso
