zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso blocks zzso gene zzso in mouse zzso zzso however, only zzso expression zzso the inclusion of zzso 16 in the mature zzso zzso This zzso event is crucial for a functional zzso protein and, therefore, for red blood cell membrane zzso This report demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso finger 1 zzso a member of the zzso motif zzso protein family needed for zzso gene zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that zzso is required for the regulated zzso of zzso 16 during late zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso approaches, we found that: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso and triggers cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required but is insufficient on its own to activate zzso zzso zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso whereas either zzso zzso or zzso of zzso expression is sufficient to activate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso triggers both the zzso and the zzso events independently of the chemical zzso Altogether, these data indicate that primary zzso zzso acts on late zzso differentiation through at least two zzso one of which requires zzso zzso and parallels the zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso
