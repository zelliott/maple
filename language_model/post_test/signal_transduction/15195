The zzso zzso cell zzso is the primary cell type in the liver responsible for excess collagen deposition during zzso Following a zzso stimulus the cell changes from a zzso vitamin zzso cell to an activated cell type associated with increased zzso zzso synthesis and increased cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has been shown to regulate several aspects of zzso zzso in zzso including collagen synthesis and cell zzso Using a targeted approach to inhibit zzso signaling specifically in zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso using a zzso model of zzso zzso An zzso expressing a dominant negative form of zzso under control of the smooth muscle zzso zzso promoter was generated zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in decreased zzso migration, collagen zzso and several additional zzso zzso while also promoting cell zzso zzso of zzso signaling was also associated with reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulated zzso signaling as well as reduced zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso to mice following zzso duct zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso deposition, including collagen zzso A reduction in zzso zzso including transforming growth factor zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 1, and zzso tissue growth factor was also zzso However, liver damage, assessed by zzso zzso levels, was not zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling in zzso during active zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition, including synthesis of type I zzso and reduces expression of zzso zzso These data suggest that targeting zzso signaling in zzso may represent an effective therapeutic target for zzso zzso
