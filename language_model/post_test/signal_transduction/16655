Recent data indicates that chronic inflammation of the zzso such as Crohn's or zzso colitis puts those individuals at heightened risk for zzso zzso In this study, we examine the effect of the inflammatory zzso zzso and associated zzso on zzso cell death zzso in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of detached zzso with zzso zzso zzso increased cell viability as well as induced zzso As zzso zzso receptors on zzso are coupled to zzso zzso we next treated cells with agents that promote zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which promoted zzso zzso as well as zzso We next treated detached zzso with specific zzso of zzso zzso or zzso which accelerated zzso To explore the mechanism of zzso zzso we next treated detached zzso with an zzso blocking zzso which dispersed zzso induced by zzso and an zzso expressing a dominant negative zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso Interestingly zzso prevented zzso of zzso induced by zzso but did not significantly reduce zzso This suggests that zzso zzso is important in both zzso formation and promoting viability but these are distinct zzso Taken together, these data support a mechanism zzso elevated zzso levels characteristic of colitis prevent zzso by zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The delay of zzso by zzso may be one mechanism by which inflammation may contribute to zzso
