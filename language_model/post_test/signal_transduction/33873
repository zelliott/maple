In response to carbon and/or nitrogen zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso either zzso or develop zzso Although the signal zzso pathways leading to these zzso changes have been extensively zzso how nutritional signals are integrated is not clearly zzso zzso of this study indicate that reducing zzso concentration from zzso zzso to zzso zzso causes an increase in the magnitude of zzso as well as a discernible reduction in the time required for zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso strain is overcome on zzso Low zzso also induced zzso in zzso but not zzso strain suggesting that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso deleting zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso Further, zzso of zzso suppressed zzso differentiation in zzso cells grown in zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso response of zzso zzso but not that of strains carrying the zzso zzso Increased zzso levels correlated with decreased zzso zzso zzso of this study demonstrate that zzso in response to nitrogen limitation occurs as zzso becomes zzso
