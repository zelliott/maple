zzso signaling has been found to be not only associated with an aggressive tumor zzso but also activated and functional during zzso zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate zzso and zzso expression and its relation to zzso features of primary and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was used to determine the expression and cellular distribution of zzso and zzso in 18 pairs of primary and corresponding zzso zzso tumors and 40 primary tumors without invasion or zzso 

Positive rate of zzso expression was zzso and zzso in 18 pairs of primary and associated zzso zzso tumor zzso while zzso in 40 primary tumors without invasion or zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso expression in all zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso between primary and matched zzso zzso was zzso respectively zzso and zzso 

These results suggest that zzso signaling might have clinical potential as a promising predictor to identify individuals with poor zzso potential and as a possible novel target zzso of therapy for zzso zzso
