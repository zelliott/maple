The mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso on normal human B zzso are not well zzso We addressed this issue by examining the effect of zzso acid on the cell cycle machinery involved in zzso zzso When zzso acid was administered to B cells zzso into mid to late zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso crude cell suspension zzso the zzso of zzso required for zzso entry was prevented in a zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso treatment with zzso acid at the optimal concentration of 1 zzso prevented zzso of zzso and effects were noted at zzso as low as 10 zzso Based on our results, we suggest that the rapid effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso is due primarily to the reduced expression of zzso E and zzso A in late zzso This could lead to the diminished zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities noted as early as 2 hours after addition of zzso zzso Furthermore, our results imply that the transient induction of zzso could also be zzso Thus, zzso acid induced a zzso but transient increased binding of zzso to zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the key events affected by zzso acid, such as zzso zzso zzso E zzso and expression of zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso This implies that zzso acid mediates its zzso effect on B zzso via the nuclear zzso
