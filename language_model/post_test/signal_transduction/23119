zzso identified as zzso a natural zzso compound found in certain herbs such as zzso zzso has been reported to exhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the possible existence of zzso zzso underlying zzso zzso and zzso in human oral cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso decreased cell viability zzso Meanwhile, the expression of tumor zzso zzso and a small group of its downstream zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of the signaling of zzso led zzso to lose its zzso effect and inhibited the expression of zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso had zzso potential accompanied with increasing zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso zzso and decreasing zzso zzso zzso Our present study zzso by using zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are downstream genes of zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso decreased the zzso cells viability zzso The expression of zzso and its downstream genes zzso and zzso were enhanced by blocking the zzso of zzso zzso in response to treatment with zzso Moreover, zzso zzso played a negative role in zzso zzso and zzso We give evidence for the first time that the novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso in human oral cancer zzso zzso
