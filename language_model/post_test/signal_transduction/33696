zzso stimulates zzso zzso however, little is known regarding the mechanism or regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso zzso signaling in human zzso smooth muscle cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso to enhanced green fluorescent protein and the zzso dye zzso zzso addition caused zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso human zzso smooth muscle cell line and primary human zzso zzso These effects were completely inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were unaffected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso cells were zzso with either zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso or small interfering zzso targeting specific zzso to assess the roles of this protein zzso family in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso with short interfering zzso zzso each caused zzso depletion of the targeted zzso for zzso but not zzso or zzso also prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso smooth muscle cells through zzso zzso receptors and that zzso recruitment is a key mechanism in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso signaling in human zzso smooth zzso These data provide insights into the in zzso regulation of this zzso zzso and may inform zzso functioning in zzso labor and other conditions involving zzso smooth muscle zzso
