zzso receptors and their zzso zzso are key zzso regulators of zzso guidance and can function in a variety of signaling zzso Here we analyze the genetic and cellular requirements for zzso signaling in a zzso zzso zzso guidance choice point, the zzso guidance of zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has both zzso and zzso roles in zzso zzso zzso Of the four zzso zzso zzso we find that only zzso has a major role in zzso zzso zzso guidance, and signals in both a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso expression and zzso requirements is consistent with a model in which zzso acts in zzso zzso interacting with zzso expressed on surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso are more strongly affected than right-hand zzso by loss of zzso zzso indicating a previously zzso zzso asymmetry in the requirement for zzso zzso By screening candidate genes involved in zzso zzso we find that the zzso zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to rescue zzso zzso guidance defects cell zzso Our results reveal new aspects of zzso signaling in a single zzso guidance decision in zzso
