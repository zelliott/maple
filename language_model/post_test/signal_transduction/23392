Bone zzso protein 2 zzso is one of the most potent regulators of zzso differentiation and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso are the major zzso for zzso receptors and, once zzso they are zzso in the nucleus regulating zzso target genes by interacting with various zzso zzso zzso proteins have been shown to interact through their zzso segment with zzso and this interaction is required for in zzso zzso In particular, recruitment of zzso to zzso sites is zzso dependent, and zzso factor may accommodate the dynamic targeting of signal zzso to active zzso zzso Previously, we have zzso by in zzso and in zzso experiments, that zzso zzso zzso which is important for the zzso responses of zzso in zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso is necessary for zzso induced nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso while zzso nuclear zzso and zzso was reduced in zzso zzso Based on these novel data, we conclude that the impaired nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso targeting with a zzso decreased expression of zzso markers and impaired bone formation in zzso zzso zzso
