zzso tumor zzso zzso is the most common pediatric zzso zzso and rated fourth in overall zzso among childhood zzso It is viewed as a zzso of differentiation failure in human zzso as it zzso the zzso of the zzso zone of the growing fetal zzso The cellular origin of zzso is zzso However, recent zzso genetic and zzso studies point to an early zzso zzso cell that zzso zzso transformation as the source for zzso In this context, classical zzso shares genes and pathways activated in zzso committed to the zzso zzso However, direct proof and characterization of the zzso initiating cell have remained zzso Novel zzso recently adopted from the cancer stem cell scientific field, including the analysis of sorted single human tumor cells, have been applied to zzso These have enabled the identification of cell zzso that show zzso terms of molecular marker zzso human fetal kidney zzso and are, therefore, likely to be derivatives of the same zzso Further zzso of the zzso cancer stem cell or the cell of origin in human tumors and in transgenic mouse models that generate zzso tumors may not only provide novel therapeutic targets but also shed light on the normal kidney stem zzso
