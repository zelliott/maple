zzso of zzso has emerged as an important form of protein zzso In zzso the zzso cells of the central nervous system, zzso basic protein zzso zzso are transported into cell processes and the zzso channels that zzso the zzso zzso This zzso movement is important for zzso and occurs in zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso grown on bed layers of zzso We have shown previously that this zzso zzso depends on zzso contact and is partially relieved in primary cultures that contain some zzso in addition to zzso and zzso We report here that soluble factors, zzso by zzso are responsible for zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Of several growth factors tested, only zzso growth factor zzso was effective in alleviating the zzso zzso Double zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso appears to mediate its effect via its zzso and zzso zzso zzso This interaction among the three neural cell types may play an important role in regulating zzso after zzso
