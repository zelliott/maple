The classical view of cortical information processing is that of a bottom-up process in a zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso evidence suggests that zzso effects play a crucial role in the processing of input zzso Not much is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these zzso Here we investigate a zzso inspired model of two zzso connected cortical zzso Each area receives bottom-up as well as zzso zzso This information is integrated by a mechanism that exploits recent findings on zzso zzso zzso This results in a burst signal that is robust in the context of noise in bottom-up zzso zzso zzso the influence of additional zzso information, zzso effects on the processing of bottom-up input can be zzso zzso In accordance with recent zzso findings, zzso zzso in zzso ranges is characteristically enhanced by zzso zzso The proposed scheme combines a qualitative influence of zzso directed signals on the zzso dynamics of zzso activity with a limited effect on the mean firing rate of the targeted zzso As it gives an account of the system properties on the cellular level, it is possible to derive several zzso testable zzso
