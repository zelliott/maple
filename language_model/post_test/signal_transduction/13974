A series of studies conducted 20 years ago, documenting the cardiac zzso zzso and its underlying signaling mechanism induced by zzso II zzso zzso and mechanical stress, showed a remarkable similarity between the effect of the zzso zzso and that of mechanical forces on cardiac zzso zzso studies confirmed the involvement of zzso mechanisms, including zzso release of zzso II in zzso cardiac zzso Recent studies showed that the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso is also directly activated by mechanical forces, suggesting that zzso receptors play an important role in zzso zzso cardiac zzso through both zzso and mechanical zzso zzso
