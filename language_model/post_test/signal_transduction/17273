zzso from plants of the order zzso are considered promising cancer zzso zzso However, their selective zzso on liver cancer has been barely zzso zzso in the present study, we systematically studied the zzso potency of zzso zzso zzso Selective toxicity was investigated by comparing its effect on liver cancer cells and their zzso zzso to normal primary zzso and liver tissue zzso Additionally, in a first assessment, the in zzso zzso of zzso was investigated in zzso Growth arrest at zzso and zzso induction was evident in all in zzso cancer models treated with zzso including populations with cancer initiating zzso This was found independent from zzso however cell death was delayed in zzso compromised cells as compared to zzso cells which was probably due to differential zzso only gene regulation zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso In normal zzso no zzso or necrosis could be detected after repeated administration of up to 50 zzso zzso In mice, orally applied zzso was well tolerated over 18 days of treatment for up to 50 zzso the highest dose zzso In conclusion, we could show here that the killing effect of zzso has a zzso selectivity for cancer cells over normal liver cells and its zzso even applies for zzso cancer initiating zzso Our study could serve for a better understanding of the zzso properties of zzso on human zzso cancer zzso
