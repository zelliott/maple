zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which zzso and multiples in zzso The molecular basis for this zzso interaction is poorly zzso zzso a signal zzso zzso in the zzso would allow this zzso to manipulate cellular gene zzso and this may aid in ensuring its zzso We demonstrate that in zzso infected with zzso zzso for 18 zzso zzso gene expression zzso through protein zzso A was unaffected under conditions where there was an impairment of protein zzso C zzso zzso gene zzso This selective impairment of zzso zzso gene expression was substantially zzso in zzso put in contact with zzso zzso zzso or zzso for only 1 zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso media was not sufficient to significantly impair signal zzso These data revealed that zzso zzso selectively impaired the transmission of information from the cell surface to the nucleus and that this effect is induced very soon after zzso zzso The zzso significance of this altered signal zzso in the zzso with respect to infection with zzso zzso was then examined by treating zzso with various protein zzso zzso prior to infection with zzso zzso that were treated with zzso zzso demonstrated an increase in the initial zzso of the zzso and carried heavier infection levels than did zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso with an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso did not show significant differences in the initial zzso of zzso but prolonged impairment of zzso resulted in a decrease in the level of zzso zzso Further experiments revealed that zzso proliferation was severely impaired by the zzso inhibitor but not any of the other zzso
