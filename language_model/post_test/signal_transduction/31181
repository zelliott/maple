zzso zzso zzso an zzso compound, is a potent zzso agent and improves zzso zzso in various models of zzso We have shown previously that zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso which may contribute as one of the mechanisms for the zzso effect of this zzso However, the upstream mechanism of zzso zzso zzso remains zzso zzso in this study, we examine the upstream events leading to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Since zzso is an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso and through enhanced zzso zzso may activate various protein zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the potential role of different zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Among several pharmacological zzso that were tested, only zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso almost completely blocked zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso specific zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, were unable to block the zzso zzso Moreover, efficient reduction of the level of zzso protein expression by zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with an increased level of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso However, this response was independent of zzso activity because in cells zzso a zzso form of zzso insulin response was attenuated while the effect of zzso remained zzso A role of zzso in zzso response was also zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso or zzso a zzso zzso as well as chronic treatment with zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso selective zzso failed to alter the zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso and zzso are required to stimulate zzso zzso in response to zzso in zzso cells and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which this compound exerts its zzso zzso
