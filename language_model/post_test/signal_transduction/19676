zzso is an zzso solid, and zzso zzso in zzso The conventional therapeutic zzso are mostly ineffective and thus new therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso are urgently zzso We examined the synergistic efficacy of combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso showed zzso decrease in cell viability and the combination therapy more prominently inhibited the cell proliferation in both cell lines than either treatment zzso zzso was confirmed zzso by Wright zzso zzso zzso analysis of cell cycle phase distribution and zzso zzso zzso showed increase in zzso DNA content and early zzso respectively, after treatment with the combination of zzso zzso was further confirmed by scanning electron zzso Combination therapy showed zzso of zzso zzso of Bid to zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso down regulation of zzso zzso and increase in zzso ratio to trigger zzso Down regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated suppression of zzso and survival zzso zzso release of zzso c and zzso into zzso indicated involvement of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso activities of zzso and zzso were also zzso Our results suggested that combination of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso and survival factors and increased zzso via zzso and zzso zzso pathways in both zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Thus, this combination of drugs could be a potential therapeutic strategy against human zzso zzso cells having zzso amplification or zzso
