The zzso pattern of blood vessels formed in zzso zzso has been described zzso but only recently have we obtained the genetic and molecular tools to address the mechanisms underlying these zzso This review describes our current knowledge regarding vascular patterning around the zzso zzso and presents data derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso The embryonic structures implicated in zzso vascular zzso the zzso zzso zzso and neural tube, are zzso Moreover, several molecular signaling pathways implicated in vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Data showing that zzso is critical to patterning the zzso zzso in frogs and zzso and to patterning the vascular zzso that forms around the neural tube in zzso is zzso A more complete knowledge of vascular patterning is likely to come from the next generation of experiments using ever more sophisticated tools, and these results promise to directly impact on clinically important issues such as forming new vessels in the human body and/or in zzso
