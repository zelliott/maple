It has been proposed that a localized calcium zzso signal at the growing end of the zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso formation in large zzso We have examined the possible role of a zzso signal in zzso zzso formation in the zzso zzso egg during the first zzso We were able to detect two kinds of zzso waves along the zzso zzso However, the zzso waves appeared after zzso zzso formation in late stages of the first zzso In addition, zzso was not affected by injection of zzso or zzso into the eggs at a concentration sufficient to suppress the zzso zzso Furthermore, even smaller classes of zzso release such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not occur at the growing end of the zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that localized zzso signals in the zzso zzso are not involved in zzso The two zzso waves have unique zzso The first wave zzso only in the region of newly inserted membrane along the zzso zzso On the other hand, the second wave zzso along the border of new and old zzso suggesting that this wave might be involved in zzso between two zzso
