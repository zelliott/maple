Several human zzso viruses zzso large zzso with often more than 100 zzso zzso zzso is determined by carefully orchestrated zzso activities of several different viral genes which trigger the zzso functions of the infected zzso zzso analyses of these complex interactions require zzso zzso zzso Here we have provided a laboratory manual for the reverse zzso cell zzso zzso alternative name: cell zzso as a zzso zzso zzso which has been successfully applied for the systematic analyses of single and combination effects of genes zzso by the human zzso on the zzso signal zzso zzso In order to zzso determine the effects of viral genes in zzso cells, protocols for the use of zzso as an indicator gene and for indirect zzso zzso of cellular target proteins have been zzso zzso provides a useful zzso approach to investigate systematically combination effects of viral genes on cellular zzso
