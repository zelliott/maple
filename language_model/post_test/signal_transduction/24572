Increased expression of the potent zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been demonstrated in airway zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso To identify its potential role in contributing to airway smooth muscle zzso zzso a characteristic feature of zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso was investigated in cultured rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso significant zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso cell number, with a mean potency zzso zzso mean effective zzso of action of zzso zzso zzso also acutely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter response was blocked by zzso C zzso with zzso however, zzso had no effect on the zzso action of zzso By contrast, the zzso cell zzso response to zzso was independently inhibited by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as blockade of the zzso zzso Moreover, in complementary studies, we found that administration of the stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso cell proliferation and that zzso evoked the release of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso these observations provide new evidence that 1) zzso is a potent zzso of zzso cells, 2) the zzso effect of zzso is associated with zzso of a zzso zzso G protein coupled to stimulation of zzso zzso and 3) the latter mediates zzso cell proliferation via the release and zzso zzso action of zzso The findings support a potential role for zzso in zzso the characteristic zzso of zzso in zzso
