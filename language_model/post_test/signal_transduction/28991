zzso zzso factor zzso promotes the survival of zzso zzso both in zzso and in an animal model of multiple zzso Here, we show that zzso protects mature rat zzso cultures selectively against the combined insult of the zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso but it does not protect against zzso stress nor against zzso induced zzso We further demonstrate that zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and the zzso 3 zzso zzso in mature zzso We show that zzso protection is independent of zzso of zzso signaling and zzso zzso expression zzso To gain further insight into the protective zzso a quantitative zzso approach zzso was applied to identify zzso expressed proteins in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso a shift in the cellular machinery toward a zzso execution program, illustrated by an enhanced expression of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These data provide further insight into the mechanisms of zzso protection of mature zzso
