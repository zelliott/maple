A key event in the pathways leading to zzso labor may be the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso in the fetal zzso and the zzso zzso agents, such as the zzso inhibit the zzso of zzso We proposed to investigate the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, a human cervical zzso cell zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso M zzso for 24 hours and exposed to 1 zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso Nuclear and zzso extracts were subjected to Western zzso analysis using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso were compared using zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso did not reduce the amount of nuclear zzso and did not interfere with nuclear zzso of zzso 

Our observations suggest that any possible role played by zzso in zzso labor prevention is not exerted through zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso
