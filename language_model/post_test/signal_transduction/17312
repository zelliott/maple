The response of zzso cells to zzso zzso localized zzso zzso of a zzso oxygen zzso zzso IX, zzso using a focused laser was zzso Upon zzso under these conditions, a localized population of zzso excited states can be produced with meaningful zzso spatial zzso the dimensions of the domain where the incident light flux is high enough for zzso zzso zzso are defined by the microscope zzso and by the zzso of light zzso diameter at beam waist of zzso zzso In turn, the dimensions of the zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso oxygen will likewise be zzso Most importantly, cell response zzso zzso signs of cell zzso zzso with the light dose delivered and the zzso domain zzso Thus, controlling light delivery can complement other techniques used to impart zzso spatial zzso in zzso studies of zzso zzso oxygen zzso Such controlled light delivery is also expected to be a particularly useful tool to study the so-called bystander effect in which a zzso cell can influence a neighboring cell through zzso signaling zzso
