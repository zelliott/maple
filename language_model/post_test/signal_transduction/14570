Our previous study demonstrated that long-term zzso consumption reduced body weight and improved insulin sensitivity in healthy male zzso In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of caffeine and zzso major components of zzso on zzso metabolism in zzso zzso diabetic zzso After a zzso administration of zzso caffeine solution, the rats exhibited reduced body weight, zzso and insulin resistance, without a change in food zzso regardless of an zzso zzso solution zzso In addition, caffeine enhanced zzso zzso and zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso This zzso action was explained by zzso an zzso growth factor 1 zzso signaling cascade via induction of insulin zzso zzso 2 in zzso In contrast, zzso supplementation deteriorated insulin sensitivity and attenuated zzso signaling in zzso which reduced the number of beta zzso zzso nullified the adverse effect of zzso on zzso zzso These findings indicate that long-term caffeine consumption can help alleviate diabetic symptoms by enhancing insulin sensitivity and zzso function through improved zzso signaling via induction of insulin zzso zzso 2 in mildly diabetic zzso
