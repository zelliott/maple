In cochlear development, the zzso signaling zzso is required for both the early zzso phase and a later lateral zzso zzso While it is known that zzso genes are important downstream zzso of zzso function in lateral zzso it is not known what genes function as zzso of the early zzso function of zzso We report that two members of the zzso gene family, zzso and zzso are expressed in the developing zzso at a time and place that makes them excellent candidates as downstream zzso of zzso during zzso zzso We also show that treatment of cochlear zzso cultures at the time of zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso mimics the results of conditional zzso zzso This treatment also reduces zzso and zzso expression by as much as zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso are the downstream zzso of the zzso function of zzso in early cochlear zzso
