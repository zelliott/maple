Given the zzso ability of zzso zzso in cerebral zzso zzso cells zzso and the invaluable role of zzso in the central nervous system, it is imperative to zzso the cellular pathways for EPO to protect zzso against brain zzso Here we illustrate that EPO relies upon the zzso of zzso zzso mating type information regulator 2 zzso 1) in cerebral zzso zzso to foster zzso during zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso which results in the zzso of zzso early membrane zzso zzso zzso and subsequent DNA degradation during zzso becomes a necessary component for EPO protection in zzso since zzso of zzso activity or diminishing its expression by gene zzso abrogates cell survival supported by EPO during zzso Furthermore, EPO promotes the zzso trafficking of zzso to the nucleus which is necessary for EPO to foster vascular zzso EPO through zzso zzso zzso through zzso of protein zzso B zzso and the zzso and zzso retention of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso through EPO zzso also zzso zzso pathways to prevent zzso zzso zzso c release, and zzso zzso 1, and zzso 3 zzso Our work identifies novel pathways for EPO in the vascular system that can govern the activity of zzso to prevent zzso injury through zzso zzso zzso and trafficking, zzso membrane zzso Bad zzso and zzso 1 and 3 activities in zzso during zzso zzso
