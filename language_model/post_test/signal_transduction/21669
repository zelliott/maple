In cell populations exposed to zzso radiation, the biological effects occur in a much larger proportion of cells than are estimated to be traversed by zzso It has been suggested that zzso cells are capable of providing signals to the neighboring zzso cells resulting in damage to these zzso This phenomenon is termed the bystander zzso The bystander effect zzso persistent, zzso zzso changes that result in delayed death and zzso zzso Because the bystander effect is relevant to zzso it could have significant implications for risk zzso for radiation zzso The nature of the bystander effect signal and how it impacts the zzso cells remains to be zzso zzso of the changes in gene expression could provide clues to understanding the bystander effect and could define the signaling pathways involved in sustaining damage to these zzso The zzso technology serves as a tool to gain insight into the molecular pathways leading to bystander zzso Using medium from zzso normal human zzso lung zzso as a model system we examined gene expression zzso in bystander zzso The zzso data revealed that the zzso gene expression profile in zzso cells is different from zzso bystander cells suggesting that the pathways leading to biological effects in the bystander cells are different from the directly zzso zzso The genes known to be responsive to zzso radiation were observed in zzso zzso Several genes were zzso in cells receiving media from zzso zzso zzso no genes were found to be zzso in these zzso A number of genes belonging to zzso zzso growth factors and several receptors were identified in bystander zzso Interestingly 15 genes involved in the cell communication processes were found to be zzso The induction of receptors and the cell communication processes in bystander cells receiving media from zzso cells supports the active involvement of these processes in inducing bystander zzso
