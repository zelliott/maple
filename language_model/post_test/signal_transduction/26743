zzso stimulation has produced impressive results in zzso clinical trials of patients with zzso Further progress will be facilitated by a better understanding of how the zzso zzso becomes activated and the subsequent functions of zzso immune zzso This review focuses on two aspects of this zzso The first is the recent recognition that signaling by zzso is initiated when the receptors are induced to cluster within the membrane of responding zzso This requirement for zzso zzso explains the zzso effects of certain zzso zzso and the activity of zzso but not zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso The second topic is the use of these zzso zzso to expand B cells zzso zzso As zzso cells zzso zzso cells are as effective as zzso cells, with the important difference that zzso B cells can be induced to zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso poorly if at zzso As a result, the use of zzso cells as zzso cells zzso promises to streamline the generation of zzso zzso T cells for the adoptive cell therapy zzso of zzso
