The main contributors to increases in zzso and tension are the entry of zzso through zzso channels opened by zzso or during action potential (AP) or zzso zzso and zzso release from store sites in the cell by the action of zzso or by zzso zzso zzso The entry of zzso during an zzso triggers zzso from up to 20 or more zzso store sites zzso as hot spots, using fluorescent zzso zzso waves then spread from these hot spots, which results in a rise in zzso throughout the zzso zzso transient releases of store zzso previously detected as spontaneous transient outward currents zzso are seen as zzso when fluorescent indicators are zzso Sparks occur at certain preferred zzso discharge sites zzso these and hot spots may represent zzso of zzso zzso scattered throughout the zzso zzso of receptors for zzso signal molecules generally zzso the cell while it increases the production of zzso zzso calcium store zzso and zzso (which activate protein zzso zzso of receptors for zzso signal molecules increases the activity of protein zzso through increases in zzso or zzso and often zzso the zzso Other receptors link to zzso zzso which trigger signal zzso interacting with zzso zzso zzso
