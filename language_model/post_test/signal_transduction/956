zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso enhances cardiac function through protein zzso A zzso zzso of target proteins involved in the process of zzso zzso zzso Experimental studies of the effects of zzso stimulation on zzso zzso have yielded complex results, including increased, zzso or unchanged zzso zzso zzso In this study, we extend a previously developed model of the canine zzso zzso describing local control of zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso release to include the effects of zzso zzso zzso of zzso effects on model membrane currents and zzso proteins yields changes of action potential (AP) and zzso zzso in agreement with those measured zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The model reproduces zzso observed zzso in zzso zzso gain in response to zzso zzso and predicts the specific roles of zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso zzso release channel zzso in altering the zzso and shape of the zzso zzso gain zzso The model also indicates that factors that promote mode 2 gating of zzso such as zzso stimulation or zzso of the zzso protein zzso II zzso may increase the probability of occurrence of early zzso zzso due to the random, zzso opening of zzso gating in mode zzso
