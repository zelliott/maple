zzso zzso mediates B zzso growth and differentiation and regulates cell death pathways by an unknown zzso Previous reports have suggested that protein zzso zzso activity is critical for zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso engagement on zzso B cells results in the rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor and the zzso of a reporter gene containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso In earlier studies, surface zzso engagement was found to produce rapid zzso of zzso accompanied by later induction of zzso which is not observed after zzso zzso Thus, these results define zzso zzso induction of zzso proteins in B cells and identify a novel and direct signal zzso zzso from the cell surface to the nucleus activated in B cells zzso through zzso that regulates a gene previously shown to be involved in zzso and programmed cell zzso
