The zzso growth factors zzso are well known zzso both in zzso and in zzso while functions in cellular differentiation have also been zzso Here, we demonstrate a new role for the zzso zzso in regulating head formation in zzso zzso Both IGF-1 and zzso along with their zzso zzso are expressed early during zzso and the zzso is present particularly in anterior and zzso zzso zzso of IGF-1 leads to anterior expansion of head neural tissue as well as formation of zzso eyes and cement zzso while IGF-1 zzso depletion using zzso zzso zzso drastically reduces head zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso signaling exerts this effect by zzso the activity of the zzso signal zzso zzso in the early zzso at the level of zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is required for head formation during zzso
