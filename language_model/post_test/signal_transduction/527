zzso zzso evidence suggests that vitamin D and its zzso are zzso However, the precise mechanisms and the molecular targets by which active vitamin D exerts its beneficial effects remain zzso The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of active vitamin D on rats with zzso zzso zzso zzso a model that is characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso rats were created by a single intravenous injection of 100 zzso zzso Changes in zzso pathology and zzso numbers were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to examine zzso expression of zzso transforming growth factor zzso and bone zzso protein zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was examined by zzso zzso and western zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso by gastric zzso at a dose of zzso zzso per day, starting 2 days before zzso injection and continuing throughout the zzso zzso A single injection of zzso induced massive zzso and elevated serum zzso on Day 7, both of which were significantly suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso of the zzso protein zzso revealed reduced and zzso zzso and this change was reversed by zzso In zzso zzso rats, zzso and zzso expression was zzso whereas that of zzso and zzso was zzso Treatment with zzso significantly restored zzso zzso while suppressing zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso can zzso zzso damage and zzso induced by zzso The beneficial effects of zzso on zzso may be zzso in part, to direct zzso of zzso zzso
