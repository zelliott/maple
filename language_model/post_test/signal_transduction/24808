The zzso body plan arises during zzso when zzso movements form the zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso and zzso derive from the marginal region of the late zzso and cells located zzso the animal pole form the zzso zzso Analysis in zzso zzso and zzso has demonstrated that zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso are essential for zzso development zzso but previous zzso studies have not established whether zzso signals control fate zzso zzso movements, or survival of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso signals are required to allocate marginal cells to zzso fates in the zzso zzso In double zzso for the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marginal cells adopt neural zzso whereas in zzso zzso cells at this position form zzso and zzso zzso zzso movements characteristic of developing zzso are also blocked in the absence of zzso zzso Because it has been proposed zzso that zzso of zzso signals promotes the development of anterior neural zzso we also examined zzso organization of the neural tube in zzso zzso zzso trunk spinal zzso is absent in zzso zzso despite the presence of more anterior and zzso neural zzso These results demonstrate that zzso genes are required for the allocation of zzso marginal cells to zzso fates and for zzso patterning of the neural zzso
