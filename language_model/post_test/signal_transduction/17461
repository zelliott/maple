zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is altered in age-related zzso disorders of the human zzso This study aimed to determine the effect of zzso on prostate zzso zzso that is zzso zzso zzso differentiation and expression of zzso factors in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were applied to primary human zzso zzso cells zzso Cellular proliferation was analyzed by zzso incorporation zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors were analyzed by zzso Western zzso analysis or zzso zzso differentiation was monitored by smooth muscle cell zzso and zzso growth factor binding protein 3 zzso and protein zzso The relevance of zzso and zzso signaling pathways was assessed by zzso zzso levels and zzso of zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso proliferation as well as zzso differentiation and increased the expression of the vessel stabilizing factor zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso or levels of zzso but attenuated zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso 

zzso promotes zzso proliferation and zzso differentiation and regulates expression of zzso in zzso zzso potentially via enhancing zzso zzso Thus, elevated zzso in the zzso of the diseased prostate presumably regulates zzso zzso by enhancing proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells and contributing to the zzso switch observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso represents a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso in zzso and zzso
