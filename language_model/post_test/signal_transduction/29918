zzso growth zzso is essential to maintain T cell zzso as illustrated by zzso inflammation in mice deficient in zzso zzso Despite the zzso importance, the mechanisms that zzso uses to regulate T cell expansion remain poorly zzso zzso signals through zzso zzso zzso zzso to activate multiple zzso zzso zzso including the zzso signaling zzso of the zzso protein zzso We used zzso mice to investigate a role for zzso in zzso production and proliferation in T zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso plus zzso steady state zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso labeling demonstrated that zzso inhibited entry of zzso zzso plus zzso cells into cycle cell, and this zzso was greatly attenuated in zzso T zzso In contrast, disruption of zzso did not affect zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso signals through zzso and zzso pathways to inhibit T cell zzso The inability of zzso to inhibit zzso proliferation of zzso T cells suggests that zzso is not the primary stimulus driving expansion of zzso plus zzso T zzso Thus, we establish that zzso signals through multiple pathways to suppress T cell zzso
