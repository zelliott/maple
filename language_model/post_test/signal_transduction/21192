The role of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the generation of zzso signals by zzso zzso receptors zzso was zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso were monitored in zzso human zzso cells using the dye zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso types II and IV, which are specifically inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an initial transient peak in zzso due to zzso of zzso from internal stores, followed by a sustained zzso in zzso that depended on the influx of zzso zzso and which was inhibited by zzso and zzso These zzso zzso signals were diminished to an equal extent by zzso the cells with zzso to 100 zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso influx and zzso from internal stores by about zzso producing a zzso effect at approximately 1 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso almost completely abolished zzso entry of zzso zzso through zzso channels, as revealed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also almost completely abolished zzso influx induced by zzso of the cells with 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulate both the zzso of zzso zzso and the stimulation of zzso influx that are induced by zzso zzso and indicate that the zzso influx of zzso occurs through zzso channels other than, or in addition to, the zzso calcium channels or zzso channels which are inhibited by zzso
