zzso zzso may zzso airway zzso Studies on zzso contraction and zzso zzso in airway smooth muscle are rather controversial and discrepancies exist regarding both zzso effects and zzso zzso We compared the effect of zzso zzso on rat trachea and zzso zzso zzso and both human and rat zzso zzso zzso and investigated the implicated zzso zzso 

zzso contraction was measured on rat zzso zzso and zzso isolated rings and human zzso isolated zzso zzso was monitored zzso using zzso 1 in freshly isolated and cultured zzso zzso zzso comparisons were done with zzso or zzso zzso tests for quantitative variables and zzso tests for qualitative zzso zzso were considered significant at P zzso zzso 

In rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso and zzso contraction, which zzso increased from trachea to zzso The response was transient and returned to baseline within zzso Similar responses were obtained with the zzso zzso analogous zzso zzso zzso at 15 zzso decreased the zzso zzso In human zzso the contraction was similar to that of rat zzso but the time needed for the return to baseline was zzso In isolated zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso zzso The zzso response was not reduced by zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso except in rat and human zzso By contrast, removal of external zzso external zzso and treatment with zzso decreased the zzso zzso The contraction induced by zzso zzso a zzso zzso was similar to that induced by zzso except in zzso where it was zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso delayed the return to baseline in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso a transient zzso response in human and rat zzso mainly due to zzso receptors and zzso zzso influx in addition with, in zzso zzso receptors stimulation and zzso release from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso influx occurs through zzso zzso channels activated by external zzso entrance through zzso zzso The zzso of the response cannot be attributed to zzso degradation but to zzso zzso and, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
