The zzso zzso signaling zzso plays crucial roles in developing and zzso zzso zzso is activated upon zzso zzso change of the zzso negative regulatory region zzso zzso a key zzso site zzso and zzso downstream zzso Thus far, the molecular mechanism of this signal zzso is not zzso However, strong indirect evidence favors a model zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, in tight association with zzso into the zzso cell, exerts a force on the zzso to drive the required structure zzso Here, we demonstrate that force applied to the human zzso zzso can indeed expose the zzso site and, crucially, allow zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insight into this process is achieved using atomic force zzso and molecular dynamics simulations on the human zzso zzso The data show zzso unfolding of its constituent zzso zzso zzso and HD zzso zzso at forces similar to those observed for other protein zzso with a zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso site is the first force zzso on the unfolding pathway, occurring prior to unfolding of any domain, and achieved via removal of the zzso zzso region from the HD zzso Metal zzso increase the resistance of the zzso zzso to forced zzso their removal clearly zzso unfolding at lower zzso The results provide direct demonstration of zzso exposure and zzso of the zzso zzso site and thus firmly establish the feasibility of a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
