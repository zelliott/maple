Patients with zzso type 1 zzso develop zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso which are often zzso and do not respond well to current zzso or zzso The goal of this study was to use comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify novel therapeutic zzso 

Nerve zzso cells and/or their precursors are the zzso cell types in zzso because of the loss of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso protein zzso zzso we created a transgenic mouse model, zzso expressing zzso active zzso in zzso cells and defined a zzso gene expression signature to drive a zzso factor zzso model analysis of zzso expressed genes in mouse and human zzso and zzso We tested functional significance of Aurora zzso zzso in zzso in zzso and in zzso using Aurora zzso short hairpin zzso zzso and compounds that inhibit Aurora zzso 

We identified 2,000 genes with probability of linkage to nerve Ras signaling of which 339 were significantly zzso expressed in mouse and human zzso tumor samples relative to normal nerves, including Aurora zzso A zzso zzso was dramatically zzso and zzso amplified in zzso but not zzso Aurora zzso zzso and Aurora zzso zzso blocked zzso cell growth in zzso Furthermore, an zzso selective zzso zzso stabilized tumor volume and significantly increased survival of mice with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso analyses combined with zzso testing has provided an effective method for identifying candidates for zzso zzso zzso Aurora zzso may be a viable treatment platform for zzso
