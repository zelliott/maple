T regulatory cells type 1 zzso zzso are excellent candidates for cell therapy in multiple sclerosis zzso The aim of our study was to assess the functional state of zzso cells and zzso signaling in patients with zzso zzso cells were induced in zzso by zzso with zzso zzso in controls and patients with zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and suppression zzso and the expression of zzso and zzso factors was evaluated by real-time zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso We found that the activity of zzso cells and zzso signaling is impaired in zzso patients since zzso cells isolated from zzso patients produced less zzso than those obtained from zzso Indeed, the zzso from zzso cells from controls did not suppress the proliferation of zzso zzso cells from patients with zzso Furthermore, the zzso signaling zzso was not fully active in zzso cells from zzso patients and these cells had higher baseline levels of zzso transcripts than zzso Indeed, after in zzso zzso zzso the expression levels of the zzso zzso and zzso genes were higher in zzso patients than in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was lower in controls than in patients after zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso regulatory function is impaired in patients with zzso
