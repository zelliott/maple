zzso is an zzso adapter protein that is a major zzso of the zzso zzso The function of zzso in normal cells is zzso In cells transformed by zzso we have previously shown that zzso is associated with two focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso could be involved in zzso zzso In two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso we found that zzso rapidly associates with zzso proteins after zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso cells was identified as zzso the cellular zzso of the zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso cell line, the major zzso zzso protein was zzso In both cases, this binding was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, although both zzso and zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso (but not zzso in zzso cells and of zzso (but not zzso in zzso zzso In both cell types, zzso is zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso through its zzso zzso and the zzso of these complexes does not change upon zzso zzso Thus, in different cell types zzso and its zzso proteins may form different zzso complexes depending on whether zzso or zzso is zzso after zzso zzso The shift in association of zzso and its zzso proteins from zzso to zzso could contribute to different functional outcomes of zzso zzso signaling in different zzso
