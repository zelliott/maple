zzso rhythms in zzso and physiology generated by the zzso nucleus zzso are zzso to the environmental zzso cycle via the zzso zzso How light is able to adjust the zzso rhythm is not fully zzso but induction of the two clock genes zzso and zzso in the zzso is believed to be important for the zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso a neurotransmitter found in zzso cells of the zzso is able to phase shift the zzso rhythm similar to zzso In the present study we show by means of an in zzso brain slice model and quantitative in zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso both zzso and zzso gene expression in the zzso during late zzso night zzso The zzso pathways responsible for the zzso zzso to the clock were investigated using zzso of protein zzso A and zzso C zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that both pathways are involved in zzso induced per gene expression and suggest that zzso is important for zzso phase shift late at zzso
