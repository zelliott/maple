zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cell zzso survival, and zzso In search of interacting proteins of zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and its zzso protein human Salvador zzso Using reporter zzso we observed that zzso of zzso and zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso in human breast cancer zzso cells, which was attenuated by the zzso of zzso Furthermore, using truncated zzso of zzso we observed that the C zzso of zzso is necessary and sufficient for the induction of zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso results in the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso 118 and 167 and zzso zzso zzso We then investigated the zzso of zzso and zzso expression with other tumor zzso using commercially available tissue zzso Among 40 breast cancer samples zzso zzso (24 out of 40) expressed zzso zzso among the 40 cases were zzso and zzso zzso a correlation between expressions of zzso with loss of zzso in breast tumor zzso This study suggests that zzso and zzso act as novel zzso of zzso and may play an important role in breast cancer zzso
