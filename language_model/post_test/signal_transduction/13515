zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso is zzso to the alpha zzso of G proteins involved in signal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso controls the zzso response zzso in zzso zzso Either zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso the negative control and leads to an arrest of cell growth in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso of rat G alpha s was previously shown to complement the growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso while not allowing zzso We have extended this analysis to examine the effects of the short form of G alpha s (which lacks 15 zzso acids present in the long zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and zzso G alpha zzso In addition, we have found that zzso able to complement zzso are also able to inhibit the response to zzso and mating when expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has a similar zzso zzso These results are consistent with a model proposed for the action of zzso as the alpha component of a zzso G protein in which the beta gamma component zzso activates the zzso response after zzso from zzso They suggest that the G alpha zzso able to complement zzso can interact with beta gamma to prevent zzso of the zzso but are unable to interact with zzso receptors to activate the zzso
