zzso are in physical association and functional cooperation with other membrane proteins that include receptors with scavenger functions, zzso zzso the family of zzso associated zzso spanning zzso proteins and possibly other less characterized proteins with a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and differentiation to zzso active scavenger cells are directly coupled zzso involving zzso as common zzso for a panel of zzso specific zzso which assemble a master cluster to coordinate zzso migration, scavenging and associated zzso pathways of the zzso and zzso route, and also processes involved in host zzso As zzso represent highly zzso cells that have major zzso and functional differences associated with specific patterns of zzso zzso the functional cooperation of zzso with scavenger receptors has to be related to specialized zzso of zzso and zzso as well as to zzso specific effects which mediate zzso zzso
