The interaction between T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed on T helper 1 zzso cells, and its zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso immune zzso However, it is poorly understood if and how the zzso signaling zzso is involved in immune escape in patients with zzso zzso zzso Here we studied the zzso function, and regulation of the zzso zzso in patients with zzso B virus zzso zzso We detected different levels of zzso expression on zzso cell zzso zzso including zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The highest zzso expression was on zzso in zzso zzso not in the adjacent zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was increased on zzso and zzso T cells in zzso as compared to the adjacent zzso and zzso T cells were zzso zzso and expressed surface and genetic markers for zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso on zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso of zzso T cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies demonstrated that blockade of the zzso signaling zzso zzso increased the functionality of zzso zzso T cells as shown by increased zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that the numbers of zzso zzso cells were zzso associated with patient zzso 

Our work demonstrates that the zzso signaling zzso mediates zzso zzso in zzso zzso The data suggest that this zzso could be an zzso target in patients with zzso zzso
