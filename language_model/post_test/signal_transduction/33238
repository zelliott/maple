The complex network of zzso that are involved in inflammatory and zzso responses plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso normal T cell expressed and zzso is a zzso that belongs to the zzso family; it is zzso for zzso T cells, it is produced by various cell types including zzso and zzso T cells as well as zzso and has recently been shown to suppress replication of zzso strains of zzso in zzso T zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso the zzso promoter region was analyzed by transient expression and zzso shift zzso We demonstrate that: 1) zzso promoter activity is zzso by zzso plus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso B, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2) the zzso promoter region contains four zzso B binding sites at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso 3) one site zzso is an zzso zzso factor of activated T zzso binding site that also has weak affinity to zzso B, and the most zzso site zzso also serves as a zzso zzso and 4) zzso on any of those zzso B sites or zzso of I zzso B alpha zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso markedly reduced the promoter zzso Thus, zzso B, a potent zzso zzso of zzso zzso is also involved in the expression of zzso a zzso that blocks infection by zzso strains of zzso
