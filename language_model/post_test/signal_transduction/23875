Large DNA viruses defend against hostile assault executed by the host immune system by producing an array of gene products that systematically sabotage key components of the inflammatory zzso zzso target many of the primary zzso of innate immunity including zzso tumor necrosis factors, zzso complement, and zzso zzso also manipulate a variety of zzso signal zzso pathways such as the zzso zzso Many of the zzso genes that disrupt these pathways have been hijacked directly from the host immune system, while others have demonstrated no clear resemblance to any known host zzso Nonetheless, the zzso targets and the diversity of strategies used by zzso to disrupt these host pathways have provided important insights into diverse aspects of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, because of their zzso nature, many of these zzso proteins hold promise as potential therapeutic agents for acute or chronic inflammatory zzso
