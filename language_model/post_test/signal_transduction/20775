In previous studies we have reported that zzso exerts a zzso effect on rat zzso zzso cells in zzso The effect of zzso appeared to be zzso through a protein zzso C zzso In this study, we have characterized the role of protein zzso C in the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, increased protein zzso C zzso from the zzso to the zzso an index of zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in 1 to 2 zzso following exposure to zzso zzso zzso before declining back to baseline level within 5 zzso zzso did not change total protein zzso C activity in the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso C, totally abolished the zzso as well as the zzso activity of protein zzso zzso The tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso However, prolonged treatment of cells with zzso inhibited their subsequent response to zzso zzso The response to zzso was also prevented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that protein zzso C mediates the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells, possibly through a zzso zzso
