In addition to zzso zzso mediate inflammation and clearance of bacteria from the zzso As with zzso zzso zzso interactions involve zzso zzso and release of zzso zzso zzso of the immune zzso zzso 2 zzso on the zzso surface, activates zzso zzso and causes zzso zzso and zzso zzso It remains unknown if zzso zzso by immune versus zzso pathways leads to the differential regulation of signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso release, and the zzso relevance of these potential zzso We investigated these processes after immune versus zzso zzso zzso We examined selected zzso pathways and found that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso differed dramatically between zzso Next, we investigated zzso zzso interactions by mass zzso zzso zzso specifically targeting zzso factor zzso zzso because of its function as a zzso protein whose binding partners have limited zzso Four zzso proteins were identified, two of which are novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was found to be altered zzso by immune versus zzso zzso Lastly, we studied the effect of zzso versus zzso stimulation on zzso release and observed differential release patterns for selected zzso proteins and decreased zzso zzso formation compared with zzso The zzso of zzso caused a decrease in protein release after zzso but not after zzso In zzso stimulation of zzso by either zzso or immune receptors leads to markedly different zzso responses and zzso protein release consistent with differential contribution to zzso and zzso
