zzso zzso approaches zzso DNA structure and zzso analysis should allow the identification of zzso of events relating to tumor zzso While different zzso zzso have been identified in zzso tumors, none have ever been correlated with the zzso This study focused on one zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso tumors, to identify molecular events associated with the aggressive and zzso zzso We combined a comparative zzso zzso and zzso analysis of 13 zzso tumors classified as zzso or zzso zzso loss within the p arm region of zzso 11 was detected in five of the aggressive zzso zzso loss in the zzso arm was observed in three of these five tumors, all three of which were considered as zzso based on the occurrence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso data showed that zzso loss impacted upon the expression of genes located in the zzso zzso Data filtering allowed us to highlight five zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the missing zzso region, potentially responsible for triggering the aggressive and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our combined zzso and zzso analysis zzso the importance of zzso zzso loss in determining the aggressiveness and zzso of zzso
