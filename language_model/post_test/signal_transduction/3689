zzso of smooth muscle cells is generally assumed to require zzso zzso of the zzso zzso light zzso However, we report here that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso a contraction of freshly isolated ferret zzso cells in the absence of increases in zzso zzso calcium or light chain zzso levels but in the presence of zzso of zzso protein zzso A protein at 36 zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso and was identified as the zzso zzso zzso by zzso An overlay zzso further confirmed an interaction between the zzso and zzso even though the zzso did not zzso zzso in zzso zzso also zzso from smooth muscle cells with protein zzso zzso High resolution digital zzso studies indicated that zzso redistributes to the cell membrane during zzso stimulation at a time when zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso are targeted to the zzso These results suggest a role for zzso as a signaling zzso possibly an adapter zzso linking the targeting of zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso to the surface zzso
