zzso plays a critical role in zzso by promoting zzso and zzso of zzso at sites of vessel zzso In the present model of zzso interaction, zzso is zzso via the zzso regulation of zzso zzso and zzso through the zzso VI zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study extends this model by demonstrating that engagement of zzso by an zzso sequence from within collagen or by collagen itself generates zzso zzso zzso signals that lead to formation of zzso and zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso The same events do not occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso of adherent zzso stimulates zzso zzso of many of the proteins in the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as plasma membrane calcium zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso spreading is dramatically inhibited in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and in zzso zzso Spreading is abolished by zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso of zzso to collagen via zzso generates zzso signals provides a new insight into the mechanisms that control zzso formation and may explain the unstable nature of zzso zzso and why loss of the zzso zzso complex has a relatively minor effect on zzso
