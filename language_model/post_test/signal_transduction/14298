In this work, we describe a single zzso zzso system containing both a zzso and a zzso expression zzso We demonstrate that a gene product can be zzso expressed from the integrated zzso and a second gene can be simultaneously targeted by a short hairpin zzso contained within the zzso both in zzso and in zzso and avian cell zzso We applied this system to zzso modify chicken primordial germ cell zzso lines in zzso and induce a reporter gene at specific zzso stages after injection of the zzso germ cells into chicken zzso We used this zzso to express a zzso zzso zzso during zzso migration to the forming zzso We found that zzso migration was retarded and cells could not zzso the forming zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso are thus essential for germ cell migration during early embryonic zzso
