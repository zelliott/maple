zzso virus zzso is a pathogen with a high impact on human zzso It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune zzso To efficiently zzso humans, zzso must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate zzso We have recently documented the zzso of type I zzso production by the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso complex in human zzso derived zzso cells zzso In the present report we identify the human zzso zzso zzso as a target of the zzso zzso zzso We characterize the mechanism of zzso of type I zzso production in primary human zzso by this viral zzso Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking zzso we show enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso that cannot be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso induced higher levels of type I zzso after infection with zzso Additionally, we show that zzso zzso is not able to degrade the mouse version of zzso a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of zzso in mouse cells, suggesting that zzso plays a key role in the zzso of zzso infection and spread in zzso
