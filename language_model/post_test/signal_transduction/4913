zzso cancer is an aggressive zzso with characteristic zzso course of disease and resistance to conventional zzso zzso is a zzso cell membrane protein that functions as a major zzso acid zzso zzso as well as key regulator of zzso zzso In this regard, we investigated the significance of targeting zzso on zzso zzso and mechanisms regulating response to zzso 

Cell survival was assessed by zzso and colony forming zzso Cellular levels of proteins and zzso was determined by Western zzso zzso The impact on zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso targeted interventions in zzso were determined using mice zzso model of the pancreatic zzso The regulation of zzso transport and radiation sensitivity were determined by transport studies and colony forming zzso zzso 

Our current studies reveal an encompassing model for the role of zzso in regulating the levels of fundamental proteins like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are of specific importance in the signal zzso from critical upstream signaling zzso that determine the zzso zzso and differentiation of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso depletion also caused marked and sustained zzso of established human zzso pancreatic cancer tumors in nude mouse zzso zzso zzso turned out to be a major regulator of drug transport along with contributing to the radiation resistance in pancreatic zzso 

zzso represents a mechanistically significant target for developing effective interventions in aggressive and zzso pancreatic zzso
