We previously reported that zzso caused rapid zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, two other zzso zzso family members, zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cultured rat cardiac zzso In this study, to zzso how zzso affects adhesive interaction between cardiac zzso and zzso zzso zzso we investigated the molecular mechanism of the zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by its increased association with adapter proteins zzso and zzso and zzso type zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso from zzso sites to the focal zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is one of the most important components in zzso zzso signaling in cardiac zzso and may play a pivotal role in adhesive interaction between cardiac zzso and zzso
