zzso kidney development begins with the outgrowth of the zzso bud zzso from the zzso duct zzso into the adjacent zzso zzso zzso Both a zzso and zzso zzso et zzso 2007) zzso have been zzso In zzso and in zzso the zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso one of the factors invoked to explain the limitation of zzso formation in the zzso regions of the zzso surrounding the zzso However, the exact mechanism remains zzso Here a previously described in zzso system that models zzso budding from the zzso was zzso to study this zzso Because zzso zzso A zzso zzso has been shown to prevent migration, zzso and zzso of zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso its activity in zzso and zzso portions of the zzso zzso was zzso The level of zzso activity was zzso higher in the zzso portions of the zzso compared to zzso portions, suggesting that zzso activity plays a key role in controlling the site of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and antagonists, we demonstrated that at various levels of the zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso outgrowth from the zzso by suppressing budding zzso This process appeared to be zzso zzso specific, and zzso by changes in the duct rather than the surrounding zzso In addition, it was not due to changes in either the sorting of zzso zzso cell death, or cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso on budding did not appear to be zzso by spread to adjacent cells via gap zzso zzso antagonism of zzso activity zzso zzso outgrowth from the zzso and resulted in both an increase in the number of buds per unit length of zzso as well as a larger surface area per zzso Using zzso analysis of gene expression in zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso had been activated revealed a nearly zzso decrease in zzso a zzso for zzso A smaller decrease in zzso a zzso for zzso was also zzso Using zzso zzso we were able to demonstrate that zzso regulated zzso budding but not zzso zzso for zzso zzso We also found that zzso was higher in zzso regions of the zzso zzso Treatment of isolated zzso with zzso suppressed budding and resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso The data suggests that the suppression of budding by zzso and possibly other factors in zzso zones of the zzso may be regulated in part by increased zzso activity, probably partially through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
