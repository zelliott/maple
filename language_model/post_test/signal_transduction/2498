We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso from zzso rats can zzso more zzso zzso than zzso from adult zzso In this study, we investigated the role of the protein zzso C zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso by rat zzso and we also evaluated zzso changes in this role with increasing zzso zzso After AM stimulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed a zzso increase in zzso zzso that was significantly more marked in zzso from zzso rats than in zzso from adult rats and that was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso A failed to induce an increase in zzso zzso by zzso zzso variations in zzso activity after zzso stimulation differed significantly between zzso rats and adult zzso zzso activity decreased in adult zzso zzso but remained stable in zzso zzso We therefore investigated age-related differences in the zzso zzso degradation of zzso which is thought to be zzso by zzso zzso used as a zzso zzso inhibited the decrease in zzso activity after exposure of adult zzso to zzso and induced a greater than zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly lower in AM extracts from zzso than from adult zzso The zzso implication of these zzso changes in zzso zzso regulation was demonstrated by investigation of zzso from zzso rats that showed a high level of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso with very low zzso zzso We conclude that sustained zzso activity is a key factor in the increased zzso zzso by zzso seen during the zzso period and is due, at least in part, to reduced zzso zzso
