zzso zzso alpha zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is the most frequently zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso holds great promise for cancer zzso However, it is challenging to develop zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso occur at two hot spot zzso an zzso cluster zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We recently discovered that zzso zzso domain zzso zzso but not the zzso domain zzso zzso directly associate with insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that disruption of zzso interaction between zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso the growth of tumors with such zzso The direct protein interaction between zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso may provide a more accessible target for developing novel precision cancer zzso
