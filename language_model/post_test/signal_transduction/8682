zzso are important regulators of cell fates with high clinical and commercial zzso However, despite decades of intense academic and industrial research, it proved surprisingly difficult to describe the biological functions of zzso in a precise and comprehensive zzso The exact analysis of zzso biology is complicated by the fact that individual zzso control many different cell fates and activate a multitude of zzso signaling zzso Moreover, although zzso different molecular programs, different zzso can be redundant in their biological zzso In addition, zzso with different biological effects can activate overlapping signaling zzso This prospect article will outline the necessity of continuous single cell zzso to unravel the biological functions of molecular zzso zzso It focuses on zzso and limitations of recent technical developments in fluorescent zzso imaging and single cell tracking allowing constant long-term observation of molecules and behavior of single zzso
