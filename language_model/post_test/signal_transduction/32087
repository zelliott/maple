In the zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso controls polarized zzso distribution and cell wall expansion in response to many different environmental and zzso zzso Its activity is essential for cell survival and adaptation under various stress zzso A recent study identified the zzso complex 1 zzso a central regulator in cell growth and zzso as a direct target of the small zzso This novel zzso extends the signaling network of zzso into many zzso processes and sheds light on how zzso cells coordinate polarized spatial expansion with mass zzso
