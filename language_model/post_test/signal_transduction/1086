In our continued studies on zzso releasing factor zzso zzso signaling in the skin, we tested functional activity of zzso zzso zzso g and h zzso after zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso and soluble zzso are translated in zzso into final protein products that undergo further zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso coupled directly to zzso zzso with the exception of an artificial zzso zzso with the zzso of 37 zzso acids between the zzso binding domain and the first zzso loop that was capable of producing zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso cell response with zzso attenuating and zzso amplifying zzso zzso production zzso by zzso Testing with plasmids containing the zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso demonstrated that only zzso was involved directly in the zzso regulation, while zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso higher reporter gene expression by zzso was observed than that zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone, being compatible with the zzso treatment by zzso zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that both protein zzso A and C can be involved in zzso signal zzso
