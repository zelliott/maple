Efforts have been made to develop a zzso strategy that selectively triggers zzso in zzso cancer zzso Previous studies showed that zzso the major pungent ingredient of red pepper, had differential effect between normal and transformed zzso As an approach to unveil the molecular mechanism by which zzso selectively zzso zzso in transformed cells, we investigated the effect of zzso in zzso and zzso cells of a common zzso parental zzso and zzso zzso zzso human breast zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso selectively zzso zzso in zzso cells but not in their normal cell zzso The zzso zzso which is dependent on zzso zzso involves the activity of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso treatment markedly activated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso while it zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso forms of zzso demonstrated a role of zzso and zzso but not that of zzso in zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Based on the present study, we propose that zzso selectively zzso zzso through zzso of zzso signaling molecules in zzso zzso zzso Taken in conjunction with the fact that uncontrolled zzso zzso is probably the most common genetic zzso in human cancer cells, our finding may be critical to the zzso potential of zzso and for developing a strategy to induce tumor zzso zzso
