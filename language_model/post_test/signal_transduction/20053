The first zzso zzso stem cells zzso emerge in the zzso zzso region of the zzso We have recently identified the zzso factor zzso as being zzso in this tissue specifically at the time of zzso zzso We now demonstrate that the production of functional and zzso zzso in the zzso is impaired in the absence of zzso Furthermore, we show that this effect on zzso generation is secondary to the role of zzso in the production of zzso the zzso of the sympathetic nervous system zzso thus making these molecules key components of the zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the recently described functional interplay between the zzso system and the zzso extends to the earliest stages of their zzso and highlight the fact that zzso development needs to be viewed in the context of the development of other zzso
