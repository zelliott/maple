Longevity is regulated by the zzso gene network in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a member of the insulin zzso family, zzso the life extension zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (a zzso zzso form specialized for zzso formation zzso The Age zzso is mutually zzso by two life extension zzso in the zzso gene and the zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso known to regulate zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso also zzso an zzso stress resistance zzso zzso which was also enhanced by the zzso zzso Similar to the Age zzso the zzso zzso was regulated by the genetic zzso of zzso signaling from zzso to the zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings led us to examine whether the zzso signaling zzso regulates the gene expression of zzso defense zzso We found that the zzso level of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso was much higher in zzso zzso than in the wild zzso Moreover, the increased zzso gene expression zzso is regulated by the zzso signaling zzso Although the zzso zzso itself did not display zzso and the increased zzso expression zzso the zzso zzso enhanced them in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in longevity in two ways: zzso composes the original zzso longevity program and the zzso longevity zzso These observations suggest that the zzso gene network controls longevity by regulating the zzso zzso defense zzso This system appears to play a role in efficient life maintenance at the zzso zzso
