In a recently developed human breast cancer model, treatment of tumor cells in a zzso culture with zzso zzso zzso or its zzso fragments led to a striking zzso and functional zzso to a normal zzso A zzso zzso zzso proved to be zzso The newly formed reverted zzso zzso a basement membrane and zzso zzso complexes, and zzso their zzso At the same time they zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stopped zzso zzso cells treated with the same zzso and injected into nude mice had significantly reduced number and size of tumors in nude zzso The tissue distribution of other zzso was also zzso suggesting the existence of intimate interactions between the different zzso pathways as well as zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells when treated with either zzso or zzso function altering zzso continued to grow, and had zzso colony zzso resembling the zzso tumor zzso This shows a significant role of the zzso zzso in directing polarity and tissue zzso The observed zzso were zzso when the cells were zzso and the zzso zzso Our results illustrate that the zzso zzso and its receptors dictate the zzso of zzso zzso cells, and thus in this model system the tissue zzso is dominant over the cellular zzso
