zzso zzso recruiting domain zzso molecules often function in the induction of potent zzso responses in order to protect zzso cells from invading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso domain 2 zzso serve as key factors in the detection of viral and bacterial zzso and in the subsequent initiation of innate immune signals to combat zzso zzso and zzso share striking similarities in their cellular zzso both zzso to membrane zzso in zzso zzso cells and both exhibit a close association with the zzso complex of polarized zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso not only zzso to cellular zzso and zzso zzso but that they also form a direct interaction that is zzso by the zzso of zzso and multiple regions of zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso regulates zzso nuclear zzso zzso signaling zzso by zzso and that zzso zzso regulates type I zzso induction by zzso We also show that the three main zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso form an interaction with zzso and zzso regulate its signaling to a greater extent than zzso zzso Our results show that in addition to their role in innate immune recognition, zzso and zzso form a direct interaction at zzso sites within cells and suggest that this interaction may impact zzso and zzso innate immune zzso
