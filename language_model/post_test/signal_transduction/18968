The zzso target of zzso zzso is a protein that is intricately involved in signaling pathways controlling cell zzso zzso is a natural product that binds and zzso zzso function by interacting with its zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the zzso solution structure of zzso and on further studies aimed at the identification and characterization of novel zzso that target the zzso binding zzso The biological activity of the zzso and that of zzso in the absence of zzso was investigated by zzso the zzso activity of zzso While we found that zzso binds the zzso domain and zzso the zzso activity of zzso even in the absence of zzso (in the low zzso zzso our most potent zzso bind to zzso with similar binding affinity but inhibit the zzso activity of zzso at much higher zzso However, we have also identified one zzso compound that is also capable of zzso zzso zzso we have identified compounds that can directly mimic zzso or can zzso the zzso binding from the zzso of the zzso activity of zzso As such, these zzso could be useful in deciphering the complex regulation of zzso in the cell and in zzso the zzso domain as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutic zzso
