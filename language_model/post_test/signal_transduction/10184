Individual cells need to discern and zzso zzso responses according to variations in external and internal zzso zzso and chemical compounds are sensed by zzso factors zzso which direct the corresponding specific zzso zzso We propose a zzso of the currently known zzso of zzso coli based on whether they respond to zzso incorporated from the exterior, to internally produced compounds, or to zzso When analyzing the mutual interactions of zzso the dominant role of internal signal sensing becomes apparent, greatly due to the role of global regulators of zzso This work encompasses zzso zzso bridging the gap between the zzso and regulatory networks, thus advancing towards an integrated network model for the understanding of cellular zzso
