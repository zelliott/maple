The treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was used to investigate the reaction of zzso selected genes of primary and secondary metabolism by zzso zzso zzso cluster analysis allowed distinctions to be made between zzso and zzso zzso regulated genes in a time course from 30 zzso to 24 zzso 97 and 64 genes were identified that were zzso or zzso more than zzso by zzso zzso zzso These genes belong to 18 functional categories of which zzso genes were by far strongest zzso Gene expression and zzso patterns of sulfur metabolism were zzso in detail, since numerous defense compounds contain oxidized or reduced zzso Genes zzso key reactions of zzso reduction as well as of zzso zzso and zzso synthesis were rapidly zzso but none of the known zzso induced zzso zzso zzso In addition, increased expression of genes of zzso defense proteins and of zzso involved in zzso metabolism was zzso In contrast, profiling of primary and secondary sulfur zzso revealed only an increase in the zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso The observed rapid zzso changes were thus regulated by a signal independent of the known sulfur zzso zzso These results document for the first time how zzso the regulation of zzso genes and plant defense are zzso This interaction is discussed as a new approach to differentiate between zzso and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
