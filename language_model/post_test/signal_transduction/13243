In zzso zzso encodes zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause enlarged zzso short zzso and altered zzso root zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso decreases both the induction and repression of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a negative regulator in zzso zzso zzso affects zzso induction of many previously characterized primary response zzso zzso that it might repress primary zzso zzso In addition, zzso also affects expression of multiple zzso zzso Light regulates expression of zzso suggesting a possible link between light and zzso response zzso
