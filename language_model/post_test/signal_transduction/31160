The actions of the zzso hormone zzso depend on two types of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso An important target of zzso is the zzso zzso zzso that controls the activity of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso type responsible for regulation of the zzso cells in zzso zzso we studied the levels of zzso zzso in zzso identified zzso cells of zzso mice zzso and of mice bearing targeted deletions of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso or of both zzso types zzso at five different time points of a zzso zzso Moreover, we analyzed whether zzso levels in zzso zzso cells also depend on intact zzso signal zzso zzso In wild type and zzso mice the percentage of zzso cells with nuclear zzso zzso varied significantly over a 24 h period, whereas in zzso and zzso mice no significant differences were found between the five time points zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso did not show rhythmic variation in wild type or zzso animals but wild type mice had higher zzso levels than zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso receptors are involved in the control of the activity state of zzso and zzso zzso cells of zzso
