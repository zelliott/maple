zzso regulates energy metabolism and skeletal muscle mass in zzso but the molecular mechanisms are not fully zzso This study investigated the response of skeletal muscle to zzso and testosterone replacement in zzso male zzso Using zzso analyses of zzso levels in zzso muscle, 91 genes were found to be zzso regulated by testosterone and 68 genes were positively zzso The zzso levels of the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso synthesis zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso regulated by zzso The zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and protein targeting to zzso were positively zzso These changes would be expected to increase zzso availability and sensing within skeletal muscle, increase zzso rate and zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso The observed positive regulation of zzso zzso by testosterone could be explained by the zzso of zzso and zzso as determined by Western zzso zzso prevented the zzso increase in zzso the decrease in zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso muscle, which were all correlated with zzso gene zzso These findings identify specific mechanisms by which testosterone may regulate skeletal muscle zzso and protein zzso
