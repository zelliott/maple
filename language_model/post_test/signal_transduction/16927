zzso channels, zzso and receptors constitute essential means for cells to maintain zzso and communicate with the zzso Investigation of their molecular architecture and the dynamic process of transporting zzso or zzso signals across the membrane barrier has been one of the frontiers in biomedical zzso The past decade has seen numerous successes in the use of X-ray or electron zzso in determining zzso structures of membrane zzso and in some cases, even snapshots of different zzso states of the same protein have been zzso But there are also many cases in which long-standing efforts to crystallize proteins have yet to zzso Therefore we have practical needs for developing complementary zzso tools such as zzso zzso and electron zzso for tackling these zzso This paper provides a number of key examples where the utility of solution zzso was pivotal in providing structural and functional information on zzso channels and zzso
