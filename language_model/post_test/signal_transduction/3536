zzso crest zzso induction is a long process that continues through zzso and zzso zzso In order to reveal additional stages of NC induction we performed a series of zzso where different known inducing zzso were taken along with the prospective zzso Interestingly the zzso marginal zone zzso is only able to promote the expression of a subset of neural plate border zzso makers without the presence of specific NC zzso We then zzso the zzso requirement for zzso and zzso signals for the zzso genes zzso and zzso compared to the expression of neural plate zzso and NC zzso Although the zzso is sensitive to zzso levels at early zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso Later, the zzso becomes insensitive to zzso levels at late zzso when NC markers require an zzso The zzso requires an zzso of zzso signals prior to zzso but becomes insensitive during early zzso stages when zzso requires an zzso of zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso is then important for the switch from zzso to NC at late zzso zzso In addition to revealing an additional distinct zzso event in NC zzso this work emphasizes the importance of zzso both timing and levels of zzso activity during the patterning of complex zzso such as the zzso zzso
