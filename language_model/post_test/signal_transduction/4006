zzso are known to play zzso roles in support of many zzso mechanisms in the central nervous system including host defense zzso Despite the ability of zzso to alter gene expression and cellular activity, their effect on zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso has not been examined in zzso In this study, an immortalized zzso cell line zzso was used to test the effect of zzso beta exposure on the zzso signaling zzso Similar to primary zzso zzso cells exhibit zzso zzso response to zzso and zzso leading to transient increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso Upon exposure of zzso cells to zzso beta zzso zzso for 24 zzso an increased response to the zzso zzso was zzso The increase in zzso zzso release could not be attributed to a shift in the zzso dose or an zzso of the time profile for the release of zzso Since the increase in response required a lag time of 4 zzso after zzso beta exposure, it is unlikely that this effect was due to a direct interaction of zzso beta with the zzso zzso On the other hand, an increase in zzso response could be observed in zzso cells exposed to zzso medium obtained after zzso beta zzso It can be concluded that exposure of zzso to zzso may lead to an increase in zzso zzso signaling activity and this may involve compounds zzso into the culture zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso
