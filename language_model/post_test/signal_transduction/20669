Our objective was to develop a system to simultaneously and zzso measure the expression levels of the zzso growth factor zzso family proteins in numerous samples and to apply this approach to profile the zzso family proteins levels in cancer and adjacent zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso against ten zzso family proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were immobilized on the surface of a glass slide in an array format to create an zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from patient's liver cancer zzso and adjacent zzso were then applied to the zzso The proteins captured by zzso on the zzso were then incubated with a cocktail of zzso detection zzso and zzso with a zzso detection zzso By comparison with standard protein amount, the exact protein zzso in the samples can be zzso The expression levels of the ten zzso family proteins in 25 pairs of zzso and adjacent zzso were zzso measured using this novel zzso array zzso The differential expression levels between cancer zzso and adjacent zzso were statistically zzso 

A novel zzso signaling zzso array was developed which allows the researcher to simultaneously detect ten proteins involved in zzso signal zzso with high sensitivity and zzso Using this approach, we found that the levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were higher than those in adjacent zzso 

Our zzso signaling zzso array which can detect the expression of ten zzso family members with high sensitivity and specificity will undoubtedly prove a powerful tool for drug and zzso zzso
