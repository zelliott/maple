Brain structural and functional integrity exquisitely relies on a regular supply of zzso In order to circumvent the potential deleterious consequences of deficient oxygen zzso brain triggers zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms - a phenomenon known as brain hypoxic zzso The highly zzso zzso family zzso of zzso factors is the zzso of the zzso response of the brain to zzso zzso acts as a cellular oxygen sensor and regulates the expression of proteins involved in a broad range of biological zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and thus, enables brain cells to survive in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso is intimately implicated in the clinical and pathological course of several neurodegenerative zzso Thus, two major questions can zzso Is zzso signaling and brain response to zzso compromised in neurodegenerative zzso If so, are zzso zzso a possible therapeutic strategy to halt or prevent the progression of neurodegenerative zzso This review highlights the current knowledge pertaining the role of zzso on brain response to zzso and its close association with the development of zzso and Parkinson's disease and zzso lateral zzso Finally, the potential therapeutic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against the symptomatic and zzso features of the zzso neurodegenerative diseases will be zzso
