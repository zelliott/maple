zzso zzso zzso cells in secondary zzso zzso play pivotal roles in tissue organization and immune responses by exhibiting specialized features such as the production of zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso process of zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a key for zzso zzso remains zzso Taking advantage of a zzso cell line established from mouse zzso zzso which can produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, by the engagement of zzso but not by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the details of zzso signaling events during the zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso pathways was essential for zzso zzso however, an excessive amount of zzso zzso complex was still insufficient for zzso gene zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso could induce a markedly high amount of zzso production, indicating that the downstream of zzso contains an additional key component of zzso We also found that protein zzso C activity plays a critical role in this process in addition to the zzso zzso Taken together, it is suggested that the maturation of zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso is accomplished by the cooperation of multiple signaling zzso
