We investigated the functional role of large-scale molecular segregation at the T zzso contact site during T zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso interaction markedly affected segregation of zzso and zzso from zzso Under these conditions, zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso production also were zzso However, early zzso signaling and T cell polarization toward zzso were zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso of a large-scale segregation of surface molecules and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso T cells, is to reinforce the assembly of the signal zzso cascade rather than favor zzso engagement and zzso
