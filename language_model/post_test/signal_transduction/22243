zzso blood zzso zzso T cells activated in zzso are able to induce expression of zzso necrosis zzso zzso in zzso via a zzso zzso zzso is achieved either with zzso zzso over an zzso period or zzso zzso using zzso zzso for 48 zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso played different roles in the generation of zzso function in these two types of activated T zzso In zzso activated T cells, zzso zzso is a negative regulator for zzso induced cell proliferation and has no significant effect on the acquisition of either the zzso function zzso of zzso zzso or production of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the acquisition of zzso zzso function and promotes cell proliferation and zzso zzso
