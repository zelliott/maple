The signal zzso for zzso relaxation followed by contraction in the isolated rat zzso was investigated by comparing the effect of blocking agents on the response to zzso and zzso The zzso C inhibitor zzso inhibited the relaxation induced by zzso but had no effect on the contraction to either zzso or zzso The same response pattern was observed when the zzso were zzso with zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso zzso influx, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso response to zzso and the contraction induced by zzso but not the contraction induced by zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso failed to respond when they were exposed to either zzso or zzso When the zzso were partly zzso (30 zzso zzso both zzso and zzso induced contraction, while the zzso response to zzso was almost completely zzso zzso (an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone inhibited the zzso but not the zzso response to zzso We conclude that the zzso response in isolated rat zzso to zzso involves two distinct zzso We propose that the zzso component is induced indirectly via zzso increase in zzso zzso in zzso cells with subsequent signals to the smooth muscle cells, whereas the zzso response is induced by direct effect on the smooth muscle zzso
