The zzso gene product zzso a nuclear zzso functions as a tumor zzso that is zzso in zzso and other zzso The zzso forms of zzso are observed in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, whereas the zzso forms predominate in S and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso may regulate progression through the growth zzso However, little is known about the zzso signals that regulate zzso of zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso early zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed as early as 1 h after treatment of zzso cells with zzso whereas complete shift to the zzso form was seen 4 h after zzso These effects occurred at zzso of zzso as low as zzso zzso with zzso effects observed at zzso zzso These effects were specific to zzso zzso as other zzso zzso and long chain zzso zzso as well as structural zzso of zzso failed to induce zzso of zzso Also, zzso of second zzso systems including protein zzso C, zzso zzso and calcium zzso as well as zzso of zzso protein zzso failed to induce zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso preceded zzso of growth and a specific arrest in the zzso phase of the cell zzso These studies, for the first time, identify an zzso zzso of zzso
