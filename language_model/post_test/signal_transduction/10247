zzso group I zzso zzso receptors zzso are densely expressed in brain zzso and are actively involved in various cellular zzso In this study, we investigated the role of group I zzso in regulating the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in cultured zzso We found that selective zzso of zzso induced a rapid and transient zzso of zzso In a series of studies to determine the mechanisms, we found that the conventional zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso release and zzso of protein zzso zzso were not involved in the zzso zzso Instead, zzso stimulation of zzso caused a dynamic zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which in turn triggered a downstream signaling zzso to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso specifically activated zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, we identified a novel zzso communication through the zzso pathway, which functions to regulate zzso zzso
