During the course of zzso development, the zzso zzso develops from a single zzso cell into a zzso that is composed of three distinct cell zzso Two waves of lineage zzso events take place, setting aside a zzso cell population, the zzso from zzso zzso The zzso that will form the zzso cells and germ line of the adult zzso remains zzso until zzso which zzso shortly after the zzso zzso The zzso remarkable property of zzso has been harnessed by researchers for decades through derivation of embryonic stem cells and zzso stem zzso Both types of cells can zzso indefinitely and still retain the ability of germ layer zzso However, a central conundrum to the field of stem cell biology is the extent to which these in zzso cultured cells represent their in zzso tissue of zzso In this review we discuss the development of in zzso zzso and compare and contrast the role of signaling pathways and downstream zzso factors in zzso stem cell types and their in zzso equivalent lineage zzso
