zzso growth factor 1 zzso has important functions in the brain, including zzso zzso zzso and neuroendocrine actions, and it also prevents beta zzso death of zzso zzso However, its functions in the synaptic zzso remain zzso Here we investigated the effects of IGF-1 on synaptic zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso using zzso patch clamp zzso zzso the zzso zzso with different zzso of IGF-1 for 24 h or 30 zzso significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso but had no effect on the frequency of miniature zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso currents zzso The mean zzso rise, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly affected by IGF-1, indicating that IGF-1 increased the probability of neurotransmitter release but did not zzso zzso zzso The effects of IGF-1 were zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso IGF-1 activated the zzso signaling zzso in cultured zzso zzso and the inhibitor zzso blocked the enhancement of zzso induced by zzso These results demonstrated the regulatory function of IGF-1 on synaptic zzso in zzso zzso and its underlying signaling zzso
