zzso expression of some members of the zzso zzso channel zzso has been associated with the development of zzso like zzso In particular, zzso levels are reportedly elevated in diffuse large zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso and cervical zzso However, whether such changes in zzso expression may be relevant to genesis or progression of cancer remains zzso Here we show that reducing zzso expression decreases proliferation of zzso cells, a cervical zzso cell zzso In this cell line, zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso degradation of zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells (a zzso cell line) increased cell proliferation and zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as an important, unanticipated regulator of the zzso pathway, where zzso signaling is frequently associated with zzso
