zzso proteins are a family of highly zzso zzso proteins that signal cellular responses downstream of transforming growth zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso originally identified as the candidate tumor zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso cell lines and interacts in a zzso manner with other zzso family members in both zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso Here, we used an zzso based on the restoration of zzso zzso responses in a zzso zzso cell line to characterize functional domain structures within zzso We showed that restoration of zzso zzso responses by zzso was inhibited by zzso with a zzso dead zzso type II zzso and that zzso zzso was blocked with zzso zzso zzso confirming the essential role of zzso in zzso zzso Using a series of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we identified a zzso acid deletion within the zzso region of zzso that is essential for the mediation of signaling zzso In addition, we showed that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso region, indicating that there is a distinct zzso domain within the N zzso of this zzso
