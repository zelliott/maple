G zzso receptors are membrane receptors that are involved in most of the zzso zzso The large variety of their functions arises from both the number of receptors and the formation of zzso or zzso having specific zzso The precise consequences of the zzso are not well understood yet but it has been proposed to affect the protein trafficking, the zzso binding and the zzso In this review, we explore the functional consequences of zzso zzso and zzso using as a model the zzso zzso which is activated by the zzso neurotransmitter zzso
