zzso zzso zzso is involved in human zzso zzso activity is known to be critical in cellular zzso and its level is modulated by regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso Since the zzso effect of zzso itself has not been ruled out, we examined that of zzso which has been classified as a selective zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation and zzso activity of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso like estrogen, clearly induced the zzso activity and human zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso Treatment with zzso for 5 days significantly induced cell growth, and either zzso with a zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso small interfering zzso significantly attenuated the zzso cell zzso zzso also induced the zzso of zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced both the zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso or a specific zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso activity and the association of zzso with zzso These results show that zzso induced the zzso of zzso activity not only by the zzso regulation of zzso but also by zzso regulation of the zzso of zzso and zzso and the association of zzso with zzso in zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso activity in vascular zzso cells might be one mechanism contributing to the potential zzso effect of zzso
