zzso 2 is a zzso protein that has an essential role in zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso rocketing can be induced by zzso zzso either alone or zzso when combined with zzso zzso or zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso Since various zzso are enriched on inwardly mobile zzso we examined whether or not zzso 2 binds to any of this class of zzso In zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso 2 binds to zzso zzso zzso but not to other zzso and zzso The affinity of zzso 2 for zzso zzso approximately 5 zzso is comparable with those reported for a variety of zzso proteins and is enhanced in the presence of zzso Although zzso 1 also bound to zzso zzso 5 did not, indicating that this is not a generic zzso zzso To test whether zzso 2 binds to zzso in zzso we zzso rat zzso leukemia cells zzso expressing zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at sites of zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso which has been shown to stimulate zzso synthesis on zzso through zzso of zzso 5 zzso These results establish a novel zzso specificity for zzso 2 consistent with a role in zzso the interaction between the zzso surface and the zzso zzso zzso
