The zzso for activated zzso zzso is a scaffold protein that is able to interact simultaneously with several zzso zzso It binds to protein zzso and zzso receptors in a regulated zzso Interestingly, zzso is also a constituent of the zzso zzso and a recent zzso zzso study localized it to the head region of the zzso zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso exit zzso zzso recruits activated protein zzso C to the zzso which leads to the stimulation of translation through the zzso of initiation factor 6 and, zzso of zzso zzso zzso therefore links zzso pathways directly to the zzso which allows translation to be regulated in response to cell zzso In addition, the fact that zzso associates with zzso receptors indicates that it promotes the zzso of zzso at sites where local translation is required, such as focal zzso
