Gene targeting is one of the most powerful tools to define the role of signaling molecules in animal development and disease zzso By using this technique, nearly 1000 knockout mice have been produced over the last two zzso zzso knockout mice, however, is a time-consuming zzso Also, an unexpected embryonic zzso sometimes prevents us from examining the function of the gene in specific zzso Here, we describe a convenient method to directly disrupt genes at both zzso in zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso These zzso knockout zzso cells have been shown useful to determine the role of the genes in the mediation of various cellular activities such as zzso zzso zzso survival, zzso and so zzso Furthermore, with the recent advance of in zzso differentiation techniques, it is now feasible to rapidly determine the role of specific molecules in particular zzso
