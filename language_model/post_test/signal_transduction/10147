zzso has been shown to mediate stress responses in the zzso The present study examined the zzso stress protein expression of zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed that zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso zzso The stimulation requires a minimal zzso concentration of 500 zzso and high concentration of zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso a significant increase of zzso expression from 2 to 24 zzso In addition, the zzso zzso expressions were inhibited by zzso for protein zzso C zzso and zzso D zzso and by zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso selective zzso zzso also decreased zzso membrane potential measured by flow zzso To further examine the proteins involving in zzso stress responses, we conducted zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso possess abundant zzso II zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso II shifting from oxidized form to reduced zzso Thus, we concluded that zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and decreased zzso membrane zzso In addition, zzso zzso expressed zzso II that might also serve as a protective mechanism to control the concentration of zzso oxygen zzso
