zzso a member of the zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso early zzso The zzso study of zzso and its signaling zzso has been a challenge, mainly because of difficulties in producing the protein in sufficient zzso We have developed a library of stable, chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso named zzso zzso and zzso show zzso signaling properties including dependence on the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso like zzso alters heart looping during the establishment of embryonic zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso as well as zzso induce zzso differentiation of human zzso stem zzso This zzso differentiation is shown to be more efficient than zzso zzso Interestingly, the crystal structure of zzso shows a backbone scaffold similar to that of zzso Our results show that these zzso zzso may have therapeutic implications in cartilage zzso
