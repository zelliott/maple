zzso are zzso proteins important to many biological zzso zzso genes zzso a family of zzso receptors that signal to the zzso compartment through the zzso protein zzso Limited information is available concerning the regulation of zzso at a zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner that appears to require the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso zzso causes a decrease in zzso mobility and accounts for a significant fraction of zzso zzso although additional zzso in the zzso tail are also zzso In addition, zzso that interfere with zzso function also interfere with zzso but these inactive zzso can be zzso when an active form of zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso significantly enhances zzso induction of neural crest zzso suggesting that zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso
