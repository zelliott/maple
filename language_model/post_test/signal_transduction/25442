zzso dysfunction is very common in diabetic zzso We assessed the changes in the zzso enteric nervous system using zzso specimens and zzso zzso from diabetic subjects and zzso zzso 

In control and diabetic zzso we determined the total zzso area zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined in enteric zzso isolated by laser capture zzso zzso zzso muscle recording was used to assess contraction and relaxation responses of zzso circular muscle zzso zzso in enteric zzso under zzso in zzso was determined by zzso zzso Western zzso and protective effects of zzso acid were zzso 

zzso subjects had higher zzso of lower gastrointestinal symptoms like zzso and zzso at baseline prior to zzso zzso zzso displayed significant decrease in zzso size due to enhanced zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in the diabetic colon zzso zzso zzso were significantly less than the control, indicating increased zzso zzso zzso circular muscle strips from diabetic subjects showed impaired contraction and relaxation responses compared with the healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso in enteric zzso was reversed by zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate loss of enteric zzso in the colon due to increased zzso stress and zzso which may cause the zzso disturbances seen in human zzso zzso may be of therapeutic value for preventing zzso disorders in zzso
