Low molecular weight zzso zzso has been reported to have zzso and zzso zzso To enhance the efficacy and minimize adverse effects of zzso a low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The LHP reduced zzso activity by about zzso of the innate zzso Liver zzso was induced by the injection of zzso zzso zzso in rats, and zzso or LHP zzso zzso body zzso was treated once daily for 4 zzso LHP administration prevented zzso liver weight loss and decreased the values of zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso and direct zzso LHP markedly reduced the zzso area compared to zzso Also, LHP zzso inhibited zzso or protein expression of zzso muscle zzso collagen type I, zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso compared to zzso in zzso liver zzso In addition, LHP decreased the expression of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso 3, which are all important molecules of the zzso signaling zzso The results support an LHP shows zzso effect in the liver via zzso of the zzso zzso as well as by the elimination of the zzso zzso
