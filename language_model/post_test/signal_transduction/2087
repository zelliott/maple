Until recently, vascular zzso growth factor zzso was the only growth factor proven to be specific and critical for blood vessel zzso Other zzso factors, such as the zzso growth factors zzso zzso growth factor, or transforming growth zzso had profound effects in zzso zzso But such factors were zzso in that they could act on many other cells, and it seemed unlikely that these growth factors would be effective targets for treatment of zzso cell zzso A recently discovered zzso cell specific growth factor, zzso has greatly contributed to our understanding of the development, zzso and pathology of zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The recent studies that identified and characterized the zzso and pathological roles of zzso have allowed us to widen and deepen our knowledge about blood vessel formation and vascular zzso zzso zzso in this review, we describe the biomedical significance of these zzso cell growth factors, the zzso in the vascular system under normal and pathological zzso
