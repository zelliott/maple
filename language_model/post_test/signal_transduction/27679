zzso zzso is characterized by changes in zzso zzso zzso composition and progressive loss of normal resident zzso In zzso inflammation there is now evidence that unscheduled zzso zzso cell zzso of zzso and other resident cells may mediate progression to irreversible zzso In the current study we examined the hypothesis that zzso components may differ in their capacity to support zzso cell survival by suppression of zzso Using a well-established in zzso model of zzso cell zzso we found that collagen IV and zzso components of normal zzso zzso protected rat zzso cells from zzso induced by serum zzso and DNA damage, by a zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso In contrast, collagen I, zzso and zzso which are zzso in diseased zzso failed to promote rat zzso cell zzso However, the zzso effect of collagen IV and zzso was not associated with changes in cellular levels of zzso regulatory proteins of the zzso zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso cell survival is dependent on interactions with zzso and provide insights into potential mechanisms by which resident cell loss may occur during acute inflammation and zzso zzso of the kidney and other zzso
