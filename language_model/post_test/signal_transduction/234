Human zzso zzso are the main zzso factor for cervical zzso zzso is the most prevalent high-risk zzso found in zzso zzso We studied the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso strongly suppressed the zzso cell zzso in the rat zzso cell line zzso This suppression was associated with the decreased expression of zzso at the zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells that express zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor recovered the zzso cell zzso together with the zzso of zzso at the zzso contact zzso Moreover, the suppression of zzso which is the element of zzso zzso factor, leads to the recovery of zzso expression and zzso cell zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso cell zzso through the zzso of zzso expression via the zzso and zzso signaling zzso
