Although the presence of a dominant zzso sorting signal ensures that the majority of newly zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors are delivered directly to the zzso surface in polarized zzso cells, a fraction of the receptors are also delivered to the zzso zzso Similar to most zzso membrane zzso the zzso zzso has an additional zzso that selectively targets molecules lacking a dominant zzso signal to the zzso zzso Although the zzso relevance of signal hierarchy is not known, alternative targeting may occur in different zzso cell types or during zzso The goal of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of membrane domain location on zzso zzso function, focusing on zzso zzso zzso signaling and DNA zzso Whereas zzso responsiveness was restricted to the zzso domain in zzso canine kidney zzso cells expressing a normal complement of zzso zzso zzso was effective if zzso zzso density was increased by zzso of an zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso which behave as dominant negative zzso in other cell types, were also responsive to zzso zzso The zzso truncated molecules appear to have at least two zzso first, to increase the local concentration of zzso at the zzso cell surface; and second, to facilitate zzso of the relatively few native zzso receptors normally located at the zzso zzso These results indicate that cell context is a critical zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso
