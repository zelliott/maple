zzso zzso are the most common zzso of the zzso system in zzso To understand the molecular genetic events underlying zzso zzso we have generated a mouse model that spontaneously develops zzso zzso zzso similar to human zzso cancer zzso zzso This zzso mouse harbors a zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified in a patient with resistance to zzso hormone zzso zzso mice exhibit highly elevated serum zzso hormone levels and increased zzso We have previously shown that zzso hormone is required, but not sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso cancer in zzso zzso However, whether the elevated zzso also contributes to the zzso zzso of zzso mice was not zzso To understand the role of zzso in zzso zzso we blocked the production of zzso by treating zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso and compared the development of zzso cancer in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso tumor growth was reduced by zzso in zzso mice as compared with zzso zzso Analysis by zzso labeling showed decreased incorporation of zzso in zzso tumor cells of zzso mice, indicative of decreased tumor cell zzso However, zzso 3 zzso showed no apparent changes in zzso of tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso studies identified a marked zzso of the zzso signaling zzso that led to decreased protein levels of zzso zzso thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso and a key regulator during tumor invasion and zzso was also zzso Thus, the present study zzso a critical role of zzso in promoting the zzso zzso of zzso mice via membrane signaling zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso drugs could be considered as possible therapeutic agents of zzso zzso
