zzso zzso binds to its type I receptors zzso which in complex with zzso accessory protein zzso zzso zzso various zzso signaling zzso We report here that zzso triggers the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a signaling complex and zzso its zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso This zzso complex consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 27 zzso acids of zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso that could not recruit zzso zzso to the zzso nor stimulate zzso zzso Moreover, zzso functioned as a zzso zzso that inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, had no effect on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that distinct regions of zzso zzso mediate the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, our results identified a functional region in the zzso zzso required for the recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso
