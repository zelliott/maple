The male zzso stem cells zzso of the zzso bug present an extraordinary structural polarity that is, to our knowledge, unequalled by any other type of stem zzso They consist of a zzso and numerous projections arising from the cell pole directed toward the zzso cells, the proposed niche of the zzso The projections can traverse a considerable distance until their terminals touch the zzso zzso From zzso until death, the zzso projections undergo conspicuous changes, the sequence of which has been deduced from observations of all zzso zzso zzso formation starts from zzso cell zzso showing zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso projections result from a process of growth and zzso zzso The newly formed projections contain mostly only free zzso other than a few zzso A stereotyped degradation process zzso in the projection zzso profiles of zzso often concentric, zzso of rough zzso zzso appear and turn into zzso bodies, whereas zzso become more zzso The zzso zzso zzso bodies appear, and zzso become zzso At the same time, the projection terminals are zzso by zzso zzso of the cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso bodies fill the zzso zzso which then zzso zzso new projections seem to zzso from the zzso of the zzso These zzso which are not synchronized among the zzso indicate that a novel type of signal exchange and zzso between the stem cells and their niche is involved in the regulation of zzso versus zzso division of zzso
