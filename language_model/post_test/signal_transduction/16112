zzso zzso was considered as a new effective drug candidate to zzso based on its zzso zzso It was reported that zzso inhibited various signal pathways which play a key role in production of zzso zzso Here, we examined the effect of zzso on the zzso of high mobility group box 1 zzso which is one of the zzso zzso zzso can reduce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in zzso and human peripheral blood zzso zzso and also reduce zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso before or after zzso zzso zzso could zzso inhibit the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso which are involved in zzso zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso inhibited classical protein zzso C zzso the effective zzso for zzso of zzso for zzso however, had no effect on zzso zzso activity, which is another mechanism known for zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso could inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso signaling zzso
