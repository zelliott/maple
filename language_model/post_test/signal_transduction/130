Stem cells are controlled, in part, by genetic pathways frequently zzso during human zzso Either stimulation of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso is sufficient to activate zzso zzso stem cells in zzso although the mechanisms by which zzso exerts these effects are not zzso Here we show that zzso directly zzso zzso zzso by serving as a zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein component zzso zzso reverse zzso interacts with zzso (also called zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and activates zzso reporters in cultured cells and in zzso zzso serves an essential role in formation of the zzso axis in zzso zzso zzso and this zzso in zzso zzso zzso as zzso transformations in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein from mouse gastrointestinal tract shows that zzso physically occupies gene promoters of zzso zzso These data reveal an unanticipated role for zzso as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
