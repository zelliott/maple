zzso receptors discriminate between different zzso molecules and activate signaling zzso that lead to immune zzso The specificity of zzso zzso signaling occurs by means of zzso proteins containing zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso functions have been assigned to four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we characterize a fifth zzso zzso zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked gene induction zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso expression by interfering zzso led to enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the fifth zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso
