Plants can recruit zzso zzso in response to egg deposition by zzso zzso sophisticated indirect plant defense zzso zzso by the Large zzso White butterfly zzso zzso on Brussels zzso plants zzso zzso changes that arrest the egg zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of an zzso of such an zzso plant zzso zzso activity was present in accessory zzso zzso released by zzso female butterflies during egg zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from virgin female butterflies were zzso In the male zzso zzso zzso females receive the zzso zzso cyanide zzso that reduces the zzso attractiveness for subsequent zzso We detected this zzso in the accessory zzso zzso released by zzso female zzso When applied onto leaves, BC alone induced zzso changes that arrested females of the egg zzso zzso analyses revealed a similarity in induced plant responses that may explain the arrest of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Thus, a zzso compound endangers the offspring of the butterfly by inducing plant zzso Recently, BC was shown to play a role in zzso behavior of zzso zzso by acting as a cue to facilitate zzso transport by zzso female butterflies to zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso fitness costs for the butterfly by both zzso zzso behavior and inducing plant zzso
