Several zzso scavenger receptors have been identified that bind and zzso modified zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso roles played by these receptors in human disease are still zzso data from zzso models of zzso have demonstrated a significant role in zzso foam cell development and vascular zzso development for two zzso the type A scavenger zzso zzso and the type B scavenger zzso zzso This review addresses the regulation and potential role of zzso in zzso foam cell formation and zzso with particular emphasis on the mechanisms by which zzso expression is altered in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso
