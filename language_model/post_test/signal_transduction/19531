We previously showed that zzso from zzso zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso knockout zzso mice had an enhanced zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate a direct association between free cholesterol zzso zzso raft content, and zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso to specific zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso compared with zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso regulates zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso by zzso of zzso raft cholesterol and zzso zzso to zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso more zzso in isolated zzso zzso Further, mass zzso analysis suggested raft zzso composition was zzso Although cell surface expression of zzso was similar between zzso and zzso zzso significantly more zzso was distributed in membrane zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited increased trafficking of the predominantly zzso zzso into zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso inflammation by reducing zzso zzso trafficking to zzso zzso by selective reduction of zzso content in zzso zzso
