zzso interference zzso has become a powerful tool for determining gene function and is used in a wide variety of zzso Since it is necessary to generate zzso zzso zzso as an zzso for zzso preparation of zzso zzso is somewhat cumbersome and time zzso especially for the thousands of genes used in a zzso zzso To overcome these problems, we have developed a more convenient zzso method in the zzso zzso using zzso DNA zzso as a model system for functional analysis in zzso zzso of zzso fragments zzso to an zzso gene into zzso cells can induce zzso gene zzso As it only requires zzso fragments zzso to a target zzso zzso fragments are enough to trigger gene zzso zzso gene zzso efficiencies of zzso have been achieved for transformed zzso In addition, simultaneous transfer of zzso fragments corresponding to multiple genes still has a zzso effect for individual zzso We term this approach zzso zzso
