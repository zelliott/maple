zzso is triggered by zzso interaction and fusion that initiate a transient zzso in the free zzso calcium zzso that is responsible for a series of zzso and cell biological events, so-called zzso zzso zzso egg zzso leads to the initiation of zzso program that culminates in the birth of zzso A growing body of knowledge has uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso transient zzso zzso to some zzso zzso in most animals so far zzso a second zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to play a pivotal role in inducing zzso zzso at zzso However, signaling mechanisms used by zzso to initiate zzso transient zzso have not been zzso To approach this problem, we have employed African clawed frog, zzso zzso as a model animal and conducted experiments designed specifically to determine the role of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso or zzso family zzso in the zzso egg zzso This review compiles information about the use of zzso zzso and zzso for analyzing signal zzso events in egg zzso Specifically, we focus on molecular identification of zzso zzso and the signaling mechanism of the zzso egg zzso that has been established zzso We also zzso recent advances in understanding the role of the zzso family zzso in egg zzso of other model organisms, and discuss future directions of the zzso
