zzso acid is an zzso acid present in neuroendocrine zzso of zzso and zzso including rats and zzso Here we investigated the effect of this zzso acid on the release of zzso and testosterone in the serum of humans and zzso Furthermore, we investigated the role of zzso in the synthesis of zzso and testosterone in the zzso and zzso of rats, and the molecular mechanisms by which this zzso acid triggers its zzso 

For zzso A group of 23 men were given a daily dose of zzso zzso for 12 days, whereas another group of 20 men were given a zzso For zzso A group of 10 rats drank a solution of either 20 zzso zzso or a zzso for 12 zzso Then zzso and testosterone zzso was determined in the serum and zzso zzso in zzso The effects of zzso on the synthesis of zzso and testosterone were zzso on isolated rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso and then the concentration zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso and of testosterone and zzso in the zzso cells was zzso 

In humans and rats, sodium zzso zzso an enhancement of zzso and testosterone zzso In the rat zzso sodium zzso increases the release and synthesis of zzso through the involvement of zzso as a second messenger, whereas in rat zzso zzso cells, it increases the synthesis and release of testosterone and zzso is implicated as second zzso In the zzso and in zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso which convert zzso into zzso The zzso and zzso possesses a high capacity to zzso circulating zzso from zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso acid is a zzso zzso acid occurring principally in the zzso zzso and zzso and has a role in the regulation of the release and synthesis of zzso and testosterone in humans and zzso
