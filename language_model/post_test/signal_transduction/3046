To clarify the effects of zzso zzso stress zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso on zzso zzso in rats with zzso fatty liver zzso induced by zzso diet zzso 

zzso zzso with advanced zzso was induced in rats by giving a zzso for 10 weeks zzso zzso A zzso diet zzso instead of zzso was given for the last 2 weeks to the experimental group zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammation were determined by tissue zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells and zzso stress were determined by zzso zzso or real zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso Expressions of zzso protein 78 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated to clarify the presence of zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso zzso were evaluated to clarify the states of zzso zzso 

zzso the diet from zzso to zzso triggered the reduction of fat in zzso a decrease in inflammatory response, zzso stress, and zzso The protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased significantly in group M compared with normal control group zzso zzso P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso the zzso expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were also increased significantly in group M compared with group N zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso or P zzso zzso while they recovered immediately in group zzso In contrast, the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions of zzso and zzso revealed no significant differences in three groups zzso zzso zzso The zzso expressions of zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso were increased significantly in group M compared with group N zzso zzso zzso while they recovered immediately after changing the diet from zzso to zzso 

zzso stress plays a role in the development and zzso of zzso fatty liver zzso induced by zzso however, zzso stress-related zzso zzso may not be the main mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso signaling may play an important role in zzso zzso in the zzso
