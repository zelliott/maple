zzso tract bacterial infections could induce abortion and are some of the most common complications of zzso however, the mechanisms remain zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso in the mechanism of bacterial zzso zzso pregnancy loss in a mouse model, and we hypothesized that zzso might play a central role in this zzso zzso increased PG production in the zzso and zzso from early pregnant mice and zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in the zzso but not in the zzso We also observed that zzso zzso prevented embryonic zzso zzso To study the possible interaction between zzso oxide zzso and zzso we administered zzso an zzso NO zzso zzso NO inhibited zzso zzso and zzso production in the zzso but activated their zzso synthesis and zzso zzso expression under septic zzso A NO donor zzso produced zzso zzso and increased PG levels in the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso was higher in the zzso than in the zzso zzso a zzso scavenger, did not reverse zzso zzso Our results suggest that in a model of septic abortion characterized by increased PG levels, NO might nitrate and thus inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso prevention by zzso zzso adds a possible clinical application to early pregnancy complications due to zzso
