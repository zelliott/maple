The zzso zzso family of zzso signaling proteins plays a critical role in regulating the development of several zzso and organ zzso The ability of zzso proteins to exert their biological effects is regulated by a series of zzso zzso These processes include an zzso zzso zzso addition of cholesterol and/or zzso and conversion into a zzso freely zzso zzso The processing of zzso proteins affects their trafficking, zzso and ability to signal over several cell zzso Here we review the current understanding of the zzso signaling mechanisms that govern the establishment of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso signal in the light of recent zzso
