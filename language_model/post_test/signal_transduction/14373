G zzso receptors zzso play pivotal roles in regulating various cellular zzso Although many zzso induce zzso zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso remains largely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 3) is a scaffold zzso with unknown biological zzso By generating zzso knockout mice using the gene targeting approach, here we show zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although it does not affect zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso of zzso alone is not sufficient to induce its zzso zzso We also found that zzso is physically associated with zzso and zzso zzso of an unknown zzso that associates with zzso likely by linking zzso to zzso zzso we found zzso zzso also abrogates zzso zzso zzso Together, our results provide the genetic evidence that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso
