zzso sclerosis complex zzso is an zzso dominant disorder zzso by the development of zzso in a variety of zzso and zzso The disease is caused by zzso in either the zzso gene on zzso zzso or the zzso gene on zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene products, zzso and zzso form a protein complex that zzso signal zzso to the downstream zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso Recently it has been shown that zzso zzso to the zzso gene can cause zzso 

We have used in zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effects on zzso function of zzso zzso zzso submitted to the zzso Open Variation zzso 

We identified specific zzso between zzso acids 50 and 190 in the zzso region of zzso that result in reduced steady state levels of the protein and lead to increased zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso acid zzso within the zzso region of zzso are important for zzso function and for maintaining the activity of the zzso zzso
