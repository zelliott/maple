zzso of growth hormone zzso from the zzso is regulated by binding zzso hormone zzso to its zzso zzso zzso one of the members of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso of zzso have been reported to regulate zzso trafficking and function of the zzso however, no functionally significant protein associated with zzso has been zzso We have identified a protein interacting with zzso 1 zzso as a binding partner of zzso In zzso binding zzso revealed the zzso of zzso and the last four zzso acid zzso of zzso were prerequisite for the zzso Further, in zzso association of these proteins was zzso zzso data of a stable cell line expressing zzso with or without zzso suggested the zzso of zzso promoted cell surface expression of zzso and zzso affected the zzso of the cell surface expression of zzso Furthermore, zzso production zzso showed the zzso of zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and the interaction of zzso with zzso may influence zzso of the signal response after zzso zzso Thus, the interaction of the zzso of zzso with zzso has a profound role in regulating the trafficking and the signaling of zzso zzso zzso available only at zzso
