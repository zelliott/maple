Human zzso virus type 1 zzso can establish zzso infection following zzso integration into the host zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso and other zzso but the signal zzso pathways that regulate the switch from zzso to productive infection have not been zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a central role in linking signals at the cell surface to zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso infected zzso zzso was activated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso infected zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression by these stimuli was inhibited by zzso and zzso which are specific zzso of zzso zzso Studies using zzso active zzso or zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso activates the zzso long terminal repeat zzso through the zzso zzso Most zzso zzso activated zzso via a zzso pathway, indicating that zzso of zzso is not sufficient to explain the zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso In contrast, all of the stimuli activated zzso via a zzso zzso zzso and zzso components zzso and zzso were shown to physically associate by zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso acts by stimulating zzso and a subsequent physical and functional interaction of zzso with zzso resulting in a complex that zzso zzso the zzso zzso These results define a mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso replication in zzso infected cells and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso reservoirs of zzso
