Our previous studies on alpha zzso signaling suggested that zzso is a signal zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Studies using the alpha zzso zzso complexes from various zzso and species revealed that the intensity zzso of the zzso proteins resulting from zzso the alpha zzso was significantly attenuated by zzso The molecular masses of zzso proteins were 74 zzso in rat heart and liver, 77 zzso in dog heart, 78 zzso zzso zzso in bovine heart and liver, and 80 zzso in human zzso Supporting these zzso a specific zzso to zzso alpha not only recognized these zzso proteins in the zzso complex zzso but also zzso alpha zzso indicating a tight association of these zzso proteins with the alpha zzso These results also demonstrate that functional and structural similarities exist among these zzso zzso Additionally, one of the identified zzso zzso zzso was zzso from bovine zzso zzso consisted of the zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso
