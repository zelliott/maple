In the case of viral infection, various viral proteins and genetic components are zzso in the zzso The former viral proteins may be captured by immature zzso cells zzso and the latter genetic components may stimulate the zzso DC to zzso via specific zzso receptors zzso leading to the establishment of zzso cellular zzso in particular, zzso T zzso zzso that control zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which might reflect a natural genetic product from a variety of viruses during zzso has recently been identified as one of the critical stimuli for zzso Based on these zzso we speculated that stimulation of zzso with zzso might drive the direction of zzso immunity to the cellular zzso Indeed, when zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso envelope zzso or influenza zzso zzso protein together with zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso were primed from zzso zzso T cells in zzso In contrast, when the same proteins were zzso with zzso a stimulant of zzso specific zzso were not primed at zzso Moreover, we show here that immature DC could present processed zzso from captured zzso protein in association with class I zzso molecules in the presence of zzso but not of zzso These results indicate that we are able to manipulate the direction of zzso zzso immune responses using an appropriate stimuli and the findings presented in this paper will offer a new therapeutic strategy using zzso administration for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso viral protein in zzso
