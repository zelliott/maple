zzso is the founding member of a family of zzso and receptors with unique structures and signaling zzso zzso is the signature zzso of zzso cells, a relatively new T cell population that promotes inflammation in settings of infection and zzso Despite advances in understanding zzso cells, mechanisms of zzso signal zzso are less well zzso zzso signaling requires contributions from two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso lacking the zzso domain are zzso indicating that zzso provides essential but poorly understood signaling contributions to zzso zzso To better understand the role of zzso in zzso we performed a zzso zzso screen to identify novel proteins associated with the zzso zzso zzso One of the most frequent candidates was the zzso promoting complex protein 7 zzso or zzso which zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso exerted no zzso impact on zzso zzso However, zzso which associates with zzso was also able to bind zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhanced zzso gene zzso suggesting an zzso zzso zzso zzso also associated with zzso zzso a zzso negative feedback regulator of zzso signal zzso zzso signaling was not impacted by zzso of zzso or zzso scaffolding proteins that mediate zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso signaling zzso These data suggest a model in which zzso rather than zzso and zzso is a novel zzso and negative regulator of zzso signaling zzso
