As much as brain stem death is currently the clinical definition of death in many countries and is a phenomenon of paramount medical importance, there is a dearth of information on its zzso zzso A majority of the clinical studies are concerned only with methods to determine brain stem zzso Whereas a vast amount of information is available on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell death, rarely are these studies directed specifically towards the understanding of brain stem zzso This review presents a framework for zzso research on brain stem death that is based on systematically coordinated clinical and laboratory efforts that center on this zzso It begins with the identification of a novel clinical marker from patients that is related specifically to brain stem zzso After realizing that this zzso signal is related to the functional integrity of the brain zzso its origin is traced to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laboratory studies on this neural zzso in animal models of brain stem death provide zzso to the notion that both zzso and zzso programs are at work during the progression towards zzso Those programs zzso functions, zzso oxide, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock proteins and zzso zzso zzso identified from the zzso are zzso along with their cellular and molecular zzso It is proposed that outcome of the interplay between the zzso and zzso programs zzso in this neural zzso determines the final fate of the individual zzso zzso Thus, identification of additional programs in the zzso and zzso of their regulatory mechanisms should shed new lights on future directions for clinical management of zzso
