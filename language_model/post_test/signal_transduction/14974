By using zzso recording, we studied how protein zzso C zzso activity affected zzso release in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso muscle of zzso rats during zzso competition in the zzso synaptic elimination zzso In zzso zzso zzso a second zzso potential zzso may appear after the first one when the stimulation intensity is zzso The nerve terminals that generate the lowest and the highest zzso zzso are designated zzso generating zzso zzso and zzso generating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso C, zzso or zzso results in an increased release from zzso ( approximately zzso whereas release from zzso and from endings generating only one zzso zzso is not significantly zzso zzso zzso also leads to the recruitment of silent zzso zzso cannot be released before zzso zzso The mean number of functional zzso terminals per zzso increases by approximately zzso and these are now designated the zzso generating zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso can zzso zzso synaptic elimination by favoring the nerve terminal zzso of certain weak zzso endings zzso and zzso We conclude that a zzso mechanism should occupy a pivotal place in zzso zzso zzso because functional zzso withdrawal can indeed be turned back by zzso zzso
