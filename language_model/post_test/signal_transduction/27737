Because envelope zzso of various strains of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso the expression and function of a variety of zzso receptors through a process of zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso derived from zzso could mimic the zzso A synthetic zzso domain, designated F zzso corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso of the zzso zzso strain, zzso reduced zzso binding and zzso response to zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso that use the receptors zzso and zzso zzso Further study showed that F zzso by itself is an zzso of zzso and calcium zzso in human zzso and zzso In zzso experiments, among the numerous zzso tested, only the bacterial zzso zzso zzso when used at high zzso partially attenuated calcium zzso induced by F zzso in zzso suggesting that this zzso domain might share a zzso zzso zzso with zzso By using cells zzso with zzso zzso receptors that interact with zzso we found that F zzso uses an zzso zzso zzso zzso as a functional zzso The zzso of zzso by F zzso resulted in zzso of the cell surface expression of zzso and zzso in a protein zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of zzso on human zzso by a zzso domain derived from zzso zzso could lead to zzso of cell response to other zzso This may explain, at least in part, the initial zzso of innate immune responses in zzso patients followed by immune zzso
