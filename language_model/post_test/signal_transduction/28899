Beyond its established function in zzso the bone zzso hosts mature zzso and acts as a secondary zzso organ in the initiation of T cell and B cell zzso Here we report the characterization of bone zzso zzso cells zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso were organized into zzso clusters that enveloped blood vessels and were seeded with mature B zzso and T zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these bone zzso immune niches led to the specific loss of mature B cells, a zzso that could be reversed by zzso of the zzso factor zzso in B zzso The presence of zzso promoted the survival of zzso B cells in the bone zzso through the production of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso are critical for the maintenance of zzso B cells in the bone zzso
