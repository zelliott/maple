zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was cloned from developing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nellie zzso and tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous zzso characterization and zzso studies had revealed that zzso has dual modes of regulation by zzso and zzso The unique structural features of zzso include a zzso domain, a zzso domain, and a neural zzso zzso zzso The existence of these three features in a single zzso zzso it from other zzso Western analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in a zzso manner in developing zzso zzso of zzso was first detected in zzso mother cells and continued to increase, reaching a peak around the zzso stage of zzso Following zzso zzso expression rapidly decreased and at later stages of zzso development, no expression was zzso A tobacco zzso clone of zzso was isolated and transgenic tobacco plants were produced carrying the zzso promoter fused to the zzso reporter zzso Both zzso zzso and protein were detected in the zzso zzso and their zzso were restricted to the zzso mother cells and zzso zzso zzso results showing a zzso expression pattern were obtained by zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso appearance of zzso in zzso suggests that it could play a role in sensing transient changes in free zzso concentration in target cells, thereby controlling zzso events in the zzso
