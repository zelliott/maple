zzso interactions contribute to many important biological processes such as cellular zzso protein trafficking and zzso zzso During zzso zzso activated zzso zzso molecules are often recruited into zzso signaling complexes at the zzso surface of the cell zzso Such recruitment can depend upon zzso and zzso interactions as well as protein zzso A wide variety of zzso techniques have been combined with the use of model membrane systems to study these interactions and have provided important information on the relationship between the structure of these proteins involved in cell zzso and their biological zzso More recently, surface zzso resonance zzso zzso has also been applied to the study of zzso systems using both zzso zzso or zzso or zzso This article provides an overview of these recent applications, which demonstrate the potential of zzso to enhance our molecular understanding of zzso cellular zzso
