zzso of unfolded protein within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation through zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor 2 on zzso of the alpha zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso zzso we engineered mice for conditional expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso in beta cells caused a severe diabetic zzso due to heightened and zzso zzso zzso defective zzso trafficking of zzso cargo zzso increased zzso zzso reduced expression of stress response and zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso intolerance and beta cell death in these mice were attenuated by a diet containing zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso translation, prevents zzso stress, and zzso zzso protein folding to support insulin zzso The finding that increased zzso synthesis causes zzso damage in beta cells may reflect events in the beta cell failure associated with insulin resistance in type 2 zzso
