zzso zzso interact directly and activate G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the identity of functionally important interactions between zzso and zzso zzso We tested the effects of all zzso zzso zzso on channel activity and showed that whereas zzso zzso activate zzso zzso channels independently of zzso zzso zzso does zzso zzso and zzso both bind the N and C zzso of the zzso and zzso channel zzso zzso analysis between the zzso and zzso proteins revealed a zzso acid stretch that spans zzso two and three of the zzso structure and is required for channel zzso Within this region, eight zzso zzso acids were critical for the activity of zzso as zzso of each zzso to its counterpart in zzso significantly reduced the ability of zzso to stimulate channel zzso In particular, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso completely abolished zzso stimulation of zzso channel zzso zzso these functionally important zzso on the three-dimensional structure of zzso shows that zzso zzso and zzso are the only surface accessible zzso zzso interacts with zzso but not with zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of the three zzso proteins showed that they fold properly and interact with zzso Of the three identified functionally important zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso currents of a channel point zzso that displays zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the presence of zzso zzso that do not interact with zzso are involved in zzso interactions in the absence of zzso zzso
