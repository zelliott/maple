The zzso gene is a member of a family of genes required for zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso We examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in asexual development and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso yielded strains with an approximately zzso reduction in zzso but a zzso increase in zzso formation when grown on potato zzso zzso in the zzso The concurrent zzso changes suggest that zzso zzso zzso exerts opposite effects on a mutual signaling zzso for both zzso The altered zzso development was in part attributable to delayed expression of zzso a gene controlling zzso zzso Unlike the loss of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso was not affected by the zzso deletion in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was recently found to be involved in the formation of zzso a component of a zzso signal of zzso zzso experiments did not show a similar zzso zzso secondary zzso produced by zzso zzso These results suggest that the function of zzso and the signaling pathways related to zzso are different in the two related zzso
