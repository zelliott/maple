Upon liver injury, zzso zzso cells zzso undergo dramatic zzso and functional changes including migration and zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso II zzso in the development of the zzso zzso of mouse zzso which are considered therapeutic targets to decrease portal hypertension and zzso 

We characterized the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in primary mouse zzso and addressed their function by gene zzso using zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed and localized and have clearly different functions in zzso zzso zzso is mainly located in the zzso area of zzso zzso and at zzso stress zzso after zzso while zzso zzso is located in the zzso and at the edge of zzso of zzso zzso at stress zzso of activated cells, and at the leading edge of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso influences cell size and shape, results in the disruption of stress zzso and in a decrease of focal zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso release but increases cell zzso zzso zzso contributes to the extension of zzso and cell spreading but has no direct role in stress zzso and focal zzso formation, contraction, or zzso zzso zzso 

In mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly zzso distinct zzso Our results provide an insight into the zzso machinery of zzso that could be important in the search for new molecules to treat portal zzso
