zzso profiling analyses were performed to determine zzso zzso dynamics associated with the induction of acquired zzso in response to heat shock and acquired freezing tolerance in response to cold zzso zzso polar zzso analyses were performed using gas zzso zzso Eighty-one identified zzso and 416 unidentified mass spectral zzso characterized by retention time zzso and specific mass fragments, were zzso Cold shock influenced metabolism far more profoundly than heat zzso The zzso pool sizes of 143 and 311 zzso or mass spectral tags were altered in response to heat and cold zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso response patterns revealed that the majority of zzso responses were shared with zzso responses, a previously unknown zzso zzso increases in the pool sizes of zzso acids derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and compatible zzso were observed during both heat and cold zzso In addition, many of the zzso that showed increases in response to both heat and cold shock in this study were previously zzso with temperature zzso This investigation provides new insight into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to zzso stress at the zzso level, reveals relationships between zzso and zzso responses, and highlights the roles of known signaling molecules and zzso
