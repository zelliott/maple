zzso VI is a member of a zzso zzso protein family that zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have identified zzso VI as one of the major zzso expressed zzso by sensory zzso of zzso root zzso zzso and by zzso of spinal zzso zzso of the rat and the zzso This zzso shows a preferential zzso at the plasma membrane of the zzso and cellular zzso particularly in zzso of the zzso This finding suggests an active role of zzso VI in the zzso regulation of plasma membrane zzso To test this possibility, the zzso function of zzso VI was evaluated by whole cell zzso of mouse zzso SC and zzso zzso An zzso was developed that has the property of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of individual zzso in culture, either from SC or zzso with zzso zzso zzso VI zzso resulted in an increase in the magnitude of the zzso current and in an increase in the zzso current in sensory zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso VI regulates the zzso zzso which indirectly zzso zzso zzso zzso in SC and zzso zzso
