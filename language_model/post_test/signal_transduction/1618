During zzso zzso undergo large-scale reorganization to allow pairing between zzso which is necessary for zzso and zzso In many organisms, pairing of zzso zzso is zzso and possibly zzso by the zzso the zzso of zzso in a small region of the nuclear zzso Taking advantage of the zzso accessibility of zzso in zzso we have characterized the organization of zzso and zzso throughout zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso are polarized prior to the bouquet stage, but that this polarization does not contribute to bouquet zzso By examining zzso and ring zzso we have tested the zzso requirements for participation in the zzso We find that: zzso the healed ends of broken zzso which contain zzso repeats, can enter the bouquet; zzso ring zzso enter the zzso indicating that terminal position on a zzso is not necessary for zzso sequences to zzso to the bouquet; and zzso beginning at zzso the behavior of zzso is dominant over any zzso zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that specific zzso regions are acted upon to determine the organization of zzso zzso enabling the bouquet to form despite large-scale changes in zzso zzso
