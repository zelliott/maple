Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso are closely related to retinal zzso these two cell types express many of the same genes and after damage to the zzso zzso zzso can serve as a source for new zzso particularly in zzso zzso We investigated the period of zzso retinal development when zzso are zzso into zzso zzso to better understand this zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso and zzso zzso from various ages of zzso mice were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso We found that genes known to be zzso by zzso zzso steadily increase over the first three zzso weeks, while genes associated with the zzso cell cycle are rapidly zzso from zzso to zzso Interestingly, zzso genes not directly associated with the zzso cell cycle, like the zzso genes zzso and zzso decline more slowly over the first 10-14 days of zzso development, and there is a peak in zzso signaling several days after the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso To confirm that zzso signaling continues in the zzso zzso zzso we performed in zzso zzso zzso for the active form of zzso and zzso for zzso Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we found that sustained zzso signaling in the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for their maturation and the stabilization of the zzso identity for almost a week after the cells have exited the zzso cell zzso
