zzso receptors zzso mediate cell zzso after zzso zzso of their zzso zzso zzso We have reported earlier that primary cultures of rat brain zzso zzso zzso cells express at least two receptors for zzso zzso and zzso In the present study we show that zzso zzso by zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso evokes zzso zzso signal in zzso zzso Taking advantage of zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso we show that zzso activates both zzso The relative zzso activity of zzso and zzso on zzso of zzso cells compared with that of zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the potency of zzso was zzso zzso higher than that of zzso Because under pathological conditions other zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso may reach the cells of the zzso barrier, we investigated the effect of these zzso on zzso zzso zzso evoked a small increase in zzso zzso but zzso of cells with zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso effect on the zzso response, and reduced the zzso signal by zzso It is concluded that zzso is functional in brain zzso zzso and that the main zzso zzso zzso and zzso may regulate zzso zzso under pathological zzso
