A unique feature of zzso embryonic development is the formation of the skeletal system, which not only fulfills zzso supportive, and protective roles, but also regulates several important zzso processes zzso in adult zzso The skeletal system is a zzso organ and its formation starts from zzso zzso in which skeletal precursor cells, also known as zzso zzso give rise to either zzso to form the cartilage or zzso to form the zzso This difference in the initial fate choices of zzso zzso also determines whether zzso is zzso or zzso Like all other zzso zzso the development of skeletons, although mostly zzso in adult lives, is controlled by tightly regulated programs of cell zzso zzso survival, and zzso In this review, we will discuss the entire embryonic zzso processes of the skeletal zzso This review will particularly focus on how zzso signaling and zzso factors regulate multiple aspects of skeletal zzso
