The objective of the study was to identify the functional outcome of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions in vascular zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cell line A10 was zzso independently and zzso with plasmids zzso fluorescent fusion proteins of rat zzso II zzso encodes zzso fused downstream of enhanced zzso fluorescent zzso and the rat zzso zzso zzso encodes the rat zzso zzso fused upstream of enhanced yellow fluorescent zzso The zzso fluorescent fusion protein possesses no zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso established that is maintained within these cells predominantly in the zzso zzso was absent from the nucleus when expressed exclusively or in zzso cells but accumulated in the nucleus following zzso zzso treatment or when zzso with zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso zzso proliferation of A10 vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a control, zzso (which encodes a scrambled zzso zzso fused to zzso had no growth zzso In light of the zzso growth effects of zzso we sought to zzso the underlying signaling zzso We found that zzso zzso treatment of A10 cells activated zzso response zzso protein zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso similarly activated zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso through different zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of A10 cells activated zzso and zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso analyses and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso each partially inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso in this zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso zzso in A10 zzso activated zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso stimulates at least one zzso common to zzso zzso This common pathway, in the case of zzso zzso likely reflects zzso signaling following zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also stimulates a unique pathway, apparently reflecting interaction with plasma zzso zzso
