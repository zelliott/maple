We have recently shown that zzso a member of the tumor necrosis zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso expressed by human T cell clones producing T helper zzso type 2 zzso We report here that zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso by established human zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells with the same zzso zzso zzso resulted in the preferential development of zzso T cell lines and clones showing a zzso profile of zzso zzso In contrast, early blockade in bulk culture of zzso zzso interaction shifted the development of zzso T cells towards the opposite zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso triggering of activated zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso cells may represent an important zzso signaling for the development of zzso zzso
