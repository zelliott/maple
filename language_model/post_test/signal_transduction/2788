We have previously shown that zzso zzso factor zzso gene expression induced by zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso 11 involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso gene expression due to release of zzso acid as a result of zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso factor zzso In the present study, we have investigated the potential mechanism involved in the induction of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso acid induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso by chronic exposure of zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso did not effect zzso expression induced by zzso Moreover, zzso of cells with the zzso zzso zzso C (1 zzso caused a marked decrease of zzso expression induced by zzso but had no influence on zzso expression induced by zzso To explore the hypothesis that a zzso zzso zzso pathway, independent of zzso zzso was involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso before challenge with zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso expression was zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, by zzso zzso similarly inhibited zzso expression in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso The potential role of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression was further investigated by zzso the zzso zzso activity of cells challenged with zzso acid, zzso and zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso acid induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso activity determined by zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso induced zzso and zzso increases in zzso protein zzso activity, zzso The effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and was enhanced by sodium zzso The increase of protein zzso zzso activity detected in zzso cells was zzso in a zzso and zzso fashion, with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a zzso zzso process is triggered by zzso as an early event in the zzso zzso that leads to increased expression of zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
