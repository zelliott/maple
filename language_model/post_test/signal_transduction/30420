How the innate immune system tailors specific responses to diverse microbial infections is not well zzso zzso use a limited number of host receptors and signaling pathways to both discriminate among zzso and zzso zzso and also to generate responses commensurate to each zzso Here, we have addressed these questions by using DNA zzso to monitor the zzso zzso response to the zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso By utilizing combinations of host and bacterial zzso we have defined the host zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso These zzso host responses induced significantly different sets of target zzso despite zzso similar zzso zzso zzso signaling was entirely zzso and induced the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso response induced a distinct set of target zzso including zzso Many of these zzso response genes were induced by zzso zzso so we further identified those host genes induced independent of secondary zzso The host response to zzso bacteria was zzso by the zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso DNA, but we observed an amplification of this response by zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso the induction of zzso was reduced in zzso zzso during infection with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso control of zzso induction by recognition of both DNA and zzso may highlight a mechanism by which the innate immune system zzso the responses to multiple zzso presented in the zzso by zzso zzso
