Plant zzso against pathogens and zzso insects form a comprehensive network of interacting signal zzso zzso The zzso molecules salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso play important roles in this zzso zzso is involved in zzso processes providing systemic acquired resistance zzso protecting the plant from further infection after an initial pathogen zzso zzso is long-lasting and provides broad spectrum resistance to zzso pathogens that feed on a living host zzso The regulatory protein zzso is a central positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus where it interacts with zzso zzso factors to induce the expression of a large set of zzso proteins that contribute to the enhanced state of zzso In a distinct zzso process, zzso protects the plant from insect infestation and zzso pathogens that kill the host cell before zzso zzso activates the regulatory protein zzso that is part of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso which is thought to zzso zzso genes involved in plant zzso Both synergistic and zzso interactions have been observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a critical zzso of zzso between the zzso and zzso signal and is thought to aid in fine tuning zzso responses specific to the encountered zzso Here we review zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso between these zzso
