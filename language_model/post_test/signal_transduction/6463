We have generated transgenic reporter mice to analyze the zzso distribution of zzso hormone signaling during mouse brain zzso The reporter system, utilizing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone alpha zzso domain fusion protein to drive zzso zzso revealed that zzso hormone signaling starts in the zzso roof several days before the onset of zzso zzso function, and that it remains highly zzso in the central nervous system throughout zzso and zzso zzso We speculate that this zzso might provide neural cells with zzso information during zzso
