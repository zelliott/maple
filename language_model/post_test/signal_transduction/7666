The correct organization of cells within an zzso is essential for proper tissue and organ zzso The role of zzso zzso protein zzso signaling in cellular zzso during zzso development is poorly zzso In this paper, we used the developing zzso zzso zzso specifically at the reorganization of zzso support cells that lie between the retinal zzso better understand the role of zzso signaling during zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso activity is tightly regulated across time in the zzso zzso and that zzso cells in this tissue require zzso signaling to achieve their correct shape and position within the zzso zzso These results point to the zzso zzso as a third component and functional link between two zzso systems, zzso and zzso A balanced interplay between these three systems is essential for zzso patterning during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we identify a similar functional connection between zzso activity and zzso and zzso during cell fate determination in the wing, suggesting a broader link between zzso function and zzso integrity during zzso zzso
