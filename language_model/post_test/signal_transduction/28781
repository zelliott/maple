The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso production in zzso arthritis zzso The zzso are regulated by upstream zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the expression and regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso studies of zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso tissue demonstrated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso activated zzso 1 zzso gene expression while only trace amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso zzso and trace amounts of zzso but not zzso or zzso regulating zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso showed that all of the zzso examined were zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso were readily zzso and were subsequently the focus of functional zzso In zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso increased zzso zzso of the key zzso that activate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activated zzso in an zzso dependent manner and this activity was inhibited by the selective zzso inhibitor zzso Of interest, zzso zzso from zzso zzso appeared to activate zzso through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso is a potent zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and that signal complexes including zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso are potential therapeutic targets in zzso
