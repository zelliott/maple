zzso zzso has an important role in zzso zzso zzso progression and zzso This study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso expression in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso and in nude mice zzso implanted with zzso showing highly spontaneous lung zzso Furthermore, we assessed the zzso potential of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso after zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner, whereas the control zzso had no zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed migration and invasion of zzso cells in zzso zzso suppression of zzso also inhibited zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso In mice bearing zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso following therapeutic treatment with zzso zzso significantly decreased lung zzso although tumor weight did not appear to be zzso These findings suggest that zzso therapy may be a promising strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso
