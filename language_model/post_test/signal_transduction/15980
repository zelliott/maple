The zzso target of zzso zzso protein is a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which regulates not only cell proliferation and zzso but also zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are common during zzso cancer zzso and thus, these proteins are attractive targets for cancer zzso So far, specific zzso zzso such as zzso zzso have been developed and studied as zzso zzso 

This review discusses evidence that justifies the potential use of zzso signaling zzso zzso as therapeutic agents for zzso zzso 

In the near future, zzso drugs might represent a new approach for the therapy of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso have already been developed and are currently being clinically zzso Besides the zzso action of zzso zzso the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso can also be useful in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso if zzso zzso are able to increase zzso zzso in zzso cancer, either alone or in combination with other agents, this will represent a new approach for the treatment of zzso cancer, which may possibly improve the treatment of patients in which zzso therapy is not zzso
