Repairing damaged cartilage and zzso is a major challenge of zzso zzso There has been great progress in the past decade toward obtaining stem cells for zzso purposes from a variety of zzso However, the development of procedures to direct and maintain the differentiation of zzso into cartilage or zzso is still a hurdle to overcome in zzso medicine of the musculoskeletal zzso This is because zzso zzso often lack stable zzso and retain plasticity to return to the initial stages of differentiation or to zzso into another zzso tissue cell zzso This makes it necessary to unravel the molecular basis that is responsible for the differentiation of zzso tissue cell zzso In this review, we zzso the investigations performed in the past two decades to unravel the signals that regulate the differentiation of skeletal cell zzso into cartilage and zzso during embryonic limb zzso The data obtained in those studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso establish a complex signaling network that directs the differentiation of skeletal cell zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso model, the divergent differentiation of zzso depends on the zzso coordination of those signals, rather than being specified by an individual signaling zzso Due to its potential medical zzso we highlight the importance of the coordinate influence of the zzso and zzso pathways in the differentiation of cell zzso into zzso or zzso
