zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates signaling pathways in a variety of cellular zzso However, the role of zzso in regulating the differentiation and zzso of stem cells has not been fully zzso zzso in this study, human zzso stem cells zzso were induced to form spheres under zzso culture conditions, and we found that the zzso population was enriched in zzso spheres compared with zzso in a zzso The expression of zzso regulated the ability of zzso to form spheres and was associated with an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, the forced expression of zzso modulated the proliferation and differentiation zzso of zzso through prolonged zzso of zzso and suppressed the level of zzso We showed that the zzso factors zzso and zzso were recruited to the putative promoter region of zzso indicating that zzso and zzso play positive roles in the expression of zzso Indeed, zzso expression was zzso in human embryonic stem cells zzso compared with zzso The elevated level of zzso expression was significantly decreased upon zzso body formation in zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso the level of zzso inducing differentiation into three germ zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the zzso protein zzso has novel and dynamic roles in regulating the differentiation potential of zzso and maintaining zzso
