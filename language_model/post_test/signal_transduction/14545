The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in zzso cells, including zzso zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso and zzso exhibit different zzso zzso and regulation of cell surface zzso although they have similar signaling zzso We investigated here whether zzso and zzso functionally interact in cells zzso the two zzso zzso We zzso both zzso cells zzso expressing zzso alone zzso or together with zzso zzso and the zzso cell line zzso which zzso expresses the two zzso zzso with either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, stimulation with either zzso resulted in the loss of approximately zzso of cell surface zzso binding sites and massive zzso of zzso zzso The cells were zzso to subsequent stimulation with zzso which failed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso and zzso cells, zzso induced the loss of zzso of zzso binding sites as well as massive zzso zzso By contrast, in cells expressing both zzso and zzso selective stimulation of zzso with zzso resulted in only zzso loss of cell surface binding and markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso were zzso to a second stimulation with the same zzso cells zzso with zzso were not zzso to subsequent zzso zzso These findings indicate that the presence of zzso in the same cells zzso trafficking and cell surface regulation of zzso and cellular zzso to the effects of zzso
