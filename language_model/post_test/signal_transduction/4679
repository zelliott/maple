Both genetic and environmental interactions affect systemic lupus zzso zzso development and zzso One known genetic factor associated with lupus is a zzso of the zzso regulatory factor 5 zzso zzso Analysis of global gene expression zzso data using gene set enrichment analysis identified multiple zzso and zzso gene sets significantly overrepresented in cells with the risk zzso zzso analysis using expressed genes from the significant gene sets impacted by the zzso risk zzso confirmed significant correlation with the zzso pathway, zzso zzso pathway, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with the zzso risk zzso have a heightened zzso signature, even in an zzso state zzso zzso zzso while patients with the zzso protective zzso have a B cell zzso signature similar to that of zzso These results identify multiple genes in functionally significant pathways which are affected by zzso zzso They also establish the zzso risk zzso as a key zzso of not only the zzso response, but also other zzso pathways involved in zzso
