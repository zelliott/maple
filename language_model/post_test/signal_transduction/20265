zzso enables zzso bacteria to transit from the zzso to the zzso growth state and to spawn novel communities in new zzso Although the zzso protein zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in response to environmental cues, little is known about regulation of zzso activity or how zzso zzso the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso in its native form is inactive and is activated upon zzso zzso at a zzso zzso site located between the zzso zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to enable zzso zzso requires zzso at zzso as a zzso elevated zzso levels, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The resulting truncated zzso zzso chains directly interact and are required for zzso zzso zzso to zzso Our results provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of zzso zzso that may be zzso to a large number of zzso zzso zzso zzso into the mechanism of zzso function have implications for the control of zzso zzso
