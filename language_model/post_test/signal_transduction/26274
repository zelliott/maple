zzso of zzso zzso as an zzso stress factor on plant zzso zzso and involvement of zzso oxide zzso as a secondary zzso zzso plant cell response to environmental stimuli were investigated in this zzso Taking into account that zzso NO content in plant cells has been shown to be increased under a broad range of zzso stress factors, the effects of zzso zzso and also the combined action of zzso and NO donor sodium zzso zzso or NO scavenger zzso zzso on the zzso organization in different root cells of zzso zzso were zzso zzso realization of the zzso processes such as root growth and development was studied under these zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene zzso were exposed to the enhanced zzso with or without zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso alone led to a zzso root growth zzso and to zzso zzso of the primary root zzso in their swelling and excessive root hair zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in both zzso and cortical cells under the enhanced zzso were zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered the zzso inhibited root growth as compared to zzso zzso It has been shown that in 24 h after zzso zzso the organization of zzso in root zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially recovered, whereas in zzso ones the organization of zzso has not been distinctly zzso zzso we suppose that the enhanced NO levels in plant cells can protect zzso organization as well as zzso processes of root growth and development against zzso effects of zzso
