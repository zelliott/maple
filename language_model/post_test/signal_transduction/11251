zzso of zzso a zzso active zzso zzso is a primary event in the zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso and zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso cell line with zzso resulted in a significant zzso of a zzso novel zzso found to be the human zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and includes an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein with a basic zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was consistently zzso zzso in all 10 zzso zzso lines tested following zzso zzso In zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso 8) and zzso lines zzso zzso zzso zzso was either zzso by Northern zzso or did not change in response to zzso suggesting that zzso repression by zzso may be specifically relevant to zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a significantly lower level of zzso expression in zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso 24) as compared to normal individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells treated in zzso with zzso exhibited a consistent zzso of zzso in 8 of 10 zzso but in none of the 9 normal individuals zzso zzso regulation of zzso in zzso cells was exerted via the zzso zzso as shown by their responses to the zzso zzso zzso hybrid mapping and FISH revealed that zzso is located on zzso 6, band zzso a region frequently associated with deletions in ALL and zzso lymphoma, suggesting its possible role as a tumor zzso zzso However, no zzso or loss of signal was observed by Southern zzso in 34 zzso 10 zzso zzso or seven zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso expression in zzso cells suggests that zzso repression by this regulator is impaired in zzso and may contribute to the emergence of zzso blast zzso
