zzso attention has been drawn to the potential role of defective zzso zzso zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso zzso and to the possibility that zzso of zzso may provide zzso in zzso However, little knowledge exists on the integrity of the zzso system in zzso zzso of the present study show diminished levels of both total and active zzso in the brain in zzso This was evident by western zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso compared to zzso control brain, but more specifically by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, double zzso zzso found zzso and zzso to be expressed at high levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control human zzso Selective loss of these zzso was accompanied by a marked decrease of zzso and zzso expression in the zzso brain, however zzso and active zzso are still evident in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso This suggests that it may be possible to target zzso zzso in advanced zzso Converse to the marked loss of zzso zzso in zzso increased zzso and zzso levels were observed in small zzso positive cells in zzso zzso whose increased number and small nuclear size indicate they are zzso These findings zzso defective zzso as a putative zzso zzso linked to loss of zzso zzso in zzso
