Cell fate diversity is generated in part by the unequal segregation of zzso zzso during zzso cell zzso In the zzso bristle zzso the sensory organ precursor zzso cell is polarized along the zzso (AP) axis by zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell prior to zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are also required for zzso polarization of the zzso cell, zzso at the anterior zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso define two opposite cortical zzso prior to zzso of the zzso zzso At zzso zzso forms an anterior zzso that zzso with the distribution of Partner of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two components of the anterior zzso complex that regulates the zzso of zzso zzso At zzso zzso promotes the anterior zzso of zzso By contrast, zzso zzso acts zzso to zzso by excluding zzso from the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso recruitment of zzso at the anterior zzso of the zzso cell is a novel zzso of zzso cell zzso
