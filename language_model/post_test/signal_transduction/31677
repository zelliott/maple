zzso are primary targets for human zzso zzso infection and are proposed to be responsible for zzso dissemination of the zzso zzso zzso have a short life span of 48 h in the zzso a period of time during which zzso must make a cell fate decision on whether to undergo zzso or differentiate into a zzso We have previously shown that zzso infection stimulates zzso zzso however, the zzso by which zzso zzso simultaneously navigate the zzso zzso zzso and undergo zzso differentiation has remained zzso Studies have demonstrated that the level of zzso 3 and 8 activities in zzso may mediate the delicate balance between zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso infection, unlike zzso treatment, does not induce zzso 8 activity to promote zzso zzso However, zzso infection does induce a zzso zzso of zzso 3, with only a low level of active zzso 3 being observed after the zzso viability zzso zzso with the role of a zzso zzso of zzso 3 in promoting zzso zzso the zzso of zzso 3 blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses identified heat shock protein 27 zzso and zzso two known regulators of zzso 3 zzso as being zzso prior to the zzso viability gate following zzso zzso Using small interfering zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso targets the rapid induction of zzso and zzso which zzso function to precisely control zzso 3 activity in order to allow for zzso zzso to successfully traverse the zzso cell fate decision checkpoint and zzso zzso zzso Overall, this study highlights a unique regulatory mechanism employed by zzso to tightly zzso the zzso 3 activity needed to promote zzso zzso a key process in the viral dissemination and persistence zzso
