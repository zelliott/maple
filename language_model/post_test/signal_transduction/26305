In addition to its role in calcium zzso and bone zzso vitamin D is involved in immune zzso cardiovascular function, inflammation and zzso and these zzso effects are of interested in the treatment of chronic kidney zzso Here we investigated the effects of zzso a zzso vitamin D zzso on human peripheral blood zzso cell proliferation and zzso and on zzso These effects were compared with those of a known inhibitor of zzso pertaining to the vitamin D zzso the vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso 

Since the effects of vitamin D zzso zzso are associated with zzso of the gene coding for the zzso we measured the effects of both compounds on zzso cells harvested from subjects harboring different zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso cell viability with the zzso zzso showing the highest zzso zzso on the contrary, zzso cell zzso with the zzso zzso showing the highest zzso zzso Both compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso cells with the highest effect on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the vitamin D zzso zzso known to be associated with the highest responses to vitamin D zzso zzso are also associated with the highest responses to zzso These results highlight the role of the vitamin D axis in chronic kidney disease, an axis which includes vitamin D, its zzso and vitamin zzso zzso zzso
