zzso application of zzso as a treatment for conditions such as allergy, zzso diseases, and transplantation presents a high risk of development of zzso zzso The presence of a functional zzso zzso zzso in human and rat lens zzso cells suggests a direct and specific targeting of these lens cells by zzso One important zzso protein in lens zzso cells is zzso which plays an important role in maintaining the normal lens zzso and zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso is involved in signal zzso changes in cell structure and zzso and zzso Based on a model of zzso cataract from our previous study, the present study focuses on whether changes in zzso can be induced in zzso through specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the rat zzso 

Clear rat lenses, cultured in zzso were treated with or without zzso zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured for 7 days at 37 zzso under zzso zzso and were observed daily with an zzso zzso Changes in zzso were followed by zzso zzso zzso transmission electron zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was examined by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso analysis, respectively, in the zzso and fiber tissue of the zzso 

zzso was obviously present at day 7 in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso group and the zzso group remained transparent throughout the zzso zzso zzso showed an orderly arrangement of fiber cells and normal cell junctions in the control group and the zzso zzso However, in the zzso group, fiber cells were zzso and the zzso junctions exhibited zzso The expression of zzso protein in the lens zzso and fiber tissue decreased in the zzso group, but normal expression of zzso zzso was zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso reduction in zzso may be involved in the formation of zzso zzso
