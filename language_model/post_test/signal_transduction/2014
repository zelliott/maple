zzso syndrome zzso is an inherited zzso disease characterized by giant zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso results from zzso in the zzso trafficking regulator zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein of unknown zzso The goal of this study was to identify proteins that interact with zzso as a first step in understanding how zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen zzso fragments, covering the entire coding domain of zzso were used as zzso to screen five human zzso libraries by a zzso zzso method, modified to allow screening in the zzso and the binding domain, three zzso zzso and more stringent confirmation zzso Five of the interactions were confirmed by an in zzso binding zzso 

zzso proteins that interact with zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso Four zzso confirmed directly, were with proteins important in zzso transport and signal zzso (the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

On the basis of protein zzso zzso appears to function as an adapter protein that may zzso proteins that mediate zzso membrane fusion zzso The zzso manifestations observed in zzso patients and in mice with the zzso zzso beige suggest that understanding the role of zzso may be relevant to the treatment of not only zzso but also of diseases such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as to the molecular dissection of the zzso cancer zzso
