zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso recognizes zzso A, the active zzso of microbial zzso zzso Little is known about mechanisms for zzso recognition by zzso Here we show zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso which directly leads to zzso zzso Since zzso zzso normally occurred in the absence of the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso works upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso A zzso is zzso on mouse zzso but turns zzso on zzso mouse zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso activity of zzso zzso is determined by human zzso zzso studies with radioactive zzso A and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is similar to zzso A in zzso and zzso binding to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso however, did not induce zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso binds mouse zzso zzso but does not trigger zzso zzso zzso study further revealed that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso binding to mouse zzso zzso which was approximately zzso higher than zzso zzso Taken together, zzso A zzso zzso zzso is distinct from zzso A in binding to zzso and in subsequent triggering of zzso zzso Given that the zzso activity of zzso zzso is determined by zzso zzso has an important role in a link between zzso interaction and zzso zzso
