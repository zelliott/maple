zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the differentiation and zzso the proliferation of zzso lineage zzso In this study, we examined whether the effects of zzso on zzso functions change with aging using zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited DNA synthesis and zzso collagen synthesis and zzso bone zzso zzso These effects were less pronounced in aged rat cells, suggesting the age-related zzso of zzso zzso They were also blocked by the treatment of young rat cells with zzso a protein zzso G zzso zzso but not by the treatment of aged rat cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso production in young rat cells, but not in aged rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a zzso zzso activity domain, and zzso which has no zzso activity domain, were predominantly expressed in young and aged rat cells, zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso on the proliferation and differentiation of aged rat zzso these effects were inhibited by the treatment with zzso toxin zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso levels of zzso and zzso which are markers for zzso C zzso zzso in aged rat cells, and the effects of these two peptides were also blocked by the treatment with zzso From these results, we concluded that zzso acts as a positive regulator of bone formation by zzso and that the signaling zzso for zzso is switched from zzso to zzso zzso with zzso
