zzso patterning must be translated into zzso through cell shape changes zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso We have found that zzso protein alpha zzso and zzso protein beta zzso which prevent extension of the barbed ends of zzso zzso are specifically required in the wing blade zzso of the zzso wing zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells in this region, but not in the remainder of the wing disc, are zzso from the zzso and undergo zzso zzso zzso filament zzso is not sufficient to explain this zzso as loss of zzso or zzso protein does not cause cell zzso or zzso zzso of zzso the zzso factor that specifies the wing zzso both increases zzso zzso and makes cells dependent on zzso for their maintenance in the zzso Our results suggest that zzso specifies the zzso changes that lead to zzso of the adult zzso
