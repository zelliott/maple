zzso beta has been reported to play an essential role in the induction of T zzso immune responses in skin, and zzso cells are considered to be the primary source of zzso beta in zzso We have established recently a long-term zzso cell line zzso from mouse zzso This line resembles resident zzso zzso cells in many respects, including the potent capacity to present a protein zzso zzso to a zzso zzso clone zzso and the expression of zzso beta zzso We sought to determine whether zzso cells zzso zzso beta upon zzso interaction with T cells and, if so, to zzso the zzso Despite zzso expression of zzso for both zzso beta and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso no zzso zzso beta zzso When they were cultured with zzso T cells and zzso relatively large amounts of zzso beta zzso zzso were detected in the culture zzso zzso beta was zzso by zzso zzso cells, but not by zzso or Con zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso beta is zzso primarily by zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells alone or with zzso alone caused no zzso beta zzso indicating the requirement for both T cells and zzso zzso beta zzso was associated with a striking zzso of zzso beta zzso and a modest zzso of ICE zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta zzso was blocked by zzso (a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso fusion zzso or zzso zzso zzso beta zzso was triggered in a T zzso manner by either zzso or zzso zzso in immobilized zzso Thus, the zzso zzso cell line zzso by an zzso zzso biologically relevant amounts of zzso beta upon zzso interaction with T cells, with both zzso molecules and zzso molecules playing essential zzso
