zzso the zzso of the zzso family of zzso G proteins is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso of zzso zzso or zzso has been previously shown to induce zzso transformation of zzso cells promoting zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent, autonomous cell growth forms a critical defining point at which a normal cell turns into an zzso zzso To identify the underlying mechanism involved in such zzso independent growth of zzso zzso we carried out a two-dimensional differential zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells and cells expressing zzso zzso This analysis revealed a total of 22 zzso whose expression was altered by more than zzso Two of these spots were identified by zzso analysis as zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The increased expressions of these proteins in zzso cells were validated by zzso zzso Furthermore, transient zzso studies with zzso cells indicated that the expression of activated zzso readily increased the expression of zzso protein by 24 zzso As zzso has been previously reported to be an inhibitor of zzso zzso the nuclear zzso activity was monitored in cells expressing activated zzso Our results indicate that the nuclear zzso activity is inhibited by greater than 50% in zzso cells compared to zzso control zzso Thus, our results from differential zzso analysis presented here report for the first time a role for zzso in zzso signaling pathways and a role for zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
