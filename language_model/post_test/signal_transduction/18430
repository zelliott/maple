Although lacking the components that characterize the acquired immunity systems of zzso zzso nevertheless possess effective general innate immune mechanisms which exhibit striking parallels with those of zzso These innate immune systems include both cellular and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso molecules to combat infectious zzso zzso substances employed by zzso include zzso zzso of oxygen and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The signal zzso pathways that are involved in zzso the production of these substances appear to be very similar among animal species, suggesting a common ancestral origin for the innate immune zzso
