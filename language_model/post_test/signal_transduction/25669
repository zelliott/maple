zzso live cell imaging is a powerful tool for studying signaling network dynamics and complexity and is uniquely suited to single cell studies of response zzso noise, and zzso zzso Although conventional imaging formats have the zzso and spatial resolution needed for such studies, they do not provide the simultaneous advantages of cell zzso experimental zzso and precise chemical zzso This is particularly problematic for zzso studies using zzso model organisms such as zzso where the motion of cells zzso tracking and where large-scale analysis under a variety of genetic and chemical zzso is zzso We present here a zzso zzso imaging system capable of tracking single cells over multiple generations in 128 simultaneous experiments with zzso and precise chemical zzso zzso imaging and robust cell tracking are achieved through zzso of zzso cells using a combination of mechanical clamping and zzso in an zzso zzso The channel and valve architecture of our device allows for the formation of a zzso of 128 integrated zzso gel zzso each allowing for an independent imaging experiment with fully zzso medium exchange via zzso We demonstrate our system in the zzso and quantitative analysis of the zzso zzso signaling response across 8 zzso and 16 conditions, and show that zzso effects contribute to observed zzso at stimulation conditions near the critical threshold for cellular decision zzso
