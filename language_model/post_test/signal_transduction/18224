The zzso of human zzso virus 8, which is associated with zzso zzso encodes proteins with similarities to zzso and zzso including a zzso of zzso Although the function of these viral proteins is zzso they might have the potential to zzso the immune zzso For viral zzso zzso it has been demonstrated that it stimulates zzso cells, indicating that the zzso system is zzso zzso binds to zzso and the zzso complex associates with zzso which zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that only express zzso but no zzso cannot be zzso by zzso unless a soluble form of the zzso is zzso This type of signaling has been shown for zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and smooth muscle zzso In this paper we show that zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and stimulates primary human smooth muscle zzso zzso fails to bind zzso and is not involved in its zzso A zzso fusion protein of zzso turned out to be a potent inhibitor of zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is the first zzso which directly binds and activates zzso This property points to a possible role of this viral zzso in the zzso of human zzso virus zzso
