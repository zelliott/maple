Evidence implicating zzso stress in the zzso of age-related zzso zzso suggests that zzso therapy could play a role in preventing its zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso cellular damage and to explore the molecular mechanisms of this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and retinal zzso cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was measured by reporter zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso and retinal zzso was induced by light zzso To explore the association of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso protected retinal cell lines from zzso cell zzso The zzso and zzso potential of these compounds was then examined in zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso induced the zzso transcripts zzso and zzso in retinal tissue and was protective from zzso retinal zzso Treatment with zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso directly binds zzso 124 within zzso active site and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Thus the stimulation of zzso activity is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

These studies highlight the potential of zzso in retinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a target in zzso
