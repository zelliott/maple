In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso regulator that releases zzso from zzso Here, we find that zzso and zzso form a complex with zzso factor 4 zzso on the promoter of zzso target genes and regulate gene zzso The complex forms via two interactions of nuclear zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, both of which bind to zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with either zzso or zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso transcription, and the reduction of zzso diminished zzso association on zzso target gene promoters in zzso zzso of a zzso fusion protein largely rescued the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells and zzso Thus, we confirm that zzso functions in zzso zzso signaling and show that zzso functions as a scaffold in the zzso zzso complex bridging zzso to zzso Our results reveal a mechanism by which nuclear zzso zzso with zzso to regulate gene zzso zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso
