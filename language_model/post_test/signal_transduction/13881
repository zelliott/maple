Nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso the zzso master regulator of the zzso zzso response, plays a key role in zzso resistance to zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily zzso by zzso both in zzso and in zzso but little is known about zzso signals that regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that activity of the zzso zzso in the brain is fine-tuned through a regulatory loop between zzso and zzso elevated zzso activity leads to zzso of zzso and other soluble factors, which activate the zzso zzso zzso through a signaling cascade that involves group I zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso signaling is one of the functions of the zzso zzso zzso by matching the zzso zzso capacity to the degree of activity in adjacent zzso zzso this regulatory mechanism may limit the zzso costs associated with zzso zzso
