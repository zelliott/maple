zzso group zzso proteins are major zzso of cell identity, stem cell zzso and zzso gene zzso during zzso The zzso repressive complex 1, which contains zzso zzso and zzso functions as an zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso are recruited to sites of DNA zzso breaks zzso where they contribute to the zzso of zzso In the absence of zzso several proteins dependent on zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso are impaired in recruitment to zzso Loss of zzso zzso cells to zzso radiation to the same extent as loss of zzso The simultaneous depletion of both proteins revealed an additive increase in radiation zzso These data uncover an unexpected link between the zzso and the DNA damage response zzso and suggest a novel function for zzso in maintaining zzso zzso
