Recent success in the cloning of zzso genes involved in the synthesis of zzso has enabled us to zzso the expression profiles of zzso in cultured cells and experimental animals, and allowed novel approaches to obtain clear zzso of individual zzso products by observing the resulting zzso changes in the zzso animals and zzso zzso In this review, recent progress in the study of zzso involved in the synthesis and modification of zzso has been summarized with special emphasis on their zzso
