zzso zzso and zzso use are risk factors for the development of breast zzso Recent work has identified zzso receptors localized at the plasma membrane that signal to cell zzso We examined the impact of zzso on membrane zzso and growth factor zzso signaling to breast cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso cells showed a rapid and sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso that was substantially prevented by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso cells induced by zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso a specific zzso zzso or by dominant negative zzso expression and by expression of zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso induced the synthesis of zzso D1 and zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso The intact tumor zzso inhibited all of zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor zzso zzso and cell zzso The zzso of zzso and cell proliferation by zzso was prevented by zzso zzso and by interfering zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a novel tumor zzso function of zzso that is relevant to breast cancer and identify a potential interactive risk factor for women with zzso zzso
