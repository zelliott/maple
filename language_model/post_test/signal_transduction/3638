The airways of the zzso lung are lined with highly specialized zzso cell types that are the targets of airborne zzso and zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in the zzso of airway zzso cells, but its contributions to zzso expansion or differentiation of resident zzso cells, and repair and zzso of the normal composition of airway zzso following injury have not been zzso In this study, the role of a specific zzso zzso zzso was investigated by targeted zzso in the embryonic lung zzso using the zzso zzso driver zzso zzso mice are viable without discernible defects in pulmonary zzso zzso determination and zzso However, in an experimental model of airway injury, activity of zzso is found to be required for normal repair of the airway zzso zzso of zzso reduced the ability of a population of cells distinguished by expression of zzso otherwise a marker of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, which appears to serve as a zzso for zzso of Clara zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso gene 6 zzso were found to be downstream targets of zzso Both zzso and zzso expressions were significantly increased in association with Clara cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso and zzso and inhibited airway zzso zzso Thus, although zzso in zzso zzso of airway zzso cells, normal activity of zzso is required for repair of the airway zzso The signaling zzso by which zzso regulates the repair process includes stimulation of zzso and zzso gene zzso
