zzso of zzso growth factor receptors zzso requires the formation of a zzso complex between zzso growth factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are all located on the cell surface and the basement membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to stabilize zzso by zzso the rapid degradation of zzso normally observed in zzso Because of the pivotal role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso a number of recent studies have attempted to engineer zzso to stabilize growth factors for use in applications in tissue culture and zzso zzso In this communication, we demonstrate that zzso linkage of zzso to zzso surfaces zzso as zzso bound zzso composed of a network of zzso zzso resulted in the maintenance of the biological efficacy of zzso when stored dry for at least 6 months at 25 degrees C or 4 degrees zzso Moreover, zzso bound zzso was more potent than zzso in solution when measured in cellular zzso of proliferation and viability using a variety of cell zzso zzso bound zzso also strongly activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Hence zzso molecules can be incorporated into a synthetic zzso surface, providing a novel means to enhance their stability and biological zzso
