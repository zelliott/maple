zzso of smooth muscle cells zzso is a prominent pathological characteristic of abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso stimulates zzso signaling in a mouse model of zzso Here, we test whether protein zzso zzso zzso an zzso mediator, zzso in the zzso of AAA by regulating zzso and zzso zzso 

Mouse experimental AAA is induced by zzso administration of zzso Mice deficient in zzso exhibit a profound reduction in zzso expansion, zzso zzso and zzso inflammation as compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso wall of zzso mice restores aneurysm, whereas zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso mice zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit significantly impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso wall of zzso mice restores inflammatory response and aneurysm zzso 

zzso is an important signaling zzso for zzso zzso and inflammation in a mouse model of zzso By stimulating zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the inflammatory process, in turn perpetuating zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for zzso
