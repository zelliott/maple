A logical model of the known zzso processes in zzso zzso was constructed from zzso an existing zzso zzso Analysis zzso model, and zzso with information from the zzso online zzso zzso The use of zzso logic as the knowledge representation for zzso enables an explicit representation of the structure of the zzso network, and enables logical zzso techniques to be used for model zzso 

Compared to the zzso model, the logical model has information on an additional 263 putative genes and 247 additional zzso The correctness of this model was evaluated by comparison with zzso (an updated zzso model closely related to zzso by evaluating the performance of both models on predicting empirical minimal medium growth zzso gene zzso 

zzso analysis and other statistical studies revealed that use of the simpler logical form and larger coverage results in no significant degradation of performance compared to zzso
