The Nuclear zzso zzso family of zzso factors are zzso expressed and control a wide range of cellular responses, including zzso zzso zzso inflammation and zzso Here, we investigated the function of the zzso upstream regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso regulation in the normal zzso setting of zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of the gene zzso zzso resulted, surprisingly, in delayed zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso This failure to induce zzso was associated with reduced zzso within 24 hours of zzso of the death zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso which are known zzso zzso This was associated with elevated levels of active zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that expression of zzso another DR zzso is dramatically zzso even in zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike other DR zzso the zzso promoter has six consensus zzso sites, further suggesting that it is zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso form of zzso is zzso during zzso This unexpected function of the zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso expression and zzso of zzso has significant consequences for future therapeutic approaches for cancer and inflammatory zzso
