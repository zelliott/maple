Animals acquire zzso values of sensory stimuli through zzso In the brain of zzso zzso zzso of two types of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso clusters has been shown to induce aversive odor zzso Here, we identified the third cell type and characterized aversive memories induced by these zzso zzso These three zzso pathways all project to the mushroom body but terminate in the zzso zzso zzso To understand the functional difference of these zzso pathways in electric shock zzso we blocked each one of them during memory zzso We found that all three pathways partially contribute to electric shock zzso zzso the memories zzso by these zzso differed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of two of these pathways revealed significant interaction of individual memory components rather than their simple zzso These results cast light on a cellular mechanism by which a noxious event zzso different zzso signals to a single brain structure to zzso an aversive zzso
