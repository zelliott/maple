When growth hormone binds to its zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso it activates the zzso zzso zzso which has zzso activity and zzso an zzso of several key zzso proteins (for example, zzso protein zzso zzso that eventually execute the biological actions induced by growth hormone, including the expression of particular zzso In contrast to receptors that themselves have zzso zzso activity, the zzso pathways leading to zzso zzso zzso that are triggered by growth hormone are poorly zzso but appear to be zzso by the proteins zzso and zzso We now show that growth hormone stimulates zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso growth factor zzso and its association with zzso and at the same time stimulates zzso zzso activity in liver, an important target tissue of growth zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and expression of the zzso factor zzso requires zzso of zzso on zzso but not its own intrinsic zzso zzso Moreover, zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso is proposed to be one of the principal zzso sites and zzso sites zzso by growth hormone via zzso Our results indicate that the role of zzso in zzso by growth hormone is to be zzso by zzso thereby providing zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso independently of the intrinsic zzso zzso activity of zzso This may represent a novel zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and growth factor zzso
