We used a zzso zzso imaging system to zzso rapid changes in zzso free zzso concentration zzso evoked by focal applications of zzso zzso to the hair bundle of outer hair cells zzso the zzso receptors of the zzso zzso recordings of the zzso current and zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso After an initial entry of zzso through the zzso zzso a second and larger, zzso zzso zzso zzso surge occurred at the base of the hair zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso release site showed that it zzso with the zzso of a unique system of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso known as zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso receptors share this zzso zzso with a zzso second zzso system linked to zzso zzso we also determined that an zzso of zzso is present in the zzso zzso cell shape changes and zzso zzso were monitored before and after zzso application, showing that the zzso zzso rise did not interfere with the zzso zzso zzso This second zzso signaling mechanism zzso the zzso power of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the base of the hair zzso where it can potentially zzso the action of unconventional zzso zzso involved in maintaining the hair bundle integrity and potentially influence zzso
