zzso acid receptors zzso are members of the nuclear hormone zzso family and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of multiple different cell types, including zzso leukemia zzso Here we describe a zzso interaction between the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso that zzso the differentiation of zzso leukemia zzso We observe that zzso is the zzso that is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and this zzso directly interacts with zzso through a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso and this zzso zzso zzso activity by enhancing its interaction with zzso zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso zzso to zzso target sites within zzso gene promoters but zzso from the promoter upon zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso a pharmacological inhibitor of the zzso enhances the terminal differentiation of zzso leukemia cell lines, and this is associated with a reduction in activated zzso zzso in the terminally zzso zzso These observations reveal a significant zzso between zzso and zzso acid signaling pathways that regulates the differentiation of zzso leukemia cells, and they suggest that zzso may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of certain human zzso zzso
