Two regulatory genes zzso a zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso and a response regulator zzso of a bacterial zzso signal zzso system are present in the zzso region of the zzso gene cluster of the zzso zzso which is composed of zzso M zzso and zzso S zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished both zzso and VS zzso with drastic zzso of the zzso profile for zzso zzso zzso whereas disruption of zzso resulted in only a loss of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso regulator for both zzso and VS zzso and that zzso is a zzso regulator for zzso zzso zzso Gene expression profiles determined by zzso zzso on the zzso zzso gene cluster demonstrated that zzso controls the zzso genes for zzso and zzso and zzso controls unidentified zzso of zzso zzso located outside the zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso analysis of a deletion zzso of zzso located in the clustered regulatory region in the zzso cluster (and which also acts as a zzso zzso for both zzso and VS zzso indicated that the expression of zzso and zzso is under the control of zzso and zzso also contributes to the expression of zzso and VS zzso zzso independent of zzso and zzso zzso coordinated zzso zzso is controlled by three zzso regulators which zzso control the expression of the zzso gene zzso
