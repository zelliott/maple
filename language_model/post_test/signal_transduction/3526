Two populations of zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso give rise to the entire zzso lung and zzso zzso but little is known about these cells because they are difficult to isolate in a pure zzso We demonstrate here the zzso and directed differentiation of primordial lung and zzso zzso derived from mouse embryonic stem cells zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso can specify these cells efficiently from definitive zzso zzso When derived using zzso zzso reporter zzso these zzso can be zzso for expansion in culture and have a zzso that zzso with developing lung zzso Upon zzso they can express a broad repertoire of markers indicative of lung and zzso lineages and can zzso a zzso lung tissue zzso Thus, we have derived a pure population of zzso able to zzso the zzso milestones of zzso zzso
