A zzso zzso is a zzso type II zzso zzso belonging to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso levels of soluble zzso increased in inflammatory zzso diseases zzso suggesting that zzso signaling is involved in the zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso colitis in zzso knockout zzso zzso 

Colitis was induced by zzso or zzso in zzso mice with zzso or zzso background, respectively, and diverse clinical signs of the disease were zzso zzso production from zzso zzso T cells of the colon was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso in mice with colitis induced by zzso or zzso 

zzso mice were susceptible to zzso colitis but resistant to zzso acute zzso The levels of T helper cell 2 type zzso such as zzso and zzso in the LP T cells were significantly higher, but the levels of zzso gamma were lower in zzso or zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso In zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso ameliorated zzso colitis but aggravated zzso colitis in zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso signaling is involved in development of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso could be a novel zzso therapy for zzso
