Much research has focused on the responses to microbial products of immune cells such as zzso zzso and zzso Although the liver is a primary response organ in various infections, relatively little is known about the zzso responses of its major cell type, the zzso It is now known that the recognition of bacteria occurs via zzso proteins that are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso is bound by circulating zzso protein zzso and presented to zzso zzso which in turn interacts with zzso and zzso an zzso zzso We investigated the zzso and zzso responses of whole liver and isolated zzso and demonstrated that these cells can be induced to express the molecules necessary for responses to both zzso and zzso zzso Our findings may have clinical implications for pathological states such as zzso
