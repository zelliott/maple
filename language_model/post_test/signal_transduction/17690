The three zzso zzso zzso differ only at their N zzso thus, they share the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso function zzso and only differ in the zzso zzso region, which contains a second, zzso zzso function zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed it in flies with the zzso system, and used it to block zzso signaling in eight zzso or groups of zzso zzso zzso arrests zzso development in the target cells and zzso of a zzso zzso development zzso zzso expressing individual zzso zzso zzso in the same target zzso suppresses the zzso zzso and identifies the rescuing zzso as sufficient to support the development of the zzso Every zzso and even an zzso truncated zzso that lacks any zzso supports development in the fat body, eye discs, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and in the zzso expression domain, zzso that zzso is zzso in these zzso By contrast, only zzso is able to support development in the margins of the wing discs, and only zzso can do so in the zzso zzso and the border cells of the developing egg zzso In light of our results, the simplest explanations for the widespread spatial and zzso variations in zzso zzso zzso appear zzso
