The zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modifications furnish the control mechanism of key components governing zzso zzso by protein synthesis provides an irreversible zzso mechanism for an extended period that can be restricted by a complementary degradation of the same zzso Both processes zzso tight measures to ensure precise expression at the right time in the right zzso Rapid modifications such as zzso and zzso supply zzso means to regulate protein zzso Information regarding these extremely exciting issues is being accumulated recently in an exponential zzso However, the vast majority of these data is generated from studies conducted on zzso zzso We fully agree with Andrew Murray's statement that zzso modern trend of promoting research on a small number of zzso organisms will eventually zzso us of the opportunity to study interesting zzso zzso 92 (1992) zzso Thus, despite of the enormous technical difficulties resulting from the limited availability of biological material we extended our interest to zzso model zzso Our review will attend to certain examples of such modifications in the regulatory zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
