The processes that determine an zzso lifespan are complex and poorly zzso Yet single gene zzso and environmental interventions can substantially delay age-related zzso In this review, we focus on the two most potent zzso of zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso signaling and dietary zzso The remarkable molecular conservation of the components associated with zzso signaling and dietary restriction allow us to understand longevity from a zzso zzso We zzso the most recent findings on zzso signaling and examine the proteins and pathways that reveal a more genetic basis for dietary zzso Although zzso signaling and dietary restriction pathways are currently viewed as being independent, we suggest that these two pathways are more intricately connected than previously zzso We highlight that numerous interactions between these two pathways can occur at multiple zzso Ultimately, both the zzso zzso and the zzso that mediates the effects of dietary restriction have evolved to respond to the nutritional status of an zzso which in turn affects its zzso
