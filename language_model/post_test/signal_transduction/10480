We have previously shown that zzso zzso protective zzso effects against zzso pneumonia in zzso zzso Further in zzso studies showed zzso effects of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, concentrating on a more challenging pathogen of zzso zzso we studied the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and signal zzso mechanisms in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso 

Human peripheral blood zzso zzso and a human zzso cell line zzso were incubated with zzso zzso of a clinical isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso were measured with and without the addition of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso up to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and up to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso Signal zzso studies showed that incubation of zzso cells with zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein expression by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso by up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso acts as an zzso agent in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso Whether these effects may be protective as in the zzso pneumonia model is unknown and merits in zzso studies in models of pulmonary zzso
