zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso cells, from rat skeletal muscle was studied in both zzso and zzso using the zzso pH sensitive, zzso probe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, showing a zzso dose response typical of other insulin zzso a maximum at 10 zzso zzso pH of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso over zzso value, for zzso and zzso zzso means zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and smaller effects at higher and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, also zzso the zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso the rapid increase in zzso pH was not observed when insulin and zzso were added simultaneously to zzso apparently these two zzso mutually excluded each zzso zzso of protein zzso C, obtained by zzso of cells with zzso for 20 zzso totally abolished both hormone and zzso effects in zzso whereas in zzso insulin stimulation was not zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity, such as zzso analog and zzso abolished insulin effect on the zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Different sensitivity to zzso toxin in the two cell types suggests that the differentiation process leads to a change in the signal pathways involved in the zzso response to zzso
