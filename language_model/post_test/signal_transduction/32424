The rat zzso cell line, zzso responds to zzso and zzso zzso by an increased zzso of specific acute phase plasma protein zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso although ineffective on its own in regulating zzso zzso zzso the action of the zzso zzso In growing cultures, the zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso is enhanced by zzso whereas the stimulation of other zzso is zzso The effects of leukemia zzso factor, zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso are generally attenuated by zzso Enhancement by zzso of the zzso response can be explained in part by the fact that zzso in combination with zzso stimulates zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso deprivation of zzso cells for 3 days leads to an enhanced zzso and zzso level of zzso gene expression zzso with a loss of the divergent regulatory effect of zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso still enhances the zzso expression but it zzso all zzso effects on zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso influences the signal zzso of the zzso zzso by separate mechanisms and that the manifestation of the zzso action is modulated by the growth state of the cell zzso
