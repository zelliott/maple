The regulation of zzso T cell development into different zzso cell zzso is zzso by a complex interplay between the zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions on the T cell and the zzso presenting cell, and the potency of T cell zzso zzso zzso In this review we will focus on how zzso in the strength of zzso zzso initiate different signal zzso patterns which regulate the zzso fate of zzso T zzso We propose a model in which specific signals are required to initiate zzso zzso but that this zzso can be inhibited following a strong zzso zzso
