In bacterial zzso regulatory systems zzso zzso of zzso response regulators is essential for zzso the activated systems to the zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso a major zzso zzso of zzso zzso the mechanism for zzso of the response regulator zzso has not been zzso Here we report that two auxiliary proteins from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a protein complex with the sensor zzso zzso and activate the sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity required the presence of both zzso and zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso zzso the expression of zzso a zzso target with low affinity for zzso zzso was greatly reduced, while the expression of zzso a zzso target with high affinity for zzso zzso was not, demonstrating a differential effect of zzso on zzso target gene zzso When expression of zzso was zzso most zzso target genes were induced at an elevated zzso Since the expression of zzso and zzso is induced by the zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso zzso returns to the zzso state by a negative feedback zzso
