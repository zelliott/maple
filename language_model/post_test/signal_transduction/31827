zzso an zzso zzso isolated from zzso has zzso activities against zzso stress and zzso The present study investigated the in zzso protective effect of zzso on zzso rats by middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and the zzso effects of zzso and mechanisms against zzso of zzso cells by zzso deprivation zzso in zzso Male zzso rats were subjected to treatment with zzso at 15, 30 and 60 zzso immediately after zzso zzso zzso volume and zzso cell zzso were assessed following 24 h zzso zzso primary rat zzso cells were exposed to zzso at the zzso of zzso 25 and 50 zzso during 4 h of zzso The effects of zzso were evaluated in terms of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear and zzso fraction zzso zzso and zzso nuclear transfer of zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso volume and inhibited the zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso in zzso zzso increased cell viability and release of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso these effects were suppressed by zzso zzso also attenuated the increases in the zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso In addition, zzso at 25 and 50 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as inhibited nuclear zzso activity triggered via zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso In conclusion, zzso displays a zzso effect on zzso rats in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells by attenuating inflammatory factors and zzso zzso in zzso
