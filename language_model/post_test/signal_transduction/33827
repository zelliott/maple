zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses two distinct life cycles, zzso replication and zzso An immediate early viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the virus switch from zzso to active zzso 

To identify cellular pathways that reactivate zzso zzso an zzso viral early promoter, zzso coupled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso reporter was delivered into a zzso zzso infected B cell zzso Five different chemical libraries with defined cellular targets were screened for their ability to induce the zzso promoter as an indication of zzso zzso 

We identified seven chemicals that disrupted zzso in zzso zzso infected B cells, five being zzso zzso We showed that these chemicals reactivate zzso through interacting with zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso receptors and the associated zzso and zzso zzso pathways to detect and transmit stress signals for zzso 

Our study identified two cellular signaling pathways that mediate zzso zzso and provided a chemical zzso approach to identify new zzso zzso with therapeutic potential against zzso associated zzso
