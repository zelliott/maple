zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso is essential for maintaining normal function of the adult heart and is known to play an important role in zzso zzso In the present study, we observed that zzso zzso transgenic zzso mice had zzso dysfunction with decreased fractional zzso zzso increased zzso diameter zzso at 5 months of age, increased heart fibrosis, and increased zzso expression of zzso and zzso at 1, 3, 5 and 7 months of age compared to zzso zzso zzso However, the left zzso anterior wall thickness at zzso zzso of the zzso mice was not different than the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were increased due to zzso expression in zzso mice compared with the zzso mice at 3 and 7 months of zzso Additionally, activated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso to cardiac zzso isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso and increased expression of type I collagen in cultured primary cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, could inhibit the expression of type I collagen in the cultured primary cardiac zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso of the heart zzso in zzso In addition, a zzso zzso showed that zzso increased proliferation of cardiac zzso by zzso compared with cells without zzso zzso zzso proliferation was completely diminished in the presence of zzso These results suggest that zzso induced heart zzso and proliferation of cardiac zzso occurs through zzso of the zzso zzso
