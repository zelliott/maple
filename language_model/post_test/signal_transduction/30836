The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we showed that zzso of full-length zzso into breast and zzso cancer cells could provoke zzso zzso and induce an enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso in highly zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso and further brought on significant protection for tumor cells against zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso with two zzso zzso targeting the same zzso zzso or simply by administration with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the ability of zzso to protect cells from undergoing zzso induced by zzso We further showed that zzso zzso protected against zzso zzso by regulating zzso levels in a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso might play an important role in inducing resistance to zzso in breast and zzso cancer zzso Our results therefore indicate that the zzso of zzso promoted by zzso attachment, might be critical in determining whether cells survive or undergo zzso zzso the zzso zzso might be a promising strategy for enhancing sensitivity to zzso in breast or zzso zzso
