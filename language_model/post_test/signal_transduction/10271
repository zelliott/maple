The lateral organization of receptors on cell surfaces is critically important to their zzso many receptors transmit zzso signals when redistributed into zzso while the response of others is zzso by their zzso zzso contact can play a crucial role in zzso zzso even when the bonds between receptors on one cell and zzso on the other are zzso zzso Carlo simulations on a zzso model were carried out to determine whether weak zzso interactions among receptors in one zzso and among zzso in another, can work zzso to give large-scale zzso when the two zzso are brought into zzso The simulations give support to such a zzso zzso In addition, because zzso is a cooperative process akin to a phase zzso individual receptors and zzso may undergo repeated binding and zzso while in a clustered zzso and a single zzso could interact with multiple different zzso zzso The results suggest a resolution of the zzso between serial triggering and zzso models of T cell zzso
