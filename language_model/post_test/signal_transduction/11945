To discuss the significance of zzso zzso and nuclear factor of active T cells 1 zzso in the damage mechanism of the zzso of rats with chronic zzso 

zzso clear class zzso male rats, aging 6 zzso were randomly divided into 3 groups, 6 rats in zzso The rats of control group were fed with tap water zzso zzso 1 zzso and the experimental rats were exposed to zzso zzso group: 5 zzso higher group: 50 zzso to established the chronic zzso zzso After 8 months, we observed the occurrence of dental zzso among rats in different groups, and the contents of urine zzso were detected by zzso zzso selective zzso zzso The body of the rats were weighted as well as their zzso The zzso zzso were stained with zzso and observed under light microscope to find the zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso protein and zzso in zzso were detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The number of rats which was found dental zzso were separately 0, 4 and 5 in control group, low dose group and high dose group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The contents of urine zzso were gradually increased in control group, low group and high group, which were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The body weight were significantly different in all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso weight were without statistical difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with the control group, the zzso structures were damaged in the experimental groups and especially significant in high dose zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso were increased by the zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso were separately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were positive correlation between the expression of zzso and zzso protein and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso 

The changes in the signaling zzso of expression of zzso may be involved in the injury mechanism of zzso zzso of rats with chronic zzso
