zzso that contain the zzso zzso attachment site, together with the zzso that serve as receptors for them, constitute a major recognition system for cell zzso The zzso sequence is the cell attachment site of a large number of adhesive zzso zzso blood, and cell surface zzso and nearly half of the over 20 known zzso recognize this sequence in their zzso protein zzso Some other zzso bind to related sequences in their zzso The zzso activity of zzso proteins can be reproduced by short synthetic peptides containing the zzso zzso Such peptides promote cell zzso when zzso onto a surface, and inhibit it when presented to cells in zzso zzso that bind selectively to only one or a few of the zzso zzso can be designed by zzso peptides with selected sequences around the zzso and by zzso zzso zzso As the zzso cell attachment influences and regulates cell migration, growth, zzso and zzso the zzso peptides and mimics can be used to probe zzso functions in various biological zzso Drug design based on the zzso structure may provide new treatments for diseases such as zzso zzso and zzso
