The zzso zzso zzso has a critical role in promoting zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that zzso the zzso zzso including the activity of zzso in zzso stem cells, are not completely zzso In the present study, we generated induced zzso stem cells zzso from bovine zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso factor 4 zzso The cells were supplemented with leukemia zzso factor and bone zzso protein 4, which maintained and stabilized the expression of zzso genes and zzso The zzso were used to assess the zzso activity following exposure to zzso zzso including di zzso zzso di zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso in zzso and induced a higher ratio of zzso thereby favoring zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso in a zzso manner and enhanced the zzso activity of zzso The forced expression of zzso and zzso of zzso led to the rescue of the zzso zzso Overall, this study suggests that zzso zzso are a useful system for screening the toxicity of environmental zzso and examining their effect on the maintenance of zzso and zzso as well as for identifying the zzso signaling zzso that are zzso by these zzso
