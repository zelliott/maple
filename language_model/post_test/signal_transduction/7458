zzso in synaptic transmission have been implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurological zzso The discovery of zzso zzso of proteins that regulate zzso represents a novel therapeutic strategy for these zzso However, zzso screening zzso approaches in primary zzso have been limited by challenges in preparing and applying primary zzso cultures under conditions required for generating sufficiently robust and sensitive zzso zzso zzso I is an abundant zzso protein that plays a critical role in zzso through zzso synaptic zzso to the zzso zzso It has several zzso sites that regulate its zzso of synaptic zzso trafficking and, therefore, the efficacy of synaptic zzso Here, we describe the development of a zzso sensitive, and homogeneous zzso to detect zzso I zzso in primary cortical zzso in zzso plates using zzso zzso From results of a pilot screening campaign, we show that the zzso can identify compounds that zzso zzso I zzso via multiple signaling zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and future development of additional primary zzso zzso zzso provides an attractive approach for discovery of novel classes of therapeutic candidates for a variety of zzso zzso
