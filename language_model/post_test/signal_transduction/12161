We try to find out the influence of traditional Chinese Medicine zzso zzso zzso on zzso signal zzso in the lung of asthma airway zzso 

Mice were zzso and challenged by zzso to establish a model of zzso To assess the effects of zzso on the mice, animals of the zzso groups were treated with zzso Data were achieved by using techniques as zzso counting cell number of zzso zzso the amount of collagen deposition by zzso zzso performing zzso and zzso for zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso of collagen in airway wall greatly increased at the model group compared with that of the normal zzso In contrast, these decreased at the zzso zzso As compared with the control group, zzso expression also decreased at both zzso and protein level at the zzso group versus increased both at the model zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased only at the model group and partly restored at the zzso zzso 

zzso greatly improves the symptoms of asthma airway zzso by zzso the expression of zzso and zzso the amount of zzso
