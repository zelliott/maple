The mechanism of zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso is zzso it depends on sodium intake and may be zzso by changing the zzso activity of the zzso oxide zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso The effects of zzso zzso a selective A1 zzso zzso on zzso zzso were examined in zzso rats maintained on high sodium zzso or low sodium zzso zzso Total zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso as well as superficial cortical zzso outer zzso zzso and inner zzso zzso flows were determined by zzso In HS rats, zzso zzso infusions of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats, zzso increased zzso zzso and other zzso decreased zzso In zzso rats, zzso with zzso zzso zzso prevented the A1 zzso decrease in zzso and zzso but not zzso the response in zzso was not zzso zzso with zzso prevented the decreases in zzso zzso and zzso and did not change the response of zzso Thus, within the zzso the zzso that follows A1 zzso zzso results both from zzso of NO synthesis and from stimulation of zzso products of the zzso zzso In the outer zzso the latter products seem exclusively responsible for zzso zzso The observation that in zzso rats zzso was not affected by stimulation of zzso A1 receptors suggests that limiting salt intake may help protect zzso zzso against zzso stimuli which have the potential to disturb long-term control of zzso zzso
