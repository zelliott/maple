zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated in both zzso and pathological zzso however, little is known about what regulates its zzso In this study, retinal zzso zzso cells and zzso were exposed to varying zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso expression measured by zzso and Western zzso Both zzso zzso and protein were observed in zzso zzso zzso cells with only weak expression in zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso (15 zzso induced an increase in expression of zzso at both the zzso and protein level while no effect was observed for zzso The increase in zzso expression could be totally abolished by blocking zzso and in the case of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was largely inhibited by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso and partially by zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso C zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso expression via the zzso zzso zzso and partially through zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso zzso the contribution of zzso in zzso via more than one zzso zzso and that zzso as occurs in diabetes, is an important regulator of zzso expression via zzso zzso
