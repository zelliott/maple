zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of collagen zzso with strong zzso zzso zzso has been considered as a highly specific inhibitor of zzso cell proliferation and migration through interaction with its zzso on the surface of zzso zzso Recently, direct zzso effects of zzso in colon cancer cells and head and neck zzso cell zzso cells has been zzso However, its effect on lung cancer cells has not been zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of zzso on in zzso lung cancer cell function and to identify its zzso on lung cancer zzso We revealed that zzso zzso is capable of being a functional zzso zzso among several zzso that are expressed on zzso lung cancer zzso lung cancer zzso zzso We further demonstrated that the zzso interaction zzso various in zzso biological functions of LLC cells as we revealed that immobilized zzso helps in LLC cell zzso and migration in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited LLC cell proliferation and induced zzso Interestingly, zzso did not demonstrate any zzso activity against the other zzso lung cancer cell line, zzso that lacks zzso zzso but binds to immobilized zzso through the zzso zzso In addition, the binding of zzso to zzso zzso on LLC cells induced zzso of focal zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso may play an important role in lung cancer cell zzso
