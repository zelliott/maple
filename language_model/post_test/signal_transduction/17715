The zzso zzso family is a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso have been demonstrated to interact with growth factors, act as zzso and zzso growth factor zzso Here we show that based on zzso array analysis, zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso By northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso was found to be zzso in 29 of 52 cases of zzso zzso By Western zzso analysis carried out with a zzso zzso zzso we generated, the zzso protein was found to be zzso in 6 zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as 22 tumors zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso in liver cancer, we analyzed its effects on cell growth of zzso zzso zzso of zzso modulated cell proliferation by zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso and bone zzso protein 7 zzso zzso An interaction of zzso and zzso was revealed by zzso while zzso was found to inhibit zzso signaling through the zzso zzso by reporter gene zzso The zzso of growth factors by zzso may help explain its role in liver zzso In addition, the ability of zzso cells to express zzso at high levels may serve as a new tumor marker for zzso
