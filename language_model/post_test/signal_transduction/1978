We have shown previously that when zzso cultures of zzso cells are exposed to very low zzso of alpha zzso zzso zzso only zzso of the cell zzso are traversed by a zzso genetic effects, including specific gene zzso and sister zzso exchanges, are induced in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso Little, Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Little, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present experiments were designed to determine whether signaling pathways arising in the cell membrane may mediate this zzso zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso an agent that zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso membrane zzso and the induction of sister zzso exchange and zzso zzso by very low zzso of alpha particles zzso doses zzso zzso was zzso zzso completely suppressed the induction of both genetic effects in bystander zzso After exposure to 10 zzso when most zzso occurred in directly zzso cells, no zzso effect of zzso was zzso These results suggest that membrane signaling may play an important role in the bystander effect of zzso On the other hand, the effects in directly zzso cells do not appear to be zzso via the cell zzso
