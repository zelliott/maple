zzso control many zzso and zzso processes in multiple zzso and, like other zzso zzso members, signal via type II zzso and type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso receptors known to bind at least a dozen zzso zzso zzso including zzso myostatin, several zzso and zzso Here we zzso a new screening procedure to rapidly identify zzso zzso with loss of signaling zzso Our goal was to identify zzso zzso able to bind zzso but unable to bind zzso and which would be, therefore, candidate type II zzso zzso zzso Using the structure of zzso bound to its type I zzso zzso as a guide, we introduced zzso in the context of the zzso zzso zzso and assessed the signaling activity of the resulting zzso zzso We identified several zzso in the finger zzso zzso zzso and wrist zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso with reduced signaling zzso Of these the zzso zzso displayed the lowest signaling activity while retaining zzso affinity for zzso Unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso was unable to form a zzso complex with zzso in the presence of zzso indicating that its ability to bind zzso was zzso This data suggested that the zzso zzso might be capable of modulating signaling of zzso and related zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso antagonized zzso and myostatin, but not zzso signaling in zzso cells, indicating it may be generally capable of blocking zzso that signal via zzso
