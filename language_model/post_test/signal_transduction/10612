zzso zzso zzso the human gastric zzso and zzso an inflammatory response that is a trigger for gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been shown to be zzso in gastric zzso cells infected with zzso zzso and might contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to extend the knowledge about the effect of zzso zzso infection on zzso expression by gastric zzso cells, the zzso of zzso the zzso properties of the zzso and the zzso signaling pathways required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced more than zzso by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso strains carrying the zzso island zzso zzso zzso strains with zzso in the zzso and a defective type IV zzso system had no effect on zzso Double zzso revealed strong zzso zzso in zzso cells of gastric zzso at sites of bacterial zzso In zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and tumor necrosis zzso but these regulatory mechanisms are not operating in zzso zzso infection as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to suppress the zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso showed a significantly reduced potential to degrade zzso basement zzso Our results suggest that in gastric zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso in a type IV zzso zzso manner via zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is further implicated in complex processes induced by zzso zzso resulting in tissue degradation and zzso of the gastric zzso
