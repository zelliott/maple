A mouse zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso The zzso markedly induced spread formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to as zzso zzso but not that of the resting zzso zzso This spread formation was completely blocked in the presence of zzso D or zzso It was partially blocked by an zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is capable of zzso a signal for spread formation of the zzso zzso
