The availability of numerous complete zzso sequences of zzso and several zzso zzso sequences provides for new insights into the origin of unique functional systems of the zzso Several key zzso of the zzso machinery, including the zzso and zzso families of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso and zzso zzso zzso have diverse zzso in bacteria, but not in zzso zzso analysis strongly suggests a zzso origin for zzso and the zzso zzso whereas acquisition from zzso appears to be the most likely scenario for zzso The zzso of zzso proteins are particularly abundant and diverse in bacteria that undergo complex development, such as zzso zzso and zzso the latter being zzso of the zzso In these bacteria, the zzso zzso typically form zzso zzso which are known or zzso to participate in signal zzso and regulation of gene zzso Some of these bacterial zzso proteins contain zzso between zzso zzso such as zzso fused with a zzso or a zzso zzso Thus, bacterial zzso of zzso zzso machinery components might functionally and physically interact with each other as parts of signaling pathways that remain to be zzso An emerging scenario of the origin of the zzso zzso system involves acquisition of several central zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso and probably also as a result of zzso additional horizontal gene transfer events, which was followed by recruitment of newly emerging zzso zzso as zzso
