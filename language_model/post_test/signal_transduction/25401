zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster is predicted to be a zzso signal zzso system involved in sensing signals and regulating gene zzso zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso production, suggesting both genes play important roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to cultures of a zzso zzso that lost the capability for zzso zzso production and structural gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso production was normally zzso The zzso of zzso was no longer induced by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso disruption zzso suggesting that zzso plays an essential role in the signal zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso indicated that zzso has the ability to zzso and subsequently transfer the zzso group to the downstream zzso protein to carry on signal zzso zzso shift zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso reporter gene expression zzso showed the specific binding of zzso to the zzso promoter, indicating that zzso regulates zzso expression by direct binding between zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso itself and regulated via the zzso signal zzso system zzso
