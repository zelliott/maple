The zzso donors folate zzso zzso and vitamin B12 are zzso of the zzso metabolism that has a key role in zzso zzso and thus in zzso and zzso zzso Low dietary zzso of folate and vitamin B12 are zzso especially in pregnant women and in the elderly, and zzso constitutes a risk factor for various diseases, including neurological and zzso zzso In this respect, both vitamins are essential for normal brain development, and have a role in zzso and in the maintenance of zzso zzso The consequences of a zzso donor zzso zzso were studied both in zzso in rats exposed in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was associated with growth zzso at embryonic day 20 zzso and zzso with long-term brain defects in selective zzso zzso and protein levels of the zzso factor zzso were found to be decreased in the brains of deprived fetuses and in zzso zzso (62 and zzso for total zzso zzso respectively), along with a strong reduction in its zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso Vitamin shortage also affected upstream zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as downstream target gene products zzso and zzso thus promoting zzso zzso the expression of the zzso regulator zzso was zzso in zzso conditions zzso and its zzso by using zzso partly restored zzso signaling in zzso zzso by increasing specifically the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso improved the zzso of deprived cells, with enhanced zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso would be a key factor in the deleterious effects of zzso on brain zzso
