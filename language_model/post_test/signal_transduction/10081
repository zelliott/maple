zzso small zzso are involved in the regulation of many processes essential for the zzso of the zzso body zzso Recently, we identified the gene of novel small zzso zzso which is specifically expressed at the anterior margin of the neural plate of the zzso zzso zzso Now, we demonstrate that zzso and its zzso in other species constitute a novel protein family, distinct from the previously known families of small zzso We show that the expression of zzso begins during zzso throughout the anterior zzso and is activated by the zzso zzso factor zzso however, later on, zzso expression is inhibited in the anterior neural plate by another zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso functioning by the zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso results in severe zzso of the zzso and derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso although the observed abnormalities can be rescued by zzso of the zzso zzso they cannot be rescued by the zzso of the closest zzso zzso from another family of small zzso zzso This fact indicates functional specificity of the zzso signaling zzso At the molecular level, zzso of zzso zzso the expression of several regulators of the anterior neural plate and folds zzso such as zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and interferes with zzso signaling within the anterior zzso By contrast, expression of the zzso regulator zzso and its target zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso Together, the data obtained indicate that zzso is an essential component of the signaling network that patterns the early anterior neural plate and the adjacent zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
