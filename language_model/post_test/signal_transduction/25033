The effects of zzso on the infectious disease process have only been studied at the level of the host immune response and indicate a zzso of the immune mechanism in humans and zzso zzso it is necessary to assess potential changes in microbial zzso associated with zzso which may impact the probability of zzso infectious zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of altered zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grown under modeled zzso zzso were more virulent and were recovered in higher numbers from the zzso zzso and liver following oral infection compared to organisms grown under normal zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were more resistant to acid stress and zzso killing and exhibited significant differences in protein synthesis than did zzso zzso Our results indicate that the environment created by simulated zzso represents a novel environmental regulatory factor of zzso zzso
