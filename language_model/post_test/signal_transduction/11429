To address the molecular mechanism of T cell zzso zzso zzso we have formulated a model for T cell zzso termed the zzso model, in which the density of zzso on the T cell surface, the density of zzso on the presenting surface, and their corresponding two-dimensional affinity determine the level of T cell zzso When fitted to T cell responses against zzso zzso immobilized on plastic surfaces, the zzso model adequately simulated changes in cellular zzso as a result of varying zzso affinity and zzso zzso These observations further demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso density in determining zzso zzso Moreover, it was found that the functional two-dimensional affinity of zzso zzso was affected by the chemical composition of the zzso zzso This makes it possible that zzso zzso zzso despite their low affinity in solution, are of optimal two-dimensional affinity thereby allowing effective zzso binding under zzso conditions, zzso at low zzso zzso in cellular zzso
