zzso signaling is broadly used to regulate zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso At 28 degrees zzso degrees C, zzso clones exhibit a full-blown loss of zzso signaling in all zzso zzso However, at 18 degrees C only a mild zzso zzso is zzso In zzso analyses reveal that the target of zzso is the zzso domain of zzso zzso accumulates zzso and at the cell membrane of zzso cells but fails to be properly zzso despite normal binding to zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein with a highly zzso zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso is a protein zzso capable of adding zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso repeats with the consensus zzso zzso These data indicate that by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso regulates its folding and/or trafficking and allows signaling at the cell zzso
