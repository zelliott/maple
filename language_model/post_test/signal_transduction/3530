The zzso and zzso lineages originate from zzso primordial germ cells in response to zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The signals required for male germ cell commitment and their entry into zzso arrest remain largely zzso Recent data show that the zzso zzso is up regulated in the zzso zzso indicating that it may be involved in male germ cell zzso In this study genetic analysis of zzso zzso shows that zzso is required for germ cell zzso zzso germ cells in zzso mice lose expression of key germ cell zzso zzso express cell cycle markers and undergo zzso Surprisingly, a similar zzso was not detected in zzso mice indicating that either zzso with a zzso related gene might compensate for its loss, or that zzso operates in a zzso independent manner in mouse zzso germ zzso Either way, this study identifies the zzso zzso as a novel component of the zzso male germ cell development zzso
