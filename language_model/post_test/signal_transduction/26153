zzso dysfunction due to loss of zzso plays an important role in diabetes, and stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso drugs improves zzso zzso In a search for potent zzso of zzso zzso we examined the effects and mechanisms of zzso and zzso acid zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso and possible zzso pathways were zzso 

Exposure of zzso cells to zzso or LA for 24 h increased the number and zzso mass per zzso Such treatment also increased zzso DNA copy number, protein levels and expression of zzso factors involved in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso factor A and nuclear respiratory factor zzso zzso produced these effects at zzso of 1 and 10 zzso whereas LA was most effective at 100 zzso At 10 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso and zzso The potency of zzso was zzso greater than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and formation of zzso zzso of zzso (with small interfering zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso which was also blocked by the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso G zzso zzso zzso Thus, stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso involved zzso via the zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and may have potential therapeutic application in obesity and zzso
