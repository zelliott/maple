The zzso zzso is zzso in a wide array of human zzso most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard zzso Although the identification of specific zzso has led to the development of clinically effective, zzso targeted therapies in some cases, zzso has remained zzso to this zzso A complementary strategy for targeting zzso is to identify gene products that, when zzso result in cell death only in the presence of an zzso zzso Here we have used systematic zzso interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of zzso zzso and found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was selectively essential in cells that contain zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on zzso zzso zzso In these cells, zzso activated zzso zzso signals involving zzso and zzso (also known as zzso that were essential for survival, providing zzso insights into this synthetic lethal zzso These observations indicate that zzso and zzso zzso are essential in zzso zzso zzso and establish a general approach for the rational identification of zzso pathways in zzso
