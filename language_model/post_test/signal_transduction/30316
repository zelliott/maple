zzso is an oral small zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso family zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso Given the central importance of zzso in zzso signals from the zzso zzso zzso signaling complex and the potent ability of zzso to inhibit zzso activity, we hypothesized this agent could provide a novel route of zzso via targeted zzso of zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso signal zzso cellular zzso zzso production, and in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso does not induce zzso because the effect is zzso or may be overcome by signals bypassing the zzso such as zzso zzso Signal zzso and zzso responses via zzso remain essentially zzso suggesting that zzso displays specificity for zzso zzso In addition, zzso combined with zzso A or zzso led to a much more potent zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that targeted zzso of zzso could be a useful adjunct for enhanced zzso In combination with currently available zzso agents, zzso zzso could potentially increase zzso efficacy while minimizing toxicity of individual zzso
