To outline the progress being made in the understanding of acquired resistance to long term therapy with the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen and zzso and zzso zzso The question to be addressed is how we can amplify the new biology of zzso zzso to create more complete responses in zzso zzso treated zzso breast zzso 

Three questions are posed and zzso zzso Do we know how zzso zzso zzso Can we improve zzso zzso zzso zzso Can we enhance zzso zzso The new player in zzso action is zzso and there are new drugs specific for this target to trigger zzso Similarly, zzso drugs can be integrated into zzso zzso therapy or to enhance zzso zzso in Phase II zzso resistant breast zzso The goal is to reduce the development of acquired zzso resistance or undermine the resistance of breast cancer cells to undergo zzso with zzso zzso Finally, drugs to reduce the synthesis of zzso a zzso zzso compound associated with drug resistance, can enhance zzso zzso 

We propose an integrated approach for the rapid testing of agents to blunt survival pathways and amplify zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Phase II resistant zzso breast zzso This zzso platform will provide rapid clinical results to predict efficacy in large scale clinical zzso
