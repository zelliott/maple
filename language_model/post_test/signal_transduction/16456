zzso zzso treatment exerts zzso zzso actions via zzso signal zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we examined the effect of zzso treatment on zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice and the role of zzso zzso action in this zzso Mice given an zzso acid zzso injection into the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso exhibited zzso cell loss in the zzso and zzso zzso fiber loss in the zzso A single injection of zzso after zzso zzso did not have an effect on zzso cell loss in the zzso but it restored the zzso zzso fiber density in the zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The most effective zzso fiber restoration was observed with 33 zzso zzso treatment at 1 h after zzso zzso The zzso zzso fiber restoration was absent in zzso zzso zzso knockout mice in zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso by zzso induced zzso zzso zzso Selective blockade of the zzso or protein zzso A zzso in zzso prevented zzso ability to restore zzso fiber zzso Finally, studies in intact female mice revealed an zzso zzso effect that was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that a single zzso treatment restores the zzso fiber loss in the cortex, regardless of zzso zzso zzso They also reveal the critical role of zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso action in the zzso system in zzso
