zzso receptors zzso are a family of innate immune system receptors responsible for recognizing zzso zzso molecular patterns zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways that lead to the zzso of a variety of zzso molecules and the synthesis and zzso of various zzso and zzso by cells of the innate immune zzso zzso innate immune responses are a prerequisite for the generation of most zzso immune responses, and in the case of B cells, zzso directly regulate signaling from the zzso zzso zzso The outcome of zzso signaling is determined, in part, by the cells in which they are expressed and by the selective use of signaling zzso Recent studies suggest that, in addition, both the zzso recognition by zzso and the functional outcome of zzso binding are governed by the zzso location of the zzso and their signaling zzso In this review we describe what is known about the zzso trafficking and zzso of zzso in innate system's zzso cells and zzso and in zzso system's B cells, highlighting how location regulates zzso zzso
