It is clinically relevant and of zzso interest to investigate whether zzso insulin resistance depends on the timing of zzso exposure relative to when insulin sensitivity is zzso 

zzso insulin resistance is rapidly zzso 

Eight male zzso patients underwent a zzso zzso zzso clamp zzso in a zzso crossover design receiving either no zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso in total) that terminated 5 h before the clamp zzso 1), or a similar zzso infusion timed to continue during the first hour of the clamp zzso zzso A muscle biopsy was obtained 30 zzso into the zzso The patients were compared with eight healthy zzso control subjects zzso zzso 

The zzso infusion rate, indirect zzso and free fatty acid metabolism were zzso In muscle zzso protein zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5, zzso and zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso and gene expression of zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso sensitivity differed significantly between the zzso studies zzso zzso zzso with distinct insulin resistance in study 2 and increased insulin sensitivity in study 0 zzso under the zzso infusion rate curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 166 zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 136 zzso 2) zzso 1492 zzso 229 zzso zzso Free fatty acid levels and zzso zzso were elevated in response to zzso exposure but became suppressed during the zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was increased in study zzso 

zzso zzso exposure evokes acute insulin resistance that subsides after 5 zzso This zzso zzso should be considered when assessing the impact of zzso on zzso zzso
