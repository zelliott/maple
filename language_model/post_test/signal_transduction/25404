Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known to zzso in zzso the activity of proteins involved in zzso mechanisms, including transient zzso potential zzso channels of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and proteins zzso zzso zzso Here we have tested these two cannabinoids on the activity of the descending zzso of zzso 

zzso activity of ON and OFF zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats was recorded zzso and tail zzso zzso to zzso stimuli were zzso zzso or zzso along with various zzso were injected into the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso reduced the ongoing activity of ON and OFF zzso in zzso rats, whilst inducing zzso responses in the tail zzso These effects were zzso with 3 zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso and were antagonized by selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso also significantly elevated zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso A specific zzso at zzso channels and a synthetic inhibitor of zzso cellular zzso exerted effects similar to those of zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso descending pathways of zzso and caused analgesia by interacting with several target proteins involved in zzso zzso These compounds might represent useful therapeutic agents with multiple mechanisms of zzso
