To investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso rat zzso injury zzso 

Male zzso rats were zzso injected with zzso zzso or saline zzso for 15 zzso Then the hearts were subjected to 30 zzso of global zzso followed by 2 h of zzso zzso function, zzso size and area at risk were zzso Cell zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso DNA zzso and measuring zzso zzso In addition, isolated zzso of zzso rats were zzso with the above drugs, then exposed to zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso Cell zzso was detected using flow zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso were examined with zzso 

Compared to zzso group, administration of zzso (20 zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso size zzso in zzso group vs zzso in zzso group), and improved the zzso function as demonstrated by the increased values of zzso zzso and coronary flow at different zzso time zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly decreased the rate of zzso cells zzso in zzso group vs zzso in zzso group), and reduced zzso activity to nearly a quarter of that in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso and its downstream target zzso and decreased the expression of zzso gene zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso (40 zzso partially countered the protective effects induced by zzso zzso In isolated zzso zzso exerted similar protective effects as shown in the ex zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reduces zzso size and improves cardiac function in an zzso rat zzso injury model via zzso of zzso signal zzso
