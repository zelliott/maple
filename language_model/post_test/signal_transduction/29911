We have shown that zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso from anterior zzso zzso zzso the cortical zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso stabilization is accompanied by zzso zzso cable zzso and cell zzso zzso Our aim was to identify the mechanisms involved in zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso increased the association of zzso II with the cell cortex, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso interaction to stabilize cortical zzso zzso This notion was supported by the finding that zzso of zzso interaction blocked zzso zzso zzso In addition, our results showed that zzso zzso association with the cell periphery may be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso filament zzso may be zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the present results provide evidence that zzso II is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso filaments in zzso and that zzso cortical zzso filament assembly and stabilization involve the zzso of zzso II to the cell zzso This effect requires, among other things, zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
