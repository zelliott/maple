zzso root architecture is established by multiple intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso zzso gravity and zzso signals and is established, in part, by directed root zzso We show that zzso exposure of zzso zzso at the root tip in zzso zzso zzso promotes cell zzso that is zzso by zzso in a zzso G zzso zzso This mode of zzso signaling requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, at a zzso its zzso type B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for full zzso while type A response regulators act zzso to zzso this zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its downstream signaling element zzso zzso are required for zzso root cell zzso zzso and positive feedback zzso are reinforced by zzso regulation of the expression of the genes zzso these elements in both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso transport facilitated by zzso as well as zzso signaling through control of the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso root cell zzso This action lies downstream of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling in this response operates independently of the zzso signal touch, although zzso filament organization, which is important in the touch response, may be important for this response, since zzso B can induce similar zzso This root growth response may have zzso significance, since zzso responsiveness is zzso related to root zzso and zzso two root behaviors known to be important for zzso
