In zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso sensor domain zzso controls an zzso zzso zzso domain, thereby enabling immediate initiation of zzso signals by membrane zzso The existence of such a mechanism in zzso has remained zzso despite the presence of zzso proteins in zzso cells, in particular in zzso precursor zzso Here we demonstrate zzso of a human zzso zzso by an zzso zzso By engineering a zzso zzso with enhanced plasma membrane targeting containing the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is a zzso whose zzso zzso is zzso In the zzso zzso activity is controlled by membrane potential via zzso zzso zzso binding zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso is a control module that zzso signaling through the zzso domain and indicate a role for zzso zzso signaling in zzso
