zzso pine zzso zzso zzso a number of small, zzso zzso proteins zzso in response to challenges with zzso pathogens such as zzso zzso although their biological role has been zzso Here, we examined the expression patterns of these zzso as well as the structure and function of the zzso zzso Northern blots and quantitative real time zzso showed increased levels of expression that are sustained during the interactions of host trees with zzso but not zzso consistent with a function in conifer tree zzso Furthermore, the genes were zzso after treatment with salicylic acid and an zzso zzso zzso but neither zzso zzso nor zzso induced zzso indicating that zzso gene expression is independent of the zzso acid signaling zzso The zzso zzso one of the proteins was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein had zzso activity against zzso zzso and caused zzso changes in its zzso and zzso It was directly shown to bind soluble and zzso zzso specifically and with high zzso Furthermore, addition of zzso zzso is linked to higher levels of zzso expression in the zzso zzso modeling and sequence comparisons suggest that a zzso patch on the surface of the zzso zzso is a zzso site that can accommodate approximately four sugar zzso We conclude that these proteins belong to a new family of zzso proteins zzso that are likely to act by binding the zzso that are a major component of zzso cell zzso
