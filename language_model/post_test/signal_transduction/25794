zzso zzso have the unique property of zzso zzso zzso zzso in most cells but inhibit zzso signaling in cells expressing zzso zzso in which zzso activity is too low to support this zzso These drugs thus selectively inhibit zzso signaling in tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso have remarkable clinical activity in zzso with zzso zzso however, resistance invariably zzso Three recent papers reveal that acquired resistance may be due to mechanisms that cause zzso signaling to become insensitive to zzso zzso or that reduce the dependence of the tumor on zzso signaling through zzso of other zzso
