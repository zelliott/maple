To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of CA on acute zzso zzso rolling and zzso in mouse cerebral zzso 

Male zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso zzso and CA (10 zzso The effect of CA on zzso zzso rolling and zzso in cerebral vessels was assessed using zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso expression on zzso were determined by flow zzso zzso and zzso expression in cerebrovascular zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso were determined by zzso zzso and Western zzso 

CA inhibited zzso zzso rolling and zzso decreased zzso production in zzso and reduced plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso CA reduced the zzso and zzso expression on cerebrovascular zzso and zzso on zzso caused by zzso Of zzso CA depressed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso 

CA inhibited zzso zzso rolling and zzso in cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso which is related to the suppression of the zzso zzso in zzso
