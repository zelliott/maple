Cellular activities that lead to zzso are zzso by zzso zzso which ultimately result from local zzso of complex gene zzso zzso growth factor zzso signaling is an essential component of the regulatory network present in the embryonic zzso controlling zzso differentiation and pattern zzso However, little is known about how zzso interact with other signaling molecules in these zzso By using cell and organ culture systems, we provide evidence that zzso Sonic zzso zzso bone zzso protein 4 zzso and zzso form a regulatory circuit that is likely relevant for lung development in zzso Our data show that zzso and zzso important for patterning and growth of the lung zzso are zzso regulated by zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we show that zzso regulate expression of zzso zzso and other zzso family zzso Our data support a model in which zzso zzso and zzso counteract the bud promoting effects of zzso and where zzso levels are maintained throughout lung development by other zzso and zzso
