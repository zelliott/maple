zzso zzso exposure has a negative effect on zzso and produces neurological zzso However, its mechanisms of action are incompletely zzso zzso a mixed zzso zzso is an alternative medication for managing pregnant zzso zzso This study provides evidence of decreased zzso and zzso consequences following prenatal exposure to zzso and sheds light on mechanisms of action in a rat model involving administration of zzso injection to pregnant rats starting from gestation day 7 and lasting for 14 days and a cultured zzso zzso zzso of forced swimming test and tail suspension test showed that zzso at zzso day 21 had worse parameters of zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso changes were accompanied by reduction of zzso zzso zzso parameters of neural zzso cells, zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type B zzso protein zzso A zzso activity, and zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso of parallel cell studies further demonstrated a negative impact of zzso on cultured zzso including zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that prenatal exposure to zzso might result in zzso zzso associated with impaired zzso action and decreased zzso in the developing brain of zzso
