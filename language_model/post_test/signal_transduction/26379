The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress has been implicated in a variety of biological zzso however, little is known regarding the involvement of the zzso stress zzso in early zzso or the underlying zzso Here, we showed that the zzso competence of in zzso zzso bovine zzso was highly dependent on the zzso stress zzso Although relative zzso of zzso gene zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were high in zzso and throughout the early stages of zzso development, extensive zzso formation was only detected in zzso zzso Using an zzso and inhibitor of zzso we showed that transient zzso of zzso activity during early zzso development greatly increased the zzso development rate, zzso cell numbers, and zzso zzso these same parameters were reduced by both zzso and prolonged induction of zzso Interestingly, the induction of zzso reduced zzso stress and associated damage, while the zzso defects in zzso zzso were significantly alleviated by zzso stress inhibitor treatment, indicating that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso stress in early zzso zzso these results suggest that early zzso of zzso bovine zzso depends on an appropriate balance between zzso and zzso zzso These findings may increase our understanding of important early zzso events by providing compelling evidence concerning the tight association between zzso and zzso stress, and may contribute to the development of strategies for the production of zzso bovine zzso with high zzso zzso
