zzso oxide zzso has been shown to regulate a variety of zzso functions, including vascular zzso The zzso of NO zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to increase zzso blood zzso The present studies were undertaken to investigate if the increased blood pressure by zzso is associated with enhanced expression of zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso was administered orally into zzso rats for a period of 4 zzso Control rats were given plain tap water zzso The zzso blood pressure was enhanced in zzso rats as compared with control zzso however, the zzso weight ratio was not different in the two zzso The levels of zzso and zzso proteins and their zzso as determined by western and northern zzso respectively, were significantly zzso in hearts from zzso rats, whereas the levels of zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, the effect of low zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso activity zzso functions of zzso was significantly zzso whereas the zzso inhibitions of zzso zzso were completely attenuated in zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso was zzso in both group of rats, the zzso effects of some zzso on zzso zzso activity were diminished in zzso zzso These results suggest the implication of NO in the zzso of zzso protein expression and associated zzso zzso zzso
