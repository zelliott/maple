The recent finding that sheep had long zzso and short zzso zzso receptors provided new tools to further explore zzso signaling to target zzso Here we used zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso to compare the zzso of known key steps of zzso signaling by the two zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although it lacked the last zzso zzso found in other long zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso both responded to zzso stimulation by zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso zzso stimulation of zzso from a promoter made of six repeats of zzso zzso However, although it contains zzso consensus zzso the zzso zzso promoter zzso to zzso was zzso by zzso but not by zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to account for zzso zzso of this milk protein zzso and that sequences of its promoter, other than zzso zzso account for the opposite zzso zzso capabilities of zzso and zzso
