zzso B cells are grouped into two major subsets, zzso and zzso believed to derive from separate zzso We have recently shown that zzso cells, which are characterized by zzso surface zzso specifically exhibit significant levels of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that also in mice zzso expression is restricted to zzso cells and address the potential role of zzso in zzso cell development and zzso Using as a model an zzso zzso we show that, while zzso for zzso cell development, zzso is required for full and sustained zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso triggered by the zzso in zzso zzso zzso The data suggest a potential role for zzso in the achievement of the higher zzso threshold required for productive zzso signaling in zzso as compared to B-2 zzso
