The zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso plays important roles in the zzso of cellular zzso Various zzso zzso exist in zzso cells which share zzso and variable regions as defined by zzso sequence zzso To test whether zzso zzso terminal sequences of distinct zzso can complement each other to yield functional zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso zzso in which zzso acids zzso at the zzso of bovine zzso alpha zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso zzso acids zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso to yield the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was then characterized zzso and zzso and compared with the parental zzso Since zzso analysis of zzso in zzso experimental systems is complicated by multiple zzso zzso and by cellular complexity, we zzso introduced the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso a simple, lower zzso with a short doubling time and well established molecular zzso In zzso the faithfully expressed zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso and were recognized on zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso peptides in a zzso and zzso manner, and, upon zzso increased the cell doubling time and the rate of zzso zzso into zzso In addition, zzso displayed characteristics distinct from normal zzso but virtually indistinguishable from normal zzso Our findings indicate the zzso of zzso function by the zzso zzso zzso
