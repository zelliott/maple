zzso zzso molecules affect the behavior of cells at a zzso Here we discuss how the zzso family member zzso reaches distant cells within the embryonic zzso of zzso We consider three possible zzso free zzso restricted diffusion and active zzso We argue that free diffusion is unlikely to zzso However, a zzso of restricted diffusion may account for zzso zzso It may be that zzso is carried from one side of a cell to the other by a drifting zzso protein such as a specific zzso or a zzso Transfer from zzso would involve release from the donor cell and recapture in an adjacent zzso zzso zzso might be transported by a mechanism akin to zzso This would involve the packaging of zzso in specialized zzso at one end of a cell, active transport across the cell, and zzso fusion and zzso release on the other zzso We describe the evidence in favor and against these two zzso
