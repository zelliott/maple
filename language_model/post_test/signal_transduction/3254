zzso are small zzso proteins present on the cell surface of almost every zzso zzso Through binding with other zzso and zzso zzso they regulate diverse cellular processes ranging from cell zzso and zzso to zzso formation and tumor zzso Here, we provide a brief overview of zzso cellular and clinical studies to illustrate how the multiple functions of this fascinating family of molecules stem from their interplay with multiple molecular zzso In particular, we emphasize the special relationship between zzso and the cell zzso molecules zzso in regulating cell physiology in health and zzso
