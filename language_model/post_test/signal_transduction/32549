Treatment of zzso cells with 1 zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso levels as determined by zzso zzso zzso In parallel studies, nuclear extracts from zzso cells also exhibited decreased binding to a consensus zzso zzso responsive element zzso as determined in a gel mobility shift zzso zzso studies showed that the decreases in nuclear zzso and zzso binding in zzso cells were observed within 1 to 3 h after treatment, respectively, and persisted for up to 24 zzso zzso (10 zzso did not affect the zzso response, whereas 1 zzso zzso an zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso partially blocked zzso of nuclear zzso binding by zzso zzso did not significantly affect steady state zzso zzso levels as determined by Northern analysis or the rate of zzso gene zzso in a nuclear zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso decrease in nuclear zzso levels is an zzso zzso response which occurs at the zzso or zzso zzso
