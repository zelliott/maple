zzso zzso was found to induce inflammatory responses in the airways and exerted as a potent stimulus for PG zzso This study was to determine the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso expression associated with zzso synthesis in zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso markedly increased the expression of zzso and release of zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, whereas zzso remained zzso Both the expression of zzso and the generation of zzso in response to zzso were attenuated by a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso C inhibitor zzso a zzso C inhibitor zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso removal of zzso by addition of zzso plus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso correlated with the degradation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso with dominant negative zzso of zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso synthesis were completely inhibited by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but these two zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is activated by zzso independently of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased expression of zzso zzso with the release of zzso from zzso zzso at least in part, independently zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso
