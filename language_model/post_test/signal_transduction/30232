Spreading depression zzso a wave of zzso activity related to migraine and the zzso zzso features a moving shell of zzso negative potential shift zzso whose generators are poorly zzso We investigated its zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso by zzso the zzso zzso that generate zzso current zzso using field analysis, and the local changes of tissue zzso a major zzso of zzso current zzso A large increase of tissue zzso occurred in times and zzso strata displaying large zzso albeit with different zzso Typically, zzso is composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso lasts much longer, while it becomes gradually restricted to a narrow zzso zzso zzso zzso cells displayed a strong surge of inward current only when zzso affected a small zzso zzso However, when the zzso signal covered most of the main zzso zzso only smaller surges of inward current developed at the outer zzso rims of a wide zzso current zzso zzso reconstruction showed that this effect was due to strong spatial cancellation of the inward and outward currents in zzso zzso and zzso regions of individual zzso zzso despite former accounts of large zzso increase, the net zzso is small and the large zzso zzso mostly due to increased tissue zzso The particular zzso evolution indicates an initial explosive opening of zzso along most of the zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso closure towards the zzso zzso The zzso of these mechanisms to zzso in other brain regions is zzso
