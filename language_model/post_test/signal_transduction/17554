The stimulation of zzso D zzso activity by zzso zzso was investigated in rabbit iris zzso zzso with zzso zzso In the presence of zzso ethanol, zzso caused a zzso and zzso increase in the production of zzso zzso Within 30 s the zzso increased zzso formation by zzso and after 5 zzso increased it by zzso The zzso value for zzso zzso formation was found to be 30 zzso This value is appreciably lower than the zzso we previously obtained for zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso but considerably higher than that for zzso acid release (1 zzso zzso formation was significantly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but it was not affected by zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was blocked by zzso and it was not zzso by zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso stimulation of zzso occurs independently of protein zzso C zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this tissue the zzso zzso is probably coupled to the three zzso through several zzso and this appears to be species and zzso type zzso
