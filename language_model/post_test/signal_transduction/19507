zzso zzso is a seven zzso zzso that can activate two separate signaling arms: one through zzso and zzso zzso and a second through recruitment of zzso zzso In some cases downstream targets of the zzso signaling arm are directly inhibited by zzso while in other cases the two pathways are zzso thus zzso act as molecular switches capable of zzso the signal generated by the zzso 

Here we demonstrate that zzso can activate zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a key regulator of cellular energy balance, through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso through interaction with zzso The ultimate outcome of zzso zzso depended on the cell type zzso in cultured zzso with low zzso zzso zzso activated zzso however, in primary fat and liver, zzso only activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso could be zzso with zzso and zzso under baseline conditions from both cultured zzso and primary fat, and its association with both proteins was increased by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to in zzso zzso zzso directly inhibited zzso of zzso by zzso on zzso 

Studies have shown that decreased zzso activity is associated with obesity and Type II zzso while zzso activity is increased with metabolically favorable conditions and cholesterol lowering zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso zzso signaling may act as a molecular switch turning a positive signal to zzso into an zzso zzso
