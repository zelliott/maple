In the previous reports, we showed that the familial Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the fragility to the zzso zzso zzso stress and that zzso mediates zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling in human zzso These results suggest the involvement of zzso stress and zzso in the cell death observed in zzso In this report, we studied the zzso of zzso in the familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso under zzso stress was enhanced by the zzso of the familial zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso is a key zzso involved in the zzso signaling of zzso We also showed that the zzso of zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso without releasing zzso from the zzso Thus, zzso activates downstream zzso independently of zzso zzso signaling and this might contribute to the zzso of zzso To sum up our data, the familial zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso under the zzso stress and results in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso without releasing zzso
