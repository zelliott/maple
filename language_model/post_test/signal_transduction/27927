zzso the specific functions that are zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is key to our understanding of the biological role of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Over the last two decades, there have been numerous reports on the functional roles of zzso zzso However, most studies have been performed with isolated cells and zzso by using specific zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Under such experimental conditions, a clear dissection between the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso for example, that of zzso zzso zzso has been difficult to zzso In order to identify biological processes in which zzso zzso are zzso involved, the genes of zzso zzso I and zzso zzso II have been deleted in zzso This review focuses on the zzso functions that are regulated by zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso I, these functions include the zzso of vascular and gastrointestinal smooth muscle and the zzso of zzso zzso According to its expression pattern, the Type II zzso zzso plays a zzso biological part in zzso zzso and zzso transport in the zzso zzso growth of long bones, and the regulation of the kidney zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso I and II zzso reveal new aspects for the role of zzso zzso in the induction of zzso zzso such as zzso long-term zzso and zzso long-term zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso zzso genes shows that zzso zzso regulate very specifically distinct cellular functions by pathways that are separate from those used by zzso zzso zzso Mice deficient in zzso zzso exhibit severe defects and, therefore, may serve as animal models for several human diseases, including hypertension, zzso gastrointestinal zzso and zzso
