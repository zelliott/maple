In zzso cells, which express high levels of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso addition of a zzso dose of zzso (10 zzso leads to an increase in zzso and also to zzso calcium zzso due to both zzso zzso and influx from zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso fatty acids such as zzso acid (1 to 100 zzso inhibited zzso zzso generation and zzso release from zzso zzso Furthermore, such a treatment completely suppress zzso influx in a zzso zzso At doses capable of suppressing such early signals, zzso acid did not alter the process of zzso zzso of the zzso complex, suggesting that zzso rise did not mediate zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation assessed by either zzso incorporation into DNA, direct cell zzso and microscopic observation was not altered by zzso acid, at doses able to block zzso early zzso In conclusion, suppression of zzso generation and zzso rises by zzso acid did not alter zzso zzso nor zzso cell zzso Such results suggest that zzso rise is not instrumental for zzso cell zzso
