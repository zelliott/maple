We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has the unusual ability to be expressed in different zzso of the embryonic zzso tract zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso depending on sequence elements within the zzso zzso In the present paper, we analyze the expression of the zzso zzso zzso from the related zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso also has the ability to switch expression between gut and zzso + zzso The control of this expression switch zzso on a tandem pair of zzso sites in the zzso zzso region, just as it does in zzso We use sequence alignments and subsequent deletions to identify a region at the zzso of both zzso and zzso that acts as the zzso cryptic zzso zzso whose activity is revealed by removal of the zzso zzso zzso This region contains a zzso binding site for zzso (the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in all cells of the developing zzso and a subset of cells of the developing zzso We propose a model in which the normal expression of zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso factor zzso We propose that, in the zzso (and zzso zzso is normally bound to the zzso zzso sequence but that the zzso function of zzso is kept zzso by a zzso zzso factor binding in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this control zzso is maintained in zzso because zzso expression of zzso is advantageous only under certain zzso or environmental zzso
