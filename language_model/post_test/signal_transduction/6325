To develop a genetically faithful model of zzso with increased tumor zzso compared with the current best model we activated the Sonic zzso zzso zzso by zzso expressing a zzso active form of zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso precursors zzso zzso This resulted in early zzso zzso cell zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Gene expression studies showed an increase in the known zzso targets zzso and zzso that correlated with increasing zzso and tumor zzso zzso and the zzso target zzso zzso were also significantly elevated in zzso tumors showing that zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso In human zzso reverse zzso for zzso and zzso targets revealed zzso of both of these pathways in most tumors when compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso with soluble Delta zzso or gamma zzso zzso resulted in a marked reduction of viable cell numbers in zzso cell lines and primary tumor zzso Treatment of mice with zzso zzso zzso with a gamma zzso inhibitor resulted in decreased proliferation and increased zzso confirming that zzso signaling contributes to human zzso proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso mice and humans have zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso activities, both of which contribute to tumor zzso
