The major zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso signaling specificity have been proposed to be zzso zzso 2 zzso binding sites, zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has multiple functions during development and has eight potential zzso sites in a region zzso terminal to its zzso zzso By analyzing transgenic zzso for three distinct zzso functions, we show that six of eight potential sites function in zzso and that they are required for most, but not all, of zzso zzso A single site is necessary and sufficient to promote zzso zzso Three other sites activate the zzso zzso and are involved only in viability and zzso zzso A fifth site is zzso and can mediate all three zzso zzso An additional site mediates zzso negative zzso zzso zzso binding sites are thus key zzso of both zzso and negative regulation in an intact zzso We suggest two distinct mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso A positive mechanism would promote zzso function through zzso present only in certain cell zzso A negative mechanism would inhibit zzso function through zzso negative zzso
