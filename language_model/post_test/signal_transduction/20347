zzso zzso zzso zzso is often detected at a late stage, hence the identification of new therapies that have potential to block tumor progression is critical for this lethal zzso zzso zzso has been observed in many zzso including zzso however, a zzso role for this cell zzso zzso in disease progression has yet to be zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso results in zzso zzso that zzso the zzso features of human pancreatic cancer providing an excellent animal model to identify genes required for tumor zzso Here we determine the consequences of genetically manipulating zzso expression in a mouse model of zzso zzso mice with reduced zzso expression zzso is, zzso survived zzso longer zzso vs 142 days, zzso than animals expressing two zzso zzso zzso zzso The survival benefit is likely due to a cumulative effect of zzso role in different aspects of zzso including zzso survival, growth, migration and zzso Interestingly, reduced zzso signaling may contribute to the better prognosis for the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso associated with poor prognosis in zzso was reduced in zzso zzso Finally, zzso tumor cells exhibited decreased zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso ability to promote zzso zzso These data support a critical role for zzso in zzso and its potential zzso zzso Additionally, this study provides in zzso genetic evidence that the zzso protein zzso represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
