zzso zzso shares common features in widely different sensory zzso The purpose of this article is to examine the similarities and differences in the underlying mechanisms of zzso in the sensory zzso cells for vision, zzso and zzso One of the major differences between the systems relates to the nature of the zzso In both the visual and zzso systems a zzso mechanism of detection is possible, because the zzso of a zzso or the binding of an zzso zzso provides an energy change significantly greater than the zzso noise in the zzso zzso In hearing, on the other hand, the energy of a zzso is far lower, and detection occurs by a zzso zzso For zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, sensory zzso employs a G protein cascade that is remarkably similar in the two cases, and that is closely zzso to other G protein signaling zzso For auditory and zzso hair cells, zzso operates via a mechanism of direct zzso of the stimulus to zzso channels, in a manner reminiscent of the direct gating of zzso zzso channels in various synaptic zzso The three classes of sensory zzso cell share similarities in their mechanisms of adaptation, and it appears in each case that zzso calcium concentration plays a major role in zzso
