The zzso zzso II zzso and type IV zzso zzso branches of the general zzso zzso in zzso bacteria share many features that suggest a common evolutionary zzso Five components of the zzso the zzso are similar to zzso of type IV zzso Here, we report that when the 15 genes zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso were expressed on a high copy number zzso in zzso coli, one zzso zzso was assembled into zzso zzso Assembly of the zzso zzso required most but not all of the zzso components that are essential for zzso zzso including some with no known zzso in type IV zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso and two outer zzso zzso components were not associated with zzso Thus, zzso is probably the major component of the zzso zzso of a type IV zzso zzso the zzso K-12 gene zzso led to zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso without diminishing zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso can be assembled into zzso zzso
