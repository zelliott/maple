zzso cells are known as zzso protein zzso cells of the anterior lobe of zzso zzso which are not zzso hormones and are presumed to be organ specific stem cells of the zzso Their role in adaptation of the body to stress remains zzso 

To evaluate dynamics of zzso and zzso cells in rats of different age in chronic stress zzso 

zzso rats aged 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were exposed to chronic immersion zzso zzso zzso section of the zzso zzso were stained zzso with subsequent image zzso 

In control rats zzso zzso cells increased in number with age and zzso correlated with the number of zzso zzso In experimental animals aged 1 and 3 months volume density of zzso zzso cells significantly decreased and zzso correlated with zzso cells, while in 6 month old rats it was only slightly decreased and in 12 months old animals showed tendency to zzso 

zzso of the study demonstrating capacity of the zzso cells to contribute to the plasticity of the zzso axis in chronic stress exposure at different zzso
