Iron is associated with the zzso of chronic kidney disease zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling is implicated in zzso however, a link between iron and zzso zzso signaling in zzso remains zzso We have previously shown that long-term dietary iron restriction leads to increased sodium and decreased zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso we investigated the effect of iron restriction on zzso damage and zzso zzso signaling in a rat model of zzso 

zzso was induced by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso rats were divided into zzso and dietary zzso zzso 

zzso rats exhibited zzso zzso zzso damage, and zzso zzso In contrast, these changes were attenuated by 16 weeks of zzso zzso zzso with these findings, iron restriction suppressed increased gene expression of collagen type III, transforming growth zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso in the zzso zzso zzso increased expression of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso a key downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso kidney was markedly attenuated by iron zzso Of interest, expression of cellular iron transport zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso metal zzso 1 was increased in the zzso zzso zzso along with increased iron zzso zzso production, and urinary iron zzso zzso rats also developed hypertension, although iron restriction suppressed the development of zzso 

Taken together, these data uncover a novel effect of iron restriction on zzso damage and hypertension through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
