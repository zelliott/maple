zzso zzso receptors zzso are novel G zzso receptors belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso family zzso that mediate a variety of rapid cell zzso zzso actions in the zzso system involving zzso of zzso signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso The zzso are highly expressed in the brain, but research on their neural functions has only been conducted in a single zzso cell line, zzso cells, which have negligible nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso and zzso on their plasma zzso which is associated with the presence of zzso specific zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is an effective zzso for zzso zzso with a relative binding affinity of zzso that of zzso zzso acts as a potent zzso zzso on zzso cells, mimicking the zzso decrease in zzso zzso and its zzso actions at low zzso zzso The decrease in zzso levels is associated with rapid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The recent suggestion that zzso are alkaline zzso and mediate zzso signaling is not supported by empirical evidence that zzso does not bind to zzso zzso in human cells and that zzso zzso is ineffective in mimicking zzso actions through zzso to induce zzso maturation of fish zzso Taken together, these recent studies indicate that zzso mediate zzso effects of zzso and zzso and are also the likely intermediaries in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
