zzso T cells expressing zzso T cell receptors zzso are of interest for cancer gene therapy but many zzso zzso are thought to be zzso targets because they are expressed at low levels on normal zzso We therefore sought to determine whether engineered T cells expressing variable surface zzso of a zzso zzso could discriminate different zzso of the targeted zzso We plotted the relationship between zzso density and the concentration of target zzso using zzso T cells expressing a zzso zzso whose expression could be modulated by zzso Our analysis reveals that there is a dynamic equilibrium between cell surface density of the zzso and the zzso density that zzso triggers T cell zzso At a fixed density of target zzso optimal T cell zzso can be achieved only within a certain range of zzso zzso while excessive zzso signaling triggers zzso of the engineered T zzso Our results show that T cells can be engineered to discriminate different zzso zzso and that the T cell response to a fixed concentration of zzso can be zzso by tuning the cell surface density of zzso
