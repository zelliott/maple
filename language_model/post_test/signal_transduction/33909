As with other complex cellular functions, zzso membrane transport involves the coordinated engagement of a series of zzso and zzso however, the molecular basis of this coordination is zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso system that is activated by traffic and is involved in monitoring and balancing trafficking rates into and out of the zzso zzso We provide evidence that the traffic signal is due to protein zzso that leave the zzso zzso and reach the zzso complex where they bind to the zzso zzso This zzso a zzso reaction that includes the zzso of a zzso pool of zzso zzso and a zzso cascade that in turn activates zzso trafficking, thereby maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the zzso zzso The concepts emerging from this study should help to understand the control circuits that coordinate zzso cellular zzso
