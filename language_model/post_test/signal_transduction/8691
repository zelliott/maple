zzso is the most common zzso zzso zzso that zzso early degradation and poor trafficking of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso channels to the zzso membrane of zzso zzso Our previous work in zzso zzso cells showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso by increasing its membrane zzso by a protein zzso C zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso activity and membrane zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso which also expresses the zzso zzso At reduced temperature (27 degrees zzso which zzso zzso trafficking, acute stimulation by zzso of rescued zzso channels was protein zzso A zzso and zzso One hour of treatment with zzso strongly increased zzso activity, with zzso zzso zzso three times higher than with zzso zzso At 37 degrees C, zzso cells, but not zzso controls, showed significant zzso zzso zzso that were sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western blots confirmed a zzso maturation and membrane zzso of zzso at 37 degrees zzso The zzso effect of zzso was abolished by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso whereas zzso stimulation by zzso toxin significantly increased zzso zzso On the other hand, membrane zzso but not zzso of zzso was significantly reduced by the zzso inhibitor zzso X and the zzso protein inhibitor zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on zzso calcium or zzso zzso These results indicate that, in human zzso cells, zzso zzso trafficking and membrane zzso of functional zzso channels at zzso temperature by stimulating both zzso and zzso zzso
