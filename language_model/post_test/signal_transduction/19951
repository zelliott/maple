zzso light zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically mediates these responses by functioning as a zzso zzso zzso exposure converts zzso from a zzso to a zzso stimulates the rapid zzso of zzso in the nucleus, where it binds to zzso and zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso which functions with zzso to control zzso zzso zzso Although the crystal structure of zzso reveals the basis of zzso it does not show how zzso zzso signaling through interaction with zzso Here we report that a region of 27 zzso acids from the C zzso of zzso zzso mediates the interaction with zzso The zzso region is necessary for zzso function in the regulation of gene expression and zzso growth suppression in zzso However, zzso lacking zzso still zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and plant protein zzso accumulates in the nucleus in response to zzso and interacts with zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction of zzso and zzso is reproduced in zzso cells and we show that zzso is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction of zzso with the zzso domain of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso interacts in zzso with the zzso OF zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are negative regulators of zzso zzso Hence the zzso region has a key role in zzso zzso
