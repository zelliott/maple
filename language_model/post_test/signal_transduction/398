zzso ligament zzso cells are known to play important roles in tooth zzso and zzso bone zzso We previously reported that zzso increases zzso expression in human zzso cells, suggesting that it promotes zzso root zzso during tooth zzso While it is known that zzso genes play a key role during bone development, the role of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells during tooth and bone zzso is less zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso cells and thereby regulates zzso and zzso We found that zzso increased zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso also promoted zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, leading to zzso and zzso and thus likely promoting tooth and zzso bone zzso
