We previously reported that suppression of the zzso zzso increases drug resistance of zzso zzso In this study, we further characterized the underlying mechanism of this zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso inhibitor enhanced zzso zzso zzso However, results of zzso analysis showed that neither zzso nor zzso zzso induced marked zzso degradation, suggesting that suppression of the zzso signaling zzso may enhance zzso zzso zzso via mechanisms other than the conventional zzso Previous findings that protein zzso 4 zzso a nuclear zzso zzso directly interacts with and activates zzso led us to examine the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso but decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso further enhanced zzso zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Further, in parallel with zzso zzso the protein level of nuclear zzso was increased in zzso cells and was further increased by suppression of the zzso zzso zzso cells were then zzso by a sense or an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a decrease in zzso zzso of zzso zzso to nearly zzso levels, and both zzso and zzso zzso activities were higher than those in parental zzso By contrast, zzso either alone or with zzso zzso induced little zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso revealed a zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso to contain potential zzso sites that directly interact with zzso Further studies by zzso zzso suggested that zzso was the major zzso zzso
