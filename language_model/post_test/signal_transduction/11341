Studies on the cellular and molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter zzso and of zzso and zzso cell responses to stresses seem to be important to zzso the action mechanism of zzso drugs and to develop novel zzso against several diseases in the zzso The present review shows our findings with regard to the membrane zzso mechanism including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso protein zzso and drug actions in zzso zzso injected with rat brain zzso zzso cells and brain zzso Regarding the results of studies on the zzso and zzso mechanism of zzso and zzso cells against cerebral zzso we review the involvement of a zzso factor zzso B in zzso zzso NO zzso zzso expression in rat zzso zzso Then we describe possible involvement of: 1) zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 2) decrease in zzso membrane potential, release of zzso from zzso and degradation of the inhibitor of zzso zzso by activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso results in expression of a molecular zzso such as protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our recent findings indicate that zzso of zzso in the rat zzso (in zzso and in zzso zzso cells (in zzso significantly suppress the zzso zzso zzso From zzso and pharmacological aspects, we review the importance of studies on the cellular and molecular mechanism of membrane zzso and of zzso in the brain to identify functional roles of zzso as well as zzso interaction in the zzso
