zzso barrier dysfunction is a serious problem that occurs in many inflammatory conditions, including zzso zzso zzso injury, cardiovascular disease, and zzso zzso dysfunction permits zzso of serum components into the surrounding zzso leading to zzso formation and organ zzso The basis for zzso barrier dysfunction is zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased by zzso zzso activity in response to zzso of zzso light chain by zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs in response to inflammatory zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso through multiple cell signaling pathways and signaling molecules zzso zzso , protein zzso C, zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso Other signaling molecules protect against zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, individual zzso zzso play specific roles in zzso barrier dysfunction, suggesting that zzso zzso could be useful for treating inflammatory disorders and preventing multiple organ zzso Because zzso barrier dysfunction depends upon signaling through zzso in many instances, zzso signaling comprises multiple potential therapeutic targets for preventing zzso formation and multiple organ zzso The following review is a discussion of zzso mechanisms and cell signaling events that mediate zzso zzso
