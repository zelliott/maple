zzso zzso capable of zzso gene expression will be useful for a number of gene therapy zzso We explored one mechanism zzso zzso zzso may be imparted to the zzso zzso zzso by utilizing the zzso signal zzso zzso that is activated by a number of zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to insert a consensus binding site for the ubiquitous zzso factor zzso into the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso followed by the zzso of zzso of a zzso zzso with the core sequence zzso After zzso of the modified zzso into a zzso zzso expressing the zzso reporter gene and zzso of the zzso cell line, zzso expression was induced with zzso human zzso The level of induction reached a maximum of zzso higher than the zzso zzso when the zzso contained four zzso zzso When this optimal zzso was compared with the zzso and zzso zzso respective values of zzso and zzso higher expression were achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporating these zzso zzso will be useful for gene therapy in a number of situations involving gene transfer to zzso zzso and other zzso cell zzso
