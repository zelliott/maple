The zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso repeat zzso protein that is membrane anchored near its zzso The protein zzso resistance in tomato to races of the fungus zzso zzso expressing the corresponding zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso zzso and leads on zzso to a subset of zzso responses zzso similar to those normally seen in the tomato zzso One of the earliest responses, both in the native and transgenic zzso results in zzso salt loss from the infected zzso However, the zzso underlying this zzso flux and its control is poorly zzso We have explored the actions of zzso on zzso transgenic zzso using guard cells as a zzso Much detail of guard cell zzso channels and their regulation is already zzso zzso were carried out on intact guard cells in zzso zzso and the currents carried by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels were characterized under zzso zzso zzso to zzso extracts resulted in a zzso to zzso stimulation of zzso and almost complete suppression of zzso within 3-5 zzso The zzso channel responses were zzso They were specific for the zzso zzso were not observed in guard cells of zzso lacking the zzso zzso and, from kinetic zzso could be ascribed to changes in channel zzso Both zzso channel responses were found to be zzso functions of zzso concentration and were completely blocked in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso both zzso protein zzso zzso These results demonstrate the ability of the zzso zzso to couple zzso zzso specifically to a concerted action on two discrete zzso channels and they indicate a role for protein zzso in zzso signal zzso leading to transport zzso
