zzso of zzso rate may be viewed as the zzso of an input signal zzso zzso into an output signal zzso length zzso by the zzso zzso This study analyzes the zzso zzso relation of zzso zzso elements and tests its impact on zzso zzso of heart rate zzso 

zzso activity of isolated rabbit zzso zzso was recorded by patch clamp zzso zzso and all the action potential parameters determining zzso were automatically measured from zzso consecutive zzso zzso zzso 5 to 50 zzso increased zzso by decreasing zzso zzso rate zzso zzso This was associated with a substantial increase in the zzso of variation of zzso and minor changes in the zzso of variation of other zzso A simple function relating zzso to action potential parameters accurately described zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations based on this zzso relation showed that zzso depression of zzso might, by its own, increase zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso may not necessarily reflect zzso of the neural input to the zzso zzso but also may be affected by its zzso zzso Properties of the zzso relation of zzso zzso may fully account for the dependency of zzso zzso on mean heart rate, previously described in zzso Any condition depressing zzso may enhance zzso zzso independent of changes in the pattern of neural zzso
