We have previously shown that zzso stimulates cell proliferation in both normal and transformed zzso cells mainly through zzso of the two primary zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso A growing body of evidence suggests that zzso also zzso zzso effects that cannot be explained by zzso of primary zzso In the present study, we observed that zzso cells express high amounts of zzso a G zzso zzso recently identified as a candidate for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso both inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression caused by specific small interfering zzso increased zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso effects of zzso on cell proliferation correlate with abundance of zzso Although zzso induced a significant increase in zzso activity, zzso did not, suggesting that the zzso zzso effect on cell proliferation was not caused by zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso failed to induce zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso and zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso However, zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso D1 zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation is the result of decreased zzso D1 by zzso of zzso zzso zzso
