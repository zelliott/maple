Balanced zzso signals maintain a competent peripheral B cell pool limited in zzso B cells that may produce zzso zzso To identify molecules regulating peripheral B cell survival and tolerance to zzso zzso a gene modifier screen was performed with B cells from zzso zzso zzso mice that undergo zzso cell death zzso and fail to zzso zzso expression after B cell zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso B cells in zzso zzso egg zzso zzso transgenic mice inhabit the zzso but undergo zzso after zzso zzso This gene modifier screen identified zzso a zzso zzso protein of ancient origin, as a major regulator of B cell survival in both zzso zzso gene disruption prevents zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings reveal that zzso is a critical regulator of an unexpected and novel zzso zzso controlling peripheral B cell survival and zzso responsiveness that may contribute to peripheral B cell zzso
