The interaction of host cells with microbial products or their invasion by pathogens frequently results in zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso The studies presented here reveal that in zzso infection with zzso zzso results in the zzso of zzso To determine whether host cells could activate zzso in response to invasion by zzso zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso were used to assess the response of host cells to zzso In these studies, infection of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso did not result in the zzso of zzso In addition, the ability of zzso to activate zzso was impaired in cultures of zzso infected with zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that invasion of cells by zzso zzso does not lead to the zzso of zzso and suggest that the zzso may actively interfere with the pathways that lead to zzso zzso
