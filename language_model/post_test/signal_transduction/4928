Identification of zzso zzso zzso has led to development of an increasingly attractive strategy for cancer therapy and other zzso zzso zzso zzso growth inhibitor zzso a potent and relatively nontoxic zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and this work shed new light on developing promising zzso zzso It is well-documented that the zzso zzso motif exhibits high binding affinity to zzso zzso which is abundantly expressed in cancer cells and specifically associated with zzso on zzso Here, we designed a fusion protein containing the special zzso motif sequence and zzso aimed at offering more effective multiple targeting to tumor cells and tumor zzso and higher zzso and zzso zzso zzso tests demonstrated that the zzso zzso human zzso protein zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth in zzso and suppressed zzso in chicken zzso membrane in zzso to a higher degree as compared with zzso zzso More importantly, zzso but not zzso zzso could potentially target zzso breast tumor cells, significantly zzso growth of zzso cells in zzso triggered zzso in zzso cells by zzso of zzso as well as zzso which was zzso by zzso the zzso signaling associated with zzso of zzso protein zzso and consequently led to the observed significant zzso effect in zzso against a human breast cancer zzso Our study indicated that the zzso fusion protein might represent a novel zzso and zzso zzso
