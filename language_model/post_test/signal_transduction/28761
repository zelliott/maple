Plants have the capacity to zzso and reject pathogens at various stages of their attempted zzso of the zzso zzso rejection often arises as a consequence of the potential zzso attempt to breach the first lines of plant zzso zzso able to penetrate beyond this barrier of zzso resistance may seek a subtle and persuasive relationship with the zzso For some, this may be limited to molecular signals released outside the plant cell wall, but for others it includes penetration of the cell wall and the delivery of signal molecules to the plant zzso zzso or indirect recognition of these signals triggers zzso zzso Our understanding of zzso resistance and its possible links to zzso resistance has advanced significantly as more is discovered about the nature and function of the molecules underpinning both kinds of zzso
