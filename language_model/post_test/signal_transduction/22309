During the course of liver zzso zzso zzso cell zzso proliferation as well as subsequent synthesis of excessive zzso zzso components is known to be the central zzso Thus, factors that could limit zzso proliferation are potential zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso a nutritional component derived from zzso family vegetables, on the proliferation of cultured zzso and to clarify the underline molecular zzso zzso an activated rat zzso line, was treated with zzso zzso 100 and 200 zzso for 24 zzso The results indicated that zzso can significantly inhibit zzso proliferation in a zzso manner with or without zzso growth zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso could also block zzso in the zzso phase from entering the S zzso The expressions of zzso muscle zzso in zzso treated with zzso were significantly decreased at levels of protein and zzso zzso In addition, the type I collagen level, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso expressions, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso oxygen species generation were significantly decreased by zzso zzso We also observed that the zzso zzso zzso in zzso was inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner; however, the zzso zzso was zzso In conclusion, zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso by blocking the zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso signal zzso These findings suggest that dietary zzso might play a novel role in prevention and treatment of chronic liver zzso
