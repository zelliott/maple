The modulating effects of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso have been evaluated in four zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor alpha zzso growth was completely inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cell lines and by zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth was reversed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in all four cell zzso The inhibitor zzso zzso at zzso zzso or zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and reduced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was completely inhibited by 3 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso can inhibit growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso consistent with zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
