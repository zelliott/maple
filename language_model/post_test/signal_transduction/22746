The effect of zzso zzso on insulin release from rat pancreatic zzso was measured to investigate the zzso action of vitamin D via the putative membrane vitamin D zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin release from rat pancreatic zzso and increased the zzso zzso concentration zzso though not increasing zzso efficacy in the zzso zzso These effects were completely abolished by an zzso of zzso zzso D3 zzso or by a blocker of zzso zzso channels, zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso caused by membrane zzso and sufficient zzso zzso metabolism are required for the expression of these zzso zzso therefore, has a rapid zzso effect, through zzso signal zzso via zzso that would be dependent on the zzso of zzso influx through zzso zzso channels on the plasma zzso being also linked to zzso signals derived from zzso in pancreatic zzso However, further investigations will be needed to discuss zzso the meaning of zzso effects of vitamin D through zzso
