zzso zzso contain higher levels of zzso receptors than other cells in the human zzso The present study investigated their functional zzso Northern and Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that human zzso zzso zzso cells in culture contained multiple zzso zzso transcripts and an zzso zzso protein that can bind zzso in a zzso zzso zzso cells with highly zzso zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso increase in steady state levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and protein and the zzso of zzso Although human zzso could mimic zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso protein zzso Studies on signaling revealed that treatment of cells with zzso resulted in an increase in zzso levels and protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso with zzso zzso prevented zzso from increasing zzso protein zzso Treatment with zzso zzso the effect of zzso and zzso with a selective inhibitor of type I zzso zzso prevented zzso and zzso from increasing zzso protein zzso The requirement of receptors for zzso action was investigated by zzso treatment of human zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso Treatment with 2 zzso zzso but not sense, zzso resulted in a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was unable to increase zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in an zzso but not in sense, zzso zzso In zzso we conclude that zzso and zzso treatment can increase expression of the zzso gene in human zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect was time and dose dependent, hormone specific, and zzso by the zzso I protein zzso A signaling zzso The zzso actions require a normal complement of its receptors in zzso These zzso and zzso effects may be another action of these hormones in human zzso that is important for zzso of the zzso and continuation of zzso
