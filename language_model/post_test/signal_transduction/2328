The zzso hormone zzso zzso displays strong zzso selectivity in that it responds fully to zzso but not at all to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso responds fully to both zzso Previously it was shown that two divergent zzso in zzso and zzso account for zzso zzso zzso position 23 zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso determines binding selectivity and position 5 zzso in zzso and His in zzso determines signaling zzso To identify sites in the zzso zzso involved in discriminating between zzso and zzso we constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed them in zzso cells, and tested for zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso modification enabled high affinity binding of each zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso revealed that the zzso region of the zzso determined zzso signaling zzso zzso analysis of smaller cassette zzso and then individual point zzso led to the identification of two single zzso that function as major zzso of zzso 5 signaling zzso These zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso zzso 3, and zzso at the zzso portion of zzso loop 2, are replaced by zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The results thus indicate a functional interaction between two zzso in the core region of the zzso zzso and zzso 5 of the zzso
