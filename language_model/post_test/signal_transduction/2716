We show that beta forms of zzso differentiation factor zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity, zzso growth factor, and zzso prevent zzso death and stimulate DNA synthesis of the zzso zzso cell zzso an early cell in the rat zzso cell zzso When precursors are exposed to zzso in defined zzso they generate zzso cells without the requirement for DNA synthesis and with a time course that is similar to that with which zzso cells appear in embryonic nerves in zzso Furthermore, a zzso signal that also mediates precursor survival and maturation is blocked by the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso a protein that specifically blocks the action of zzso These observations provide important evidence that zzso is one of the zzso elusive zzso signaling molecules long proposed to regulate development in the zzso cell zzso
