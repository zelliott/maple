As part of a program to further understand the mechanism by which zzso signals are coordinated and zzso outcomes are generated, we have cloned a novel class of related zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso and have characterized in more detail one of the members, zzso zzso has an zzso zzso domain and a putative zzso zzso interaction zzso Treatment of cells with zzso growth factor or insulin leads to zzso zzso and increased association with a zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cell contact with zzso results in zzso zzso and a transient zzso of zzso from zzso Increased expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso with this zzso zzso increases the activity of an zzso zzso Thus, we have described a novel family of zzso zzso one of which may be involved in the process by which zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors control the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso
