Both zzso and zzso are known to stimulate zzso production in cardiac zzso When added together, however, they inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso Type V zzso zzso the major zzso in the heart, was also inhibited when an increasing concentration of zzso was added in the presence of zzso zzso was not dependent on the condition of stimulation or preparation of the zzso However, this zzso was abolished in the presence of zzso Other zzso including zzso and zzso as well as zzso an oxidized product of zzso similarly inhibited the activity of this zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso for the zzso zzso was zzso but the zzso was significantly zzso In contrast, type II zzso zzso a zzso zzso was resistant to such zzso by zzso and was somewhat zzso by zzso Thus, zzso when zzso directly zzso with zzso zzso in an zzso manner in the absence of G zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso have different sensitivity to various zzso including zzso zzso
