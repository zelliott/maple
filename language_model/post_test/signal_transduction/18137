zzso tissue cell types in zzso are separated from air by the zzso zzso layer of various zzso zzso the skin, zzso and respiratory and upper zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused by zzso traumatic or surgical injury would be expected to expose the zzso zzso zzso to influx zzso However, it is unclear what effects air stimulation elicits in zzso growth, which is critical for wound zzso To address this question, we examined the proliferation of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso using zzso collagen gel culture with or without air zzso The zzso intake of zzso zzso was about 6 times that of zzso zzso To further characterize this zzso growth, we examined the expression of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which plays a key role in the zzso zzso of various cell zzso zzso and Western zzso showed that air exposure increased zzso cascade expression of the cells more strongly than air zzso The data indicate that air exposure promotes zzso zzso zzso growth, suggesting in turn that in wound repair air stimulation itself may be involved in the basic mechanisms of zzso zzso proliferation and that it may be related to the zzso of excessive zzso through zzso zzso
