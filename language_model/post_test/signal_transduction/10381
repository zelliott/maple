zzso zzso acid zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso acid transport across zzso zzso function and regulation have not been characterized previously in cerebral zzso cells but may be important during normal cerebral energy metabolism and during brain diseases such as zzso Here, by using the zzso pH indicator zzso zzso the initial rates of zzso zzso zzso were measured as an indication of zzso kinetic function in zzso using the rat brain zzso cell zzso model of zzso zzso The initial rate of zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso cell signaling pathways as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso but did not affect zzso zzso The effects of zzso were completely reversed by the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso whereas zzso alone increased transport zzso zzso zzso levels, measured by zzso were increased by zzso or zzso and the effect of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso pH control mechanisms did not contribute to the zzso or zzso effects on zzso kinetic function as determined with zzso zzso acid zzso or the transport inhibitor zzso The data demonstrate the direct zzso of zzso kinetic function in cerebral zzso cells by agents known to affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso signaling zzso
