Clinical progression of zzso zzso zzso may occur in parallel with distinctive signaling zzso We designed zzso analyses zzso zzso data with zzso and zzso to zzso the signaling and zzso zzso underlying zzso development in the zzso zzso 

Studies were performed on normal zzso zzso and zzso samples obtained during surgery or zzso zzso of zzso sections prepared from the tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist to control the relative cell type zzso The zzso were done using zzso zzso zzso and probe set data was generated using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso set zzso The data was evaluated using zzso comparisons and data decomposition into singular value decomposition zzso zzso The method selected for the functional analysis used the zzso zzso zzso profiles obtained in 105 samples of whole tissue sections were used to establish zzso signaling zzso in progression of zzso while those representing 40 zzso specimens were used to select differences in zzso pathways between zzso and zzso Based on a consensus of the results obtained by two zzso zzso and two probe set sorting criteria, we identified 14 and 17 zzso signaling and zzso pathways that are significantly altered between normal and tumor samples and between benign and zzso tumors, zzso Several of them were also selected from the raw zzso data of 2 recently published studies zzso and zzso 

Although the proposed strategy is zzso complex and zzso it may reduce the number of false zzso
