In this review a number of uses of human T cell clones have been zzso Before considering T cell zzso however, it is worth bearing in mind that there are certain disadvantages to this approach to T cell zzso not the least of which is that these cells, adapted as they are for in zzso growth, may be zzso of the normal T cell, in terms of both zzso and zzso In addition, cloning is sufficiently difficult for it to be undertaken only where zzso populations are essential to the desired zzso Nevertheless, the range of uses discussed, and the fact that many have had a fundamental impact on our understanding of immune mechanisms, not only as zzso by T cells, but also of the zzso mechanisms of zzso the nature and mode of action of the zzso as well as the cell surface molecules and cascade of signals that orchestrate T cell zzso indicate the importance of T cell zzso In the future, it is probable that the use of T cell clones with defined zzso usage will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease zzso and thus aid both the prevention and treatment of zzso In addition, the T cell zzso structure will, no doubt, be zzso leading to a further quantum leap in our understanding of T cell immune mechanisms, as well as suggesting other avenues for zzso In all these areas there is no doubt that the methodology of T cell cloning will continue to make a fundamental zzso
