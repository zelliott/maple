The innate immune response to zzso zzso is primarily zzso by zzso though the bacterial products that stimulate this zzso remain zzso Here we report the identification of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which activate zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso stimulate zzso production in human and mouse cells in a zzso zzso Using an zzso that relies on zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso and zzso stimulate exclusively the zzso zzso Our results also show that yet unidentified zzso zzso possibly zzso have the ability to stimulate the zzso zzso Through zzso analysis, we determined that an extended region that comprises zzso zzso in the zzso portion of zzso mediates response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso of zzso with the zzso derived from zzso enables zzso to recognize zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study identifies for the first time specific zzso products capable of stimulating a zzso response and the cellular receptors they zzso
