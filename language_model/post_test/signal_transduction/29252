Acute zzso heart failure zzso is responsible for more than 1 million hospital admissions each year in the zzso zzso and scientists have developed therapeutic strategies that reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure zzso Despite the widely appreciated magnitude of the zzso problem, there is still a critical gap in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved and effective treatment strategies for hospitalized zzso zzso of the zzso patients with zzso present with similar symptoms zzso zzso altered zzso and zzso as multiple signaling pathways zzso in a common zzso zzso zzso have shown that patients with zzso have increased zzso levels, which cause chronic stimulation of zzso zzso This zzso leads to chronic zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso as the patient's heart attempts to adapt to progressive zzso Over time, these zzso signaling mechanisms ultimately fail, and zzso signaling prevails with progressive worsening of zzso This Review summarizes some of the changes that occur during chronic zzso zzso and examines how downstream zzso dysfunction and zzso death can alter the prognosis of patients with zzso hospitalized for acute zzso
