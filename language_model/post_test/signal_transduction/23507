zzso zzso zzso is characterized by active zzso and zzso which account for rapid recurrence and poor zzso There is frequent zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso In this study, the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was investigated with in zzso zzso tube formation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mouse models, and human zzso zzso Reduction of zzso in zzso zzso was significantly associated with increased zzso zzso and worse recurrence-free zzso Both zzso and zzso studies of in zzso models revealed that zzso not only suppressed the ability of zzso cells to promote the migration and zzso tube formation of zzso cells but also directly zzso the abilities of zzso cells to migrate and invade zzso zzso zzso Based on mouse models, we found that the induced expression of zzso dramatically reduced zzso zzso in zzso tumors and zzso both zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso investigations disclosed that zzso directly inhibited the expression of the zzso factor vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of these target molecules of zzso zzso the effects of zzso restoration, whereas zzso of these targets antagonized the function of zzso Furthermore, we revealed that zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso levels in the tumor zzso which subsequently activated zzso zzso 2 signaling in zzso cells and thereby promoted zzso Additionally, zzso zzso led to increases in zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso signaling and zzso formation and thereby facilitated the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso deregulation contributes to zzso and zzso in zzso The restoration of zzso expression may be a promising strategy for zzso zzso
