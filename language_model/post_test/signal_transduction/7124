zzso are syndromes caused by zzso zzso in the Ras signaling zzso One of these conditions, Costello syndrome zzso is typically caused by an zzso de zzso zzso zzso in zzso and is characterized by a wide range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report that a majority of individuals with zzso have zzso of zzso the outer covering of teeth, and that similar defects are present in a zzso mouse zzso Comprehensive analysis of the mouse model revealed that zzso the cells that generate zzso lacked zzso and the zzso zzso cells were zzso Ras signals through two main zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine through which zzso Ras affects zzso formation, zzso targeting either zzso or zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso pathway, were zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso zzso the zzso polarity zzso and restored normal zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso only corrected the zzso cell proliferation zzso We demonstrate for the first time the central role of Ras signaling in zzso formation in zzso individuals and present the mouse zzso as a model system to dissect the roles of the Ras zzso pathways in zzso
