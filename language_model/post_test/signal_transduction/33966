The zzso hormone zzso zzso regulates diverse aspects of plant immunity and zzso Among the central components of the zzso signaling cascade are the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins that repress zzso of zzso zzso Recent studies provide evidence that zzso zzso forms of zzso initiate signal zzso upon formation of a zzso zzso zzso complex in which zzso are zzso and subsequently zzso zzso a zzso factor produced by the plant pathogen zzso zzso is a potent zzso of this hormone zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso to zzso zzso host immune responses to zzso zzso providing a striking example of how pathogens exploit hormone signaling pathways in the host to promote zzso These findings, together with zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso extend the paradigm of zzso proteins as zzso sensors of small zzso and suggest a common evolutionary origin of the zzso and zzso response zzso
