The cellular prion protein zzso resides in zzso zzso yet the type of raft and the zzso function of zzso are zzso We show here that zzso of zzso with specific zzso leads to 1) zzso capping in zzso and human peripheral blood T zzso 2) to zzso with the zzso zzso raft proteins zzso and zzso 3) to signal zzso as seen by zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 4) to the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the cap along with local zzso zzso and zzso zzso and later, zzso of zzso together with the zzso into zzso positive zzso Thus, zzso association with zzso zzso triggers distinct zzso signal zzso events in T cells that promote the focal concentration of zzso itself by guiding activated zzso into zzso zzso caps and then to the recruitment of important interacting signaling zzso
