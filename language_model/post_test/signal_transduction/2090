The zzso ducts are composed of an zzso and surrounding zzso that have the potential to differentiate into female zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and upper zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso by the fetal zzso causes the zzso of the zzso ducts to prevent the differentiation of female zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso duct is zzso by the zzso type II zzso zzso that is expressed in the zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso alters the zzso duct zzso leading to the elimination of the zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso leads to the differentiation of female zzso zzso in males that can cause zzso and zzso We have exploited the mouse zzso locus to express zzso genes in the cellular target of zzso zzso the zzso duct zzso This approach can be used with conditional genetic strategies to identify factors that are required for the zzso of the female zzso duct zzso
