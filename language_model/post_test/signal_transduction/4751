zzso zzso zzso zzso disease type C zzso and zzso disease zzso are genetic inherited disorders with impaired processing of cholesterol, caused by zzso in genes that regulate cellular zzso zzso movement and transport of zzso Various studies have shown a crucial regulatory role of the zzso for cellular cholesterol zzso in these zzso Since cholesterol is an essential structural component of cells, we assessed the impact of a severe FH causing zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso in primary FH zzso zzso FH zzso derived from patients with the LDL zzso zzso zzso were used for gene expression zzso Gene expression studies revealed increased expressions of zzso regulated genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but interestingly not zzso In contrast expression of zzso was strongly decreased in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso Gene expression experiments with LDL zzso lacking primary FH zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are important regulators for cholesterol acquisition in FH cells, consistent with findings in cells from zzso and TD zzso
