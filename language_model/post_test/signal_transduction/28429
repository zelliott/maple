zzso have a pivotal role in the zzso and zzso of specific zzso zzso in acute zzso zzso However, the role of specific zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso rejection has not been fully zzso We now show that zzso zzso rejection is associated with a steady increase in zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso and their corresponding zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso was found to be highly zzso we tested the specific role of zzso in zzso zzso rejection by zzso fully zzso mismatched zzso from zzso mice into zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso survival was noted in zzso recipients, with median survival time of 24 and 12 days for zzso and zzso recipients, respectively zzso zzso zzso This was associated with reduction in the generation of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso recipients had a reduced zzso and increased zzso zzso in the periphery (by zzso zzso as well as in the zzso (by zzso However, these changes were only transient in zzso recipients that ultimately rejected their zzso Furthermore, in contrast to the zzso transplants, zzso zzso offered only marginal zzso of heart zzso zzso This study demonstrates the important role for zzso in early zzso zzso rejection and highlights the tissue specificity of the zzso zzso system in zzso in regulating zzso zzso
