We present evidence for the existence of two zzso of zzso acid zzso signaling required for zzso limb zzso zzso zzso synthesis is under the control of zzso zzso zzso expressed in the lateral plate zzso which generates a zzso zzso signal during limb zzso We report that zzso zzso lack trunk zzso zzso activity and fail to initiate zzso zzso This is associated with deficient expression of important limb zzso zzso zzso and zzso needed to establish zzso bud zzso zzso identity, and the zone of polarizing activity zzso zzso zzso expression of these genes can be rescued by maternal zzso treatment limited to embryonic day 8 zzso during limb field establishment, but the zzso forelimbs obtained at E10 display a significant growth zzso associated with a smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to here as an zzso zzso mound zzso In these zzso zzso a zzso expressing zzso forms, but it is located zzso adjacent to the zzso expression domain in the zzso rather than zzso as is zzso zzso formation in zzso forelimbs is rescued by continuous zzso treatment through zzso which restores zzso to zzso zzso zzso to become the zzso Our findings indicate the existence of an early phase of zzso signaling acting upstream of zzso zzso and zzso followed by a late phase of zzso signaling needed to expand zzso structure fully along the zzso zzso During zzso formation, zzso acts early to activate expression of zzso but it is not required later for zzso zzso
