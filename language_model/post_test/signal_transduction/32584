We have previously reported a novel zzso donor zzso site zzso in zzso 9 of the zzso zzso zzso gene in Japanese siblings who showed partial zzso zzso and high serum zzso protein zzso zzso This zzso caused the zzso zzso and produced the truncated zzso consisting of 277 zzso acids zzso which lacked most of the zzso domain of zzso including both boxes 1 and zzso In this study, we have characterized the function of zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso possessed approximately zzso times higher affinity to zzso and twice the number of binding sites compared to zzso full-length zzso zzso The zzso level in culture medium of zzso cells was approximately 3 times higher than that in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso was significantly reduced compared with that of zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso exerted a dominant negative effect when zzso and zzso were zzso These in zzso data would well explain the clinical characteristics in our patients showing high serum zzso levels and development of short stature despite a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
