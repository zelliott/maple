At least zzso of the human zzso predating the zzso radiation is thought to have evolved under zzso selection, yet zzso and related untranslated zzso occupy at most zzso of the zzso Thus, the majority of zzso and, by extension, functional sequence in the human zzso seems to be zzso Recent work has highlighted a handful of cases where mobile element insertions have resulted in the introduction of novel zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a zzso survey of zzso constrained zzso elements in the human zzso that have all been deposited by characterized mobile zzso These repeat instances have been under strong zzso selection since at least the zzso zzso zzso zzso They are most often located in gene deserts and show a strong preference for residing closest to genes involved in development and zzso zzso In particular, constrained zzso elements with clear repetitive origins are located near genes involved in cell zzso including all characterized cellular members of the zzso zzso Overall, we find that mobile elements have contributed at least zzso of all constrained zzso elements unique to zzso suggesting that mobile elements may have played a larger role than previously recognized in shaping and specializing the landscape of gene regulation during zzso zzso
