zzso zzso encodes the core binding factor alpha zzso of a zzso zzso factor complex which plays critical roles in normal zzso zzso or zzso of zzso have been linked to favorable clinical outcomes in acute zzso suggesting that zzso may also play critical roles in chemotherapy responses in acute zzso however, the molecular mechanisms remain zzso The median level of zzso transcripts in Down syndrome zzso children with acute zzso leukemia zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso lower than that in zzso zzso zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso cell line, zzso resulted in significantly increased sensitivity to zzso zzso accompanied by significantly decreased expression of zzso which encodes the delta zzso zzso of the survival zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso regulation of zzso by zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso and promoter reporter gene zzso Further, a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso effects on zzso and primary pediatric zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play a critical role in chemotherapy response in zzso by regulating the zzso zzso Thus, the treatment of zzso may be improved by zzso zzso or zzso zzso into the chemotherapy of this zzso
