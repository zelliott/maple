zzso initiation factor 6 zzso an essential protein important in zzso zzso and zzso was identified as an interacting partner of the zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Independent studies identified zzso zzso zzso in a genetic screen designed to detect new genes involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in wing discs results in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso colon cancer cells, which express high levels of active zzso showed that zzso selectively zzso the zzso zzso at the level of zzso protein independently of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids into zzso was selectively decreased in cells that zzso zzso A similar inverse relationship of the two proteins was observed in the zzso mouse zzso in which zzso levels are very zzso Taken together these data reveal a link between zzso and zzso zzso perhaps at the level of zzso recycling on zzso zzso
