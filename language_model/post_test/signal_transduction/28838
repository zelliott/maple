zzso perception by the zzso zzso system of zzso coli is still controversial with respect to the nature of the stimulus that is perceived by the sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the medium or high zzso leads to zzso signal zzso resulting in zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that changes in zzso are sensed by zzso through zzso in the physical state of the zzso zzso However, in this study the quantitative determination of expression levels of the zzso zzso revealed that the system responds very effectively to zzso conditions in the medium but barely and to various degrees to salt and sugar zzso Since the current view of stimulus perception calls for mainly zzso zzso which might be sensed by zzso we set out to test the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso As a first result, the determination of the zzso volume, which is a prerequisite for such zzso revealed that a transient shrinkage of the zzso volume, which is indicative of a reduction in zzso occurred only under zzso zzso but not under zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso concentration significantly increased under zzso zzso whereas only a slight increase occurred after a zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso concentration rose zzso only after an zzso zzso For the first time, these data indicate that stimulus perception by zzso zzso neither with changes in the zzso volume nor with changes in the zzso zzso or zzso concentration or those of the other zzso zzso In conclusion, we propose that a reduction in zzso cannot be the stimulus for zzso
