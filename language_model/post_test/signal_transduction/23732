zzso zzso arises as a response of the heart to many different pathological stimuli that challenge its zzso Regardless of the initial zzso cause, cardiac zzso shares some characteristics resulting from a genetic zzso of several zzso Recent studies point to zzso as a key signaling element in the initiation of this genetic zzso In fact, besides its important role in zzso zzso zzso regulates cardiac growth by zzso of zzso zzso zzso This mechanism has been termed zzso zzso zzso Some information about cardiac zzso zzso is being gathered from the analysis of cardiac zzso development, where two zzso dependent zzso are key zzso the zzso zzso II zzso and the zzso zzso both activated by zzso In this review we focus on some zzso signaling pathways involved in cardiac zzso which could be ascribed as zzso of zzso zzso for instance, zzso stimulation and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso which directly, (through zzso response zzso or indirectly (through zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type 1 are zzso protein coupled zzso which when zzso stimulate zzso C producing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso in the nucleus, zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2) zzso and may indirectly induce zzso entry through transient zzso potential channels zzso Other zzso channels are activated by zzso zzso entry activates zzso zzso zzso By promoting zzso zzso channel zzso zzso may also have an important role in the genetic zzso during zzso
