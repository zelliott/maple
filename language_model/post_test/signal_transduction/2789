zzso zzso zzso zzso have been described in zzso of patients with several forms of systemic zzso including zzso zzso and microscopic zzso The two main targets of zzso in zzso are zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso primed by tumor necrosis zzso zzso in zzso which may be relevant for the induction of the vascular inflammation observed in zzso Recently, it has been suggested that engagement of zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso on the zzso is involved in the zzso by zzso In the present study, we show that zzso of the zzso respiratory burst by zzso and zzso is strongly enhanced after zzso zzso and lost on removal of the zzso parts of the zzso Similar results were obtained when the zzso were activated with zzso against known membrane zzso without major changes in the expression of the target zzso The zzso enhancement of the zzso zzso was not observed when adherence of the cells was prevented by continuous stirring of the suspension or by the addition of zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that engagement of both zzso gamma zzso and beta 2 zzso is instrumental in zzso zzso induced by zzso
