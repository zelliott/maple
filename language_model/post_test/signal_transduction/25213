In zzso zzso exists in a form that cannot bind adhesive proteins in the zzso although it can interact with immobilized zzso it cannot interact with immobilized von zzso factor in the vessel zzso zzso zzso such as zzso convert zzso to a form that recognizes soluble and immobilized zzso Attempts to zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell system have been zzso In the present study, we have developed a zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell model in which zzso zzso is induced by signaling across zzso zzso zzso by its zzso von zzso zzso zzso activates not only the zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso of the pathways leading to zzso zzso occurred even in cells zzso with zzso lacking the domain on zzso that binds zzso or that which binds zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that signals induced by interaction of zzso with von zzso factor lead to zzso zzso and suggest that the signaling pathways by which zzso zzso zzso zzso are different to those used by zzso zzso of these differences may provide insights into therapeutic ways in which to inhibit zzso zzso in selective clinical zzso
