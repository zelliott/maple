Growth and patterning of the zzso limb relies on signals produced by three discrete zzso zzso the zzso zzso Ridge zzso the Zone of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The molecular identities of these signals and their associated downstream pathways have begun to be zzso In this review, we focus on recent work that has highlighted the importance of zzso between these zzso zzso and how zzso zzso integrate multiple zzso zzso We also discuss recent evidence suggesting how zzso of key zzso pathways have been used to generate the zzso diversity seen between different zzso limb zzso
