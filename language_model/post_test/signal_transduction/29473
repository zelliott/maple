The zzso zzso primarily zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso primarily zzso of human zzso We previously reported that zzso 1 zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso elicits the zzso zzso of zzso skin due to suppression of zzso function and growth via the regulation of two important signaling factors, zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso We now report that treatment of zzso with zzso increases their proliferation and decreases their zzso of zzso and that treatment of reconstructed skin with zzso zzso a thicker and less pigmented zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed many genes regulated by zzso and several with critical expression patterns were validated by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso 9 and zzso zzso interacting protein zzso but zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C, and zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with the expression patterns of those proteins in human zzso zzso Treatment of reconstructed skin with zzso reproduced the expression patterns of those key proteins observed in zzso zzso These findings further zzso why human skin is thicker and paler on the palms and soles than on the trunk through topographical and zzso differences in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso that affects the zzso zzso
