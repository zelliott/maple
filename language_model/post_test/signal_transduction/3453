We previously demonstrated that zzso A zzso promotes proliferation in zzso human zzso cancer zzso This study was designed to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso expression and activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso gene and protein expression after treatment with zzso at doses of zzso 2, 8 and zzso Our data reveal zzso zzso expression but an absence of zzso gene and protein expression in zzso zzso At doses of 8 and zzso zzso had zzso effects on zzso zzso gene and protein zzso zzso and zzso alone zzso cell proliferation but zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but with different zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso experiments, the timing of protein zzso represented an additive effect of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, taking into consideration limitation of in zzso study, whether zzso by creating more binding sites for zzso and extending the time of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can zzso zzso action in cancer cells, require confirmation by in zzso zzso
