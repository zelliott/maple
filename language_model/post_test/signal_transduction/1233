zzso In previous work we described a zzso zzso that zzso occupancy of the pump ( P) by zzso into changes in zzso stimulation of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso molecules ( zzso thereby causing a release of the cell from the zzso In the present work we try to understand the mechanism of this zzso whether, in order to trigger the zzso zzso zzso should block the pumping activity of zzso as zzso or whether it would suffice that the drug occupies this zzso as a zzso We zzso a series of drugs known to act on the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We gauge their ability to block the pump by measuring the zzso content in the cells, and their ability to zzso the cells from the zzso by determining the amount of protein remaining in the zzso zzso None of the drugs tested was able to cause detachment without stopping the zzso zzso also enhances zzso yet pump zzso and signal zzso do not seem to be intimately associated in a zzso chain, but to occur zzso To investigate the response of the site of cell attachment, we analyze the position of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and find that this adherent zzso zzso is sent to the nucleus, where it is known to act as a zzso zzso
