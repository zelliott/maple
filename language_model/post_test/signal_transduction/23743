zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins link cortical zzso to the plasma membrane and coordinate cellular events that require zzso zzso including cell division, migration, and zzso While zzso proteins are involved in many important cellular events, the mechanisms regulating their function are not completely zzso Our laboratory previously identified zzso roles for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso We recently showed that zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso while zzso results in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Following these findings, we aimed to examine known zzso of the zzso zzso and evaluate their ability to regulate zzso zzso We examined zzso a known zzso of the zzso pathway, for its ability to regulate the zzso family of zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso pathway, as this was prevented by zzso zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso Using zzso as well as zzso zzso approaches, we determined that zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso In addition, zzso led to cell polarization in the form of zzso and this occurred through a mechanism involving zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cellular invasion was also found to be dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso such that zzso zzso zzso and expression of a zzso zzso zzso prevented cellular invasion toward zzso In this work, a novel mechanism of zzso invasion is zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is zzso
