zzso zzso is a key zzso in the production of zzso and an important zzso drug zzso Recent focus has been placed on the role of zzso in heart function and pathology, due to the finding that specific zzso zzso significantly increased the risk of heart disease in chronic zzso However, the exact role of zzso in cardiac physiology and disease remains controversial due to the conflicting data zzso Roughly equal numbers of reports have shown either a zzso role or a protective role for zzso in heart in experimental zzso Here we attempt to provide a background on the more general roles of zzso in zzso as well as molecular mechanisms employed to control zzso zzso This background provides a basis for better understanding the functional role of zzso in human heart zzso based on the results of zzso pharmacological inhibitor studies in humans as well as zzso expression in human heart zzso Furthermore, we will explore the experimental evidence implicating different zzso molecular signaling zzso that regulate zzso expression in zzso All of this data permits a more zzso understanding of the published studies using pharmacological zzso of zzso in experimental models of heart zzso Lastly, we will examine the use of genetic manipulation of zzso in mice as one of the future avenues in an attempt to resolve the role of zzso in cardiac physiology and zzso
