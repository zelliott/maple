The zzso zzso zzso zzso system contributes to the zzso and aversive consequences of stress and is implicated in the zzso of zzso fear and anxiety in zzso Here, we sought to identify neural circuits that mediate zzso system effects on fear and anxiety in zzso 

We assessed whether fear conditioning zzso plasticity in zzso or zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso and central zzso zzso of the amygdala, zzso or zzso We then assessed whether zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso or zzso affect the expression of zzso fear or zzso Finally, we examined whether fear extinction zzso plasticity in zzso zzso expression that relates to the quality of fear zzso 

Fear conditioning zzso zzso zzso in the zzso by zzso and zzso it in the zzso by zzso without affecting zzso levels in the zzso or zzso or zzso levels in any zzso zzso antagonism in either the zzso or zzso decreased zzso fear in the zzso startle zzso whereas zzso antagonism in the zzso but not the zzso produced zzso effects in the elevated plus zzso zzso fear extinction was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso zzso in the zzso 

These findings suggest that fear conditioning and extinction zzso regulate zzso expression in the zzso and provide evidence that the zzso and zzso are important neural zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso in models of fear and zzso
