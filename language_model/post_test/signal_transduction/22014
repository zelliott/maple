The adaptation of the zzso zzso coli to carbon zzso is controlled by a large network of zzso reactions involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dynamics of these networks is difficult to analyze, notably due to a lack of quantitative information on zzso zzso To overcome these limitations, model reduction approaches based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso approximations have been proposed, resulting in models that are easier to handle zzso and zzso These approximations are not supposed to affect the capability of the model to account for essential zzso properties of the system, but the zzso of this assumption has not been systematically zzso In this paper, we carry out such a study by evaluating a large and complex zzso model of the carbon zzso response in zzso coli using an ensemble zzso The results show that, in comparison with conventional zzso models, the zzso approximations generally preserve the dynamics of the carbon zzso response network, although with some zzso concerning notably the quantitative precision of the model zzso This encourages the application of zzso models to the qualitative analysis of bacterial regulatory networks, in situations where the reference time scale is that of protein synthesis and zzso
