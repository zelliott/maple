zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso promote tumor proliferation and are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with zzso We screened the natural compounds possessing an zzso effect on zzso polarization in human zzso zzso Among 130 zzso natural compounds zzso zzso acid significantly inhibited the expression of zzso one of the zzso markers of zzso zzso and also suppressed the zzso of zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso thus suggesting that zzso acid suppresses zzso polarization of zzso Furthermore, zzso acid inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells, zzso and zzso and the zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso in both human zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso acid suppresses the zzso polarization of zzso and tumor cell proliferation by zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid might be a potential new tool for tumor prevention and zzso
