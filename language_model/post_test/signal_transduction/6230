A genetic screen for zzso zzso zzso with zzso growth or zzso zzso revealed three zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso distinguished as regulatory or target genes on the basis of zzso zzso was shown previously to be required for zzso zzso of target genes like zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso zzso (which is a zzso substitute for zzso zzso zzso III zzso and zzso IX zzso zzso We show here that zzso is required also for normal zzso of copper proteins like zzso and zzso in zzso medium and for zzso degradation in zzso zzso indicating that a single zzso controls nutritional copper zzso at multiple zzso zzso is linked to the zzso OF zzso 13 zzso zzso which zzso to a zzso zzso resulting in zzso expression of zzso zzso is required also for hypoxic growth, pointing to a zzso meaningful regulatory connection between copper zzso and zzso The growth zzso of zzso strains results primarily from secondary iron zzso zzso to reduced zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in copper distribution to a zzso zzso involved in iron zzso zzso at the zzso locus also result in zzso iron zzso which is consistent with a function for zzso in a zzso for copper delivery to the zzso Taken together, the observations argue for a specialized zzso adaptation for iron zzso in zzso
