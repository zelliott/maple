Our recent study identified zzso zzso genes in the zzso of rats that received a zzso exposure to the zzso zzso zzso We further reported that zzso of these genes were positively modulated to zzso levels of expression in zzso animals that consumed dietary zzso zzso zzso a constituent of zzso zzso zzso we report our results with companion animals that were fed a diet containing zzso zzso black zzso zzso instead of zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso genes in rat esophagus were restored to zzso levels of expression by zzso Further, we have identified 53 zzso genes that are positively modulated by both zzso and zzso These 53 common genes include genes involved in phase I and II zzso zzso damage, and zzso and tumor zzso genes that regulate zzso cell zzso and zzso Because both zzso and zzso maintain zzso levels of expression of these 53 zzso their zzso during the early phase of zzso zzso cancer may be especially important in the genesis of the zzso
