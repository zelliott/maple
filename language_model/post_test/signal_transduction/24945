zzso II activates the zzso zzso via the zzso zzso We studied two zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso that contain Y to F zzso for the zzso zzso naturally found in the third zzso loop and the zzso zzso After binding zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso receptors trigger zzso zzso zzso equivalent to that observed with the wild type zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is independent of these zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso II, zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and zzso physically associate, a process that depends on the zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso of the wild type, zzso and zzso zzso receptors showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation is dependent on zzso active zzso not on the zzso zzso zzso in the third zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso of zzso virtually eliminated the zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso These data indicate that the association of zzso with the zzso zzso is not strictly zzso it requires zzso as both a zzso zzso and as a molecular bridge linking zzso to the zzso zzso
