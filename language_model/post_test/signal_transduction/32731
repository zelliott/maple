In order for nuclear zzso acid receptors to mediate zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid must first be produced from its vitamin A precursor zzso zzso studies have shown that retinal can be zzso in zzso to zzso acid by members of the zzso zzso zzso family, including zzso Here we describe the first direct evidence that zzso plays a zzso role in zzso acid synthesis by analysis of zzso signaling in zzso zzso which have plentiful stores of zzso derived zzso The zzso zzso gene was cloned and shown to be highly zzso with chick and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not expressed at zzso and zzso zzso but was expressed at the zzso zzso We used a zzso acid zzso to demonstrate that zzso acid is normally zzso in zzso from zzso to the initial zzso stage, but that a tremendous increase in zzso acid occurs during zzso when zzso is first zzso zzso of zzso by injection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso chick or zzso zzso zzso induced high levels of zzso acid detection during the zzso zzso Thus, premature expression of zzso stimulates premature synthesis of zzso zzso These findings reveal an important zzso role for zzso in zzso acid synthesis in zzso and demonstrate that conversion of zzso from the zzso form to the zzso acid form is a crucial regulatory step in zzso zzso
