The zzso zzso family and its zzso zzso and zzso have been found zzso in several human zzso We and the zzso group recently identified zzso as a direct zzso target gene of the zzso zzso in T cell acute zzso leukemia zzso Although the zzso roles of zzso and zzso are established, a direct link between zzso and zzso had not been zzso zzso our work in mouse zzso tumor cell lines revealed that zzso zzso remains dependent on the zzso zzso Studies by the zzso group provide genetic evidence that the zzso zzso also contributes to mouse zzso zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate that zzso mediates T cell and zzso cell transformation at least in part by sustaining zzso zzso
