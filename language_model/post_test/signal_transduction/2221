The expression of zzso zzso factor zzso alpha zzso was investigated in the developing chick zzso root zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso At zzso levels, zzso zzso was first observed at stage 19 zzso in cells with zzso zzso zzso is restricted to the zzso lineage in the zzso throughout zzso zzso expression precedes that of zzso beta zzso Hu zzso and zzso zzso which are markers expressed in developing sensory zzso zzso studies showed the onset of zzso expression during terminal zzso of sensory zzso zzso making zzso the earliest known zzso marker in the zzso zzso signal zzso was demonstrated in zzso and E11 zzso zzso cultures by zzso zzso zzso Although low zzso zzso (5 zzso elicit zzso zzso in zzso and E11 zzso zzso a survival response is only observed in zzso from E11 zzso This implicates a complex zzso mechanism downstream of zzso zzso leading to different cellular responses that depend on the age of the zzso zzso These results argue against a role of zzso zzso in the control of early zzso survival but are compatible with other functions in zzso and sensory zzso zzso
