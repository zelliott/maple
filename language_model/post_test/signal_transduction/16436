Critical to advancing the zzso evaluation of complex biological processes is the development of comprehensive networks and zzso methods to apply to the analysis of systems biology data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these networks will be specifically designed to capture the normal, zzso biology of the tissue or cell types under investigation, and can be used with zzso generated systems biology data to assess the biological impact of zzso like zzso and other cellular zzso Lung cell proliferation is a key biological process to capture in such a network model, given the pivotal role that proliferation plays in lung diseases including cancer, chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and zzso Unfortunately, no such network has been available prior to this zzso 

To further a zzso assessment of the biological impact of zzso on zzso zzso lung cells, we constructed a zzso network for cell zzso The network encompasses diverse biological areas that lead to the regulation of normal lung cell proliferation zzso zzso Growth zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and contains a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso edges zzso between biological zzso The network was verified using four published gene expression profiling data sets associated with measured cell proliferation zzso in lung and zzso cell zzso zzso changes in the activity of core machinery involved in cell cycle regulation zzso zzso and zzso are statistically supported across multiple data sets, zzso the general zzso of this approach for a zzso biological impact assessment using systems biology zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this zzso Cell zzso Network provides the most comprehensive connectivity map in existence of the molecular mechanisms regulating cell proliferation in the zzso The network is based on fully referenced zzso relationships obtained from extensive evaluation of the zzso The zzso structure of the network enables its application to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of cell proliferation using systems biology data zzso The network is available for public zzso
