DNA zzso is a characteristic feature of systemic lupus zzso zzso immune zzso Numerous reports have implicated the involvement of the zzso zzso in the reduction of DNA zzso zzso zzso hence inducing the zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain zzso Here, we investigated whether the zzso zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso contributes to reduced DNA zzso We show that both chemical suppression and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso resulted in sustained zzso of zzso and zzso following stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso suppression resulted in increased zzso zzso activity, DNA zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso suppression of zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression and suppressed expression of the zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso regulates DNA zzso by influencing the zzso of zzso We propose that enhanced zzso in zzso zzso may zzso and activate the signaling zzso upstream of zzso thus disturbing the tight control of zzso zzso which are involved in zzso zzso
