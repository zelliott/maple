The zzso and zzso have recently been suggested to be involved in the regulation of limb growth, serving as potential sources of signaling molecules that are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previously, we observed that removal of the zzso and zzso from zzso in organ culture resulted in an overall increase in zzso cartilage growth, suggesting negative regulation originating from these zzso To determine if the zzso and zzso regulate growth through the production of zzso factors, we have tested various zzso media from these zzso for the ability to modify cartilage growth in zzso organ cultures from which these zzso have been zzso Both negative and positive regulatory activities were zzso zzso regulation was observed with zzso medium from zzso cell cultures of the region bordering both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells, and zzso a mixture of zzso media from zzso cell cultures and zzso cell zzso The requirement for regulatory factors from both the zzso and zzso suggests a novel mechanism of zzso Positive regulation was observed with zzso media from several cell types, with the most potent activity being from zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso
