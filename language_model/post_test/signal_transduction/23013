The role of zzso oxide in cellular signaling in the past 22 years has become one of the most rapidly growing areas in biology with more than 20,000 publications to zzso zzso oxide is a gas and free radical with an zzso electron that can regulate an ever-growing list of biological zzso In many instances zzso oxide mediates its biological effects by zzso zzso zzso and increasing zzso zzso synthesis from zzso However, the list of effects of zzso oxide that are independent of zzso zzso is also growing at a rapid zzso For example, zzso oxide can interact with transition metals such as iron, zzso groups, other free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids and other zzso Some of these reactions result in the zzso of zzso oxide to zzso and nitrate to terminate its effect, while other reactions can lead to altered protein structure, function, and/or zzso zzso These diverse effects of zzso oxide that are either zzso zzso dependent or independent can alter and regulate important zzso and zzso events in cell regulation and zzso zzso oxide can function as an zzso messenger, an zzso a zzso substance, a zzso or as a hormone that can be carried to distant sites for zzso Thus, it is a unique simple zzso with an array of signaling zzso However, as with any zzso zzso there can be too little or too much of the substance and pathological events zzso Some of the methods to regulate either zzso oxide formation, zzso or function have been in clinical use for more than a century as with the use of organic zzso and zzso in angina zzso that was initiated in the zzso Current and future research with zzso oxide and zzso zzso will undoubtedly expand the zzso therapeutic zzso to manage a number of important diseases by zzso zzso oxide and zzso zzso formation and zzso Such promise and expectations have obviously fueled the interests in these signaling molecules for a growing list of potential therapeutic zzso
