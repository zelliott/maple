The mechanisms of action of zzso in the nervous system involve zzso steroid signaling and zzso steroid zzso zzso receptors zzso are involved in both zzso zzso interacts with the signaling of IGF-1 zzso in neural zzso zzso zzso activity is regulated by IGF-1 zzso signaling and zzso regulates IGF-1 zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and the IGF-1 zzso in the brain may occur at the plasma membrane of zzso and zzso zzso zzso may provide the scaffolding for the interaction of different zzso zzso including zzso zzso channel, zzso and zzso zzso
