Both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso second zzso systems are involved in zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso zzso is one of the principal zzso calcium channels responsible for zzso stored zzso The precise location of the zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and its role in the events of zzso signal zzso need to be zzso By light microscopic and zzso zzso we show expression of the zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso responses, and of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso projections and zzso of essentially all zzso zzso zzso indicating that individual zzso express components of both second zzso zzso By zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is localized to the surface membrane of rat zzso zzso This is the first zzso demonstration of the surface membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings, taken in conjunction with zzso data from other workers, are supportive of the zzso zzso zzso playing a novel role in regulating calcium flux at the zzso surface zzso
