zzso zzso which causes bacterial zzso of diverse plants, produces copious zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso The function of zzso in zzso disease is zzso Leading hypotheses are that zzso physically zzso plant water zzso or that zzso zzso the zzso from host plant recognition and subsequent zzso Tomato plants infected with zzso zzso race 3 zzso 2 strain zzso and tropical strain zzso zzso genes in both the zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso defense signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso tomato line zzso activated expression of these defense genes faster and to a greater degree in response to zzso zzso infection than did susceptible zzso zzso zzso However, zzso played different roles in resistant and susceptible host responses to zzso zzso In susceptible plants the zzso and zzso zzso strains induced generally similar defense zzso But in resistant zzso tomato plants, the zzso pathogens induced significantly greater defense responses than the zzso zzso suggesting that the resistant host recognizes zzso zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso zzso triggered significant zzso zzso defense gene expression in zzso but not in zzso tomato zzso In addition, the zzso zzso triggered noticeably less production of zzso zzso oxygen species in resistant tomato stems and leaves, despite attaining similar cell zzso in zzso zzso these data suggest that bacterial zzso plants can specifically recognize zzso from zzso zzso
