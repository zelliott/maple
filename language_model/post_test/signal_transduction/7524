Liver function is affected during zzso zzso We evaluated the effect of the aging process on selected parameters determining the NO level in rat liver subjected to zzso 

The animals were divided into the zzso and the zzso group of young rats zzso months old) and the zzso and the zzso group of older rats zzso months zzso zzso belonging to the zzso and the zzso group were subjected to partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso (4 zzso Blood samples were obtained after surgeries to estimate the activity of zzso as well as just before zzso and during zzso zzso zzso and 240 zzso to estimate concentration of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and protein concentration of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were measured in liver zzso 

In the zzso group zzso level increased the most between 15 and 120 zzso of zzso and was the highest of all the groups zzso zzso In the zzso group zzso level decreased significantly and was lower compared to all the other groups at 15 zzso zzso zzso and to zzso at 120 zzso zzso and 240 zzso zzso zzso of zzso Only the zzso group zzso level increased significantly between 15 zzso zzso and 240 zzso zzso zzso of zzso At the beginning of the surgery the zzso level was significantly higher in young rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in older ones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group the zzso level zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso were significantly higher compared to the zzso groups at 15 zzso and to all the other groups at 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 240 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group zzso level zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso decreased significantly at 15 zzso and during the next phase of zzso the levels of those parameters were low, comparably to those in zzso As a result of zzso a decrease in zzso activity and an increase in zzso protein concentration were observed only in the young zzso 

We found that in the zzso groups the zzso level may be affected by the aging zzso Under zzso conditions, important changes in zzso zzso were observed only in young zzso
