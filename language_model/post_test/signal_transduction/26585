zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key factor in the widely used signaling cascade of zzso cycles and plays pivotal roles in many aspects of biological zzso Experimental studies in zzso and in zzso zzso have suggested that the zzso and spatial zzso of zzso are influenced by the level of its downstream zzso However, the zzso through which these zzso control properties of zzso zzso has been zzso I propose a zzso kinetic model of zzso cycle with its zzso and demonstrate that the zzso can zzso the zzso activity by directly interacting with zzso The model shows that the addition of zzso controls the level of zzso zzso positively or zzso depending on the balance between zzso zzso of zzso interaction and properties of zzso zzso signaling in the absence of the zzso In addition, by considering cellular zzso zzso and nucleus, the zzso can lead to nuclear zzso of zzso suggesting that the zzso can act as a nuclear anchor of zzso The model gives a possible mechanism that can account for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
