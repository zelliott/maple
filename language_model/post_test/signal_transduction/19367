zzso recognition of viruses is zzso by pattern recognition receptors zzso triggering expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In mice, zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso pathways have been shown to recognize zzso zzso virus zzso Here, we describe how human primary zzso recognize early zzso infection via zzso zzso A number of inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso after zzso zzso We show that early recognition of zzso and induction of zzso and inflammatory zzso are independent of zzso and zzso since zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso responses and the zzso were unresponsive to zzso zzso Instead, zzso recognition involves zzso recognition systems, since induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso was dependent on virus entry and zzso zzso expression of zzso was strongly inhibited by small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso but this zzso zzso induction occurred independently of the recently discovered zzso III zzso zzso DNA sensing zzso In contrast, induction of zzso was largely independent of zzso suggesting that induction of inflammatory zzso during zzso infection proceeds via a novel zzso zzso with zzso a broad inhibitor of zzso zzso recognition, revealed that zzso systems are employed to induce both zzso and zzso Finally, using zzso zzso we found that zzso but not zzso was the primary zzso of zzso zzso Thus, innate recognition of zzso by human primary zzso occurs via two distinct zzso zzso pathways responsible for induction of zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso
