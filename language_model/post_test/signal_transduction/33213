Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins play an important role in signaling through a variety of zzso and growth factor zzso Each of the zzso proteins is activated in a zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are critical for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study we determined the zzso in zzso protein that contribute to zzso 6 zzso zzso Based on evidence that zzso but not zzso is activated in the presence of low levels of zzso and soluble zzso zzso we constructed various swap zzso between zzso and zzso and examined their response to zzso after their transient expression into zzso zzso The region upstream of the zzso domain was zzso between zzso and zzso whereas the region zzso to the zzso domain of zzso was critical to zzso by zzso However, unlike zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the swap zzso in which 5 zzso acid zzso just zzso to the zzso zzso site zzso in zzso was replaced by the corresponding region derived from zzso was not zzso in response to zzso Substituting 1 zzso acid zzso at position zzso relative to zzso abolished the zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that these zzso were associated with zzso at an extent similar to zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that the zzso acid zzso immediately zzso to the zzso zzso site are involved in zzso zzso of zzso
