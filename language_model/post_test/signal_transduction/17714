During the process of zzso most colon cancer cells acquire resistance to zzso The short chain fatty acid zzso is well established as an zzso agent which selectively zzso zzso in colon cancer cells but not in normal zzso zzso zzso 

To zzso the zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso 

Using zzso cells we focused on the zzso family of zzso zzso pathway, and zzso zzso cascade involved in zzso induced zzso zzso employed included western zzso zzso as well as experiments with zzso zzso of specific zzso 

zzso induced a clear shift of the zzso zzso zzso towards a zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso of zzso zzso accompanied by reduced zzso zzso zzso This was associated with zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso cascade via zzso Key executioner zzso were zzso and zzso No effect of zzso on regulatory proteins of the inhibitor of zzso family was zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell zzso via the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were upstream of the zzso zzso zzso this cascade was activated via the formation of an zzso
