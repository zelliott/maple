zzso T zzso zzso 4 zzso is a T cell zzso zzso that delivers zzso signals upon zzso Although the zzso motif zzso within its zzso tail has been shown to associate in zzso with zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso upon zzso the mechanism of negative signaling remains zzso Here, we report a new mechanism of negative signaling based on the analysis of zzso T cell clones zzso with various zzso of zzso Upon T cell zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso engagement inhibited both proliferation and zzso 2 production in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso lacking most of the zzso region strongly suppressed zzso 2 production as zzso These data suggest that negative signals by zzso could be zzso through the zzso region of zzso but not through the zzso motif and that the association of zzso with zzso is not required for zzso suppression of T cell zzso
