Recent evidence suggests that fatty acids generated from zzso zzso zzso zzso may have important roles in zzso zzso This study was conducted to determine if fatty acids liberated from zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso rat zzso cultures were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or treated with short interfering zzso zzso targeted against zzso zzso effects on zzso metabolism and zzso activity and target gene expression were zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso zzso from zzso reporter activity zzso demonstrated that decreasing zzso zzso by zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in reporter activity under zzso conditions or in the presence of fatty zzso As expected, zzso target genes were also decreased in response to zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was able to restore zzso activity following zzso zzso Despite its effects on zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and the consequential release of fatty acids regulate zzso zzso
