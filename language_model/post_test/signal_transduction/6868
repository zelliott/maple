There is increasing evidence that the zzso hormone zzso receptors zzso can play a role in aging, cancer and degenerative zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso damage in cultured cells and in zzso of young zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso signal zzso and recruitment of the zzso zzso respiratory factor 1) and zzso to the promoters of genes with a key role on zzso zzso Increased zzso leads to production of zzso zzso oxygen species, which in turn causes zzso stress and DNA zzso breaks and triggers a DNA damage response that ultimately leads to premature zzso of susceptible zzso Our findings provide a mechanism for zzso zzso effects of zzso with the tumor zzso activity of zzso the effect of zzso status on zzso and the occurrence of tissue damage in zzso
