When used as an alternative zzso following bare zzso removal of zzso and other zzso surface diseases, zzso membrane transplantation can reduce zzso on the reconstructed zzso zzso This study was carried out to determine if the zzso membrane zzso suppresses the expression of the zzso signaling system in cultured normal zzso zzso and zzso body zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were cultured on AM and plastic zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with or without zzso Total zzso was extracted and subjected to Northern zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso beta zzso type I, II and zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso b zzso and zzso as a loading zzso zzso zzso was used for cell zzso 

zzso membrane markedly suppressed the transcript expression of zzso zzso and all three types of zzso receptors by both zzso as compared to their cultures on plastic zzso In addition, expression of zzso transcript was also markedly suppressed while that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was mildly zzso In contrast, expression of zzso and zzso remained largely zzso The cell proliferation of zzso and zzso grown on AM was also significantly zzso 

zzso membrane zzso uniquely suppresses zzso beta signaling in both types of zzso It may also suppress signaling via zzso zzso zzso and zzso As a result, the zzso may become less zzso zzso and zzso These data support in part why zzso membrane transplantation has an zzso effect for zzso surface zzso
