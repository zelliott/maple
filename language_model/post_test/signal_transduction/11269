zzso 1 zzso regulates zzso zzso however, published data regarding the direction of the effect are zzso We examined the effects of zzso and zzso forms of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and signaling pools of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso the zzso and nuclear pools of zzso when stabilized by zzso or zzso but not when stabilized at lower levels of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso examined were less able to reduce the stability of zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were again less zzso at the level of zzso but showed a different pattern of zzso toward zzso below zzso The zzso activity of zzso expressed zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso were also inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso regulates the stability and zzso activity of zzso at different levels in the zzso pathway, that the effect on zzso activity appears to be independent of the zzso zzso degradation of zzso and that zzso in zzso zzso affect the stability and zzso activity of zzso
