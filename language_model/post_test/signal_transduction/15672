Pulmonary zzso is a progressive zzso disease with no effective zzso zzso growth factor zzso is zzso in zzso diseases, where it stimulates differentiation of zzso to zzso and production of excess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma is a zzso factor that regulates zzso insulin zzso and zzso We report here that a novel zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso differentiation of human lung zzso to zzso and suppresses zzso of zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and the novel zzso marker, zzso The zzso concentration causing a 50% decrease in zzso for zzso was zzso lower than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (15 zzso and zzso lower than the synthetic zzso zzso zzso and genetic approaches were used to demonstrate that zzso mediates its activity via a zzso zzso zzso and 15 zzso contain an zzso zzso zzso which acts as an zzso center that can form zzso bonds with cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both strong zzso also inhibit zzso zzso but a structural analog of 15 zzso lacking the zzso center is much less zzso zzso does not alter zzso zzso or zzso zzso but does inhibit zzso of zzso binding zzso a critical zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso Overall, these data indicate that certain zzso zzso and other small molecules with zzso centers, are potent zzso of critical zzso zzso activities through pathways independent of zzso As the zzso concentration causing a 50% decrease in zzso for zzso is zzso lower than that in zzso the zzso potential of zzso for treatment of zzso diseases is zzso
