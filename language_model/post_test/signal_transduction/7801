A growing body of literature indicates that the zzso zzso can influence the zzso and differentiation of peripheral zzso T cells, though comparatively little is known about the effects of zzso signaling in human T zzso In the present report we demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling zzso immobilized zzso fusion zzso during stimulation of zzso human zzso and zzso T cells zzso zzso T cell proliferation and zzso function, including both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of T cell zzso is not due to zzso or disruption of zzso zzso zzso but is associated with zzso of zzso zzso related to zzso in zzso in zzso T cells, with modest effects on other zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso When evaluated for its effects on zzso T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso T cell zzso zzso with no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso signaling in human T cells induced by zzso promotes a novel form of T cell zzso that differs from zzso zzso primary T cell proliferation and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso function but not zzso capacity are ameliorated upon secondary zzso
