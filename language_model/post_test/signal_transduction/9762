Rapid production of zzso oxide zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso has been implicated in diverse zzso zzso such as programmed cell death, development, cell zzso and hormonal zzso in zzso Much attention has been paid to the regulation of plant innate immunity by these signal zzso Recent studies provide evidence that an zzso zzso respiratory burst zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso However, we still do not know about zzso zzso except for nitrate zzso although many studies suggest the existence of NO zzso activity responsible for NO burst in zzso Here, we introduce regulatory mechanisms of NO and zzso bursts by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and we discuss the roles of the bursts in defense responses against plant zzso
