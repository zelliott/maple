Invasion of zzso by zzso zzso is a complex process that is zzso by specific molecular zzso Here, we review recent studies on interactions between zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso proteins from the zzso and zzso receptors involved in zzso The timely release of these zzso zzso from internal zzso such as zzso and zzso to the zzso surface is critical for zzso leading to successful zzso We review information on signaling mechanisms that control the regulated zzso of zzso proteins during zzso zzso invasion involves the formation and movement of a junction between the invading zzso and host zzso We review recent studies on the molecular composition of the junction and the molecular motor that drives movement of the zzso
