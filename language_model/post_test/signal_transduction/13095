zzso are the most abundant proteins in the zzso body and it is well recognized that zzso fulfill an important structural role in the zzso zzso in a number of zzso zzso of the collagen alpha zzso gene in mice results in embryonic zzso and collagen zzso in humans cause defects leading to zzso zzso constitute a major group of receptors for zzso zzso zzso including zzso Currently four zzso I zzso zzso are known, namely alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 10 beta 1 and alpha 11 beta zzso Unlike the zzso role of zzso as structural zzso the biological importance of zzso zzso zzso interactions is far from zzso This is in part due to the limited information available on the most recent additions of the zzso family, alpha 10 beta 1 and alpha 11 beta zzso Future studies using gene zzso of individual and multiple zzso genes will allow testing of the hypothesis that zzso zzso have redundant functions but will also shed light on their importance in pathological zzso In this review we will describe what is currently known about the zzso zzso and discuss their biological zzso
