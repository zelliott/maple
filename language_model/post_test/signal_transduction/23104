zzso zzso zzso zzso is a protein zzso zzso zzso crucial in regulation of cell migration and zzso In addition to its zzso roles as a zzso zzso downstream of zzso and growth factor zzso zzso recent studies revealed new aspects of zzso action in the zzso Nuclear zzso promotes zzso and zzso degradation via zzso resulting in enhanced cell proliferation and reduced inflammatory zzso zzso can also serve as a zzso regulator that alters a gene zzso zzso These findings established a new paradigm of zzso signaling from cellular zzso to the zzso Although zzso stimuli for controlling zzso nuclear zzso have not been completely zzso zzso zzso from focal zzso to the nucleus to directly convey zzso zzso Interestingly, nuclear zzso of zzso becomes prominent in zzso conditions such as in zzso and pharmacological zzso zzso while a small fraction of nuclear zzso is observed a normal growth zzso In this review, roles of nuclear zzso in regulating zzso factors will be zzso Furthermore, a potential use of a pharmacological zzso inhibitor to target nuclear zzso function in diseases such as inflammation will be zzso
