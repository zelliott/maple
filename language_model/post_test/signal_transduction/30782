Previous studies have shown that zzso and zzso are required for the normal programmed cell death zzso in zzso of immature zzso zzso and zzso active zzso precursor zzso In contrast, zzso activity is not necessary for the normal zzso of more mature zzso zzso that are establishing synaptic zzso Although normally these cells use zzso for zzso in the absence of zzso activity these zzso undergo a distinct zzso type of zzso We examined the survival of these more mature zzso zzso populations in mice in which zzso has been genetically deleted and find that they exhibit zzso normal zzso of developing zzso zzso We next characterized the zzso mode of zzso in these mice and show that the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso that involves zzso However, zzso does not appear to be involved in the normal zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso are present and functional because zzso normal zzso zzso occurred in the absence of a key gene required for zzso zzso Finally, we examined the possible role of another zzso type of zzso zzso involving the zzso factor zzso Mice deficient in zzso also exhibit zzso normal zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that, when key components of the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso developing zzso zzso nonetheless undergo zzso normal zzso by a zzso zzso involving zzso and not requiring zzso
