The zzso signal zzso is initiated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso present in the zzso parts of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Numerous data suggest that after stimulation zzso interacts with membrane zzso and thus it gains access to zzso and other important molecules involved in signal zzso However, the precise mechanism of this process is zzso One of the key questions is how zzso access zzso and what is the importance of zzso and membrane zzso zzso for the initiation and maintenance of the zzso zzso To answer this question we targeted a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to membrane zzso recently described zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data show that only zzso targeted into zzso raft but not to zzso zzso or zzso membrane effectively zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the critical role of membrane zzso zzso in this zzso
