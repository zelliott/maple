zzso zzso are intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and zzso On the one hand, they are necessary for protein zzso zzso of damaged, zzso and potentially harmful proteins provides free zzso acids required for the synthesis of new zzso Furthermore, the selective breakdown of regulatory proteins by the zzso zzso controls key aspects of plant growth, development, and zzso zzso are, on the other hand, also responsible for the zzso modification of proteins by limited zzso at highly specific zzso Limited zzso results in the maturation of zzso is necessary for protein assembly and zzso zzso and controls the activity of zzso regulatory proteins and zzso zzso are thus involved in all aspects of the plant life cycle ranging from the zzso of storage proteins during seed zzso to the initiation of cell death and zzso zzso This article reviews recent findings for the major zzso classes, zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso emphasizing the regulatory function of representative zzso
