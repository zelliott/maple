zzso F is the most abundant zzso in zzso zzso and is analogous to zzso zzso zzso This paper examines the effects of zzso F on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and provides preliminary data on the zzso mechanisms zzso zzso F zzso zzso had profound zzso effects on zzso zzso in zzso The effects were insensitive to high zzso (1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso sites of zzso zzso F activity was not significantly blocked by a zzso zzso analog zzso that was found to inhibit zzso zzso indicating the occurrence of distinct zzso F and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso salt prior to the addition of zzso F completely abolished the zzso effects indicating the involvement of zzso and a zzso coupled zzso in zzso F zzso zzso of zzso zzso following zzso F had limited zzso effects consistent with the zzso of a zzso cascade by the zzso With respect to zzso involvement in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso larvae, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both abolished zzso F activity as did high zzso zzso and drugs which blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pumps zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso is important for zzso F zzso in zzso zzso With respect to second zzso the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso both abolished zzso zzso zzso The involvement of a zzso zzso that involves protein zzso C was further supported by the fact that zzso known to directly activate protein zzso C, had direct zzso effects on zzso zzso Although zzso F is structurally analogous to zzso Y, its zzso in zzso appears quite distinct from the common zzso mechanism seen in zzso
