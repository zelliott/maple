Cellular zzso is a zzso state of irreversible growth arrest thought to act as a barrier to cancer zzso The zzso tumor zzso is a critical zzso of zzso and recent in zzso studies have suggested that zzso zzso may contribute to tumor clearance by the immune zzso Recently developed zzso antagonists, the zzso are effective zzso zzso and potent zzso agents in cells with functional zzso zzso However, they only block cell cycle progression in cancer cells with compromised zzso zzso zzso We use zzso as a selective probe to study the role of zzso zzso in zzso using a panel of eight zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso zzso Our results reveal that the zzso zzso can induce a zzso state in all tested cell lines, but it is zzso and cells resume proliferation upon drug removal and zzso of zzso zzso zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso previously implicated in gene zzso during zzso zzso were found zzso in cells with zzso zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism for its zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso is insufficient for induction of true zzso in zzso cells in zzso However, elevated expression of several inflammatory zzso in cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso suggests a possible in zzso benefit of zzso zzso
