The zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate a variety of cellular functions by signaling to different signal zzso It is believed that the presence of a specific zzso at the location of zzso zzso determines the route of downstream zzso We previously reported about zzso zzso zzso of zzso By using the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso we investigated the impact of zzso zzso on binding to selected zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to their specific interaction partners zzso and zzso respectively, as well as to their common zzso protein zzso was zzso when zzso was exchanged to zzso as zzso zzso zzso with their common zzso proteins zzso or zzso alpha was, however, hardly zzso This ambivalent zzso was obvious in functional zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not able to induce increased membrane zzso Instead, zzso zzso allowed zzso formation, which is in accordance with zzso of the dominant zzso zzso zzso In addition, in contrast to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso failed to activate zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was as effective in zzso of zzso as zzso zzso illustrating positive signal zzso of zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso represents a zzso mechanism to shift specificity of zzso zzso and to zzso address selected downstream zzso
