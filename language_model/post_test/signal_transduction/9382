Evidence indicates that systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso brain zzso ultimately resulting in cognitive zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso zzso is well known to possess multiple biological functions, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we assessed the protective effect of zzso against the zzso cognitive deficits in zzso We found that zzso significantly improved cognitive deficits of zzso mice in open field, zzso passive avoidance and Morris water maze zzso One potential mechanism of this action was attributed to the decreased production of zzso markers including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and degradation, zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso in mouse brain, but did not affect the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may be useful for zzso zzso brain disorders by zzso zzso factors production, at least in part, through blocking the zzso signaling zzso
