zzso has recently been reported as a risk factor for zzso diseases such as coronary heart zzso however, its precise mechanism is not well zzso To zzso the role of insulin in the development of zzso we have investigated the effect of insulin on cell survival in zzso which are known to be important in the zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso cell lines derived from human zzso or zzso zzso by serum zzso zzso administration retarded zzso zzso by means of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso V binding zzso zzso also enhanced zzso expression and protein production of the zzso zzso gene in a zzso manner within the range of zzso zzso In the exploration of the signaling zzso involved in these zzso effects of insulin, zzso of cells with a specific inhibitor of zzso significantly suppressed zzso cell survival and zzso zzso expression in zzso These data indicate that the survival effect of insulin on the zzso of zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso and it may be zzso through the zzso signaling zzso These mechanisms could be involved in the possible role of insulin in the development of zzso
