zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly express zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and are successfully treated with zzso zzso a zzso zzso As resistance to zzso causes therapy failure, our aim was to develop an in zzso zzso model to evaluate zzso zzso and monitor therapy with small animal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The first mouse model of zzso zzso was successfully established by injecting zzso cells zzso into nude zzso 

Using the small animal zzso zzso zzso in zzso was significantly decreased after 24 h of treatment with zzso which correlated with a response to treatment, zzso with a decrease in zzso volume, the zzso of zzso and downstream intermediate zzso and arrest of zzso cell proliferation as evaluated after 7 days of zzso 

This model is useful to study zzso resistance and to evaluate novel targeted zzso
