zzso zzso has been viewed as one of the major medical problems, which can lead to progressive dysfunction of the liver, zzso zzso skin, heart, and eventually death of zzso Fibrosis is initiated by a variety of zzso zzso zzso and physical zzso Regardless of their different zzso they all share a common zzso process: excessive zzso of the key zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso a zzso zzso factor of the nuclear zzso zzso has received particular attention in recent years, because the zzso of zzso by both natural and synthetic zzso could effectively inhibit zzso zzso effects in many zzso 

The English-language medical databases, zzso zzso and zzso were searched for articles on zzso zzso and fibrosis, and related zzso 

zzso is recognized as a key zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases synthesis of zzso zzso proteins and decreases their degradation, associated with a gradual destruction of normal tissue architecture and function, whereas zzso zzso inhibit zzso signal zzso and are effective zzso agents in many zzso including the liver, zzso zzso skin and zzso 

The main zzso activity of zzso zzso is to suppress the zzso signaling zzso by so-called zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso especially zzso also exert potentially zzso activity independent of zzso zzso zzso signaling not only plays many essential roles in multiple zzso zzso but also forms zzso networks with other signal zzso and their zzso by zzso zzso certainly affects the zzso networks and causes zzso zzso zzso therapies with zzso zzso may have to be carefully tailored to be zzso and target zzso to minimize zzso indicating a great challenge to the medical research at zzso
