We have zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the major zzso domain within the insulin zzso zzso and showed that it zzso inhibited insulin zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso of a synthetic zzso by the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso interacts directly with zzso causing its zzso The zzso had no effect on the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or alkaline zzso Furthermore, we found that the introduction of a zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells caused a significant increase in zzso zzso of the insulin zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso receptors was not affected by the presence of zzso These data suggest that by zzso zzso of the insulin zzso in intact cells, zzso may specifically enhance insulin zzso
