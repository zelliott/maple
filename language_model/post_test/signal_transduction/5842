Due to the dominance of zzso zzso in rejection and the ability of zzso zzso particularly zzso to inhibit zzso responses, it has long been held that zzso zzso can improve transplant zzso Although there is some support for this, there is mounting evidence that zzso and zzso zzso can promote graft zzso These disparate effects are zzso 

The role of zzso zzso in graft dysfunction is not necessarily due to promotion of zzso zzso but is due to their ability to drive zzso and zzso responses including alternative zzso of zzso zzso activated zzso compete with classically activated zzso for zzso and they are mutually zzso analogous to mutual competition between zzso and zzso zzso Recent findings also point to two zzso of regulatory T cells zzso each dependent on either zzso or zzso zzso In addition to its effects on bone zzso cells, zzso affects zzso cells by zzso through the type II zzso which consists of the zzso alpha chain zzso and the zzso which also binds zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso in transplantation depend on their cellular targets, the timing and form of administration and on zzso zzso zzso
