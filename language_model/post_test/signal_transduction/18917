One of the fundamental questions in neural development is how zzso form zzso of the appropriate size for the efficient transfer of information across neural zzso Here we investigated the mechanisms that bring about the size correlation between zzso and zzso cells during development of zzso zzso junctions zzso To do this, we made use of a unique system in which two neighboring muscles zzso and zzso are zzso by the same zzso In mature zzso synaptic size on zzso is normally larger than that on zzso in accordance with the difference in muscle zzso this ensures the same extent of contraction of both muscles, and we refer to this correspondence as zzso We found that matching was apparent in larvae 8 h after zzso but not in newly hatched larvae despite the difference in muscle zzso When sensory zzso were suppressed by the expression of zzso toxin in sensory zzso matching did not occur, although zzso were able to zzso zzso was also suppressed by the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that matching is induced by regulating the rate of synaptic growth on zzso and zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso It seems most likely that retrograde signals from the zzso to the zzso cell convey the information about muscle cell zzso We thus examined whether a candidate of retrograde signaling in zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso However, there was no effect on matching in zzso type II zzso gene zzso suggesting that other zzso mechanisms besides zzso signaling are involved in the proper development of zzso
