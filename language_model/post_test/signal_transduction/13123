zzso is an zzso zzso produced in the joint in zzso arthritis by zzso and zzso blood zzso zzso of its expression is poorly zzso but previous findings have suggested that physical interactions with T cells may play a zzso This report investigates zzso mechanisms involved in the production of zzso zzso upon interaction with zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso were differentiated to zzso by zzso factor zzso and zzso with fixed T cells chronically zzso in a zzso cocktail of zzso necrosis factor zzso in the presence or absence of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso arthritis zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso of zzso arthritis T cells zzso and zzso was also zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso production was suppressed by cell separation and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso involvement was also shown by zzso of the downstream zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso was also inhibited by zzso and depletion of the zzso zzso fraction of the cell zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso activated by interaction with zzso is zzso and zzso
