zzso also known as zzso interaction domain containing zzso is a recently discovered gene which is involved in zzso insulin resistance zzso and zzso zzso We aimed to further zzso the effects and mechanisms underlying zzso zzso by investigating the effect of zzso zzso zzso factor A zzso which is essential for zzso DNA zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso copy number and zzso content in both control zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production was enhanced in zzso zzso and reduced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso production in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso did not affect the zzso zzso potential zzso in control zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso to the PM in zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso strongly induced zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso plays a role in zzso by zzso zzso function, and that zzso of zzso can restore zzso function to normal levels in zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
