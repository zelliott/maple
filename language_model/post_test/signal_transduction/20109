We found that zzso zzso Lyn zzso 1 zzso or zzso is highly expressed in human zzso cells and that stimulation with zzso zzso factor zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso factor zzso binding factor 1 zzso transporting zzso into the nucleus upon zzso stimulation and inducing zzso zzso In patients with severe zzso zzso inherited zzso in the gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso lead to profound defects in zzso zzso of zzso and subsequently to reduced zzso and expression of zzso zzso with these results, zzso mice are zzso In bone zzso zzso of the majority of tested patients with acute zzso zzso zzso protein expression is substantially zzso associated with high levels of zzso synthesis and, in some individuals, a zzso zzso in a zzso region of zzso protein known to accelerate zzso zzso These data demonstrate the importance of zzso in zzso in zzso and in zzso
