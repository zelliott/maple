zzso infections are common causes of fever without an apparent source in young zzso Despite absence of bacterial infection, many zzso children are treated with zzso zzso and bacteria interact with different pattern recognition receptors in circulating blood zzso triggering specific host zzso programs zzso immune zzso zzso unique zzso signatures may be defined that discriminate viral from bacterial causes of fever without an apparent zzso Gene expression zzso analyses were conducted on blood samples from 30 zzso children positive for zzso human zzso 6, or zzso infection or with acute bacterial infection and 22 zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso profiles clearly distinguished zzso zzso children from both zzso zzso controls and zzso children with the same viruses present in the zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiles could be zzso The zzso signaling zzso was uniquely activated in zzso children with viral infection, whereas the zzso signaling zzso was uniquely activated in children with bacterial zzso zzso profiles classified zzso children with viral or bacterial infection with better accuracy than white blood cell count in the zzso zzso accurate zzso was shown with data from an independent study using different zzso zzso Our results support the paradigm of using host response to define the zzso of childhood zzso This approach could be an important supplement to highly sensitive tests that detect the presence of a possible pathogen but do not address its zzso role in the patient being zzso
