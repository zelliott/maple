A major problem in the search for new cancer drug targets is that the drugs are often toxic to normal zzso and require high doses to kill tumor zzso Therefore cellular targets which appear to involve low dose responses to cancer therapy are especially interesting since they could selectively target normal zzso which are not targeted by the treatment and thus may be responsible for unpleasant side effects or may be amenable to exploitation in order to improve the therapeutic zzso One such target, which is the subject of this review, is zzso bystander effects zzso which result in the observation of radiation like responses in cells which have not been zzso zzso is a novel phenomenon which indicates that at low doses, cell signaling is more important than direct DNA zzso Historically, DNA has always been considered to be the target for radiation zzso The growing realization that signaling is important opens up several important therapeutic strategies which will be discussed in this zzso zzso appears to be the result of a generalized stress response in zzso or cells which is expressed at the level of the zzso organ or zzso rather than at the level of the individual zzso The signals may be produced by all exposed cells, but the response may require a zzso of cells in order to be zzso The major response involving low LET zzso or zzso radiation exposure discussed in the existing literature is a death zzso This has many characteristics of zzso but may be detected in cell lines without zzso zzso although the death response is suppressed in many tumor cell zzso While a death response in zzso normal cells around a tumor might appear to be zzso it can in fact be protective and remove damaged cells from the zzso If harnessed correctly, it could lead to the development of new drugs aimed not at tissue destruction but at enabling zzso mechanisms to control tumor zzso In this scenario, the level of harmful or beneficial response will be related to the background damage, carried by the cell population, and the genetic zzso determining response to zzso This focus may be important when attempting to predict the consequences of mixed therapies involving radiation and other zzso zzso In this review, our current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the induction of bystander effects by zzso radiation is zzso and the question of how bystander effects may be harnessed to produce a new generation of zzso drugs aimed at stabilization of tissue zzso rather than tissue destruction is zzso
