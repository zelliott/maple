This study examined the hypothesis that treatment with zzso zzso would alter the coronary blood flow and signal zzso responses of the rabbit zzso T4 was administered for 16 days by subcutaneous zzso zzso (3 zzso in 3 zzso New Zealand white zzso Four groups of zzso zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15 zzso zzso and T4 + zzso were used to determine coronary blood flow zzso zzso zzso zzso content zzso zzso low zzso zzso activity zzso zzso conversion of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso number and affinity zzso zzso blood flow was increased from control by zzso from 167 zzso 59 to 354 zzso 157 zzso zzso T4 did not cause cardiac zzso but increased baseline coronary blood flow to zzso zzso 115 zzso zzso The zzso response was attenuated in terms of blood flow zzso zzso zzso and heart rate with zzso zzso numbers increased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while neither soluble zzso zzso 39 vs 119 zzso 15 zzso zzso nor particulate zzso zzso activity were different between control and T4 zzso zzso zzso content was increased from control by both zzso zzso zzso 239 to zzso zzso zzso zzso and T4 zzso zzso zzso T4 animals showed a smaller increase in zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso There was not a significant difference between the control and T4 group zzso zzso level following zzso Thus, despite increased zzso numbers, there was a diminished responsiveness of heart rate, coronary blood flow and zzso zzso levels to zzso in the zzso rabbit zzso
