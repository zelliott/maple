zzso zzso are widely used in T cell zzso studies, and are effective in zzso zzso We used a panel of mouse zzso zzso switch zzso zzso of five different zzso to study zzso release from accessory zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso levels with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with no effect of zzso or zzso This suggested involvement of zzso zzso receptors zzso gamma zzso in triggering zzso zzso To evaluate the role of different zzso gamma R molecules individually we used a panel of zzso gamma zzso mouse zzso and zzso T cells as a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso expressing the zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso form was triggered by zzso zzso zzso with no effect of four other zzso None of the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso zzso expressing either a zzso of this zzso containing only a single zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso form, or zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso production after incubation with zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent with zzso and zzso zzso zzso involvement of T cells in triggering zzso zzso could be excluded by experiments in which zzso were cultured with immobilized zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of either zzso gamma zzso or zzso gamma zzso by appropriate zzso zzso triggers zzso production of accessory cells, and not T zzso This may also take place in zzso during zzso therapy with zzso zzso and related zzso immune zzso
