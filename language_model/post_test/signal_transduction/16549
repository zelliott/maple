Between the ages of 20 and 80 years, humans lose about zzso of their skeletal muscle zzso This phenomenon has been termed zzso of old age and is directly involved in the well-being of the zzso With aging, people tend to be less mobile and are frequently zzso which zzso the muscle weight zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for the muscle protein breakdown during zzso in aging have been studied in our laboratory in a model of zzso zzso rats, immobilized for 4 zzso zzso we investigated the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso systems in the immobilized zzso A similar group of young zzso rats was examined and compared to the older zzso The involvement of zzso zzso factor in muscle zzso was assessed in immobilized muscles of young and old zzso There were marked differences in the zzso and the pattern of zzso zzso in young versus old zzso It seems that in both young and old animals in the early stages of limb zzso an alternative zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso However, in late stages of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex with zzso alpha zzso is zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso is more prominent in muscles from old animals compared to young zzso The zzso of zzso has been observed also in muscles subjected to acute and intense exercise, zzso that inflammatory processes may take place under the conditions of intense zzso This may cause muscle damage and protein zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso may prove beneficial in attenuating zzso muscle damage in both disuse zzso and zzso zzso
