zzso a synthetic zzso zzso used in the treatment of cardiac failure, exhibits zzso zzso and cell growth regulatory zzso The mechanisms underlying these properties are not zzso but due to the critical role of nuclear zzso factor zzso B in these responses, we hypothesized that zzso must zzso zzso B zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on zzso B zzso induced by inflammatory zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso B in a zzso and zzso zzso This effect was zzso through zzso of zzso and degradation of I zzso B zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso The effects of zzso were not cell type specific, as it blocked zzso zzso B zzso in a variety of zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso activated by zzso was also suppressed by zzso The zzso zzso B zzso cascade involving zzso zzso zzso zzso associated death zzso zzso associated factor 2 zzso zzso zzso was interrupted at the zzso zzso associated factor 2 and zzso zzso zzso sites by zzso thus suppressing zzso B reporter gene zzso zzso also blocked zzso B zzso induced by several other inflammatory agents, inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso and suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also abolished by zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso B and zzso and their associated zzso This may provide a molecular basis for zzso ability to suppress zzso zzso and growth zzso
