In the present study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso with central administration in the forced swim test in zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso time, which was reversed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data suggested that central administration of zzso produced an zzso effect by zzso both zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso In order to eliminate the possibility of a zzso result in the forced swim test, locomotor activity was checked in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no influence on zzso mice, though had weak effect on zzso zzso In addition, mice treated with zzso did not display any zzso zzso
