Brain zzso is one of the most common causes of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the zzso Brain zzso zzso zzso refers to a zzso zzso zzso which results in tolerance to later, otherwise zzso cerebral zzso Many attempts have been made to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the zzso offered by zzso zzso Many studies have shown that zzso mechanisms may involve a series of molecular regulatory pathways including zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways such as zzso activated protein zzso zzso and other protein zzso zzso of zzso and heat shock proteins zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A better understanding of the processes that lead to cell death after stroke as well as of the zzso zzso mechanisms by which zzso protects against brain zzso insults could help to develop new therapeutic strategies for this devastating neurological zzso The purpose of the present review is to zzso the zzso mechanisms of zzso and to discuss the possibility of mimicking zzso zzso as a new strategy for preventive treatment of zzso
