The present studies examined the effects of growth hormone zzso on zzso and zzso release by zzso tissue from mice incubated for 24 h in primary zzso In zzso tissue from control mice zzso enhanced zzso without affecting zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso was unaffected in zzso tissue from zzso male mice but zzso release was enhanced by zzso in fat from zzso zzso In zzso tissue from zzso female mice no significant zzso action of zzso was seen but zzso release was enhanced by zzso An zzso effect of zzso on zzso conversion to zzso was also seen in mice deficient in zzso These results suggest that the zzso action of zzso involves the zzso proteins while the zzso effects of zzso on zzso metabolism and zzso release involve different zzso
