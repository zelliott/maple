Previous work in our laboratory has indicated that the steroid hormone zzso triggers programmed zzso in the fat body of zzso larvae by zzso the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso We recently found evidence that Deep orange zzso a zzso zzso finger protein implicated in zzso trafficking, controls zzso signaling as well as zzso fusion, thus exerting a dual regulation of zzso We found that zzso zzso are defective in programmed zzso The zzso larvae showed impaired zzso of zzso signaling during development, accompanied by a failure to zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could be restored by feeding the zzso zzso with zzso Even though zzso signaling and zzso were impaired in the zzso zzso we detected an zzso of zzso in zzso zzso fat zzso This could probably be attributed to the failure of zzso to fuse with zzso In this zzso we review these findings and provide some speculations about how zzso may control both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
