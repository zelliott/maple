zzso zzso zzso regulates traits important to both zzso of grape as well as colonization of zzso zzso via its production of a fatty acid signal zzso known as zzso whose production is dependent on zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit increased zzso to plants, they are unable to be spread from plant to plant by insect zzso To gain more insight into the traits that contribute to these zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso for this species was developed and used to determine the zzso zzso by zzso zzso In total, zzso protein coding genes whose expression was significantly different between the wild type and an zzso zzso zzso discovery rate zzso zzso were identified when cells were grown in zzso liquid zzso Among them, 165 genes were zzso in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso strain whereas 281 genes were zzso zzso function was required for regulation of 11 regulatory and zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In general, zzso is required for regulation of genes involved in attachment and zzso formation, enhancing expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso and suppressing most type IV zzso and gum zzso A large number of other zzso genes that might contribute to zzso or insect colonization were also identified such as those zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as genes with unknown zzso
