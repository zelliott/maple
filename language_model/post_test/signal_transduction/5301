Development of the peripheral nervous system requires zzso zzso sorting by zzso cells zzso To accomplish zzso zzso must both zzso and undergo zzso changes such as process zzso Signaling studies reveal pathways that control either proliferation or zzso and zzso is essential for SC zzso However, it is not clear whether zzso is also required for SC zzso By using a novel zzso zzso technique, we demonstrated that zzso are required for zzso to form a bipolar shape as well as for process zzso These zzso deficits are accompanied by zzso in signaling zzso zzso of zzso at zzso 518 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all significantly decreased in zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso activities in cultured zzso attenuated zzso zzso whereas forced zzso of zzso and/or zzso in zzso improved sorting and zzso zzso in zzso lacking zzso These findings indicate that zzso play a pivotal role in regulating SC zzso zzso zzso with previous results demonstrating that zzso is critical for SC zzso this work identifies zzso signaling as a central regulator zzso the processes of proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
