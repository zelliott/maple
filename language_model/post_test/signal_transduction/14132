zzso the calcium salt of zzso contributes to the maintenance of zzso in zzso patients, but its mechanism of action in the central nervous system is zzso Here, we report the effect of zzso on zzso behavior in standard laboratory zzso rats, including voluntary ethanol consumption and the zzso zzso After forced ethanol consumption arranged by the provision of only one drinking bottle containing zzso ethanol, the rats were given a choice between two drinking bottles, one containing water and the other containing zzso zzso In rats selected for high ethanol zzso repeated oral administration of zzso diminished voluntary ethanol zzso After three months of continuous access to two bottles, rats were deprived of ethanol for three days and then presented with two bottles zzso After ethanol zzso ethanol preference was increased, and the increase was largely abolished by zzso After exposure of primary zzso cultures of rat cerebral zzso to ethanol for four days, zzso as measured by the zzso leakage of zzso zzso zzso was induced by incubation with zzso for zzso followed by incubation in the absence of ethanol for zzso The zzso zzso blocker zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso blocker zzso all inhibited zzso zzso leakage from zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso leakage from zzso zzso more strongly than that from intact zzso In conclusion, zzso showed effective reduction of drinking behavior in rats and protected zzso zzso by multiple blocking of zzso zzso
