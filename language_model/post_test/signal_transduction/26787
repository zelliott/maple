zzso proteins are zzso expressed zzso zzso proteins that have emerged as key zzso of many cell signaling pathways in multiple cell zzso Its effects are mainly zzso by binding to selective zzso zzso The importance of zzso proteins in cancer have only started to become apparent and its exact role in cancer progression as well as the mechanisms by which zzso proteins mediate cancer cell function remain zzso While protein zzso is widely accepted as a tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to have tumor promoting zzso Despite the importance of zzso family in zzso various cell zzso the exact role and mechanism of zzso remain zzso In the current study, we investigated the role of protein zzso in prostate cancer cell zzso and zzso migration using zzso molecular biology and electric zzso zzso sensing approaches as well as cell based functional zzso Our study indicated that expression with zzso protein zzso significantly enhanced zzso activity in zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity and associated zzso of zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso active zzso enhanced zzso zzso recognition, zzso formation, cell migration and zzso migration by zzso zzso In contrast, expression with zzso zzso or zzso in zzso cells significantly inhibited these cell zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso enhances prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso migration in zzso via zzso of zzso and is an important target for therapeutic interventions for prostate zzso
