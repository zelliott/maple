The balance between zzso and its naturally occurring inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical in determining the inflammatory zzso Four zzso zzso of the zzso gene have been zzso one zzso zzso and three zzso zzso The biological roles of the zzso zzso remain largely zzso We wished to determine whether zzso had zzso functions regulating zzso zzso zzso was determined using an zzso reporter zzso measuring induction of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in zzso cells did not cause zzso of zzso promoter activity following zzso of the zzso zzso components zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso This implies that zzso does not act to alter zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso We investigated whether zzso and/or zzso of the zzso zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso by permitting its zzso In zzso cells, no effect of zzso was observed in zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso cells, compared to a significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso cells zzso with zzso the released fraction was effective in attenuating zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso does not act at an zzso level to alter zzso zzso zzso and is effective in zzso zzso responses only when released in an zzso and cell type specific zzso
