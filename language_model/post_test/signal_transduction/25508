Increased zzso zzso activity promotes cancer cell zzso and zzso of cell surface zzso acid zzso with poor prognosis in cancer zzso To seek therapies targeting zzso for cancer treatment, we developed a novel ST zzso zzso and investigated its zzso and zzso effects and zzso We found that cells treated with zzso showed a reduction of activity on various ST zzso by in zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso inhibited migration and invasion abilities in various cancer cell lines and showed zzso effect on the zzso activity of human zzso vein zzso zzso Indeed, zzso treatment consequently delayed cancer cell zzso in experimental and spontaneous zzso zzso in animal zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso acid modification of zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso activity leading to zzso dynamic zzso In addition, zzso and zzso analyses showed that zzso altered the protein expression level and zzso status of various proteins involved in crucial zzso and zzso pathways such as zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment significantly inhibited the invasive ability exerted by zzso zzso of various ST zzso catalyzing zzso or zzso Our results provide compelling evidence that the potential zzso zzso zzso suppressed cancer cell zzso likely by zzso zzso signaling and expressing zzso zzso zzso is worthy for further testing as a novel zzso drug for cancer zzso
