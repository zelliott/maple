The effect of zzso and other zzso on zzso zzso was studied in primary cultures of rat zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso for 1 to 30 zzso brought about an increase in cellular zzso zzso of calcium influx by zzso was investigated using a 90 zzso exposure to zzso and over a concentration range of zzso zzso to 3 zzso a zzso zzso curve was obtained with zzso values of zzso zzso and 9 zzso indicating the presence of low and high affinity zzso binding zzso Similar levels of zzso influx at 90 zzso were observed with zzso zzso and zzso (all at 100 zzso Prior treatment of the cultures with zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that one zzso for calcium entry in zzso involves zzso zzso calcium zzso
