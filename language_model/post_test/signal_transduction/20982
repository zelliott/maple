zzso zzso is an zzso signal of the transforming growth zzso family with multiple functions during zzso zzso For example, it plays a key role in the zzso during zzso zzso During this process, zzso stimulates zzso of the zzso genes zzso in the visceral zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso response element zzso from an zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso and that zzso expression from a zzso zzso depends on multiple zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso protein zzso binds to the zzso zzso and ubiquitous expression of a zzso form of zzso suppresses zzso reporter gene expression and reduces zzso expression in the zzso zzso a zzso protein may act as a nuclear target, or as a partner of a nuclear target, for zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso
