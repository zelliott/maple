zzso in the zzso gene have recently been shown to cause zzso zzso Parkinson's zzso To estimate the prevalence of this zzso an analysis was undertaken of 39 index cases of Parkinson's disease in whom a family history suggested zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso were found in these patients, indicating that this gene is unlikely to be of zzso significance in clinical zzso The hypothesis was also tested that young onset Parkinson's disease patients in whom, despite extensive analysis, only a single zzso zzso zzso was found, might zzso a second zzso in the zzso zzso is, zzso zzso No patient was found with a single zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso making this mode of inheritance zzso Finally it was confirmed that zzso and zzso zzso despite being zzso similar and mapping to the same small zzso region of zzso are caused by zzso in separate zzso
