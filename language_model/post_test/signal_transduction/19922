zzso are well known as zzso zzso of liver X receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso of zzso suppress cell proliferation via zzso signaling zzso Recent reports have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso plays an opposite direction to zzso in zzso zzso The present report was to explore the effect and mechanism of zzso on zzso proliferation in zzso Following administration, zzso had a 48 h half life in the circulation and widely distributed in mouse zzso zzso zzso array and zzso analysis showed that either zzso or zzso zzso generated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso plus administration of zzso significantly zzso the proliferation gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso in a zzso manner in liver while substantially zzso the expression of cell cycle arrest gene zzso and zzso gene zzso Either zzso or zzso administration of zzso significantly induced zzso DNA replication as measured by zzso of the zzso labeling index and was associated with reduction in expression of zzso response zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively blocked zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be a potent regulator of zzso proliferation and zzso zzso may represent a novel regulatory zzso in liver proliferation via zzso zzso zzso
