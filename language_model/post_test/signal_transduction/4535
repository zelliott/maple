zzso zzso is a small, zzso expressed zzso protein with known important zzso zzso However, zzso is also zzso in response to various stress zzso is found both at the cell surface and zzso into zzso and has known zzso and zzso zzso Previous animal studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso delivery can have therapeutic effects in a number of disease models and have implicated an interaction of zzso with the complement zzso We found that zzso is expressed in a zzso form at the surface of zzso and acts as an inhibitor of complement deposition in a manner dependent on its zzso active zzso zzso occurred at the point of the zzso zzso of complement, regulating production of zzso and the membrane attack zzso A truncated form of zzso also exists in zzso zzso which has separate zzso functions compared with the full-length zzso We found that zzso activates the classical and alternative pathways of complement zzso leading to zzso production, but the inflammatory potential of this was also limited by the binding of zzso zzso protein and factor zzso This study adds a further role to the known zzso properties of zzso and highlights the difference in function between the full-length and truncated zzso
