Studies in cultured cells have implicated protein zzso zzso alpha zzso as a potential regulator of insulin zzso The zzso role of zzso in insulin action was investigated using zzso mice deficient in zzso zzso animals had normal body weights and circulating levels of zzso and insulin in random fed and zzso zzso In zzso and insulin tolerance tests, their efficiency of blood zzso clearance was comparable to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso were similar in zzso and zzso liver, muscle, and zzso zzso However, the association of zzso and zzso zzso was altered in zzso liver, with increased zzso and reduced zzso association compared to zzso zzso This did not affect zzso of the downstream signaling zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is not a negative regulator of insulin signaling and does not perform an essential role in zzso the zzso action of zzso
