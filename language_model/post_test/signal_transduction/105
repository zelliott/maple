zzso stabilizing effects of zzso as well as of the small zzso zzso 1 are well zzso Moreover, it is generally believed that zzso zzso such as zzso disrupt zzso barrier functions primarily via zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we provide evidence that decrease of both zzso levels and of zzso 1 activity contribute to zzso barrier zzso Treatment of human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso electrical resistance zzso and caused zzso gap zzso These effects were reversed by addition of zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso but not by the zzso analogue zzso zzso which primarily stimulates protein zzso A zzso signaling via zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso did not increase zzso above control levels in the presence of zzso in contrast to experiments without zzso 1 zzso Because zzso 1 was required for maintenance of barrier functions as well as for zzso barrier stabilization, we tested the role of zzso 1 and zzso in zzso barrier zzso zzso drop of zzso and zzso gap formation were paralleled by a rapid decrease of zzso as revealed by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso The efficacy of zzso or zzso to block zzso effects of zzso was comparable to zzso zzso of zzso zzso but was blunted when zzso 1 was zzso by zzso Taken together, these data indicate that decrease of zzso and zzso 1 activity may be an important step in inflammatory barrier zzso
