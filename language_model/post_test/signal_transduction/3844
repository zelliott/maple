zzso gap recordings from the zzso roots of isolated, zzso zzso spinal cords were used to determine the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on primary zzso terminals by zzso acid zzso zzso root zzso evoked by zzso root zzso were significantly reduced by zzso (30 zzso as were zzso and zzso zzso terminal zzso The effects of zzso on zzso depended upon zzso of group I zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects were blocked by the group zzso zzso zzso but not by the group II zzso zzso or the group III zzso zzso and were zzso by the group I zzso zzso but were not zzso by the group III zzso zzso zzso the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso but the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not alter zzso depression of zzso zzso The actions of zzso on zzso zzso were neither zzso nor blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid, zzso indications that the effects of zzso did not involve zzso zzso the release of zzso from zzso stores, or the formation of zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso were blocked by 20 zzso zzso the broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso and the selective zzso zzso zzso acid, but not by the zzso zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso (10 zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso depression of zzso zzso involves an zzso zzso mechanism that includes zzso of Group I zzso zzso receptors on zzso and/or on zzso zzso the release of zzso from the latter structures, and the zzso of zzso receptors on primary zzso zzso The depression of zzso zzso caused by the release of zzso from zzso terminal and/or zzso leads to a block of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso spinal zzso by zzso resulting in a positive zzso amplification of zzso zzso
