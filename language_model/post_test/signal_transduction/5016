zzso diseases zzso are the major causes of death in the western zzso The zzso of cardiovascular disease as well as the rate of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity increase zzso in the elderly population, suggesting that age per zzso is a major risk factor of zzso The zzso changes of human cardiac aging mainly include left zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso increased cardiac fibrosis, increased prevalence of zzso zzso and decreased zzso exercise zzso Many of these changes are closely zzso in animal models commonly used in an aging study, including zzso flies, and zzso The application of genetically modified aged mice has provided direct evidence of several critical molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac aging, such as zzso zzso stress, zzso growth zzso pathway, zzso and zzso zzso II zzso and zzso signaling zzso This article also reviews the central role of zzso zzso stress in zzso and the plausible mechanisms underlying the progression toward heart failure in the susceptible aging zzso Finally, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cardiac aging may support the potential clinical application of several zzso strategies that treat zzso and improve healthy cardiac zzso
