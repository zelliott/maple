zzso are zzso diseases, and their mechanisms of invasion and zzso are highly zzso In breast cancer, zzso that specifically correlate with the invasive zzso have not been clearly zzso A small zzso zzso primarily regulates recycling of plasma membrane zzso We have shown that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso in some breast zzso and used for their invasion and zzso zzso of these proteins is independent of the zzso zzso of their zzso and occurs only in highly zzso breast cancer zzso We recently identified zzso zzso to be responsible for the zzso zzso to induce invasion and zzso by directly binding to zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso A series of our studies revealed that for zzso of the invasion zzso of zzso it is prerequisite that zzso and zzso both are highly zzso and that zzso is activated by zzso zzso analyses indicate that a significant large population of human zzso zzso may zzso the zzso zzso for their zzso zzso have been highly implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso Our results reveal an aspect of the precise molecular mechanisms of some breast zzso in which full zzso is not acquired just by zzso zzso of cancer cells, but zzso factors from zzso may also be zzso zzso translation of our knowledge to cancer zzso will also be zzso
