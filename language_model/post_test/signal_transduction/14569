Since zzso is an important zzso growth factor, we sought to examine the zzso mechanisms by which it exerts two of its pivotal effects, stimulation of proliferation and zzso We used the zzso zzso cell line zzso which zzso spontaneously to differentiated growth plate zzso This differentiation process could be enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the protein zzso zzso A zzso by zzso or zzso and the zzso zzso by zzso suppressed zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso early cell zzso as assessed by collagen type II and zzso gene zzso was not affected by zzso zzso zzso but significantly diminished by zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso Moreover, terminal differentiation of zzso in response to zzso as assessed by gene expression of alkaline zzso Indian zzso and collagen type X, were only interrupted by zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts its differential effect on zzso proliferation vs differentiation through the use of at least four partially interacting zzso signaling zzso whose activity is temporarily zzso When zzso progress from zzso cells to early and terminal zzso cells, they progressively zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso This mechanism might be essential for the complex and cell zzso anabolic action of zzso in the growth zzso
