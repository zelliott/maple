Due to frequent zzso in certain zzso zzso gene is considered as an zzso However, in some normal zzso zzso can limit cell growth and promote cell zzso Thus, zzso action appears zzso 

zzso expression was forced in pancreatic cell zzso The zzso exerted dual zzso it suppressed tumor growth in pancreatic zzso cells and had zzso properties in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso exclusive pathways were zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso had similar effects and used the same zzso zzso In human pancreatic zzso zzso levels of zzso dropped in zzso 

In tumors from zzso origin, zzso signal can limit tumor growth, explaining why the zzso locus bearing zzso is frequently lost and why zzso zzso of zzso in benign or low grade tumors of zzso origin are associated with good zzso The new hypothesis that zzso can harbor both tumor zzso and zzso properties is crucial in the context of targeted therapies involving specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso might result in adverse effects if used in the wrong cell zzso
