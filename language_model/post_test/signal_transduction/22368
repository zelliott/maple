Purple acid zzso zzso are a family of zzso involved in a variety of zzso functions, especially zzso zzso adaptations in zzso We identified 26 putative zzso genes by a zzso analysis of rice zzso zzso 24 of which have isolated zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that 25 of these genes possess sets of zzso zzso typical of known zzso zzso analysis classified the 26 rice and 29 zzso zzso into three main groups and seven zzso We detected transcripts of 21 zzso genes in roots or leaves of rice zzso The expression levels of ten zzso genes were zzso by both zzso deprivation and zzso of the zzso factor zzso These zzso genes all contained one or two zzso binding elements in their promoter regions, zzso that they are directly regulated by zzso Both acid zzso (AP) and surface zzso acid zzso zzso activity zzso showed that the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout or zzso zzso interference led to an increase in zzso and zzso activity in rice zzso This study reveals the potential for developing technologies for crop improvement in zzso use zzso
