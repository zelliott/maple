zzso zzso survives in aquatic zzso but replicates within zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, the signal zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in response to zzso acid depletion was zzso To facilitate kinetic and genetic studies, a zzso reporter of zzso was engineered by fusing zzso promoter sequences to a gene zzso green fluorescent zzso When subjected to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso and converted from a zzso to a virulent state, as judged by zzso and sodium zzso zzso appeared to initiate this response, as zzso zzso induced to express the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso independently of zzso depletion accumulated zzso exited the exponential growth phase and expressed zzso zzso sodium sensitivity, zzso and zzso five traits correlated with zzso Although zzso with the stationary phase, zzso zzso zzso expression appeared to require an additional zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso and acquired two stationary phase traits but none of six zzso zzso zzso We propose that, when nutrients are limiting, zzso acts as an zzso triggering the expression of multiple traits that enable zzso zzso to escape its spent host, to survive and disperse in the environment and to re-establish a protected zzso replication zzso
