The Ras zzso zzso targets zzso factors such as the zzso complex factors that are recruited by the serum response factor to form complexes on the serum response element zzso of the zzso zzso We have identified a new zzso complex factor, zzso We report the features of the net gene and show that it produces several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein are expressed in a variety of zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed at low levels, and the protein was not zzso raising the possibility that it is a cryptic zzso zzso We have studied the composition of zzso complexes that form on the zzso of the zzso promoter with extracts from zzso zzso zzso cultured under various conditions and zzso cells zzso before and after differentiation with zzso zzso The zzso complexes contain mainly zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso complexes, as well as zzso and zzso are induced by zzso growth factor zzso stimulation of cells cultured in low zzso zzso complexes contain mainly zzso with less of zzso and little of zzso There is little change upon zzso differentiation compared to the increase with zzso in zzso We have also found that zzso is a nuclear protein that zzso zzso zzso zzso is not activated by Ras zzso in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso We have previously reported that zzso of Net proteins with zzso zzso increases zzso zzso The increase in zzso activity is observed at low serum levels and is even greater after serum zzso showing that the zzso is under negative regulation by Net proteins and the level of repression increases during zzso zzso the zzso factor in zzso complexes in zzso may both keep the activity of the zzso low in the absence of strong inducing conditions and rapidly shut the activity off after zzso
