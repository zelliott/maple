Evidence indicates that a limited set of common genetic zzso is responsible for tumor progression and cancer cell resistance to current zzso The ability of tumor cells to escape zzso zzso which normally occurs in response to zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso Recent work supports the existence of alternative zzso death programs, which seem effective in cancer cells bearing multiple defects in zzso zzso The goal of this review is to highlight the importance of these alternative death programs and to present the zzso zzso protein (Early region 4 open reading frame zzso as a unique molecular tool to identify key regulators of these pathways in cancer zzso Evidence indicates that zzso hijacks the zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso to activate a cell death program in cancer cells, which does not rely on the classical zzso pathways and zzso zzso Recent findings support a critical role for zzso zzso dynamics downstream of zzso zzso in the regulation of this cell death zzso
