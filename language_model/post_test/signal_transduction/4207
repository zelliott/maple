The survival and proliferation of the zzso human zzso cell line is strictly dependent on the presence of either zzso 3, zzso zzso factor or zzso In these cells, zzso stimulation led to the rapid zzso of several proteins including the zzso zzso and proteins with molecular masses around 45 zzso which could be zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso from resting or zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso revealed two zzso of zzso basic protein zzso zzso The zzso activity of the first peak was independent of zzso treatment of the cells and corresponded to an unidentified zzso zzso whereas the second peak was only present in zzso cells and corresponded to three forms of zzso zzso with molecular masses of 45, 44 and 42 zzso The three forms were separated by zzso zzso and were shown to be activated in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso forms corresponded to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Evidence was obtained showing that the zzso form is not a shifted form of zzso but corresponded to a less well defined form of zzso zzso which may be the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected after 1 zzso zzso stimulation and remained zzso after more than 1 zzso A role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell proliferation was suggested by the simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulation and cell zzso The potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells and its zzso activity was strongly zzso The protein zzso zzso was heavily zzso in zzso zzso cells and associated strongly with a unidentified zzso zzso However, zzso bound poorly to the activated zzso zzso and most zzso proteins were zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso associated efficiently with the activated zzso zzso and a significant part of zzso was associated to a particulate zzso fraction upon zzso zzso
