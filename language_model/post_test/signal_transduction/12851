zzso and T cell factor zzso are zzso components of the highly zzso zzso zzso that govern cell fate and proliferation in lower zzso Thus, we hypothesized that the regulation of zzso and zzso played a critical role in vascular zzso The first objective was to define zzso expression in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso after balloon zzso Indeed, zzso zzso and protein were significantly elevated 7 days after balloon injury in the rat carotid zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso in response to vascular injury inhibited zzso zzso In line with our hypothesis, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso into rat zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso of zzso To test if zzso was necessary to zzso zzso survival, loss of function studies were carried out with a dominant negative zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding domain, zzso Indeed, loss of zzso activity abolished zzso zzso We further zzso that zzso and zzso promoted cell cycle progression by zzso zzso zzso a target gene of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and this zzso was partially blocked with loss of zzso In zzso blockade of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso incorporation and partial blockade of the zzso phase zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso play a dual role in vascular zzso by zzso zzso zzso and promoting zzso
