We investigated the zzso between the zzso and zzso receptors in zzso human zzso While both zzso and zzso zzso increase zzso zzso concentration zzso we found that zzso treatment causes a decrease in the subsequent zzso zzso release from zzso stores and zzso influx from zzso zzso In addition, zzso also inhibited the subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso generation in a manner comparable to the zzso zzso However, zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso release and influx, thus indicating that zzso does not directly inhibit the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso which does not produce zzso was also inhibited by treatment with zzso suggesting the presence of zzso channels that are regulated by zzso Treatment with zzso zzso or zzso inhibited the subsequent zzso response similar to zzso Moreover, the incubation of cells with zzso zzso a protein zzso A inhibitor abolished zzso zzso effect on the zzso zzso rise and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso both zzso zzso production and zzso channel zzso through protein zzso A zzso
