Being unable to move away from their places of zzso in order to avoid excess zzso damages, plants have to evolve different strategies and complex regulatory mechanisms to survive harsh zzso While both zzso and zzso are documented to be important in plant response to metal stress, the mechanisms underlying the zzso between zzso and zzso in metal stress are poorly zzso In this review, we provide an update on the regulation of plant responses to zzso by zzso and zzso signaling zzso primarily, with a focus on the copper, aluminum and cadmium zzso We aim at surveying the mechanisms underlying how metal stress zzso the changes in zzso distribution and the network of zzso and zzso in plant response to metal stress based on recent zzso
