Recent findings on zzso and non zzso zzso routes are currently changing our classical view of zzso Originally seen as a way for the cell to zzso zzso receptors or various soluble zzso this process is in fact directly linked to complex signaling zzso Here, we review new insights in zzso and present latest development in imaging techniques that allow us to zzso and follow the dynamics of zzso signaling events at the plasma membrane and other zzso zzso The immune zzso is taken as an illustration of the importance of membrane reorganization and proteins zzso to initiate and maintain zzso Future challenges include understanding the zzso between traffic and signaling and how all zzso signals are integrated inside the cell at a higher zzso
