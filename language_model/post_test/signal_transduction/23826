The risk of specific zzso increases in patients zzso dysfunction, including obesity and zzso Here, we use zzso as a model to explore the effects of diet on tumor zzso Feeding zzso a diet high in carbohydrates was previously demonstrated to direct zzso dysfunction, including zzso zzso and insulin zzso We demonstrate that high dietary sugar also converts zzso tissue from localized zzso to aggressive tumors with emergent zzso Whereas most zzso displayed insulin resistance, zzso tumors retained insulin zzso sensitivity, increased the ability to import zzso and resisted zzso High dietary sugar increased zzso zzso zzso activity, which zzso insulin zzso gene expression to promote insulin zzso The result is a zzso circuit that amplified zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso By targeting multiple steps in this circuit with rationally applied drug combinations, we demonstrate the potential of zzso drug intervention to treat zzso zzso zzso
