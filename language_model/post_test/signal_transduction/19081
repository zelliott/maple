We have shown that the tobacco zzso zzso zzso is an zzso for zzso receptors zzso and increased DNA synthesis of human lung zzso cells with features of zzso Clara cells by binding to these zzso Using a cell line derived from a human pulmonary zzso with Clara cell zzso zzso and immortalized human small airway zzso cells zzso the putative cells of origin of this cancer type, our current studies have analyzed signaling initiated by binding of zzso to the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso manner in both cell zzso This response was further increased by transient zzso of the beta zzso zzso of cells to the selective beta zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso suggesting the latter zzso zzso and zzso via this zzso In zzso labeling and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso an effect inhibited by zzso The inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso ability to stimulate zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso genes showed that no zzso were present in either zzso zzso our data provide evidence, for the first time, that zzso targets zzso and zzso proteins via dual signaling involving beta zzso and zzso pathways in zzso and their putative cells of zzso
