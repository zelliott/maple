zzso prion protein zzso generated from the cellular zzso of zzso zzso is assumed to be the main or sole component of the zzso called zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is a zzso zzso acquired immune responses are not induced in zzso Meanwhile, zzso of the innate immune system has been suggested to partially block the progression of zzso however, the mechanism is not well zzso To further zzso the role of the innate immune system in prion infection, we investigated the function of zzso regulatory factor 3 zzso a key zzso factor of the zzso type I zzso zzso production zzso We found that zzso mice exhibited significantly earlier onset with three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso following zzso transmission, than with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso attenuated prion infection in the cell culture system, while zzso was increased in zzso cells treated with small interfering zzso zzso against zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso Our findings provide new insight into the role of the host innate immune system in the zzso of prion zzso
