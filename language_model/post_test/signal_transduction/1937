zzso necrosis zzso zzso is a contributing cause of the insulin resistance seen in obesity and zzso type 2 diabetes, but the zzso by which zzso zzso insulin resistance is not zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we identified 142 known genes zzso zzso by at least zzso after 4 h and/or 24 h of zzso treatment, and 78 known genes zzso by at least twofold after 24 h of zzso zzso zzso genes include zzso factors implicated in zzso gene expression or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factors, zzso and signaling zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso including zzso hormone sensitive zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 30 zzso and zzso factors zzso binding zzso zzso zzso X zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma were significantly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso zzso to zzso resulted in reduced protein levels of zzso and several insulin signaling zzso including the insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso and protein zzso B zzso Nuclear zzso zzso was activated within 15 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso a zzso zzso zzso exhibited normal zzso global gene zzso and insulin zzso However, absence of zzso zzso abolished suppression of zzso of the genes normally suppressed by zzso and induction of zzso of the genes normally induced by zzso Moreover, extensive cell death occurred in zzso zzso after 2 h of zzso zzso Thus the changes in zzso gene expression induced by zzso could lead to insulin zzso Further, zzso is an obligatory zzso of most of these zzso zzso
