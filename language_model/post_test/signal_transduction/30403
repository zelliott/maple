zzso pathways modulated by the family of zzso receptors are central to innate immune zzso Novel components playing key regulatory roles in these pathways continue to be zzso Here we describe the use of zzso zzso for identifying critical components of these zzso zzso The method was tested with a zzso system where zzso clones are expressed as zzso fusion zzso or in an zzso containing zzso combined with a zzso zzso These zzso are placed under the control of an zzso promoter, responsive to zzso of zzso receptors such as zzso or zzso zzso which activate the promoter will, when zzso form a positive feedback zzso We introduced zzso zzso zzso components into both types of zzso The components tested regulated reporter zzso expression in both zzso Our data suggest that this type of system is capable of selective identification of components from signal zzso pathways once the promoter of a relevant zzso gene is identified from, for example, zzso zzso
