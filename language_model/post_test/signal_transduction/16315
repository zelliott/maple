At the beginning of zzso massive brain cell death occurs and more than 50% of cells are eliminated by zzso along with zzso zzso However, few studies were conducted so far regarding the regulation of neural zzso cells zzso death during zzso Because of the zzso role of cell death during development, aberration of normal zzso cell death is zzso to normal zzso occurs in not only zzso but also in zzso and zzso When growth and survival signals such as zzso or zzso are removed, zzso is activated as well as the induction of zzso To investigate the regulation of cell death during zzso stage, it is essential to investigate the regulation of zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso cells were cultured from zzso embryonic brains of zzso zzso For in zzso zzso animal model, pregnant rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso diluted with normal saline at zzso To analyze the cell death, we performed zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso level of proteins was investigated by Western zzso and zzso zzso The level of zzso expression was investigated by zzso zzso of zzso gene promoter and zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso protects cultured zzso from cell death after growth factor withdrawal both in zzso and zzso or hydrogen zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso injected zzso was also observed in zzso embryonic zzso Treatment of zzso decreased the level of zzso and increased the nuclear zzso of zzso which subsequently enhanced expression of zzso protein zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate the reduced death of zzso by zzso at zzso critical periods through the degradation of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The reduced zzso death might zzso the zzso defects collectively called fetal zzso syndrome, which shows symptoms such as mental zzso and zzso zzso
