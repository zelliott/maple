We examined regulation of the zzso zzso zzso 1 by zzso in the rat zzso We zzso cell extracts from adult rat hearts, adult rat extracts zzso by fast performance liquid zzso and extracts from cultured zzso cardiac zzso The zzso 178 zzso acids of the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli fused with zzso zzso The zzso protein was used as a zzso for in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts from zzso zzso or adult hearts zzso the zzso domain of the zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein zzso zzso (44 and 42 zzso and zzso (90 zzso were present in specific zzso of cardiac extracts that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that protein zzso of approximately 44 and 90 zzso could zzso this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso could be demonstrated by zzso of these zzso from extracts of zzso cardiac zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and abolished serum and zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso These results confirm the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso in the rat zzso and suggest an important role for zzso zzso in regulation of the protein by zzso stimulation of the zzso
