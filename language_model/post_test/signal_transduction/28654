Cellular signaling via zzso zzso appears to play a major role in the functioning of the peripheral nervous zzso Information regarding the functional characterization of zzso zzso receptors or their expression pattern has been accumulating zzso however, very little is known regarding the distribution of zzso in the zzso The zzso level of zzso is controlled by zzso zzso the three zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family are of special functional zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso is associated with zzso zzso cells of the rat zzso zzso whereas zzso is restricted to blood vessel zzso zzso zzso was detected from embryonic day zzso zzso suggesting that immature zzso cells express the zzso With the onset of zzso zzso zzso remained associated solely with zzso zzso zzso zzso was absent from zzso zzso cells but was associated with zzso covering the zzso at some zzso In addition, zzso zzso was associated with the satellite zzso cells in zzso root zzso and sympathetic zzso and with the enteric zzso surrounding the cell bodies of zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over zzso zzso and thus can act either in zzso or in producing zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the control of zzso zzso of peripheral zzso or zzso and in the dialogue between these two cell zzso
