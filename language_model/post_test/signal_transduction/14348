zzso zzso zzso immune responses in the skin and is a major cause of zzso during which zzso accumulate in the zzso Because of their abundance in skin and ability to produce a variety of zzso zzso we propose that mast cells may play a key role in ultraviolet B zzso skin zzso zzso zzso human mast cells were treated in zzso with varying doses of zzso and production of multiple zzso was measured in culture zzso zzso exposure significantly increased the release of zzso zzso and modestly increased zzso production, but zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso reduced the zzso induction of zzso by zzso suggesting that new protein synthesis contributed to zzso zzso In line with this, zzso treatment of mast cells significantly increased zzso zzso In contrast to its effect on zzso production, optimal doses of zzso did not provoke zzso or zzso release, indicating little effect on zzso Our data suggest that mast cells may play a major role during zzso acute inflammation by selectively inducing zzso involved in zzso zzso
