zzso conducted over the past 18 months have shed new light on how modular zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso the assembly of functional plasma membrane zzso Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family, like zzso use multiple zzso to cluster zzso channels, zzso zzso molecules and zzso signaling proteins at zzso cellular zzso and polarized membrane zzso Other zzso zzso like the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso organize cellular signaling by zzso zzso and zzso components to specific membrane zzso and assembling these components into functional zzso The organization of these proteins into discreet structures has functional consequences for downstream zzso
