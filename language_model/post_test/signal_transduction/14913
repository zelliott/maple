The freshwater turtle zzso zzso is among the most zzso of zzso a true zzso zzso able to survive without oxygen for days at room temperature to weeks or months during winter zzso Our good friend and colleague Peter Lutz devoted nearly 25 years to the study of the physiology of zzso tolerance in these and other model organisms, promoting not just the basic science but also the idea that understanding the physiology and molecular mechanisms behind zzso tolerance provides insights into critical survival pathways that may be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Work by Peter and his colleagues focused on the factors which enable the turtle to enter a deep zzso state, including decreases in zzso flux zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso like zzso and zzso and the maintenance of low zzso levels of zzso compounds such as zzso and zzso Our attention has recently turned to molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso including the zzso of such protective factors as heat shock proteins zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso gated zzso channels, and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this review we discuss three zzso of zzso zzso including the initial zzso zzso over the first several hours, the long-term maintenance of zzso function over days to weeks of zzso and finally recovery upon zzso with necessary defenses against zzso oxygen zzso
