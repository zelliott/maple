The zzso factor zzso is essential for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells and normal development of the zzso Our previous study revealed that the zzso gene is an amplification target of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and that zzso promotes zzso cell proliferation in zzso In the present study, we aimed to identify the mechanisms by which zzso promotes proliferation of zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we zzso multiple signaling pathways activated by zzso and determined that zzso activated the zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso signaling zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso suppressed the ability of zzso to enhance proliferation of zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso zzso including reduced levels of zzso zzso and decreased zzso cell zzso were reversed with zzso zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In mouse zzso zzso promoted in zzso tumor growth of zzso which was dependent on zzso zzso zzso suppressed the ability of zzso to enhance tumor growth of zzso by reducing cell zzso but not by enhancing zzso Furthermore, tissue zzso analysis of 61 primary zzso tumors showed a positive correlation between expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso promotes in zzso tumor growth of zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which enhances cell zzso
