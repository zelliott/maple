Earlier studies have revealed an improvement of cardiac function in animals with zzso heart failure zzso due to zzso zzso zzso by treatment with zzso converting zzso zzso zzso Since heart failure is also associated with attenuated responses to zzso we examined the effects of zzso an zzso zzso on the zzso zzso signal zzso in the failing zzso Heart failure in rats was induced by zzso the coronary artery, and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with zzso zzso day) zzso zzso for 4 zzso The animals were assessed for their left zzso function and zzso responses to zzso zzso and crude zzso were isolated from the zzso viable left zzso and examined for the zzso concentration of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in zzso function and positive zzso response to zzso as well as zzso increase in zzso in zzso these changes were attenuated by zzso zzso Both zzso zzso density and zzso zzso activity were decreased in the failing heart and these zzso were prevented by zzso zzso zzso in cardiac function, positive zzso effect of zzso zzso density and zzso zzso activity in the failing heart were also attenuated by treatment with another zzso zzso zzso and an zzso II zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso not only zzso cardiac dysfunction but also prevents changes in zzso signal zzso in zzso due to zzso These beneficial effects are similar to those of zzso or zzso and thus appear to be due to blockade of the zzso zzso
