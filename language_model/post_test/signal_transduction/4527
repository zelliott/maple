zzso helper zzso T zzso cells provide B cells with signals that are important for the generation of zzso zzso and zzso memory and, therefore, are critical for the protective immunity zzso by most human zzso zzso regulators of human zzso cell differentiation are poorly zzso In this article, we demonstrate that zzso controls specific gene zzso for human zzso cell zzso The introduction of zzso expression in primary human zzso T cells resulted in the regulation of a core set of migration genes that enable trafficking to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression also induced a module of protein expression critical for zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This constitutes direct evidence for zzso control of most of these functions and includes three genes known to be zzso of severe human genetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Introduction of zzso did not alter the expression of zzso or zzso the primary zzso of human zzso zzso We show in this article that introduction of zzso zzso does induce the capacity to express zzso Surprisingly, zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that zzso and zzso cooperate in the induction of zzso zzso and zzso Altogether, these findings reveal that zzso and zzso collaborate to orchestrate a suite of genes that define core characteristics of human zzso cell zzso
