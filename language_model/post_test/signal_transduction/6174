zzso zzso contains an zzso domain zzso that zzso into the nucleus, where it may regulate gene expression upon zzso zzso However, the identity of its target promoters and the mechanisms by which it regulates zzso have been zzso Here we report that, in the mouse zzso synaptic activity increases the level of nuclear zzso and zzso zzso density zzso zzso a scaffolding protein that is enriched in zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso activity of the zzso promoter by binding to a zzso zzso factor, zzso The zzso complex zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso through a signaling zzso that is mostly independent of zzso zzso This zzso of zzso expression by the zzso complex provides a molecular basis for zzso synaptic zzso
