zzso in either white zzso zzso or white zzso zzso lead to a loss of most zzso phenomena in zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso experiments show that zzso and zzso are zzso factors regulating the expression of zzso zzso The zzso proteins form zzso and zzso in zzso this interaction could represent a fundamental step in the control of their zzso We demonstrate in zzso that the zzso proteins are assembled in a white zzso complex zzso and that zzso zzso a change in mobility due to zzso zzso zzso The zzso level increases progressively upon light exposure, producing a zzso form that is zzso and apparently replaced in the complex by a newly zzso zzso zzso is unmodified and also does not change zzso in the time frame zzso zzso zzso of zzso also occurs in a zzso zzso suggesting that a functional zzso is zzso for this zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and degradation of zzso could play a role in the transient expression of zzso zzso Our findings suggest a mechanism by which zzso and zzso mediate light responses in zzso
