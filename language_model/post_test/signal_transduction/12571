zzso understanding of the mechanisms of zzso relations between the nervous and the immune systems, has been the subject of numerous studies for the recent two zzso These mechanisms are zzso particularly at the stage of early response to zzso zzso or viral zzso They are also essential from the medical point of view, as they may help in the development of the new methods of treatment of infectious diseases, and also may provide better methods to neutralize possible side effects of the zzso As it is commonly zzso both forms of zzso zzso and zzso play an important role as a signaling molecules in these zzso Regardless of the route of administration, they cause to the zzso of the brain zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso response induced by activity of the immune system is a normal, zzso phenomenon with essential zzso It gives the negative feedback where zzso released from the adrenal cortex, inhibit activity of the immune system, and by this reduce the probability of the zzso of this system and its zzso zzso precise recognition of the mechanism which is the indicator of influence of zzso on the brain and also leads to initiate that response has a significant scientific and practical zzso Also, the two mechanisms are probably the most important, and under appropriate conditions could complement each zzso These are zzso and neural ways by which immune system influences the zzso The former zzso that zzso influences the zzso stimulating them to the zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and release molecules such as zzso (especially zzso which have the ability to penetrate the brain zzso The latter assumes that zzso directly or zzso can influence the peripheral nerves (the most important is probably the zzso zzso which zzso sensory endings subsequently send signals to the zzso The results of many experiments (including the zzso zzso indicate that both mentioned above ways take part in the mechanism of the communication between the immune and the nervous zzso These point out that signaling via the zzso nerve and via zzso may contribute to the effects of zzso administration on animals behavior, and the zzso of zzso axis and brain zzso However, the zzso zzso and the zzso appear to substitute each other during infections or pathogens zzso The zzso data also suggest that these two mechanisms by which zzso can affect the brain are probably the most important ones, by which the immune system influences the nervous zzso
