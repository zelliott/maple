The zzso II type 1 zzso zzso is known to signal through zzso G zzso and zzso zzso zzso has only recently gained appreciation for profound impact on a diverse range of biological zzso zzso among other central zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso interact with zzso regulators and promote zzso of nuclear zzso However, the relative contribution of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso regulation remains zzso We here present a comprehensive comparative analysis of zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso gene zzso We found zzso II to regulate 212 zzso whereas zzso zzso obtained with the biased zzso zzso zzso II only regulated few zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso II, like zzso II vastly zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These novel findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso the zzso response governed by other zzso zzso while direct induction of gene expression by the zzso is dependent on classical zzso protein zzso
