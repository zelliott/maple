zzso are implicated in a variety of biological effects, particularly in zzso processes such as embryonic development and zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso signal zzso mechanism were achieved with the characterization of the zzso zzso and the recent identification of zzso factors apparently involved in the signaling zzso The present studies were undertaken to further analyze the zzso signaling zzso The complementary DNA coding for the bovine zzso zzso type zzso zzso was amplified by zzso from corpus zzso and zzso zzso and cloned to characterize its role in zzso signal zzso Two complementary DNA zzso zzso and zzso were zzso coding for 512 zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso The shortest zzso lacked a sequence zzso a zzso acid stretch very rich in zzso zzso located between the zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso protection zzso demonstrated that alternative zzso is responsible for the generation of these zzso zzso This alternative zzso event is unique in that it has not been observed in other species, including the zzso in which extensive alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of this alternative sequence with other known zzso sequences showed that it has characteristics of a zzso 3 domain zzso binding zzso zzso experiments have identified two proteins of 69 zzso and 71 zzso from an zzso zzso cell line, specifically interacting with the short zzso alternative zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could have a zzso interaction, through its putative zzso binding site, with at least two zzso zzso zzso
