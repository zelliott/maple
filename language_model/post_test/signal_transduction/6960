We previously demonstrated that zzso markedly increases the zzso rate of DNA from zzso The mechanism of this process remained a puzzle because no zzso complex was observed, and structures show that the DNA and zzso binding sites on zzso are zzso The zzso of interaction of zzso with zzso and its complex with DNA were analyzed by using zzso experiments in which zzso changes in zzso DNA or the native zzso in zzso were zzso Rate zzso governing the individual steps in the reaction were obtained from analysis of the measured rate zzso concentration zzso The zzso association with DNA is extremely rapid with a rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso with a rate constant of zzso zzso yielding a zzso of zzso zzso When zzso is added to the zzso complex, we observe the formation of a transient zzso complex in the first few milliseconds of the zzso zzso which rapidly zzso to release zzso The rate constant of this zzso zzso is nearly equal to the rate constant of association of zzso with the zzso complex, showing that zzso is zzso to repress zzso The rate zzso for the individual steps of a more folded zzso zzso were also zzso This zzso associates with zzso more rapidly than zzso zzso but it associates with the zzso complex more slowly and also is less efficient at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
