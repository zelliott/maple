To zzso an understanding into zzso protein network, we have established various zzso zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso cell zzso which are expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins under the tight control of expression by an zzso zzso Here we provide a catalog of zzso profiles in total cell zzso derived from the zzso and partial loss of function zzso zzso zzso In this biological context, we compared total zzso changes by the combined methods of zzso quantitative image analysis and zzso analysis both commonly in zzso and partial loss of function zzso expression zzso Thus, we tried to dissect zzso signaling pathway, especially a downstream zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells using zzso zzso In this study, we zzso upon the zzso profile changes as common targets for zzso zzso and a partial loss of function zzso in the zzso zzso Thirteen protein spots were selected as what the zzso zzso on the gels for zzso images from both kinds of cells were consistently changed in their protein expression zzso zzso regulated expression was further confirmed for some zzso of candidates by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis using specific zzso Taken together, our results obtained and present here show that the comparative analysis of zzso from zzso and partial loss of function zzso cells has yielded zzso data to zzso the protein network directly and/or zzso
