zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is an important feature of chronic zzso zzso zzso one of the most prevalent zzso zzso in Western zzso The presence of stereotyped and zzso zzso in different zzso patients suggests that recognition of specific zzso might drive zzso zzso Here we show that, in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso zzso which is dependent on the zzso zzso region zzso and an internal zzso of the zzso Indeed, transferring the zzso of a zzso zzso provides autonomous zzso capacity to a zzso active zzso whereas zzso in the internal zzso abolish this zzso Because zzso expression was required for the binding of zzso zzso zzso to target cells, and zzso in the internal zzso reduced this zzso our results indicate a new model for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a crucial zzso zzso
