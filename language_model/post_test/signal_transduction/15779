During zzso development, the zzso zzso zzso signals are first established around the zzso zzso zzso a zzso organ generating directional fluid zzso Then, zzso asymmetry is conveyed and stabilized in the lateral plate zzso Although numerous molecules and signaling pathways are involved in controlling zzso zzso zzso difference and zzso between different zzso during zzso patterning are poorly zzso Here we show that zzso signaling regulates zzso decisions at two stages in zzso Before the zzso stage zzso zzso of zzso signaling leads to zzso visceral zzso through bilateral expression of zzso in the lateral plate zzso which is zzso by increases in zzso length and defective directional fluid flow in zzso zzso is required for the regulation of zzso length by zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling before zzso also leads to mild defects of heart zzso which become much more severe through zzso of cardiac zzso asymmetry when zzso signaling is blocked after zzso At this stage, visceral zzso and the zzso zzso remain zzso These findings suggest that zzso signaling controls visceral zzso through the zzso zzso signal before zzso and regulates heart zzso through cardiac zzso mainly after zzso first identifying sequential control and zzso of visceral and heart zzso
