zzso cultures of zzso sympathetic zzso were established more than 30 years zzso More recently, these cultures have been used to characterize various neurotransmitter receptors that govern sympathetic zzso zzso These receptors may be zzso into at least three groups: zzso receptors which evoke zzso zzso zzso receptors which zzso zzso receptors which zzso zzso zzso Group zzso comprises zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Group zzso currently zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors for zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In group zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso and receptors for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso receptors can be zzso zzso which regulate zzso release from zzso in cell culture may be located either at the zzso region or at the sites of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Most of the receptors that evoke release are located at the zzso There zzso receptors cause zzso to generate action zzso which then trigger zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso receptors which evoke release still remain to be zzso zzso which facilitate zzso release appear to be located zzso at zzso sites and presumably act via an increase in zzso zzso zzso which inhibit stimulation evoked release are also zzso origin and most commonly rely on a G zzso blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained with primary cell cultures of zzso sympathetic zzso have now supplemented previous data about neurotransmitter receptors involved in the regulation of zzso as well as zzso zzso In the future, this technique may prove useful to identify yet zzso receptors which control the output of the sympathetic nervous system and to zzso underlying zzso zzso
