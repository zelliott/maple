zzso zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso promotes differentiation and survival of various types of zzso in the central nervous zzso zzso binds to and activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiating zzso signaling and exerting its zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been implicated in promotion of zzso survival by zzso factors, is a component in the signaling zzso of zzso We examined how zzso activates zzso in cultured cerebral cortical zzso We found that insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso signaling zzso that activates zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and bound to zzso in response to zzso This zzso signaling via zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso In addition, signaling via zzso and zzso was markedly sustained as well as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso On the other hand, we observed no association of zzso with zzso in response to zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso via zzso and zzso rather than by a direct interaction of zzso with zzso in cultured cortical zzso
