The discovery of adult stem cells in most adult zzso is the basis of a number of clinical studies that are carried out, with therapeutic use of zzso stem cells as a prime zzso zzso scientific debate is still ongoing as to whether adult stem cells may have a greater plasticity than previously zzso Although cells with some features of embryonic stem cells that, among others, express zzso zzso and zzso are isolated from fresh zzso it is not clear if the greater differentiation potential is acquired during cell zzso Moreover, adult more zzso cells do not have all zzso characteristics typical for embryonic stem zzso Recently, some elegant studies were published in which adult cells could be completely zzso to embryonic stem zzso cells by zzso of some key zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It will be interesting for the future to investigate the exact mechanisms underlying this zzso and whether similar zzso factor pathways are present and/or can be activated in adult more zzso stem zzso
