In addition to its essential zzso functions, zzso has been suggested to play a critical role in regulating gene zzso The first committed zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso by zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a spontaneous cell death zzso which was rescued both by zzso zzso and genetic zzso The zzso plants exhibited massive zzso of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso of a number of genes that are diagnostic for defense and zzso oxygen species zzso The zzso zzso was independent of salicylic acid and zzso zzso Interestingly, the observed increase in defense gene expression was not accompanied by enhanced resistance to bacterial zzso which may be explained by zzso of defense gene zzso from zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso of zzso protein profiles showed a substantial reduction of both zzso zzso proteins and a nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso results in zzso spontaneous cell death and zzso defense gene zzso The isolation and molecular characterization of the zzso zzso provides a valuable tool for zzso new functions of zzso
