In limb zzso of zzso the early steps leading to zzso formation are critical for the success of zzso and the initiation of zzso in an adult limb requires the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso can completely zzso an zzso limb at the early limb bud stage, and the metamorphosed young adult also zzso a limb by a zzso process that results in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso the initiation of zzso limb zzso but it remains unclear whether limb zzso in young adults also requires zzso zzso 

We expressed zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in transgenic zzso to block zzso signaling during zzso zzso in young zzso zzso did not inhibit limb zzso in any of the young adult zzso though it suppressed zzso expression of genes zzso and zzso zzso When nerve supply to the limbs was partially removed, however, zzso expression blocked limb zzso in young adult zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by a zzso inhibitor rescued failure of zzso zzso in young adult frogs after total removal of nerve zzso 

In contrast to its essential role in zzso limb zzso our results suggest that zzso signaling is not absolutely essential for limb zzso in young zzso The different requirement for zzso signaling in zzso and young adults appears to be due to the projection of nerve zzso into the limb zzso Our observations suggest that zzso signals and zzso signaling have redundant roles in the initiation of limb zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time the different mechanisms of limb zzso initiation in limb buds zzso and developed limbs zzso zzso with reference to zzso signals and zzso zzso
