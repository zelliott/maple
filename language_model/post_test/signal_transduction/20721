zzso acid zzso induced a rapid zzso increase in production of zzso zzso in cultured adult human zzso zzso at 30 zzso Natural and zzso PA were equally effective, while other zzso classes had no zzso zzso A was also zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso production, but contamination of the PA preparation by zzso could not account for the effect of zzso The effect of PA could not be reproduced by treatment of cells with calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso production could be inhibited zzso zzso by zzso of cells with either zzso toxin or zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso protein and a protein zzso zzso negative feedback zzso PA also zzso release of zzso acid from zzso Treatment of cells with zzso zzso D similarly induced zzso zzso production in the zzso Since PA may be formed by zzso zzso of zzso D, or by zzso of zzso the results suggest that PA may play a significant role in zzso mechanisms of human zzso
