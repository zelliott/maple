zzso is a widely used zzso in humans that is associated with multiple zzso effects, such as addiction and physical zzso In zzso models, zzso also zzso locomotor zzso These effects likely involve functionally selective zzso Indeed, G zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 zzso through its interaction with the zzso zzso regulates the zzso but not the rewarding properties of zzso However, zzso is also required for zzso locomotor activity in mice, but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate this zzso behavior are not zzso In this study, we show that zzso is required for zzso locomotor activity in a zzso D1 zzso zzso manner and that a zzso zzso signaling complex may mediate this zzso zzso administration of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso locomotion in zzso mice in a zzso zzso Acute zzso administration to mice promotes the formation of a zzso signaling zzso zzso locomotor activity and formation of the zzso signaling complex is blunted in zzso knockout zzso mice and is presumably independent of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso are not required for zzso reward as zzso mice show the same zzso place preference for zzso as do control zzso Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for a zzso zzso signaling complex in selectively zzso the zzso but not the rewarding properties of zzso
