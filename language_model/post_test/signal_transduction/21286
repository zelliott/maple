The zzso B cell response induced by highly zzso zzso zzso preparations has been studied zzso The in zzso measured zzso curve tends to be roughly zzso with the peak response occurring at very low zzso zzso between zzso zzso for a variety of different zzso Furthermore, zzso with more than approximately 10 zzso tend to be zzso whereas zzso with fewer than 10 zzso zzso tend to be zzso These observations have been perplexing when viewed within the context of standard theories of zzso zzso by zzso zzso We present a new analysis of these previous experiments that zzso the differences between theory and zzso From this theory it is concluded that the peak in the observed dose response curve only zzso reflects properties of the zzso and the affinity of surface zzso for the zzso but depends strongly on the density of zzso B cells in the zzso The number of responding cells decreases at low zzso zzso because cells have to share limiting amounts of zzso and not because of the decreasing probability of receptors and zzso meeting each zzso Our theory leads to the same conclusion as made by previous researchers, namely that a minimum number of zzso sites, of the order of 10, need to be bound to a single zzso in order to stimulate a B zzso While this conclusion was based on the lack of zzso of zzso carrying less than a minimum number of zzso the quantitative results of this study, derived from fitting experimental dose response zzso obtained with highly zzso zzso provide evidence for the zzso hypothesis that is based upon the degree of zzso zzso Our theory also provides quantitative agreement with experimental observations on systems, in which both zzso and zzso zzso are mixed in the same zzso
