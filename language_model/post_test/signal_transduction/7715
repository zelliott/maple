zzso signaling is an important component of the stem cell zzso affecting both differentiation and zzso However, traditional zzso techniques do not provide precise control over zzso zzso while existing zzso technologies are limited when used with zzso or zzso zzso To address these limitations, we created the zzso Flip zzso zzso a zzso zzso chip containing thousands of zzso each sized to trap down to a single stem zzso We have demonstrated the functionality of the zzso by patterning a 50 zzso 50 grid of zzso embryonic stem cells zzso with patterning efficiencies zzso onto a variety of zzso zzso dish patterned with zzso a 3-D zzso and even another layer of zzso We also used the zzso to pattern small groups of cells, with and without zzso zzso allowing incremental and independent control of zzso zzso We present quantitative evidence that zzso contact plays an important role in depressing zzso colony formation, and show that zzso is involved in this negative regulatory zzso Thus, by allowing exquisite control of the cellular zzso we provide a technology that enables new applications in tissue engineering and zzso zzso
