The zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso binds to specific receptors on zzso zzso These receptors belong to the family of G zzso zzso Their zzso leads to zzso breakdown with generation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These second zzso initiate zzso release from zzso stores and zzso of protein zzso C, both of which are important for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors by zzso leads to zzso and consequently to suppressed zzso zzso This is the primary mechanism of action of zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso compete with zzso for receptors on zzso cell zzso inhibit zzso signal zzso and consequently zzso zzso These compounds are free of zzso actions, which might be beneficial in certain clinical zzso
