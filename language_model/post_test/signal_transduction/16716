zzso zzso are heavy zzso peptides that play important roles in the zzso of toxic heavy metals and the regulation of zzso zzso of essential metals in zzso including higher plants, zzso and zzso Recently, PC zzso genes in higher plants and zzso zzso have been identified and zzso enabling molecular biological studies to unravel the mechanisms underlying PC zzso Moreover, recent routine database searches have unexpectedly identified genes that are similar to plant PC zzso genes in the zzso of worms and some zzso In this review, we introduce these recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms for PC zzso and functions in order to supply basic information about the unique and attractive peptides zzso to various zzso
