zzso transfer protein zzso is essential for zzso C signaling and for zzso and regulated zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso site that can zzso bind zzso zzso and zzso zzso and transfer these lipids between membrane compartments in zzso The role of the zzso zzso was examined by comparing zzso zzso with zzso in which 5, 10, and 20 zzso acids were deleted from the C zzso zzso and zzso had reduced zzso and PC transfer activities compared with zzso zzso with the effect on zzso transfer being more marked than that on PC zzso zzso was inactive at all zzso zzso All three truncated zzso were unable to restore zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso inhibited the signaling function of zzso protein without any effect on zzso transfer in zzso We conclude that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in zzso C zzso zzso the transfer activity is not the only determining factor that dictates the zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso the dominant zzso effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso in zzso C signaling suggest the existence of a zzso for zzso
