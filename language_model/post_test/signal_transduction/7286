G zzso signal zzso is essential for the regulation of cardiovascular function, including heart rate, growth, contraction, and vascular zzso Regulators of G protein Signaling zzso zzso fine-tune G zzso zzso signaling by regulating its magnitude and duration through direct interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso G zzso Changes in the zzso protein expression and/or function in the heart often lead to zzso changes and are associated with cardiac disease in animals and humans, including zzso zzso development, heart failure, and zzso This article focuses on zzso of G protein Signaling 2 zzso which is widely expressed in many zzso and is highly regulated in its expression and zzso Most information to date has been obtained in zzso zzso and animal studies, but data from humans is zzso We review recent advances on the functional role of cardiovascular zzso and the mechanisms that determine its signaling zzso zzso and zzso We highlight key unanswered questions and discuss the potential of zzso as a therapeutic zzso
