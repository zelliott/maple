Role of zzso coupled pathways in modulating the cardiotoxic effects produced by Indian red scorpion zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso of spontaneously beating or paced zzso zzso rat right zzso preparations in zzso were zzso The cumulative concentration zzso zzso of zzso on spontaneously beating zzso exhibited a marked decrease in rate (by zzso and an increase in force (by zzso only at a higher concentration zzso zzso The zzso decrease in rate and increase in force were sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso a zzso channel zzso blocked the force changes but not the rate changes induced by zzso In the paced atrium, on the other hand, a zzso decrease in force was observed, and at 3 zzso the decrease was zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso blue, significantly attenuated the zzso force changes in paced zzso The observations of this study demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
