zzso zzso within the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso C are zzso We investigated the role of the zzso region of the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso to two signal zzso zzso We zzso zzso in this region by zzso scanning and expressed these zzso receptors in zzso cells and/or zzso zzso All zzso receptors retained high affinity zzso binding in zzso cells, indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in two zzso segments zzso and zzso demonstrated impaired zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso scanning these two segments showed three different signaling defects in zzso zzso 1) Two zzso receptors zzso and zzso had reduced zzso zzso zzso but normal zzso responses to zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso but zzso zzso responses to zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso demonstrated both markedly reduced zzso and zzso production due to zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso region of the third zzso loop of this zzso plays a critical role in zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
