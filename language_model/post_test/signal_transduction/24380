zzso of zzso calcium levels plays a key role in the zzso of many biological zzso Here, we characterize early calcium responses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants to zzso factors produced by the bacterial zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso imaging zzso When presented with 1 zzso zzso factor, root hair cells exhibited only the previously described calcium zzso response initiating 10 zzso after zzso zzso factor (10 zzso zzso an immediate increase in calcium levels that was temporally earlier and zzso distinct from calcium spikes occurring later in the same zzso zzso factor zzso that were structurally zzso applied at 10 zzso failed to initiate this calcium flux zzso zzso induced to spike with low zzso factor zzso show a calcium flux response when zzso factor is raised from 1 to 10 zzso Plant zzso previously shown to be deficient for the calcium zzso response zzso and zzso exhibited an immediate, truncated calcium flux with 10 zzso zzso factor, demonstrating a competence to respond to zzso factor but an impaired ability to generate a full zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso root hair cell exhibits two independent calcium responses to zzso factor triggered at different zzso zzso and suggests an early branch point in the zzso factor signal zzso zzso
