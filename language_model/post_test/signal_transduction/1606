Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso dual signaling zzso resulting in zzso of both zzso and zzso It has been shown that zzso either zzso or stimulates zzso depending on dose of the zzso zzso the ability of zzso to regulate other members of the zzso family is zzso Another member of this family, zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated by zzso and cellular stresses and plays a key role in regulating the activity of various zzso zzso We demonstrate that treatment of zzso zzso cells and rat zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides of zzso that selectively activate zzso or zzso zzso zzso results in the zzso of zzso activity from high zzso zzso zzso of the upstream members of the zzso cascade revealed that both zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 activities were also inhibited after treatment with zzso zzso zzso We conclude that treatment of zzso cells with zzso is sufficient to inhibit high zzso zzso activity by zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
