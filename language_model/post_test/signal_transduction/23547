Cancer is increasingly described as a zzso network zzso zzso methods, such as next generation sequencing and zzso interference uncovered the complexity zzso zzso effects and the identification of multiple target zzso Network analysis of zzso zzso and signaling pathways highlighted the structural features of zzso proteins and their complexes to develop next-generation protein zzso zzso as well as the zzso of inflammatory and zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation can be described as a zzso process, where an initial increase of system plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor zzso zzso tumors should be attacked by an indirect network influence zzso On the contrary, the attack of zzso tumors may target central network zzso Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis and zzso since they potentially have an extremely high ability to change the zzso of their zzso The early warning signals of the zzso of fast growing tumor cell clones are important in personalized diagnosis and zzso zzso attacks are needed to zzso zzso networks to exit from cancer zzso and re-enter a normal zzso However, the dynamic zzso zzso of cancer cell population zzso the zzso of the cancer zzso with zzso zzso cells from neighboring abnormal zzso The development of drug resistance is further complicated by interactions of tumor clones and their zzso Network analysis of zzso cooperation using game theory approaches may open new areas of understanding tumor zzso In conclusion, the above applications of the network approach open up new, and highly promising avenues in zzso drug zzso
