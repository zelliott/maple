To investigate the role of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso in zzso metabolism and insulin action, a specific zzso zzso zzso was used to reduce its expression both in zzso and in zzso Reduction of zzso expression with the zzso in cultured mouse zzso and in liver and fat zzso of zzso obese zzso mice and zzso mice led to increased zzso and activity of key insulin signaling zzso including insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to insulin zzso The zzso zzso and zzso animals showed improved insulin sensitivity, which was reflected by a lowering of both plasma insulin and zzso levels and improved zzso and insulin tolerance in zzso zzso The treatment did not decrease body weight or increase zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a key negative regulator of insulin action and a potential novel target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 zzso
