A central question in muscle biology is how zzso are formed and become aligned with underlying zzso in mature zzso zzso are composed of focal zzso zzso including zzso and zzso and anchor zzso zzso to the zzso In the present study, we investigated the process of zzso formation zzso in zzso primary mouse zzso Using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso we found that two additional focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso We have characterized zzso as occurring in three distinct stages based on the organizational pattern of these zzso zzso We show that both zzso and zzso are initiated at sites of membrane contacts with the zzso zzso and that their maturation is tightly zzso To test the importance of zzso signaling in these zzso we analyzed cells expressing a dominant negative form of zzso zzso When cells expressing zzso were induced to zzso both zzso and zzso were disrupted although the expression of constituent proteins was not zzso Likewise, zzso zzso activity by reducing zzso levels using an zzso approach also resulted in an zzso of zzso and zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso formation was tested further by treating zzso cultures with zzso or zzso to block contraction and disrupt zzso zzso This also resulted in zzso of zzso zzso We present a model of zzso zzso signaling through zzso is essential for both normal zzso and normal zzso which are tightly coupled during skeletal zzso
