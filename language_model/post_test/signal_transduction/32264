zzso resistance in breast cancer remains a major clinical problem and is caused by zzso mechanisms of growth factor zzso zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso The possibilities a single breast cancer cell has to achieve resistance are zzso We developed a model of zzso zzso human breast cancer cell lines and compared their different expression patterns, zzso of growth factor zzso pathways and compared cells by zzso zzso zzso We also tested a panel of selective zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways to overcome zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed increased expression of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells showed zzso expression and activated zzso zzso whereas in resistant zzso cells activated zzso was due to loss of zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed remarkable aberrations in resistant zzso which were predominantly zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and restored zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso restored zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso All cell lines showed expression of receptors for zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso of zzso restored zzso sensitivity in both resistant cell lines by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, mechanisms to escape zzso treatment in breast cancer share similarities in expression profiling but are based on substantially different genetic zzso zzso of activated zzso of growth factor zzso zzso is helpful to predict response to specific zzso zzso of zzso receptors provides zzso treatment zzso
