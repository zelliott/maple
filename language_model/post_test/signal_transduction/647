zzso of the zzso zzso is common in human zzso The basic players in this zzso are the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso This review will zzso some of the key animal models that have helped us understand this signaling network and its contribution to zzso Recently, great advances in cancer mouse models have been achieved zzso While zzso deletion often affects the development of the zzso and can result in embryonic zzso conditional knockout mouse models offer the possibility of inducing gene deletion in the adult zzso Another useful strategy involves the zzso of zzso function by introducing small zzso in the gene zzso thereby maintaining the protein in an zzso state and mimicking protein zzso with zzso Combining zzso expression of zzso and zzso with a secondary zzso event, for example, leads to the development of specific zzso Such models are more accurate for growth studies of human tumors than those involving zzso tumors, due to the zzso of the tumors with blood zzso These studies will improve the pharmacological analysis of drug zzso With the discovery of zzso zzso in members of the zzso pathway, mouse lines harboring these zzso are being developed in order to imitate the molecular features of a human zzso Using these models for drug testing may enable more accurate prediction of the effects that a specific drug will have on a zzso
