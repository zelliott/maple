zzso zzso is widespread in zzso but its molecular mechanism and biological function are still poorly zzso A way to study zzso zzso is to investigate the function of genes whose zzso suppress this zzso In zzso zzso these genes are known as mod zzso In addition to suppressing zzso zzso mod zzso cause some zzso zzso This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and development zzso are zzso The zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso of the zzso defects of the zzso zzso We show here that zzso also partially suppresses zzso zzso strengthening the link between development and zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso of zzso zzso characterized at the molecular zzso It encodes a member of the zzso family, suggesting that development and zzso zzso use common steps of a signal zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in the sexual cycle has also been further zzso
