How taste zzso cells participate in zzso disparate compounds into distinct taste qualities represents a fundamental problem in the study of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common stimulus employed to represent bitterness yet its zzso consequences on zzso zzso channels in the taste zzso cell have not been zzso in zzso This study examines such effects on taste zzso cells zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which include zzso sustained and zzso zzso were zzso inhibited by bath application of zzso with an zzso of zzso The time course of the current zzso along with zzso shifts in zzso zzso and zzso curves, suggests that multiple mechanisms of zzso may be zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were zzso zzso zzso to somewhat higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were also reduced in magnitude without noticeable effects on zzso or reversal potential but with a shift in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as a charge carrier, were enhanced in magnitude by the presence of low zzso of zzso zzso but were suppressed by higher zzso zzso zzso broadened the zzso of the zzso action potential and increased the input zzso These data serve as genesis to future investigations of the signal zzso mechanism of zzso on zzso zzso
