For the first time, kinetic information from the literature was collected and used to construct zzso zzso mathematical models of zzso zzso One model was designed primarily with kinetic equations in the tradition of zzso and zzso whereas the other two models were designed as alternative zzso models within the framework of zzso Systems zzso Each model contains about 50 zzso about a quarter of which are dependent zzso zzso while the others are independent zzso and zzso activities that are considered zzso The models account for known regulatory signals that exert control over the zzso Standard mathematical testing, repeated revisiting of the literature, and numerous rounds of amendments and refinements resulted in models that are stable and rather insensitive to zzso in zzso or zzso zzso The models also appear to be compatible with the modest amount of experimental experience that lends itself to direct zzso Even though the three models are based on different mathematical zzso they show dynamic responses to a variety of zzso and changes in conditions that are essentially equivalent for small zzso and similar for large zzso The kinetic information used for model construction and the models themselves can serve as a starting point for future analyses and zzso
