The importance of zzso interactions during zzso zzso zzso has been extensively investigated over the years; however, it still remains questionable whether the interaction is a prerequisite for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso T cells require two signals for proper zzso and induction of zzso signal 1 is provided by zzso zzso in the context of the major zzso complex zzso class II, while signal 2 is delivered by zzso molecules such as zzso or zzso present on the zzso cell zzso It is well known that the expression of zzso is zzso after interaction between zzso on zzso and zzso expressed by at least partly activated T zzso We used a DC line, zzso to compare the importance of zzso expression and downstream zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso cells represent zzso bone zzso zzso expressing low levels of zzso zzso low levels of B7 molecules and no zzso We have previously shown that zzso cells, despite the lack of zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso In correlation with the current literature, we present data showing that zzso expression of zzso significantly increases the zzso capacity of zzso cells in zzso In addition, we show that zzso expression is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
