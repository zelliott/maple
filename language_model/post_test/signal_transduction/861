zzso requires the zzso of a variety of cell types and the organization of these cells into a particular three-dimensional zzso The embryonic zzso heart is organized into two major chambers, the zzso and atrium, each consisting of two tissue zzso the zzso and zzso The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the separation of zzso and zzso lineages are not well zzso To test models of cardiac chamber zzso we generated a high-resolution fate map of cardiac chamber zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso zzso a stage prior to the initiation of zzso Our map reveals a distinct spatial organization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are positioned closer to the margin and to the zzso zzso than are zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not zzso organized at this zzso The relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso suggest orderly movements of these zzso Furthermore, the initial positions of zzso zzso at zzso zzso indicate that signals residing at the embryonic margin could influence chamber fate zzso Indeed, via fate zzso we demonstrate that zzso signaling promotes zzso fate zzso near the margin, thereby playing an important early role during zzso zzso
