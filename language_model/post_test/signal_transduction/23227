zzso zzso is characterized by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expansion, and zzso zzso zzso zzso development of the disease, a direct result of increased zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso cell zzso flux which leads to zzso of signaling zzso favoring zzso including pathways zzso by zzso II zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso tissue growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso II has both zzso and zzso effects directly inducing zzso and/or zzso protein synthesis through zzso zzso zzso or protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso cell stretch, and/or through zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso the zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso growth zzso zzso all of which may stimulate zzso synthesis via an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II effects suppresses zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso flux leads to metabolism of zzso via zzso with induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in turn triggers both zzso and zzso zzso New roles for zzso and zzso factor interactions in diabetic zzso have also recently been zzso Recent mouse models confirmed roles for zzso in zzso in stimulating zzso growth factor zzso growth factor receptors and development of zzso zzso may therefore act in concert with zzso and growth factors to induce diabetic zzso Further clarification of the pathways involved may prove useful for the therapy of diabetic zzso New directions for investigation are zzso
