After about ten years of research renaissance in zzso the present challenge is to understand how zzso zzso are controlled by a complex interplay of overlapping regulatory zzso Reconstruction of various regulatory network zzso is zzso illustrating that we underestimated the broad importance of zzso modifications such as zzso zzso or zzso for microbial zzso With the growing zzso knowledge, the functional relevance of these regulatory events becomes an even more pressing zzso A major knowledge gap resides in the regulatory network of zzso zzso simply because we lacked pertinent methods for systematic analyses - but a start has now been zzso Perhaps most dramatic was the conceptual shift in our perception of metabolism from an engine of cellular operation to a generator of input and feedback signals for regulatory circuits that govern many important decisions on cell zzso zzso death, and naturally zzso
