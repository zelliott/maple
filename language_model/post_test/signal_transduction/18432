The zzso family of zzso zzso receptors and zzso play key roles in cell segregation and zzso targeting in the developing nervous zzso zzso between the zzso and receptors cause zzso or zzso of zzso zzso from several brain regions including the zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso zzso We extend these previous observations by showing that three zzso also zzso regulate the growth of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso In addition to negative effects, however, we also report a zzso activity of the zzso zzso and A5 promote survival and zzso outgrowth of sympathetic zzso These observations provide support to the notion that zzso may function as either negative or positive signals in the developing nervous zzso
