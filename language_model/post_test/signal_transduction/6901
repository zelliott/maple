zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to increase zzso zzso making collagen less susceptible to zzso zzso Previously, we observed a relationship between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso knee zzso For this study, we investigate if transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso tissue growth factor zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression differently in zzso human zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigate via which zzso route zzso or zzso zzso is zzso to explore options to inhibit zzso during zzso To answer these questions, zzso were isolated from knee zzso of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso with zzso with or without a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso The gene expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso protein levels were determined with western zzso As expected, zzso induced zzso expression in zzso whereas zzso did zzso zzso and zzso were not affected by either zzso or zzso zzso prevented the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso completely blocked the induction of zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso was only slightly zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso whereas zzso had no zzso We zzso in zzso zzso that zzso induced zzso via zzso zzso This zzso of zzso in zzso zzso makes zzso an interesting target to interfere with zzso persistent zzso
