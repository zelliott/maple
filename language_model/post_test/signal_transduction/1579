We report that the zzso family of zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso are novel components of zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly induced the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso This effect is zzso by zzso zzso zzso as nerve growth factor zzso induced the zzso of zzso only in zzso expressing cells and not zzso zzso Additional experiments with various zzso zzso the transient expression of zzso active and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso the actions of zzso Similar data were obtained for zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in primary cortical cultured zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that the zzso of the zzso family of zzso factors can be modulated by zzso via zzso receptors and zzso zzso (but not zzso or zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, survival zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso active and zzso forms of zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso plays a role in zzso cell zzso
