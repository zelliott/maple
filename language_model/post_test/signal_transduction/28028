Our concepts of oxygen sensing have been transformed over the zzso We now appreciate that oxygen sensing is not a unique property limited to zzso but is a common property of zzso and that responses to changes in oxygen levels are not zzso but can change over zzso Respiratory responses initiated at the carotid body are modified by the zzso and zzso effects of zzso at the brain and on the pathways connecting the carotid body to the zzso Equally important is that we are beginning to use our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways triggered by zzso and zzso to identify therapeutic targets to treat diseases such as zzso We also have a better understanding of the complexities of the human respiratory responses to zzso however, major deficiencies remain in our ability to alter or even measure human zzso responses to oxygen zzso
