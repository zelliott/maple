Cellular fates such as zzso zzso and death are controlled by a variety of zzso zzso which are crucial in initiating downstream signaling zzso To initiate zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain recruits specific signaling molecules with a range of zzso zzso Thus, we zzso that it is possible to regulate signal zzso artificially by locating the zzso motif of interest into the zzso domain of specific zzso Construction of such artificial receptors was based on an zzso zzso zzso zzso We selected several known zzso motifs from native zzso receptors that strongly bind to their target zzso and located them downstream of the zzso zzso zzso binding domain of zzso which would be necessary for zzso of the zzso Next, we used zzso zzso to express zzso receptors in a zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso which was zzso with zzso The results indicated that each zzso zzso zzso activated the corresponding signaling zzso We also examined whether the position of the zzso motif in the zzso could influence the zzso levels of the signal zzso and found that the zzso receptors could activate the corresponding signaling zzso even when the zzso motif was distant from the zzso binding zzso
