zzso systems use zzso reactions to regulate zzso zzso In zzso zzso a human respiratory zzso the infectious cycle of the zzso is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso has similarities to sensor and response regulator components and is an zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso a response regulator, is a zzso protein that activates zzso gene zzso Three zzso zzso zzso the zzso receiver, and C zzso are essential for signal zzso We now demonstrate that the zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso but is unable to zzso the C zzso or zzso The zzso receiver regulates several zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso and C zzso as well as transfer of a zzso group from the zzso to the C zzso Our results indicate that zzso signal zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso followed by zzso to the zzso The zzso receiver can donate to the C zzso or to zzso The zzso C zzso is then able to transfer the zzso group to zzso
