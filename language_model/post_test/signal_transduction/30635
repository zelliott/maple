zzso is a complex of proteins that includes the zzso target of zzso zzso and several regulatory zzso It is activated by a variety of hormones zzso zzso and nutrients zzso zzso zzso that act to stimulate cell growth and proliferation and zzso by hormones zzso zzso that act to reduce cell zzso zzso zzso signaling is reported to be rapidly zzso within 1-2 zzso activated by zzso of protein synthesis that act on either zzso translation zzso or gene zzso However, the basis for the zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso In the present study, zzso signaling was found to be activated in response to zzso of either the initiation or zzso zzso of zzso zzso Changes in zzso signaling were zzso zzso to zzso in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso but not the expression of zzso or zzso zzso the zzso increase in zzso signaling was significantly attenuated in cells lacking zzso showing that zzso plays an integral role in the zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso was estimated to be 5 zzso or zzso Overall, the results are consistent with a model in which zzso of protein synthesis leads to a loss of zzso protein because of its rapid degradation, and in part reduced zzso expression subsequently leads to zzso of zzso zzso
