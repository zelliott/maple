zzso The underlying mechanisms involved in the zzso regulation of zzso acid zzso in the human zzso zzso were examined by use of an immortalized human embryonic kidney zzso cell line zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso response to maintain zzso zzso zzso occurs predominantly via changes in the activity of the zzso zzso transport system by zzso in the zzso capacity and with an unaffected zzso zzso An zzso response was not observed for the structurally related zzso zzso Only zzso which interferes with zzso organization, was capable of blocking the response to zzso of zzso in cell zzso whereas zzso of protein and zzso acid synthesis by zzso and zzso D, respectively, did not change the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mimicking the effects of zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso mimicking the effects of zzso only zzso the zzso of zzso but not the influx of zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was rapid and short-lived in contrast to the zzso response, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso involving zzso and zzso is less likely to be linked directly to the zzso regulation, but rather plays a role in short-term zzso
