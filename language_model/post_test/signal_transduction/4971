zzso cell communication has the potential to generate elaborate cell patterns, and this occurs in zzso We used the zzso signaling system, consisting of the zzso Delta and the zzso zzso to construct a positive feedback loop between adjacent cells to generate a zzso signal in cultured zzso To amplify the responses of zzso to zzso we created a zzso positive feedback loop using an engineered zzso cascade and a zzso positive regulator, zzso zzso We used mathematical modeling to determine the appropriate amount of amplification to enable the induction of Delta to zzso from one cell to its neighboring cells, which generated zzso within the local cell populations and resulted in discrete groups of cells that were either positive or negative for zzso These results demonstrate the zzso of the zzso positive feedback loop to generate signal propagation and cell zzso zzso This study represents a step in engineering more elaborate cell patterns in zzso zzso
