The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is enriched in zzso zzso zzso I, II and III of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso participate in zzso binding and zzso zzso However, the function of the zzso zzso IV has not been zzso In this study, we analyzed the role of the zzso portion of zzso IV in zzso binding and signal zzso A double zzso zzso that breaks the most zzso zzso bond zzso to zzso zzso high affinity zzso binding and substantially reduced signal zzso A similar zzso that breaks the overlapping zzso to zzso zzso had little effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso to zzso zzso loop did not alter the zzso binding or signal zzso activities of the zzso Despite the fact that the zzso zzso zzso was significantly impaired zzso this zzso as well as all of the other receptors with zzso in the region of zzso zzso to zzso localized normally to zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso structure of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso rather than its primary zzso is important for zzso binding and signaling but is not involved in zzso the zzso to zzso zzso
