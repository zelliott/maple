Color is important for zzso objects from backgrounds, which can in turn facilitate visual search in complex zzso However, brain areas involved in zzso the eyes toward colored stimuli in our environment are not believed to have access to color zzso Here, we show that zzso in the intermediate layers of the monkey superior zzso zzso a critical structure for the production of zzso eye movements, can respond to zzso color stimuli with the same magnitude as a maximum contrast zzso zzso In contrast, zzso from the superficial SC layers showed little zzso zzso zzso visual onset zzso were zzso zzso longer for color, zzso that zzso and zzso information reach the SC through distinct pathways and that the observed zzso activity is not the result of residual zzso zzso Furthermore, these differences in visual onset zzso translated directly into differences in zzso reaction zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso system can signal the presence of chromatic stimuli only one stage from the zzso zzso zzso that drives the zzso
