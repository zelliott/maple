Acquisition of zzso properties is a key step in the generation of zzso T zzso zzso Here we show that inflammatory signals regulate zzso expression in zzso and that deletion or depletion of zzso in mouse or human activated zzso T cells causes zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso changes induced by exposure of zzso zzso to zzso and inflammatory signals identifies zzso and zzso as components of an zzso network that controls zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso and whose activity is modulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our data show that strong zzso and inflammatory signals act through zzso and zzso to control the zzso program and other aspects of zzso zzso zzso
