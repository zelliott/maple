zzso control growth of prostate zzso cells and zzso deprivation zzso zzso leading to prostate zzso We investigated the effects of surgical stress on prostate zzso induced by zzso zzso and determined the underlying zzso zzso zzso in mice was induced by surgical zzso and administration of the zzso drugs zzso and zzso zzso stress was induced by sham zzso under zzso zzso zzso stress delayed zzso and prostate zzso induced by zzso zzso These effects of stress were prevented by administering the selective zzso zzso zzso and were also blocked in zzso mice expressing zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and prostate zzso in response to zzso zzso therapy could be delayed by surgical stress via the zzso signaling zzso Thus, surgery could interfere with zzso zzso therapy, whereas administration of zzso zzso may enhance its zzso
