Due to the functional defects in zzso signaling molecules or deficient zzso of zzso zzso leukemia has become an aggressive disease with poor zzso Although the majority of leukemia patients initially respond to chemotherapy, zzso is still the leading cause of zzso Hence targeting zzso zzso would be a promising strategy for the improved treatment of zzso zzso derivatives possess a wide range of important biological and pharmacological properties including zzso zzso Here we investigated the zzso activity and mechanism of action of one of the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate the zzso efficacy of zzso we have used zzso zzso cell cycle analysis by zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso and western zzso zzso 

zzso showed that zzso was approximately zzso more potent than the parent compounds in inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with cell cycle analysis suggests that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso The limited effect of zzso on cell viability of normal cells indicated that it may be specifically directed to cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3, zzso 9, zzso zzso in the ratio of zzso protein expression as well as the loss of zzso membrane potential suggests zzso of the intrinsic zzso of zzso 

These results could facilitate the future development of novel zzso derivatives as zzso agents for zzso
