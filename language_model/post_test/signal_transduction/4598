The sonic zzso zzso zzso is activated in several types of zzso and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation and zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to freeing of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso More than zzso of zzso zzso and zzso specimens stained positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the expression of the genes zzso these four molecules did not correlate with any zzso zzso including the age, zzso the status of zzso gene zzso tumor stage, local invasion, and zzso Three zzso tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso all expressed the genes zzso these four zzso zzso labeling and zzso cell proliferation zzso revealed that zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso pathway, was able to inhibit the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells more effectively than zzso zzso zzso led to the arrest of cell cycle or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression by zzso zzso that target zzso or zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells led to the zzso of cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is widely activated in zzso zzso and may have potential as an early marker of zzso cancer or as a potential therapeutic target for zzso cancer zzso
