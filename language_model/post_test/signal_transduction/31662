zzso is a key player in the zzso signaling zzso as a primary zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso production is one strategy to alleviate zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso against zzso were designed to specifically block the expression of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were formulated to enhance an zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was prepared using zzso method, composed of zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a zzso core zzso zzso The size and zzso potential of zzso and zzso complexes were measured using light zzso zzso was used to confirm the zzso and the size distribution of zzso and zzso zzso The prepared zzso had a zzso sized zzso shape with highly positive charge, which were physically stable without zzso during the zzso The zzso zzso complexes were successfully generated and zzso onto zzso zzso without zzso After the treatment with zzso complexes, zzso was inhibited and collagen type I was also significantly suppressed in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso with zzso have a therapeutic potential to suppress collagen deposition in zzso zzso zzso this strategy might be developed to lead to zzso zzso
