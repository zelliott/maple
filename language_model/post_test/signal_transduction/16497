zzso is required for plant growth and zzso The sugar status of plant cells is sensed by sensor zzso The signal generated by signal zzso zzso which could involve zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in appropriate gene zzso A variety of genes are either induced or zzso depending upon the status of soluble zzso zzso stresses to plants result in major zzso in sugar status and hence affect the expression of various genes by zzso and zzso their zzso zzso and zzso pathways are involved in sugar zzso zzso also acts as a signal zzso as it affects the activity of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso acts as a zzso sensor and is involved in zzso zzso zzso may represent an additional sensor that zzso zzso zzso especially when zzso zzso is zzso zzso isolated on the basis of response of zzso and zzso growth to zzso and zzso screening protocols are being used to study the response of altered sugar status on gene zzso Common zzso elements in sugar zzso pathways have been zzso zzso plants with elevated levels of zzso alcohols like zzso zzso series zzso zzso and zzso are tolerant to different stresses but have usually impaired zzso Efforts need to be made to have transgenic plants in which zzso stress responsive genes are expressed only at the time of adverse environmental conditions instead of being zzso zzso
