zzso zzso within the zzso locus have been shown to play an important role in modulating the cellular response to pattern recognition zzso zzso zzso transcript 2 zzso is a member of the zzso locus that is zzso in mouse and zzso zzso exhibits a unique expression pattern in that it is expressed on cells of the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it plays a role in both innate and zzso zzso In this work, studies reveal that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso response to the zzso zzso zzso leading to increased zzso oxygen species production, zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso has the ability to specifically zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to a range of zzso that bind to G zzso zzso as it does not zzso the response of cells to growth factor zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso to sites of inflammation in zzso These findings reveal a novel functional role for zzso that involves zzso of zzso responses to G zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to play an important role in enhancing the innate immune response via a novel molecular zzso
