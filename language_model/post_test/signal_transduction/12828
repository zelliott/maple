The aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso role of zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso processes in rat zzso zzso zzso In addition, we wanted to determine whether the zzso cells possess zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso activity by measuring NO production using the fluorescent NO indicator zzso zzso We initiated investigations by adding NO from an external source by means of the zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso and we found that zzso induced a fast increase in the zzso amounting to zzso of the zzso in resting zzso Moreover, addition of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso loaded zzso zzso cells, resulted in a zzso protein zzso release of zzso from zzso stores, leading to a rise in the zzso free zzso concentration zzso The zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso release was not accompanied by zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso cells possess zzso zzso activity, which is activated by zzso stimulation and not by a rise in zzso zzso We show that in rat zzso zzso cells, NO and zzso induce zzso release from zzso stores via G zzso zzso However, the changes in zzso are relatively small, suggesting that this zzso plays a zzso role in zzso zzso thus not by itself causing fast transient increases in zzso In addition, we suggest that zzso produced NO activated by zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso to the surrounding zzso
