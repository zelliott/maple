In zzso zzso zzso we studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso in relation to modifications of the zzso environment to find basic mechanisms of how altered zzso forces zzso affect this zzso Animals were exposed to zzso during space flight or zzso zzso for 4 to 12 zzso Basic observations were that zzso development of the zzso is significantly affected by altered zzso conditions, zzso the duration of zzso depends on the strength of the test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the body which are related to the zzso zzso Future studies are based on the hypotheses zzso that the zzso zzso play a key roll in the adaptation to zzso conditions, zzso that the stimulus zzso systems in the sense organ are affected by zzso conditions, and zzso that zzso eggs will be converted to normal adults guided by zzso and zzso set points representing the genetic zzso zzso zzso or zzso or otherwise occurring zzso from standard development during embryonic and zzso life will activate genes that direct the zzso processes towards zzso
