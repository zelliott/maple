We examined the potential role of zzso in insulin and zzso growth factor zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso is an zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein that has been reported to associate with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso association of zzso with these molecules was assessed by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso Neither insulin nor zzso treatment induced zzso association with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso association with zzso were not further increased by insulin or zzso zzso and zzso were heavily zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Both insulin and zzso zzso their zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso association, although the magnitude of these effects was greater with insulin than with zzso Interestingly, zzso but not insulin, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its association with zzso To investigate the functional roles of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso DNA zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cells, and zzso of zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso membrane zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso linking insulin and zzso receptors to their downstream zzso The presence of zzso association may partly determine the signal zzso initiated by insulin and zzso
