zzso can replace calcium in triggering neurotransmitter release, although peak release is reduced and the duration of release is zzso zzso has therefore become useful in probing release, but its mechanism of action is not well zzso Here we study the action of zzso at the zzso cell to zzso cell zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso residual zzso levels were monitored with fluorescent zzso which all responded to zzso zzso calcium orange, zzso zzso green, and zzso When calcium was replaced by zzso zzso of zzso in the external bath, zzso and calcium both entered zzso zzso zzso calcium was eliminated by including zzso in the zzso bath, or by loading parallel fibers with zzso enabling the actions of zzso to be studied in zzso After a single zzso zzso reached higher peak free levels than did calcium zzso zzso times zzso and decayed more slowly zzso time 189 zzso for zzso and 32 zzso for zzso These differences in calcium and zzso dynamics are likely a consequence of greater zzso zzso through calcium channels, lower affinity of the zzso buffer for zzso and less efficient zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels help to explain properties of release evoked by zzso Parallel fiber synaptic currents triggered by zzso are smaller in zzso and longer in duration than those triggered by zzso In both calcium and zzso release consists of two zzso one more steeply dependent on zzso levels than the zzso zzso drives both components less effectively than does zzso suggesting that the affinities of the sensors involved in both zzso of release are lower for zzso than for zzso Thus, the larger and slower zzso zzso account for the prominent slow component of release triggered by zzso
