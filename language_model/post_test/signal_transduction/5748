The zzso expressed and zzso zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso has been observed in approximately zzso of multiple myeloma zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether the therapeutic effect of zzso is associated with zzso zzso 

Cell proliferation and zzso zzso were performed in minimal zzso expressing zzso cells and compared to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggested cell survival decreases in a zzso zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso protein was similarly dose dependent on zzso It is confirmed the zzso zzso death is correlated with zzso zzso Furthermore, increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso suggested that zzso resistance associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be partly zzso through zzso zzso 

Our data indicates that zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be associated with zzso treatment resistance in multiple zzso
