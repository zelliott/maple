the zzso zzso zzso has multiple actions on peripheral zzso including the zzso of adverse cardiovascular outcomes after zzso zzso zzso Although we recently demonstrated that zzso its zzso and downstream zzso are zzso in the heart after zzso the significance of intact zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso our objective was to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse to determine whether worse cardiac outcomes after zzso result from impaired zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso mice were subjected to experimental zzso or sham surgeries and studied after 1 zzso After zzso zzso mice displayed a loss of cardiac signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso survival and cardiac morbidity were also seen in the zzso mouse zzso including decreased zzso function and zzso zzso and increased left zzso zzso zzso collagen deposition, zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso mice zzso with an zzso zzso zzso improved cardiac function and restored many of these zzso processes to zzso zzso 

these data indicate that zzso zzso zzso cardiac injury in the zzso failing heart by acting directly on zzso to increase zzso and zzso zzso to decrease cardiac zzso zzso and zzso and to limit deleterious changes in cardiac structure, function, and zzso zzso
