We have reported that zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso by expression of zzso small zzso stimulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso small zzso can substitute for tumor necrosis zzso zzso or serum and stimulate zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso activity, resulting in zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects were zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso inhibited small zzso cell growth but was unable to abolish small zzso zzso zzso Our results provide the first in zzso evidence for a critical regulatory role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso following zzso of zzso supports new mechanisms by which zzso small zzso promotes cell growth and zzso By establishing zzso as a key player in the response of cells to growth factors and stress signals like zzso our findings could explain why zzso is a primary target zzso during zzso infection to alter cellular zzso
