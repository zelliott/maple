The present research was undertaken to study the possible involvement of the zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso in primary cultures of rat zzso As shown by Western zzso analysis, zzso of zzso zzso to the particulate fraction occurred upon exposure of zzso to zzso zzso zzso or to zzso zzso The particulate fraction may zzso to a zzso area, as indicated by zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of cells with zzso led to an increased zzso of zzso zzso thus show that stimulation of zzso may be one of the zzso events triggered by zzso of the zzso zzso
