zzso insight has been garnered on initial mechanisms of zzso of plasma membrane proteins and their subsequent trafficking through the zzso zzso It is also well established that zzso stimulation of many plasma membrane receptors leads to their zzso However, zzso regulation of zzso trafficking has not received much zzso In previous studies, we showed that sustained stimulation of protein zzso C zzso with zzso zzso led to zzso of recycling zzso in a zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso receptors that activate zzso exerted effects on zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso This zzso coincided with zzso of zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso the observed zzso of zzso was shown to require continuous zzso activity because it was inhibited by zzso with classical zzso inhibitor zzso and could be reversed by zzso with this zzso In addition, classical zzso zzso was necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso D zzso activity and zzso of zzso and zzso using dominant negative zzso also prevented this zzso zzso this zzso did not affect zzso zzso or zzso as measured by zzso calcium zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso of receptors resulted in zzso of other plasma membrane proteins and receptors as shown for zzso growth factor zzso and zzso activated zzso This led to zzso zzso of those receptors and diverted their cellular fate by protecting them from zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for sustained zzso stimulation in regulation of zzso trafficking, and this process requires sustained stimulation of zzso and zzso
