zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso and mediates various insulin signals zzso In this study, we have examined the impact of three natural zzso zzso identified in zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso on insulin zzso zzso is located near zzso zzso 2 protein binding sites, and zzso and zzso are located in the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso human insulin zzso were zzso with zzso human zzso zzso zzso or three zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the cell lines expressing zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso incorporation compared with zzso Upon insulin zzso cells expressing zzso showed a zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, a zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in binding of the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso activity compared with those expressing zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso showed slight but significant decreases in zzso zzso activity (17 and zzso zzso both P zzso zzso and in binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both P zzso zzso and a greater decrease in zzso protein zzso activity (41 and zzso zzso both P zzso zzso compared with zzso After insulin zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso showed significant decreases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both P zzso zzso and in zzso binding to the insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso showed no changes in zzso zzso and in zzso binding to the insulin zzso compared with zzso These data suggest that the impaired zzso response of zzso and zzso was mainly due to reduced binding to the insulin zzso whereas the impaired response of zzso was mainly due to reduced association with zzso zzso zzso
