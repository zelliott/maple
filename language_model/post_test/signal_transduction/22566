zzso family members are zzso proteins zzso for zzso G zzso There is evidence that altered zzso gene expression may contribute to the zzso of cardiac zzso and zzso We investigated the ability of zzso to zzso cardiac physiology using a transgenic mouse zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso tissue did not affect cardiac zzso or zzso cardiac function, but markedly compromised the ability of the heart to adapt to zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso mice, the transgenic animals developed significantly reduced zzso zzso in response to pressure overload and also did not exhibit induction of the cardiac zzso gene zzso zzso of the transgenic mice caused a rapid zzso in most animals characterized by left zzso zzso depressed zzso function, and increased zzso mortality when compared with zzso zzso These results zzso zzso proteins as a crucial component of the signaling zzso involved in both the cardiac response to acute zzso pressure overload and the cardiac zzso zzso
