The zzso hormone zzso signals in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso to suppress food zzso in part, by amplifying zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling also reduces zzso and motivational aspects of zzso and that these effects can depend on energy zzso Using the lowest dose that significantly suppressed zzso cumulative food zzso unilateral zzso zzso administration to the zzso zzso before zzso reduced zzso lever pressing for zzso under increasing work demands zzso ratio reinforcement zzso regardless of whether animals were energy zzso zzso zzso or replete zzso zzso zzso However, in a separate test of zzso responding in which there was no opportunity to consume food zzso place preference zzso for an environment previously associated with a palatable food zzso zzso zzso administration suppressed zzso behavior only in chronically zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso signaling did not reduce zzso expression for zzso reinforcement regardless of energy status, suggesting that zzso zzso signaling zzso influences motivated responding for food vs zzso zzso zzso results show that zzso zzso signaling reduces food intake and zzso zzso responding independent of energy status in situations involving zzso and zzso contact with food, whereas zzso behavior independent of food consumption is only reduced by zzso zzso zzso in a state of energy zzso These findings reveal a novel zzso role for zzso signaling in the zzso a brain region traditionally linked with processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso
