zzso zzso zzso in the pig follows a prolonged zzso period characterized by migration, spacing and zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso for maternal recognition of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that binds zzso to promote zzso attachment and zzso zzso appears to play a key role in zzso zzso and maintenance of pregnancy in zzso however, a role for zzso in the zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso this study examined zzso expression and function in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso Northern and slot zzso zzso detected an increase in zzso zzso expression between Days 25 and 30, and levels remained elevated through Day 85 of zzso In zzso zzso localized zzso zzso to discrete regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on Day 15 of pregnancy and to the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was first detected on Day 35 of pregnancy and increased through Day zzso Both zzso and zzso forms of zzso protein were detected in zzso and pregnant zzso by Western zzso zzso protein was localized to the zzso and GE by zzso however, only the zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso protein was present along the entire zzso interface after Day 30 of zzso In addition, zzso zzso and protein were localized to zzso cells within the stratum zzso of the zzso in both Day 9 zzso and pregnant zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso molecules at the zzso cell surface as assessed by zzso detection of zzso or zzso as markers for focal zzso These results suggest that zzso expressed by zzso zzso and immune cells, may interact with receptors zzso zzso on zzso and zzso to promote zzso development and signaling between these zzso as key contributors to attachment and zzso in the zzso
