The second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be implicated in the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso by activated zzso There is controversy regarding the potential of human zzso to produce zzso oxide zzso Since zzso zzso can be activated also by carbon monoxide zzso and this gas may be formed zzso we examined the ability of human pulmonary zzso to produce CO in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso gamma zzso In addition, the source and the relative contribution of this zzso to the zzso increase in cell zzso content and zzso release were zzso 

zzso zzso were obtained from multiple organ donor lungs by zzso zzso After 24-hour zzso zzso zzso were cultured for 24 hours in the presence or absence of zzso zzso CO zzso and 500 zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso blue, zzso IX, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso content of the cells and zzso zzso and NO release to the medium were zzso 

In the presence of zzso zzso production was not accompanied by any zzso increase in the NO release to the zzso However, an increase in medium CO concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and cell zzso content zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10; P zzso zzso was zzso These changes were more pronounced in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso also was induced by both sodium zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso blue, a zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso which traps zzso had a similar zzso 

zzso zzso increase, secondary to an zzso production of zzso zzso in the release of zzso by activated human pulmonary zzso
