The protein zzso C zzso zzso is a family of zzso zzso involved in the regulation of many cell zzso The objective of the present work was to identify the zzso zzso present in human zzso zzso and to compare their relative responses to acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso treatment on zzso zzso production was zzso In total extracts prepared from cultured or freshly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Following acute treatment with zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso were zzso from the zzso to the particulate zzso zzso treatment (up to 36 zzso with zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso did not respond to either acute or chronic treatment with zzso An acute 10 zzso treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso An enhanced response was observed at all zzso of zzso tested zzso zzso suggesting an increased capacity to zzso The acute zzso effect was evident within 2 zzso and near zzso by 5 zzso The acute response to zzso was lost in cells where zzso was zzso by prior zzso zzso zzso growth factor, a potential zzso for the zzso of zzso in zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha or zzso zzso appears to enhance zzso zzso production in zzso This may be a zzso important example of zzso between various zzso pathways in human zzso zzso
