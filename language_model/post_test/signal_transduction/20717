zzso studies have identified zzso zzso processes that determine zzso cells to skeletal zzso and control the spatial patterning of muscle differentiation in zzso zzso Gene knockout studies provide evidence that the zzso zzso genes have essential, although partially redundant functions in zzso as regulators of muscle zzso However, continuous zzso zzso processes also appear to be required to control and maintain the zzso potential of embryonic zzso cells, even after zzso of zzso zzso The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to cellular mechanisms of muscle zzso and the use of zzso transfer as a muscle zzso zzso
