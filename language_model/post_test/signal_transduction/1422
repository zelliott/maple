We have prepared a zzso zzso hybrid consisting of human zzso zzso and the toxic zzso A chain, utilizing zzso The zzso hybrid exhibited zzso toward rat zzso zzso cells due to zzso of protein synthesis within the cells, although it inhibited protein synthesis in a zzso system of a rabbit zzso zzso only after treatment of the zzso hybrid with zzso On the other hand, zzso of the zzso hybrid with zzso completely abolished its zzso The zzso hybrid zzso the testosterone production by rat zzso zzso cells to a similar degree to zzso The zzso hybrid could elicit full testosterone production in the presence of about zzso less accumulated zzso compared with in the case of zzso zzso The zzso effect of the zzso hybrid was largely inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso A chain zzso These results suggest that the zzso hybrid first binds to zzso cells via an zzso zzso and then is zzso into the cells, and finally the zzso of cellular protein synthesis occurs on the release of the zzso A chain from the zzso Furthermore, it was suggested that zzso may stimulate testosterone production via another second zzso system as well as via the zzso system, since the zzso hybrid zzso full testosterone production without zzso zzso zzso
