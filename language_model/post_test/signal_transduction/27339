B cell zzso following zzso zzso zzso can be zzso in zzso by zzso of cell surface zzso which associates with the zzso protein zzso zzso The targeted deletion of zzso in mice demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso signaling in resting and zzso B zzso B cells from zzso mice exhibited the cell surface zzso and zzso zzso calcium responses characteristic of chronically zzso B cells, as occurs in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso signaling in the absence of zzso However, zzso of zzso B zzso by prolonged zzso zzso resulted in modest B cell zzso demonstrating that zzso positively regulates zzso zzso signaling in the presence of zzso
