zzso syndrome of inappropriate zzso is a recently identified genetic disease first described in two unrelated male infants with severe symptomatic zzso Despite zzso zzso zzso levels, patients have inappropriately concentrated urine resulting in zzso zzso and zzso It was found that each infant had a different zzso of the zzso type II zzso zzso at zzso 137 where zzso was converted to zzso or zzso zzso or zzso resulting in zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso at the same zzso converting zzso to zzso zzso leads to the opposite disease zzso with a loss of the zzso ability to concentrate urine resulting in zzso diabetes zzso This zzso is associated with impaired zzso although whether this is predominantly due to impaired trafficking to the plasma zzso zzso zzso or G protein zzso is currently zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso zzso we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso zzso interact with zzso in an zzso manner resulting in zzso zzso This zzso is similar to that observed for zzso which is intriguing considering that it is accompanied by zzso rather than impaired zzso zzso it would seem that zzso zzso per zzso is unlikely to be the major zzso of impaired zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso traffic considerably more efficiently to the plasma membrane than zzso identifying this as a potentially important zzso difference affecting zzso zzso
