zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and is broadly used as an zzso zzso Continuous administration with zzso zzso adverse effects and suffering in humans zzso zzso due to negative calcium balance derived from low zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso involved in calcium zzso and zzso and plays an active role in calcium zzso In the present study, we employed zzso zzso and zzso zzso male mice to examine the effect of zzso on zzso gene expression in the zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and it restored zzso decrease in zzso zzso protein compared with the level of zzso zzso zzso treatment increased calcium and zzso levels in the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso In a time course experiment, zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso levels at 3 days, whereas it temporarily increased zzso zzso and protein levels at 12 and 24 zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was completely reversed by zzso an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso on the zzso zzso supporting a role for zzso in regulating zzso In zzso zzso and zzso female mice daily treated with zzso for 3 days, zzso zzso was expressed at the same level as in male zzso Also, no zzso of zzso and zzso on their receptors was zzso Taken together, these results indicate that mouse zzso gene may be regulated by zzso in a zzso manner, and reduced zzso zzso via the zzso zzso may take part in negative calcium zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso may not be involved in the regulation of calcium zzso
