It is technically demanding to make zzso zzso of zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso Here we introduce a method for recording mechanically induced electrical events in a class of zzso zzso using single zzso zzso or zzso A zzso piece of zzso containing a zzso zzso slit organ was dissected free and fixed with wax onto a specially designed zzso This zzso complex, filled with zzso zzso allowed displacement of the slit membrane from below while simultaneously recording zzso from zzso of the organ through a thin saline zzso zzso zzso zzso could be changed and zzso channel zzso could be applied to the zzso The method promises to allow the investigation of the zzso channels responsible for mechanically zzso zzso signals and spike zzso
