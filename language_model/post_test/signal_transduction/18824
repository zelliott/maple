zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso sequences is a task whose importance has been renewed by the recent discovery of numerous functional zzso often interacting with other zzso Even if several programs exist for zzso motif search, none exists that can represent and solve the problem of searching for zzso of zzso motifs in interaction with other zzso 

We present a constraint network zzso of this zzso zzso are represented as structured motifs that can occur on more than one sequence and which are related together by possible zzso The implemented tool zzso is used to search for several zzso families in zzso zzso zzso show that zzso allows to efficiently search for interacting motifs in large zzso sequences and offers a simple and zzso framework to solve such zzso New and known zzso are identified as zzso candidates in zzso zzso
