Gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso is regulated at zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we have shown that the zzso of zzso is partially dependent on the zzso zzso sensors zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our results revealed that the zzso of zzso fluctuates during the growth stages of zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso rate of zzso rapidly dropped when the stationary stage zzso cells were zzso into fresh zzso There was an instant zzso of zzso zzso and a high level expression during the entire zzso stage of zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso decreased zzso when the zzso cultures entered the stationary zzso The zzso rate in zzso also varied depending on the growth zzso The highest zzso level was observed during the zzso zzso It decreased up to zzso during the stationary zzso Furthermore, we have found that the zzso rate of zzso diminished at least zzso in slowly growing zzso These results indicate that the zzso and the zzso efficiency are zzso regulated in the zzso zzso depending on the growth conditions of zzso zzso
