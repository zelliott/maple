Growing lines of evidence suggests that high mobility group zzso zzso plays an important role for promoting inflammation and zzso in brain zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduce zzso release in inflammatory conditions in zzso and in zzso Thus, we tested our hypothesis that zzso protects brain injury by zzso of middle cerebral artery zzso zzso zzso release in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso due to zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression in zzso cells in both zzso and zzso in which the former was much more significant than the zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso to nucleus, and increased zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibited zzso induction by zzso and zzso induced by zzso in zzso cells was prevented by zzso which effect was reversed by zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso significantly reduced brain zzso size, mortality rate, zzso activity and tissue expression of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso high mobility group box 1 induced zzso in zzso cells by increasing ratio of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso and all of these effects were reversed by zzso with zzso zzso we conclude that zzso at least in part, protects brain cells against hypoxic damages by zzso of zzso Thus, zzso may be beneficial for the use of zzso injuries such as zzso
