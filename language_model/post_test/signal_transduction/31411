To provide insights into the mechanisms by which receptors for zzso zzso activate defense zzso we investigated the duration of zzso treatment required for induction of various defense responses including programmed cell death in synchronized tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment induced only a rapid and transient phase of zzso burst and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso and prolonged zzso of zzso as well as zzso of transcripts of zzso genes and cell death, required continuous recognition of zzso for several zzso In contrast, zzso was gradually induced in the absence of the zzso
