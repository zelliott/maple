zzso zzso zzso regulate vital processes in zzso and their production downstream of zzso C zzso is controlled through a network of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso and zzso accounts for zzso of zzso to zzso as well as production of several other zzso zzso Here, we report the structure of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and find it is similar to the zzso zzso zzso despite zzso sequence identity, as well as the active site architecture of human zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso modeling were used to identify a putative basis for zzso zzso To test this model, we zzso binding site zzso predicted to have restricted zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and in zzso zzso labeling studies in modified zzso zzso we observed that zzso and zzso zzso exhibited nearly normal zzso function but zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso These zzso zzso conditional nutritional growth defects observed in zzso zzso zzso and, zzso suppressed zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso activity and production of zzso are critical for cellular zzso Overall, our studies provide new insights into the structure and function of zzso and zzso a synthetic biological approach to redesign zzso zzso signaling zzso
