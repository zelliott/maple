zzso zzso interactions induce the development of colitis by zzso deleterious acquired immune zzso zzso of zzso T cells is mainly induced through signaling machinery associated with zzso zzso zzso A key zzso associated with the IS is protein zzso C zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso of colitis has not fully been zzso 

The role of zzso for the zzso responses involved in the development of different types of colitis zzso model, zzso zzso zzso alpha knockout zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso was examined by generating double zzso mice and by utilizing cell transfer zzso 

zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso T cells failed to induce T helper cell zzso zzso colitis in the zzso host zzso zzso Development of zzso colitis in zzso mice was also inhibited by the absence of zzso In zzso mice, which develop colitis because of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso T cells failed to induce the development of severe zzso Interestingly, absence of zzso led to a remarkable decrease in the zzso but not zzso of zzso memory zzso T zzso This impaired proliferation resulted in a marked decrease in the zzso zzso T cells that are capable of producing zzso In addition, zzso of zzso inhibited the production of zzso zzso by zzso zzso T zzso 

zzso serves as a common and fundamental signaling zzso in the development of different types of colitis and may represent an attractive target for treating inflammatory zzso zzso
