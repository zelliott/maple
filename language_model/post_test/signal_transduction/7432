The fat mass and obesity associated zzso gene is related to obesity and type 2 diabetes, but its function is still largely zzso A link between zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso was recently suggested in the zzso Because of the presence of zzso in liver and the role of zzso in the control of zzso zzso we investigated both in zzso and in zzso the potential zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in liver and the impact of zzso zzso on zzso action and zzso zzso in liver of zzso 

We found that zzso protein expression is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso to an induction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso altered both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso expression and zzso density, zzso In zzso liver specific zzso zzso in mice induced a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in nuclear zzso associated with reduced zzso and zzso zzso levels and with an increased zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso resulting in an increase of zzso function and zzso Altogether, these data indicate that zzso promotes zzso recruitment of zzso to the detriment of its nuclear zzso affecting in turn zzso metabolism and the expression of zzso zzso Interestingly, these effects were associated in mice with zzso of zzso action and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Altogether, these data point a novel regulatory loop between zzso and zzso zzso pathways in liver cells, and highlight a new role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso action and zzso zzso
