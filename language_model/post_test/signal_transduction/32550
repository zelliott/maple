zzso E and zzso 32 are two zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso 32 zzso is also induced by unfolded and zzso proteins in the zzso and the function of many of the proteins in the zzso 32 zzso is to bind to zzso proteins and assist them in folding or zzso To further understand the function of the zzso E zzso we searched for zzso that affected zzso E zzso Our results indicate that a signal generated by expression of outer membrane proteins zzso zzso E zzso Specifically, zzso E activity is induced by increased expression of zzso and is reduced by decreased expression of zzso In addition, zzso that cause zzso zzso induce zzso E zzso This signal is generated after the fate of zzso and zzso proteins diverge in the zzso zzso and is not the result of an zzso of zzso precursors in the zzso Our results indicate that this effect of zzso is specific to the zzso E zzso because none of the above zzso affect zzso 32 zzso We propose that the zzso E zzso is involved in processes that occur in zzso compartments and that these two zzso zzso may have distinct but complementary roles of monitoring the state of proteins in the zzso zzso zzso and outer membrane zzso zzso
