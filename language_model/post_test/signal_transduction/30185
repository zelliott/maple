We previously showed in rat zzso zzso zzso cells, that zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was zzso by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Am J zzso Renal zzso zzso In this paper, we extend these observations and show that different protein zzso C zzso zzso play different roles in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso treatment for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of conventional and novel zzso zzso by chronic (24 zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso inhibitor decreased zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso or cell zzso while a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso On the other hand, zzso an inhibitor of conventional zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso without affecting cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso
