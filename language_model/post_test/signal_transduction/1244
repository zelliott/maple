zzso play pivotal roles in plant defense to environmental zzso However, stress tolerance of genetically engineered plants for zzso zzso has been little examined so zzso We cloned zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the gene was introduced to zzso zzso under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso The zzso was zzso integrated and actively transcribed in the transgenic zzso As compared with the zzso plants, the zzso and zzso transgenic plants exhibited a significant increase in zzso zzso activity and zzso content in leaves together with enhanced tolerance to various stresses including chilling, zzso zzso zzso drought, and zzso zzso During exposure to chilling stress (5 degrees zzso the zzso displayed a remarkable increase in zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso contents in leaves compared to the wild zzso A zzso zzso analysis revealed that several genes were more abundantly transcribed in the zzso than in the wild type under chilling zzso These genes included those for zzso zzso factors such as zzso and zzso proteins like zzso These results strongly suggest an important role for zzso as a signaling regulator in stress signaling zzso leading to zzso of stress tolerance mechanisms in plants under stress zzso
