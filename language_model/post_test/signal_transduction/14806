zzso capsule zzso zzso is a complication of cataract surgery resulting from the zzso migration, and zzso transition zzso of lens zzso cells that remain associated with the lens zzso These changes cause a loss of zzso The authors developed a chick zzso lens zzso bag model to study mechanisms involved in the onset of zzso Because zzso family zzso zzso signal cell zzso migration, and zzso the authors examined whether the zzso of zzso can prevent zzso 

After mock cataract surgery, chick lens zzso bags were pinned to a culture dish and grown in the presence or absence of the zzso inhibitor zzso Cell movement was followed by zzso zzso of proliferation and zzso in the zzso cultures was determined by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso 

As occurs in zzso lens cells in this model zzso migrated across the zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lens cells treated with zzso maintained an zzso zzso accumulated zzso zzso and did not migrate to the zzso zzso increase zzso or express zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to prevent zzso but longer zzso was necessary to prevent lens cell zzso 

zzso of zzso involved early zzso of zzso Lens cell migration preceded zzso and each of these two events required zzso of an zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked zzso suggesting zzso as a therapeutic target for the prevention of zzso
