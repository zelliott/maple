zzso and zzso receptors zzso are highly zzso yet they play clearly distinct roles in cardiac physiology and zzso zzso contraction, for instance, is readily zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso and chronic stimulation of the two receptors has opposing effects on zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso in the assembly of zzso signaling complexes may explain the distinct biological zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso forms a signaling complex with a zzso zzso zzso in a manner inherently different from a zzso complex reported zzso The zzso binds a zzso zzso zzso in a direct manner, and occupancy of the zzso by an zzso causes zzso of this zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso is a prerequisite for the recruitment of a complex consisting of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso We propose that the distinct modes of interaction with zzso result in divergent zzso signals in the vicinity of the two zzso thus, providing an additional layer of complexity to enforce the specificity of zzso and zzso zzso
