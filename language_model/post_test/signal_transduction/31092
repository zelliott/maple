zzso sensory cells such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells use zzso channels to respond to zzso zzso In zzso taste cells, bitter and sweet substances as well as some zzso acids are received by G zzso receptors zzso or zzso As a result of zzso of G protein and zzso zzso the zzso channel is zzso zzso zzso is known to be a zzso zzso but the participation of zzso zzso remains zzso To clarify the effect of zzso acid on zzso in taste cells, we investigated the expression profile of a series of zzso involved in controlling the zzso free zzso acid level, with the result that in a subset of taste bud cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed as well as the previously reported group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in some cells that express zzso We then investigated whether zzso acid activates zzso via a zzso expression system in zzso cells, and found that its zzso occurred at 10 zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest the possibility that zzso acid acts as a zzso of zzso in taste signaling zzso
