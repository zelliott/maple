A detailed and precise picture is being zzso together about how the pattern of digits develops in zzso zzso What is particularly exciting is that it will soon be possible to trace the process all the way from establishment of a zzso zzso in a small bud of zzso cells right through to final limb zzso The development of the zzso limb is a traditional model in which to explore mechanisms involved in pattern formation, and there is accelerating knowledge about the genes zzso One reason why the limb is holding its place in the zzso age is that it is rich in zzso zzso Here, we will focus on recent findings about the aspect of zzso limb development concerned with zzso pattern across the zzso axis of the zzso This process is controlled by a zzso region in the early limb bud known as the polarizing zzso zzso between polarizing region cells and other cells in the limb bud ensure that a thumb develops at one edge of the hand zzso and a little finger at the other zzso
