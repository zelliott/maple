zzso acid zzso is the zzso agent of zzso tumors associated with AA zzso and is also implicated in the development of Balkan endemic zzso zzso zzso These tumors contain zzso zzso zzso We examined gene expression changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice after treatment with zzso acid I zzso by zzso (5 zzso body zzso After 3, 12 and 21 days of treatment gene expression profiles were investigated using zzso Whole Mouse zzso Genome zzso zzso zzso profiles were significantly altered by zzso treatment in both target zzso and zzso zzso zzso Renal pathology and DNA zzso analysis confirmed kidney as the target tissue of zzso zzso Gene zzso for functional analysis revealed that processes related to zzso cell cycle, stress response, immune system, inflammatory response and kidney development were altered in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and cell cycle signaling as the most important pathways modulated in zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time zzso zzso and was consistent with the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso frequently zzso in zzso tumors, was zzso by zzso on the zzso and confirmed by zzso and protein zzso zzso we found that zzso gene expression analysis is a useful tool to define zzso responses in zzso zzso Several genes identified such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are frequently affected in human zzso cancer, and may be valuable zzso markers in future clinical zzso
