zzso 24 zzso encodes a zzso protein that exhibits significant zzso to the zzso 10 zzso family of zzso Here we show that the human zzso is zzso by activated peripheral blood zzso cells and is the zzso for two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter is also the zzso for zzso zzso cells zzso with either zzso zzso zzso bind the zzso with similar zzso zzso zzso binding to either its zzso receptors on human zzso or to zzso expressed receptors on baby zzso kidney cells leads to zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for zzso being the fourth member of zzso family of zzso to which their specific receptors have been zzso
