zzso of DNA damage by zzso and UVA radiation may generate zzso and zzso instability leading to zzso zzso skin cells being repeatedly exposed to ultraviolet zzso light have acquired multilayered protective mechanisms to avoid zzso zzso Besides extensive DNA repair mechanisms, the damaged skin cells can be eliminated by induction of zzso which is zzso through the action of tumor zzso zzso In order to prevent the excessive loss of skin cells and to maintain the skin barrier function, zzso pathways are zzso by zzso signaling including the zzso zzso However, zzso not only prevents cell death, but is also active in cell cycle transition and zzso thereby also zzso zzso In turn, zzso is tuned down by the negative regulators being controlled by the zzso This zzso of zzso in combination with zzso of zzso zzso zzso guides the zzso elimination of damaged cellular components by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks cell cycle progression to prevent zzso zzso thereby inducing premature zzso zzso zzso via an extensive cross talk with zzso influences the zzso response in the skin with no black and white scenario deciding over death or zzso
