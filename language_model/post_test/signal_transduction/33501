G zzso receptors zzso are the largest family of signaling proteins and the most common therapeutic zzso In the last 2 decades, impressive progress in the understanding of zzso function has been zzso driven largely by the idea of similarity of the molecular mechanisms underlying their signaling and zzso However, recent comprehensive studies of signaling and trafficking of several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso type 1 zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, clearly demonstrate that each zzso is regulated by a unique set of molecular mechanisms involving different zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso of similarities is nearly exhausted and that zzso from one zzso to another is as likely to be misleading as zzso Further progress in the field requires careful analysis of the regulation of individual zzso zzso in defined cellular zzso In this issue of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso describe a complex pattern of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso
