Much of our knowledge of the mechanisms governing zzso transport has come from the combination of genetic and zzso approaches that have identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as key components of transport processes in both zzso and zzso zzso More recently, research has focused on establishing the complex zzso interactions necessary for the regulation of zzso transport by a variety of methods, including the zzso zzso interaction zzso A central component of the signaling zzso regulated by zzso proteins is the zzso cycle, in which the proteins cycle between an active zzso zzso zzso form and an inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso proteins when either zzso or zzso is bound specify the interaction of zzso proteins and influence membrane zzso Our work has focused on identifying interacting partners for the zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso which regulate transport steps between the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We have employed both active zzso and inactive zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify potential new interacting proteins using the zzso zzso system and have verified these interactions using alternative zzso
