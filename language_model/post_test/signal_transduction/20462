zzso zzso differentiated from human zzso stem cells zzso are increasingly being used for cardiovascular research, including disease zzso and hold promise for clinical zzso Current cardiac differentiation protocols exhibit variable success across different zzso lines and are primarily based on the application of growth zzso However, zzso zzso is also fundamentally involved in cardiac development from the earliest zzso events, such as zzso 

We sought to develop a more effective protocol for cardiac differentiation of human zzso by using zzso zzso in combination with growth factors known to promote zzso 

zzso were cultured as zzso on zzso an zzso zzso preparation, and subsequently zzso with zzso The zzso sandwich promoted an zzso transition as in zzso with the generation of zzso zzso zzso Combining the zzso sandwich with sequential application of growth factors zzso A, bone zzso protein 4, and basic zzso growth zzso generated zzso with high purity (up to zzso and yield (up to 11 zzso zzso from multiple zzso zzso The resulting zzso progressively matured over 30 days in culture based on zzso expression pattern and zzso zzso Action zzso typical of embryonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed, and zzso of zzso coupled zzso modeled cardiac tissue and basic zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso application promoted zzso transition of human zzso and zzso growth factor signaling to enable robust cardiac zzso
