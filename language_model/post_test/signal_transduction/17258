zzso how initial radiation injury translates into long-term effects is an important problem in radiation zzso Here, we define a set of changes in the zzso profile that are associated with the long-term response to radiation zzso The study was performed in zzso using zzso an established zzso model zzso To study the long-term response, 24 hour zzso zzso were exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gamma radiation and allowed to develop for 16 zzso Liver zzso profiles were then analyzed using the zzso zzso platform, with validation by quantitative zzso As a basis for comparison, zzso old adults were exposed at the same doses and analyzed after 4 zzso zzso analysis was performed in a way to minimize the effects of multiple zzso The responses to these two treatment regimes differed zzso 360 probe sets were associated primarily with the long-term response, whereas a different zzso probe sets were associated primarily with the response when adults of the same age were zzso 4 hours before zzso Surprisingly, a zzso difference in radiation dose zzso versus zzso zzso had little zzso Analysis at the gene and zzso level indicated that the long-term response includes the induction of zzso and inflammatory regulators and zzso and growth zzso The acute response includes the induction of zzso target genes and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso help define genes and pathways affected in the zzso low and moderate dose radiation response and differentiate them from those affected in an acute response in the same zzso
