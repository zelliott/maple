zzso receptors zzso are an integral part of the innate immune system that recognize zzso molecular patterns and initiate innate and zzso defenses against invading zzso zzso and zzso are involved in sensing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecules in cellular zzso to activate the type I zzso zzso in zzso Although certain synthetic zzso molecules have been identified to show zzso in zzso cells, very little is known about the ability of these sequences to stimulate avian zzso The current study investigated zzso properties of four synthetic zzso sequences using chicken zzso zzso of zzso and 7, type I zzso and several other zzso as well as zzso signaling zzso genes at different time points zzso was zzso by real-time zzso A zzso increase in expression of zzso was observed in zzso treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was significantly zzso upon stimulation with all four zzso zzso Furthermore, in a time course study, a significant increase was noted in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso in zzso treated with zzso In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the zzso properties of zzso zzso especially those that contain a zzso zzso in zzso
