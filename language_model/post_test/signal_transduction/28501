Based on the findings that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso result in the zzso transformation of zzso cells in a zzso manner, a model system has been established in which the zzso and subsequent cell transformation pathways activated by zzso can be turned on or off by the addition or removal of zzso Using this model system, our previous studies have shown that the stimulation of zzso or the expression of an activated zzso of zzso zzso leads to increased cell proliferation and subsequent zzso transformation of zzso cells, as well as persistent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present studies, we show that the stimulation of zzso or the expression of zzso results in a potent zzso of zzso and that the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso activity involves the dual specificity zzso upstream of zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso which are known to stimulate only zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The results also suggest that zzso activates zzso specifically through the stimulation of the zzso upstream zzso zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso by specifically zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Since the stimulation of zzso is often associated with zzso responses, our findings suggest that zzso stimulates cell proliferation and zzso transformation of zzso cells by attenuating zzso zzso responses, while zzso the zzso responses through the stimulation of zzso and zzso signaling zzso
