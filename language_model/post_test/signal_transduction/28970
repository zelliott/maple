zzso active zzso stimulates zzso activity in T zzso cultured in zzso This regulation contrasts with findings obtained in zzso zzso or zzso cells grown on zzso where zzso stimulation occurs independently of zzso We now show that zzso stimulation of zzso is not restricted to the zzso lineage but is dependent on the adherence status of the zzso zzso stimulation of zzso as well as molecular association between zzso and zzso occurred exclusively in cells kept in zzso zzso and complex formation are dependent on zzso but in a manner that differs from its role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells lacking zzso but not those lacking zzso are able to activate zzso through the zzso zzso Our data reveal the existence of a bona fide zzso to zzso signaling pathway, tightly regulated by zzso and operational in suspended cells zzso This zzso may point to an alternative survival signal that is called into action when cells lose contact with the zzso and/or with other zzso
