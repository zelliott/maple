During development and aging, animals suffer zzso modify the fitness of individual zzso In zzso the elimination of viable but zzso cells is zzso by cell competition, ensuring that these cells do not accumulate during zzso In addition, certain genes such as the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso are able to transform cells into zzso which eliminate neighboring zzso cells by zzso and zzso leaving total cell numbers zzso Here we have identified zzso zzso as an early marker zzso zzso in loser cells that provides a transient protection by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, we describe the unexpected existence of a zzso mechanism that zzso cell competition during zzso
