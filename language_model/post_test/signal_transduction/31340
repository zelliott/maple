zzso is a central biological process whose rates and zzso are influenced by a variety of complex and interacting zzso Although DNA repair pathways are generally known to play key roles in maintaining genetic stability, much remains to be understood about the relative roles of different pathways in preventing the zzso of zzso and the extent of zzso in zzso repair efficiencies across different zzso zzso In this study we examine zzso processes in base zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lines across 24 regions of the zzso and compare our observations to previous data from mismatch zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso MA zzso zzso variation in both average and zzso zzso rates, ranging two orders of magnitude for the latter, was detected among the four sets of zzso MA zzso Our work provides critical insights into the relative roles of three DNA repair pathways in preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso and provides evidence for the presence of zzso DNA repair territories in the zzso zzso zzso
