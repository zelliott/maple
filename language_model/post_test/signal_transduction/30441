The role of zzso signaling in zzso lineage formation and differentiation has been zzso 

To define the role of zzso signaling in these zzso we used a zzso line to target a zzso zzso zzso throughout the embryonic zzso zzso the zzso zzso conditional zzso Out zzso largely zzso zzso double knockout zzso suggesting that zzso signaling in the zzso depends mostly on the zzso family of zzso zzso We have dissected this relationship further in the developing lungs and find that zzso deletion of zzso zzso affects two major zzso zzso The amplification but not differentiation of zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso cells is drastically zzso In the zzso zzso however, only differentiation into mature zzso cells is zzso 

Taken together these findings reveal a hierarchy of gene activity involving zzso and zzso as important regulators of zzso cell proliferation and zzso
