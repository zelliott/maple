Women with zzso B virus zzso infection usually have lower viral loads than men, reducing their risk of liver zzso There are 2 zzso elements in the zzso zzso I that contribute to higher viral zzso in zzso We investigated whether and how zzso signaling affects progression of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso supplementation were used to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in transgenic mice with replicating zzso in zzso The effect of zzso signaling on zzso of zzso zzso and the mechanisms of regulation, were studied in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso increased in female mice after zzso and decreased in male mice supplemented with zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso reduced zzso transcription, which required a specific region within zzso zzso zzso DNA binding of zzso and zzso zzso activity were not required for zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso nuclear factor zzso which binds to this region, overcame the repressive effect of zzso zzso did not repress zzso of an zzso zzso with a zzso zzso binding site within zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an interaction between zzso and zzso this interaction prevented zzso binding to zzso I and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso can repress zzso of zzso genes by zzso zzso which interacts with and alters binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso These findings might account for the lower viral load and reduced zzso of liver cancer in zzso women than zzso
