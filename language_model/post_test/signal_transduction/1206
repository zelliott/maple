Our previous study showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the promoting ability to differentiate zzso zzso zzso To expand our study, the effect of zzso on the differentiation of embryonic zzso cells into zzso zzso cells was investigated in this zzso The relationship between cell differentiation with zzso of zzso and the possible signal zzso were also zzso zzso increased zzso extension, a typical characteristic of the differentiation of embryonic zzso cells isolated from zzso rat zzso in a zzso zzso The expression of differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also increased by the treatment of zzso zzso with the increasing effect on cell zzso zzso increased the expression and zzso activity of zzso in cultured embryonic zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso and zzso in the differentiated zzso of fetus (17 zzso and adult rat brain was zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso differentiation of embryonic zzso cells and expression of zzso To zzso the possible signal pathway, the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso family was zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso response zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso further increased the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of specific inhibitor of zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso This zzso correlated well with the zzso of zzso extension and expression of zzso induced by zzso The present results therefore indicate that zzso stimulates differentiation of embryonic zzso cells into zzso zzso cells, and its effect may be zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso
