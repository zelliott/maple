We found that zzso specifically binds to a type I zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso in the activated forms associate with zzso zzso The association of zzso zzso with zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso is zzso associated with a zzso zzso and stimulates zzso production in zzso zzso These data suggest a model in which the initial step in the zzso of zzso is release from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso bound form can associate with the zzso zzso and also interact with an exchange zzso zzso bound zzso may then zzso to sites of zzso zzso bringing the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso capping zzso leading to their release and the production of zzso free zzso zzso zzso can then occur from the free zzso Many other factors must be involved to regulate the type and extent of zzso zzso that is necessary in such complex processes as cell movement and membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso and its product zzso may act at a crucial regulatory point that permits zzso to zzso
