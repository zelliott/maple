Intellectual disability zzso is a common zzso disability observed in 1 to zzso of the human zzso A possible role for the zzso II type 2 zzso zzso in brain function, affecting learning, memory, and behavior, has been suggested in humans and zzso Mice lacking the zzso gene zzso showed significant impairment in their spatial memory and exhibited abnormal zzso spine zzso To identify zzso influenced genes and zzso we performed whole zzso zzso analysis on zzso isolated from brains of zzso and control male mice at embryonic day 15 zzso and zzso day one zzso The gene expression profiles of the zzso brain samples were significantly different when compared to profiles of the zzso control zzso We identified 62 differently expressed genes zzso or zzso at zzso and in zzso brains of the zzso zzso We verified the differential expression of several of these genes in brain samples using quantitative zzso zzso expressed genes zzso molecules involved in multiple cellular processes including zzso functions associated with zzso spine zzso This study provides insight into zzso influenced candidate genes and suggests that expression zzso of these genes may zzso zzso actions in the brain that influences learning and zzso
