Increased synthesis and zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso in response to water deficit stress zzso an intricate network of zzso pathways in guard cells leading to zzso zzso Despite the large number of zzso zzso zzso that are known in guard cells, new discoveries are still being zzso Recently, the zzso oxygen species hydrogen zzso zzso and the zzso nitrogen species zzso oxide zzso have been identified as key molecules regulating zzso zzso closure in various zzso As with many other zzso responses in which zzso and NO are involved, zzso closure in response to zzso also appears to require the tandem synthesis and action of both these zzso zzso Recent pharmacological and genetic data have identified zzso zzso as a source of zzso whilst nitrate zzso has been identified as a source of NO in zzso guard zzso Some zzso components positioned downstream of zzso and NO are zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso However, the exact interaction between the various zzso components in response to zzso and NO in guard cells remains to be zzso
