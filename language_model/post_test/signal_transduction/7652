New models of the gastric zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso states are presented as the first structures of a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibiting zzso entry and exit zzso zzso modeling was first used to generate a starting zzso from the zzso zzso zzso form zzso code zzso that contains bound zzso Energy zzso of the model showed a zzso zzso site but zzso zzso contacts compared to the zzso zzso zzso dynamics was then employed to expand the zzso entry sufficiently to allow access of the rigid zzso competitive zzso zzso zzso to its binding site within the membrane zzso The new zzso model had increased separation between zzso segments zzso through zzso and addition of water in this space showed not only an inhibitor entry path to the zzso zzso but also a channel leading to the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso to the hydrated channel with molecular dynamics modeling of zzso movement identified a zzso for zzso from the zzso to the zzso binding site to give zzso A zzso exit path to the zzso operating during the normal zzso cycle is also proposed on the basis of an zzso zzso model derived from the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso code zzso zzso analyses of the new zzso model now correctly discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso competitive zzso Finally, the expanded zzso zzso of the zzso model explains zzso zzso binding in a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2005) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
