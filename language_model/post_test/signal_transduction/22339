zzso zzso and its zzso product zzso zzso were recently detected in human zzso zzso and brain zzso and they may play pivotal roles in the zzso of zzso and neurodegenerative zzso However, as their origin remains unidentified, we examined the formation zzso the stability, and the fate of zzso in zzso and in zzso About zzso of zzso remained unchanged after 3 h incubation in the zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were converted to its zzso product, zzso acid, and zzso zzso In the presence of zzso almost all zzso was converted immediately to these zzso zzso in the zzso with and without zzso was relatively stable, but zzso was converted to its zzso product, zzso acid zzso When zzso differentiated human leukemia zzso zzso cells activated with zzso were cultured in the zzso medium containing cholesterol, significantly increased levels of zzso and its zzso product, but not zzso were zzso This zzso formation was decreased in the culture of zzso zzso cells containing several zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso or in the culture of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is formed by an zzso zzso generated with zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
