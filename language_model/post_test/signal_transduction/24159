zzso signal zzso involves zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso functions upstream of the negative regulator zzso The similarity of zzso to members of the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso signaling in plants involves a zzso pathway, but no direct evidence for this has been zzso Here we show that distinct zzso are activated by the zzso precursor zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso while in zzso zzso and another zzso were zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso and zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso lines resemble zzso zzso in showing a triple response zzso in the absence of zzso Whereas zzso was not activated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed normal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso These data indicate that a zzso cascade is part of the zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso
