zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso blood zzso when zzso with factor zzso Recently, zzso has been shown to promote cellular zzso tumor growth, zzso and zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso by which zzso complex zzso cellular signaling in human breast cancer cells using the zzso cell zzso This cell line has high zzso zzso expression as measured by flow zzso and expression of zzso receptors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso as determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Both zzso and zzso are functionally active as determined by induction of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso using specific zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso in this cell line was strongly induced by the combination of zzso and factor zzso but not by zzso alone at a concentration of zzso that approaches zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso involved the formation of zzso complex and occurred by a zzso that did not require zzso formation, indicating a critical role for zzso zzso In addition, induction of zzso zzso was found to be independent of zzso zzso We then examined whether zzso complex formation could promote tumor cell migration using a modified zzso chamber zzso zzso The combination of zzso and FX, but not zzso alone, strongly induced migration of tumor cells by a zzso that probably involves zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be required for the induction of cell migration by the combination of zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling in human breast cancer cells occurs most efficiently by formation of the zzso zzso One of the zzso consequences of this signaling zzso is enhanced cell migration that is probably zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso
