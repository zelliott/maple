zzso of zzso is increased in aging hearts and those subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhances pressure overload zzso cardiac zzso We studied whether suppression of the zzso zzso contributes to cardiac responses induced by zzso zzso using zzso active zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso which were obtained by crossing zzso zzso transgenic mice zzso and zzso zzso transgenic mice zzso The suppression of zzso zzso observed in zzso was eliminated in zzso zzso At 12 zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso weight, and cardiac zzso size were significantly smaller in zzso than in zzso mice zzso but were not significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ejection fraction zzso fractional zzso zzso and change in pressure over time were significantly lower in zzso than in zzso but were not significantly different between zzso mice and zzso The increase in zzso in zzso was abolished in zzso mice, although the increase in zzso was zzso After zzso the decrease in cardiac zzso and the enhancement of zzso seen in zzso were zzso in zzso zzso After zzso the zzso and zzso were significantly reduced in zzso compared with its sham, but not in zzso zzso or zzso mice compared with their respective zzso There was no significant difference in zzso and zzso between zzso mice and zzso after zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso zzso mediates the zzso suppression and cardiac dysfunction caused by zzso zzso in cardiac zzso
