zzso zzso is known to inhibit zzso and hormone zzso or zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso cells in primary zzso This zzso persists when cells are incubated in a zzso medium (a condition in which zzso could not inhibit zzso activities by blocking calcium zzso and is abolished by a zzso toxin zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso could be zzso coupled to zzso by a direct mechanism involving a zzso zzso G zzso To demonstrate this hypothesis, we measured zzso activities on crude plasma zzso obtained from rat zzso cells in primary culture grown in the presence of zzso zzso We showed that 1) zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso or zzso membrane zzso zzso 2) Such inhibitions were completely prevented by zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso proteins coupled the zzso receptors to zzso because zzso inhibitions were completely reversed by zzso either with zzso toxin or with a specific zzso zzso Such data are in favor of the existence of a direct negative zzso between zzso zzso and zzso on a native zzso plasma membrane zzso
