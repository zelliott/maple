zzso is a zzso found in a variety of cells and zzso and involved in a multitude of biological zzso Recently, zzso has been identified as a host defense zzso and as such it plays a role in the inflammatory zzso The zzso factor zzso is a major regulator of genes involved in the inflammatory response and the aim of this study was to determine whether zzso played a role in the inflammatory process triggered by zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were used as our model in zzso Western zzso analysis from zzso zzso cells revealed a rapid degradation of zzso inhibitor alpha and beta followed by the zzso of free zzso to the nucleus, where it was detected by Texas Red zzso after incubation with zzso for 15 zzso zzso shift zzso showed that zzso present in the nucleus was active, since it bound to a probe containing an zzso binding zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso members of the zzso family, were both part of the zzso zzso involved in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso which was significantly attenuated by the zzso inhibitor zzso Taken together, the data lend support for an zzso role for zzso
