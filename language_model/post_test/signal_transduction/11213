zzso zzso injury results in the death of irreplaceable cardiac zzso by a zzso cell death or zzso The signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso factors function as zzso of zzso signaling and sensors responding to cellular zzso Interestingly, many studies have demonstrated that although they have a similar structural organization, zzso and zzso have zzso effects on processes such as differentiation or zzso For example, zzso has been shown to induced zzso whilst zzso is able protect cardiac zzso following zzso zzso zzso Many of the effects of zzso and zzso involve the direct binding to DNA and zzso zzso of target zzso However, recent studies have shown that for zzso some of its effects appear not to require DNA zzso For example, induction of zzso by zzso can be produced by the zzso zzso domain in the absence of the DNA binding zzso This therefore, appears to involve a zzso effect in which zzso is recruited to DNA via a zzso zzso zzso In this regard, it is of interest that zzso but not zzso has been shown to interact with zzso and enhance its growth arrest and zzso inducing zzso zzso the finding that zzso and zzso can zzso the zzso zzso both by direct DNA binding or via a zzso mechanism and despite their very similar structures, suggests that these related factors may be therapeutic targets against the damage zzso following zzso zzso Recently, we reported that the zzso agent zzso zzso a major constituent of green tea and a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso protects the zzso against zzso zzso
