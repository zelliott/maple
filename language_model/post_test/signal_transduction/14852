The tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso is a zzso protein which is not only an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but also to have a possible zzso zzso Here, we first compared zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso (a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso (a normal liver cell line) and zzso (a cell line derived from peripheral tissue of liver zzso using real-time quantitative zzso By evaluating the variation of the zzso ratio as an index of zzso changes of the expression of the two zzso we observed that the zzso ratio was about zzso and zzso higher in zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the zzso ratio in zzso and then inhibited the cell growth to zzso and reduced the migration to about zzso Meanwhile, our data showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso could also inhibited the cell growth of zzso Further studies indicated that zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner, which could further accelerate the expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A dominant negative zzso zzso totally abolished zzso zzso expression and its biological zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso may be one of the zzso that regulate the zzso effect of zzso on zzso proliferation in which zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso also play important zzso
