zzso zzso development has recently become the focus of intense zzso In this report, we first show that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene plays a critical early role in zzso zzso bon zzso exhibit a profound reduction in the number of zzso zzso precursors formed during zzso and, consequently, a profound reduction in gut tissue at later zzso The zzso precursors that do form in bon zzso however, appear to differentiate normally indicating that bon is not required at later steps of zzso zzso We further demonstrate that bon encodes a zzso zzso protein of the Mix family that is expressed zzso before and during early zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of bon can rescue zzso gene expression and the formation of a gut tube in bon zzso Analysis of a newly identified zzso zzso reveals that a single zzso acid substitution in the DNA recognition zzso of the zzso creates a dominant interfering form of zzso when zzso We also show through zzso and zzso analyses that zzso functions exclusively downstream of zzso and zzso zzso Together, our data demonstrate that zzso is a critical zzso regulator of early zzso zzso
