Daily zzso zzso of the zzso system relies on the transmission of light information from the zzso to zzso cells within the zzso zzso nucleus zzso core, and subsequent zzso of rhythmic clock cells in the zzso zzso Some zzso such as zzso zzso zzso mimic the phase shifting effects of light and induce zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso of the zzso element binding protein zzso is necessary for zzso zzso to occur and accompanies behavioral phase zzso however, several zzso zzso are involved in this zzso One zzso that has been implicated in zzso responses involves protein zzso A zzso It is not known if this zzso zzso in zzso phase shifts to zzso Here we show that preventing zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso phase shifts in locomotor behavior, but only during the zzso zzso This finding demonstrates that zzso of zzso is an important component in the zzso signaling zzso and may mediate zzso output signaling from the zzso core to the zzso however, this effect appears to be temporally zzso
