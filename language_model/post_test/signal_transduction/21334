It has been previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso the response of zzso the resident brain zzso to acute injuries in specific brain zzso We here show that the effect of zzso in acute brain inflammation is widespread and that the hormone reduces the expression of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso induced by zzso demonstrating that zzso are a direct target of zzso action in zzso Using the zzso mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease zzso chronic zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso increases zzso zzso at zzso zzso deposits and zzso the progression of these cells toward a highly zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso reverts the effects of zzso and decreases zzso zzso compared with control zzso In this animal model, these events do not correlate with a reduced number of zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso zzso expression of scavenger zzso in zzso cells, providing a mechanism for the effect of zzso on zzso signaling observed in the zzso zzso Altogether, our observations reveal a substantial involvement of zzso zzso in zzso processes and provide novel mechanisms for hormone action in the zzso
