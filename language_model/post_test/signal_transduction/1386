The cellular events involved in zzso zzso analgesia were investigated in the mouse hot plate zzso zzso zzso with zzso against the alpha zzso of zzso and zzso proteins prevented the analgesia induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily for 7 zzso Administration of the zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the injection of an zzso complementary to the sequence of zzso antagonized the increase of the pain threshold induced by zzso zzso with zzso an analogue of zzso inactive on zzso did not modify zzso zzso zzso In mice undergoing treatment with zzso which zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso a blocker of zzso release from zzso stores, the zzso induced by zzso was zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso an zzso zzso zzso prevented the increase of pain threshold induced by the investigated compound, analgesia that was restored by zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso with the selective protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso C and zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso prevented the zzso increase of pain zzso Neither zzso nor pharmacological treatments produced any behavioral impairment of mice as revealed by the zzso and hole board zzso These results indicate that central zzso analgesia in mice requires the zzso of the zzso zzso By contrast, the simultaneous zzso of zzso may represent a zzso of negative zzso of zzso zzso
