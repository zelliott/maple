We demonstrate that zzso of the gene zzso required for swarming migration in zzso zzso is driven by two zzso a zzso promoter and a putative zzso promoter, which is inactive during growth in liquid zzso medium and becomes active in the presence of the zzso form of the response regulator zzso or on zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is enhanced by zzso this finding reveals that zzso expression is controlled by a positive feedback zzso We also demonstrate that the positive action of zzso in swimming and swarming zzso is prevented in strains carrying a deletion of the zzso system zzso and that this effect is independent of zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso must be present to achieve full zzso in zzso zzso
