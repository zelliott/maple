zzso zzso is the most serious complication in clinical zzso for spinal zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso induced zzso of spinal zzso zzso accompanied by zzso In this study, we further investigated the mechanism by which zzso radiation triggered zzso in neural zzso We found that zzso induced by zzso radiation was involved in zzso zzso zzso stress and mainly dependent on zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly suppressed in zzso knockout neural zzso Meanwhile, the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso all significantly increased in neural cells zzso with a zzso zzso and which enhanced zzso of zzso after zzso zzso The results were consistent with that by zzso and zzso zzso In animal model of zzso pigs with radiation zzso caused by zzso zzso we have successfully decreased zzso expression by zzso administration of the zzso zzso The zzso rate was significantly higher than that in control group and which deteriorated radiation zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso caused by zzso radiation was mainly as an attempt of cell survival at an early stage, but it would be a self-destructive process and promoted the process of zzso and necrosis radiated by zzso for more than 72 zzso The study would be useful and helpful to maximize efficiency of radiation therapy in clinical zzso
