In this study we investigated the effects of zzso receptors in the regulation of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso 

zzso zzso concentration zzso was measured using zzso and zzso zzso zzso using Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause a rapid and zzso increase in the zzso of zzso In contrast, negligible response was seen for zzso a general zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso of zzso was prevented by zzso of zzso with zzso toxin or zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso cascade by zzso was blocked in cells zzso with zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso or a zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso with high doses of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were observed when cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was unaffected in cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso We also found that zzso stimulates both the zzso of 3- zzso protein zzso zzso and its zzso to plasma membrane in a zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that the effects zzso by zzso in zzso occur via zzso zzso zzso receptors through zzso mechanisms, in which zzso and zzso are two key molecules within signal cascade leading to zzso zzso
