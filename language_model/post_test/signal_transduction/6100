To investigate the involvement of the zzso zzso in collagen gel contraction by zzso 

An in zzso type I collagen gel contraction zzso using cultured bovine zzso was performed to evaluate the effect of zzso and zzso The effect of both zzso on the zzso of zzso light chain zzso was analyzed by Western zzso zzso To confirm the involvement of the zzso zzso in the collagen gel contraction, the effects of zzso a specific zzso inhibitor were zzso The effect of zzso another potent zzso zzso was also zzso The expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso was analyzed by Western zzso analysis to examine the zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso collagen gel contraction was observed within 24 hours after treatment with zzso and much stronger contraction with zzso whose effect was time dependent, at least up to 5 zzso Although transient and maximum zzso zzso by zzso was observed at approximately 4 hours after stimulation zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in a zzso manner at least up to 24 hours zzso P zzso and was maintained up to 5 zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso of collagen gel contraction induced by both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prohibited the zzso of zzso and inhibited collagen gel contraction at a concentration corresponding to that which inhibited zzso zzso zzso but not zzso also caused zzso zzso with zzso zzso which was zzso by zzso in part zzso zzso 

The zzso have a zzso property in the presence of zzso and zzso Whereas zzso zzso collagen gel contraction by transient zzso of the zzso pathway, sustained zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso appears to be involved in the zzso zzso properties of zzso
