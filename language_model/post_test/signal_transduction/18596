zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to zzso zzso transmission via selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite huge research efforts, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system in pain processing remains incompletely zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in the processing of zzso zzso zzso To address this issue the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice were tested in the mouse zzso zzso Twenty zzso of zzso zzso solution was injected zzso into the right hind paw causing a characteristic pattern of zzso zzso zzso biting and lifting of the injected zzso In control mice, the injection of zzso resulted in a classical zzso zzso response with the first phase lasting from 0 to 10 zzso and the second phase from 15 to 45 zzso zzso at 10 zzso (but not at 1 zzso produced zzso action when injected zzso and a zzso action when given zzso zzso administration of zzso (10 zzso zzso and the genetic zzso of the zzso zzso gene both produced a significant increase of mouse zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated during the mouse zzso test producing spinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso The overall effect of blocking zzso zzso zzso by either systemic pharmacological antagonism or genetic zzso indicates that the spinal zzso action prevails over zzso zzso zzso
