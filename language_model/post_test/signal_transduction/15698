zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified to play important roles in zzso zzso Evidence from both in zzso and in zzso studies indicates that increased zzso activity contributes to zzso and to the zzso of zzso zzso But the molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We reported here that zzso zzso factor zzso zzso a nuclear zzso factor known to promote zzso survival, is directly zzso by zzso Our data showed that zzso of zzso by zzso at three specific zzso in its zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso activated zzso in the nucleus, leading to zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso contributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that is resistant to zzso zzso protected zzso zzso zzso from either zzso zzso or zzso activity zzso zzso These results identify survival factor zzso as a novel downstream zzso targeted by zzso and define a molecular link between zzso of zzso and zzso survival machinery which may zzso in part zzso zzso
