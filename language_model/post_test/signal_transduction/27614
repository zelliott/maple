zzso zzso is responsible for initiating host responses leading to septic zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso is thought to be its primary zzso In addition, zzso alpha is one of the major components of the zzso of insulin resistance in various zzso It has been shown that zzso induced zzso alpha production in rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso However, little is known about the signaling zzso by which zzso in culture produce zzso zzso We investigated the possible signaling components involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation of inhibitor of zzso zzso and an increase in nuclear binding activity of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso Different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which specifically abolished zzso degradation and subsequent zzso zzso by zzso suppressed zzso alpha zzso from zzso Although zzso a specific zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso activity, zzso suppressed zzso alpha zzso however, zzso did zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso of dominant negative zzso or zzso with zzso suppressed the zzso alpha gene zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso expression induced by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso These observations indicate that zzso alpha production in zzso is zzso by zzso and its zzso and translation are dependent on zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso It is likely that zzso zzso may play a critical role in regulating zzso of the zzso alpha gene in zzso unlike in other cell zzso
