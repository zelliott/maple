Clinical studies are evaluating the efficacy of synthetic zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, the control of zzso zzso under conditions of zzso gastric zzso is largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in animals and zzso We investigated the time course of zzso changes zzso in zzso rats and whether zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso signaling is zzso zzso surgery zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid and long-lasting decrease in plasma zzso zzso levels as shown by the 64, 67, and 59% reduction at zzso 2, and 5 h zzso respectively, compared with sham zzso alone for 10 zzso P zzso zzso zzso were partly recovered at 7 h and fully restored at 24 zzso The percentage of zzso zzso reduction was significantly higher than that of zzso zzso at 2 h zzso and not at any other time zzso This was associated with a 48 and zzso decrease in gastric and plasma zzso protein zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso levels by 64 and zzso at zzso and 2 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso prevented the abdominal zzso decreased circulating zzso zzso but not the delayed gastric zzso assessed zzso h zzso These data show that zzso of zzso zzso located on gastric zzso cells plays a key role in the rapid zzso of circulating zzso zzso induced by abdominal surgery while not being primarily involved in the early phase of zzso gastric zzso
