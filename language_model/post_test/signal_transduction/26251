It is well established that zzso trigger zzso signaling via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, we have observed both zzso zzso zzso and functional activity of the liberated zzso domain zzso suggesting that zzso zzso can also signal via regulated zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso domain is a hallmark of the most common class of zzso To investigate the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso by zzso converting zzso zzso and zzso zzso We tracked the fate of zzso and fusion zzso of zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso versions of zzso and zzso 1 and zzso zzso and zzso location were determined by zzso zzso zzso and reporter zzso We found that both zzso and zzso 1/2 cleave zzso in a sequential manner that allows the zzso to move to the zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso but was not consistently required for the zzso effects of zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso 1/2, suggesting that zzso signal by both zzso and zzso zzso
