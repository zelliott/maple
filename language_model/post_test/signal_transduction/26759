The zzso capacity ascribed to embryonic stem cells zzso is reminiscent of cancer cell zzso raising speculation that a common network of genes may regulate these zzso A search for general regulators of these traits yielded a set of zzso for which expression is highly enriched in human zzso and liver cancer cells zzso but attenuated in differentiated zzso zzso Here, we show that these zzso promote zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and when zzso in normally zzso zzso induce proliferation and activate cancer signaling zzso zzso in zzso is zzso through zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which collectively zzso the zzso and zzso tumor zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of these zzso is observed in human liver tumor zzso and zzso zzso transition in zzso These findings suggest that zzso that are essential in normal development as promoters of zzso zzso are frequently zzso in human liver tumors and harbor zzso transformation potential when they escape zzso in zzso human zzso
