zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the nuclear zzso hormone zzso family, activates zzso of numerous zzso genes upon exposure to therapeutic drugs and environmental zzso zzso in the zzso this zzso signals zzso exposure, such as zzso zzso by zzso into the zzso Unlike other hormone zzso zzso can be triggered indirectly without binding to zzso We have now identified a zzso zzso of protein zzso 1 zzso or zzso as zzso as a novel zzso zzso When zzso and zzso are zzso in mouse liver, zzso zzso into the zzso Close association of zzso and zzso zzso on liver membrane was shown by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso analysis using expressed yellow fluorescent protein zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso can form zzso through its middle region, where protein zzso A zzso sites are recently zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso with the ability of zzso to form an zzso interaction via the middle zzso Moreover, this interaction is enhanced by zzso treatment in mouse zzso zzso specifically zzso with zzso in zzso cells despite the highly zzso structure of zzso family zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso in liver can prevent zzso zzso into mouse zzso Taken together, zzso at the membrane may mediate the zzso signal to initiate zzso nuclear zzso through a mechanism including its zzso and zzso of zzso activity, providing a novel model for the zzso of nuclear receptors in which direct interaction of zzso and the receptors may not be zzso
