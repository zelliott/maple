Early in animal development, zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as Sonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso family members, regulate cell proliferation and determine the fate and zzso of the target cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso which ultimately control gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also play an important and evolutionary zzso role in neural circuit zzso They regulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso development and zzso processes that require rapid and local changes in zzso organization and plasma membrane zzso A key question then is whether zzso zzso at the growth cone uses similar mechanisms and zzso zzso components to those described for zzso cell zzso This review discusses recent advances towards the understanding of this problem, showing how zzso zzso and zzso have adapted their zzso zzso pathways or adopted alternative and novel molecular mechanisms to influence different aspects of zzso circuit zzso
