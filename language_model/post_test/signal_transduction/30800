zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins is a potential zzso mechanism in insulin zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso requires prior zzso of its zzso prompting us to identify the zzso zzso It was found that the stress zzso zzso enhanced the ability of zzso to zzso zzso Use of a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and cells zzso zzso implicated zzso as the zzso zzso This allowed us to narrow down the number of potential zzso zzso sites within zzso to four regions that follow the motif zzso zzso deletion zzso enabled us to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso sites to zzso 484 and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of each site separately abolished zzso zzso of zzso Treatment of zzso liver cells with zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was reversed by zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its association with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in the diabetic zzso of zzso zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso is zzso zzso by zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and provide evidence for their zzso role in zzso insulin zzso
