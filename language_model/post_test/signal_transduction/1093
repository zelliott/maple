zzso the zzso kidney disease 1 gene product, has been implicated in several signaling complexes that are known to regulate essential cellular zzso We investigated the role of zzso in zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso To this aim, a zzso construct zzso the zzso zzso region of mouse zzso reported to mediate signal zzso activity was expressed in human embryonic and zzso zzso zzso To ensure specificity and minimal zzso effects, we focused our study on the zzso proteins that actually zzso the signals, zzso and zzso zzso factor for zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso Our data indicate that the zzso region of zzso activates zzso by inducing zzso and expression of at least zzso and zzso whereas zzso was not zzso Under our experimental conditions, zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in human zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso cells expressing transgenic full-length zzso resulting in decreased zzso and increased zzso activity, whereas zzso signaling remained zzso Since our data indicate that zzso zzso expression results in altered zzso activity, zzso may be required for adequate zzso zzso
