Host defense mechanisms are impaired in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed in localized aggressive zzso zzso a familial disorder characterized by destruction of the supporting structures of zzso In the present studies, we sought evidence for molecular events underlying this zzso human zzso zzso To this end, zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso generation were assessed with zzso patients and zzso family members, as well as patients with other chronic zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients showed decreased zzso across vascular zzso zzso (18 zzso zzso of control, zzso zzso 4) and increased zzso zzso generation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Gene expression was analyzed using zzso zzso and zzso kinetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed diminished zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha in zzso from zzso patients zzso zzso zzso relative units, zzso zzso 6, p zzso zzso compared with zzso individuals zzso zzso 27 relative units, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was monitored by zzso zzso and individual zzso molecular species were zzso using liquid zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and correlated with increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso defects in both zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso alpha signaling as zzso functions in zzso Moreover, they identify a potential molecular zzso in zzso signal zzso that may account for their zzso responses and tissue destruction in this zzso
