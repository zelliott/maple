When considering the pathological steps in the progression from cardiac overload towards the full clinical syndrome of heart failure, it is becoming increasingly clear that the zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in this zzso zzso pressure overload zzso a number of structural zzso not only zzso of zzso but also an increase in zzso proteins in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso When this culminates in excessive fibrosis, zzso compliance decreases and electrical zzso is zzso Altogether, zzso is associated with an increased risk of zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso strategies are increasingly recognized as a promising approach in the prevention and treatment of heart zzso Thus, zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cardiac zzso is of great scientific and therapeutic zzso In this review, we provide an overview of the available evidence supporting the general idea that zzso plays a zzso role in deteriorating cardiac zzso Next, we will delineate the zzso pathways zzso governed by transforming growth factor zzso zzso in the control of cardiac zzso Finally, we will discuss the recent discovery that zzso zzso regulate cardiac zzso
