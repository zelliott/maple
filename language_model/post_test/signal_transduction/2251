zzso is an zzso fusion gene found in patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso whose zzso potential has been demonstrated using in zzso and in zzso model zzso Current research efforts are focused on defining the mechanism by which zzso zzso cells, with a view toward applying insights from these studies to the treatment of zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso an zzso domain, an zzso domain, and zzso zzso The presence of so many zzso interaction zzso raises the possibility of multiple contacts with cellular signal zzso zzso Indeed, zzso is reported to bind and/or zzso more than 20 zzso Many of these can be directly linked to signal zzso pathways based on defined roles in other systems, but others have no known zzso As the list of such proteins grows, it is critical to define the role of each in the zzso activity of zzso This review summarizes current views of the mechanism of zzso transformation with emphasis on the zzso and signal zzso pathways affected by its zzso zzso zzso
