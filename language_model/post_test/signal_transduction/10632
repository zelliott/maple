The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in skeletal muscle where they zzso control cell cycle arrest during zzso We have previously shown that zzso is a target of the zzso factor zzso in cells lacking zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level through a mechanism different from that involved in zzso regulation, since it is zzso and requires new zzso zzso We have identified zzso family members as the factors that mediate the zzso of zzso through a zzso promoter zzso The levels of zzso zzso beta and delta zzso increase during muscle differentiation both in zzso zzso and in spontaneously zzso C2 zzso Moreover, the expression of a zzso dominant negative zzso interferes with the induction of zzso Finally, each of the zzso zzso by zzso even when zzso alone, is capable of inducing zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the same zzso zzso either induced by zzso or zzso zzso are unable to activate the expression of zzso in zzso zzso Our finding that a zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike the zzso zzso is responsive to both zzso and zzso even in these cells, suggests that a zzso zzso probably involving a repressive zzso structure, prevents the induction of zzso in zzso zzso
