The highly zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso has been proposed to have various roles in the cell, from translation to zzso zzso to nuclear protein zzso To further our understanding of this essential zzso three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been zzso Two zzso zzso proteins contain zzso in a zzso zzso at the junction between the two zzso zzso and the third, strongest zzso encodes a protein with a single zzso in each domain, both of which are required for the growth zzso The stronger zzso zzso cause defects in degradation of short-lived zzso supporting a role for this protein in zzso zzso A zzso zzso screen revealed six zzso the zzso of which allows growth of a zzso strain at high zzso these genes include zzso zzso and zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso Further results suggest that zzso may also be involved in zzso synthesis and the zzso signaling zzso for cell wall integrity or related zzso
