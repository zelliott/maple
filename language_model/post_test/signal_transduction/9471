zzso regulation of the transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso has been linked to zzso zzso aneurysm zzso Previous work has indicated that differential zzso is a common phenomenon, potentially influencing the function of zzso In the present study we investigated the occurrence of differential zzso in the zzso zzso associated with zzso in patients with zzso zzso valve zzso and zzso zzso valve zzso zzso human zzso zzso were applied to 81 zzso tissue samples from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 30) zzso of zzso and zzso zzso To analyze the occurrence of alternative zzso in the zzso pathway, zzso techniques, including principal component analysis and zzso zzso partial least squares to zzso structures zzso zzso were applied on all zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The scores plot, based on the zzso index of individual zzso showed separate clusters of patients with both zzso and zzso zzso thereby illustrating the potential importance of alternative zzso in zzso In total, differential zzso was detected in zzso zzso Furthermore, the pattern of alternative zzso is clearly differs between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was specific for zzso and zzso patients in 40 and 86 zzso respectively, and zzso of 61 zzso were shared between the two zzso The occurrence of differential zzso was demonstrated in selected genes by reverse zzso chain zzso In zzso alternative zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso in zzso and zzso patients has different alternative zzso fingerprints in the zzso zzso
