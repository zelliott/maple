The zzso migration, survival, and differentiation of zzso zzso cells, precursors to zzso zzso in the zzso are controlled by a number of zzso growth factors in zzso The requirement and roles for individual factors in zzso however, are primarily zzso We have used a cell transplantation approach to examine the role of zzso growth factor zzso in zzso development in zzso A zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso in zzso generating cells that were zzso to zzso but responsive to other zzso When transplanted into the brains of zzso rats, zzso cells were unable to migrate and remained within the zzso These results suggest a role for zzso signaling in establishing a zzso zzso for zzso zzso cell migration in zzso and illustrate the utility of a zzso cell zzso approach for the study of gene function during zzso development in zzso
