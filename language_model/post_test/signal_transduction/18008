This review covers recent findings concerning the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso attention is paid to aspects of retinal patterning and differentiation where relative timing of events seems to be tightly controlled and essential for proper assembly of the compound zzso For example, zzso of the founding zzso of each cluster requires sequential positive and negative signaling through the zzso pathway, and reiterated signaling through the zzso growth factor zzso leads to the zzso recruitment of the distinct types of zzso in discrete zones across the zzso zzso suggest that different signaling environments for these two receptors may exist across the disc, and that receiving cells may constantly shift their predisposition to respond to such signals by adopting given zzso In addition, considerable data exist that the rate of expansion of retinal patterning across the disc is restricted to allow the orderly patterning of retinal zzso and that one mechanism for controlling this rate may be the zzso expression anterior to the zzso of factors which both inhibit and promote the expansion of retinal zzso Finally, this review considers the possibility that the zzso zzso serves as a moving source of zzso which supply spatial information to both anterior and zzso zzso providing zzso cues that regulate the many events involved in orderly assembly of the precise array of retinal cell types in the compound zzso
