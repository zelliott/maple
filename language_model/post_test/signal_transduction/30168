zzso and zzso contain zzso regulatory motifs that interact with and stabilize the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and related proteins may influence signal strength or duration as well as the adaptation of the signaling system associated with sustained zzso To address these issues, we determined the effect of zzso on the integration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals to zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not alter the zzso increase in zzso or the zzso effect of zzso zzso System adaptation was addressed by determining the influence of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso that occurs following prolonged zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of cells with the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso for 18 h resulted in a approximately zzso increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and this was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso Both effects were blocked by zzso zzso also decreased the rate of zzso zzso A zzso zzso incapable of binding zzso was zzso These data suggest that zzso and perhaps other zzso regulatory zzso proteins increase the stability of zzso in the zzso which influences the adaptation of the cell to prolonged zzso of zzso zzso
