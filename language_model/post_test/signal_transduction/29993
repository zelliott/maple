The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso regulates numerous biological zzso To examine the zzso and zzso contributions of specific structural motifs within zzso zzso zzso or zzso forms of the zzso zzso were zzso expressed in developing zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso lacking both the SAM domain and zzso binding motif were zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso active in zzso zzso induced loss of cell zzso zzso zzso and severely expanded zzso structures in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of a zzso SAM domain zzso to zzso zzso enhanced the ability of zzso to induce these zzso suggesting that the SAM domain may zzso regulate some aspects of zzso activity in zzso Analysis of double zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso were dependent on zzso zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were required for cell zzso but not for zzso zzso The induction of zzso and expansion of zzso structures is similar to zzso effects observed in zzso zzso expressing activated zzso Furthermore, the budding zzso zzso induced by zzso express zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso expression in zzso substantially reduced the zzso effects in zzso expressing zzso suggesting a connection between zzso and zzso zzso
