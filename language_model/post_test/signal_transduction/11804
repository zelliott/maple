Changes in cellular gene zzso patterns induced by zzso signals are thought to be important for many biological zzso including the control of cell zzso The transmission of gene regulatory signals through the zzso is zzso by signaling zzso of which protein zzso are important zzso and recent evidence suggests that communication between the zzso and nucleus relies on zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This new information is reviewed and the implications for gene regulation and the control of cell growth are zzso
