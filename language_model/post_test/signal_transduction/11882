zzso target of zzso zzso signaling has been suggested to be effective in zzso cognitive status in animal models of Alzheimer's disease zzso but little is known about its role in zzso zzso We hereby tested whether zzso signaling was activated and whether activated zzso signaling was related to the degree of cognitive deficits in patients with zzso zzso brain zzso zzso were obtained from controls and patients with zzso and Western blots were performed using zzso against zzso signaling molecules and zzso an upstream component of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso We found that expression of zzso and its downstream targets zzso and zzso were expressed in the control and zzso zzso The expression levels of these signaling molecules were significantly increased in the zzso at the severe stages of zzso compared to controls and other stages of zzso Interestingly, zzso expression level was zzso In addition, zzso was increased in the zzso at the early, moderate, and severe stages of zzso Our data indicate that zzso but not zzso was activated in the zzso brains and that the level of zzso signaling zzso was correlated with cognitive severity of zzso zzso
