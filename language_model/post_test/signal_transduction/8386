Native zzso zzso is a zzso zzso composed of identical 23 zzso zzso which can be zzso zzso to form free zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso has a reduced zzso zzso and a tendency to zzso into zzso zzso in various zzso in particular, blood vessel zzso A dramatic increase in expression of zzso occurs in zzso blood vessels derived from zzso brain regions, zzso arteries and active vessels from other zzso diseases such as zzso Furthermore, zzso unlike the native zzso is highly zzso to vascular zzso cells in zzso and therefore might impact on the processes of zzso and zzso thus affecting tissue survival and zzso In this zzso we will discuss the differences in the biological properties between zzso and zzso We will provide a brief historical background to the importance of zzso as a zzso for cardiovascular zzso We will explain the mechanisms of conversion of zzso to its zzso form and describe evidence for the role of zzso in zzso of zzso cell zzso promotion of inflammatory status and zzso formation in zzso zzso Finally, we will provide evidence for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso from diseased zzso and demonstrate its highly zzso zzso The discovery of the existence of this zzso highly zzso zzso form of zzso capable of cellular binding and zzso signal zzso zzso may help in our understanding of the processes responsible for zzso of zzso and inflammation in zzso
