zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein with expression restricted to zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from targeted zzso mice exhibited enhanced zzso zzso production, and zzso induction in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso led to a suppression of zzso zzso induced by the zzso pathway, without having effects on gene expression zzso by zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso unlike zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso signaling by zzso signal relay through the zzso zzso
