The bacterial type VI zzso system zzso is an zzso that is structurally and mechanistically analogous to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies determined that a rapid zzso change in the structure of a sheath protein complex propels zzso spike and tube components along with zzso and zzso zzso out of predatory zzso cells and into prey zzso The contracted zzso is then recycled in an zzso zzso zzso is regulated at zzso and zzso levels, the latter involving detection of membrane zzso in some zzso In addition to directly targeting zzso cells, the zzso can also target other bacteria zzso a zzso host, highlighting the importance of the zzso not only for bacterial survival in environmental zzso but also in the context of infection and zzso This review highlights these and other advances in our understanding of the structure, mechanical function, zzso and regulation of the zzso
