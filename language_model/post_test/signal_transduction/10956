In the developing zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and underlying zzso Insight into the function of zzso in limb development has been hampered by the early embryonic zzso of zzso zzso zzso We directly investigated zzso using a conditional zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso to zzso zzso in limb bud zzso The limb bud zzso of zzso zzso was defective in production of zzso but still competent to respond to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had defective zzso patterning including zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also had zzso zzso with zzso five zzso zzso zzso limbs had delayed induction and maturation of the zzso that resulted in expanded zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso persisted longer in the zzso zzso limb buds exposing the forming digits to prolonged zzso zzso Our data show that zzso in limb zzso regulates zzso induction and maturation and zzso signaling from the zzso in regulation of zzso number and zzso
