zzso clones of zzso virus 40 large T zzso zzso zzso T cells can be made zzso as part of a differentiation zzso In these zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso are both associated with the induction of the zzso zzso zzso and Scott 1991 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang et zzso 1991 Cell Growth zzso 2, zzso The current studies were therefore designed to compare the early signal zzso pathways employed by insulin and zzso to regulate zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso of protein zzso C by prolonged exposure to zzso or zzso of protein zzso C activity by treatment with the protein zzso C zzso zzso is shown not to affect zzso induction by insulin or zzso This suggests that both insulin and zzso act in a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso induction does, however, involve a G protein because zzso effect can be inhibited by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso induction of zzso is not affected by zzso zzso zzso a general zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the ability of zzso to induce zzso but it does not inhibit zzso zzso Finally, the depletion of zzso particularly zzso by zzso treatment also prevents zzso induction by insulin but zzso treatment has no effect on zzso induction by zzso These observations indicate that the zzso induction by insulin and zzso in zzso cells is zzso by different signal zzso zzso Together with our previously published data, these results suggest that zzso can be induced independent of protein zzso C zzso without involvement of zzso zzso G zzso independent of induction of zzso and without expression of high levels of zzso zzso
