To investigate the role of G proteins in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso system, we examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the abundance of cerebral cortical membrane G protein zzso in zzso Three weeks after zzso injection of zzso zzso which significantly reduced cortical zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso levels, no statistically significant differences were observed for G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha 0, G beta 1 and G beta 2 zzso levels between zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the functional zzso of zzso zzso system often observed following zzso of zzso fibers may not involve changes at the level of G proteins but may instead zzso other downstream elements of the zzso zzso signaling zzso
