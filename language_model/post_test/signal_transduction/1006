One of the key zzso of T cell zzso is zzso zzso Mice genetically deficient in zzso zzso zzso develop massive expansion of both zzso and zzso T cells as well as increased numbers of zzso zzso cells and serum zzso zzso To determine the dependence of the zzso and B cell zzso on zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso Compared to that in their zzso counterparts, expansion of zzso cells in zzso mice was markedly zzso Nonetheless, expansion of zzso cells was identical in both sets of mice, demonstrating that the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cells can zzso be zzso from those on zzso cells, and pointing to a critical zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso B cell zzso also developed in zzso mice, albeit in a manner less rapid and less intense than that in their zzso counterparts, demonstrating an underlying zzso zzso to B cell zzso and pointing to a critical zzso role for zzso in zzso B cell zzso in zzso When human zzso was introduced as a zzso into zzso mice, B cell zzso was restored to levels observed in zzso mice, pointing to a critical zzso role for zzso in zzso B cell zzso in zzso superimposed upon its zzso role on zzso B cell zzso
