zzso receptors are expressed in zzso and zzso in the adult nervous system, but why this expression persists is not zzso Here we examine the role of the zzso zzso in the zzso mouse main zzso system, and show evidence consistent with a model where zzso is required for maintaining zzso cell zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso nature of these zzso cells is zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are downstream zzso of the zzso pathway, are zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso cells is zzso zzso levels of zzso activity are also zzso These disruptions are associated with increased zzso sensory zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of zzso is also zzso This suggests the existence of a feedback loop where expression of zzso is initially independent of zzso but requires zzso for maintained zzso While the zzso zzso has previously been shown to be important for promoting zzso during development, this is the first demonstration that the persistent expression of zzso receptors is required for maintaining zzso function in zzso
