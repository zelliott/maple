zzso expression and zzso of zzso growth factor zzso 4 zzso has been linked to tumor progression and zzso drug zzso We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by zzso degradation involving zzso transition in response to zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso induction at the edge of tumors expressing the zzso risk zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso in tissue zzso from several human cancer types including breast zzso where they were partially zzso at the zzso border and tumor invasion zzso The strongest overall zzso was found in prostate zzso Studies with cultured prostate zzso cell lines showed that the zzso zzso which has previously been associated with poor cancer zzso increased zzso collagen zzso In this experimental model, zzso of zzso or zzso by zzso interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in zzso This was coupled with impaired zzso of zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso of zzso and suppression of zzso and zzso These in zzso results were substantiated by reduced zzso content and in zzso growth of prostate zzso cells after the zzso gene zzso In contrast, zzso of the alternative zzso zzso enhanced zzso and invasive tumor cell growth in zzso and within three-dimensional zzso These results will help to explain the reported association of the zzso zzso with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of zzso
