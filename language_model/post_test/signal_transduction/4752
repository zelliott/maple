In own previous work zzso mice were tested in the Multiple zzso zzso a robust land maze allowing determination of zzso to reach the goal box with food reward and to evaluate correct decisions made on the way to the goal zzso zzso zzso of these animals were used for the current study with the aim to investigate differences in protein levels between trained and zzso mice and, moreover, to determine differences in protein levels between trained and zzso mice with and without memory formation in the zzso Three training sessions were carried out for four training days each, followed by probe trials on Days 5 and zzso Good and zzso in the zzso were separated based on means and median of zzso to reach the goal box on probe trial Day zzso Six hours following the probe trial on Day 12, animals were sacrificed and zzso were zzso zzso were extracted and run on two-dimensional gel zzso spots were zzso and zzso expressed proteins were identified by mass zzso using an zzso zzso zzso of 17 proteins were significantly different in trained zzso zzso zzso Seven proteins were zzso expressed comparing trained zzso zzso mice from good and zzso A series of proteins were significantly correlated with zzso and may link these proteins to spatial memory zzso zzso protein expression in trained zzso zzso mice and in good and zzso may allow insight into spatial memory formation as well as represent tentative pharmacological zzso
