zzso zzso and zzso share the type II zzso zzso for cell zzso We show that despite expressing the necessary signaling zzso zzso cells failed to respond to either zzso or zzso This was in part because of the expression of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that inhibited zzso zzso zzso by acting as a decoy zzso In contrast, normal human zzso that did not express the zzso gene efficiently induced zzso zzso in response to both zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells inhibited not only zzso but also zzso signal zzso and zzso gene zzso The zzso was likely zzso through the physical interaction between the short zzso domain of the zzso protein and the zzso domain of the zzso chain that harbors the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso signal zzso pathways via a novel mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso
