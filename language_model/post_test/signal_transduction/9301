The accurate distribution and recycling of zzso proteins amongst the zzso zzso of the cell is vital to ensure its correct zzso zzso protein cargo destined for zzso zzso and transport along the zzso zzso is sorted into transport zzso by interactions with zzso which simultaneously link zzso to the zzso zzso zzso recognize a variety of signals present in the zzso portions of cargo zzso recent zzso zzso and cell biological studies have zzso new types of zzso interactions and zzso the molecular mechanisms regulating cargo selection and zzso zzso Here, we review this recent progress in the context of our existing knowledge of zzso sorting zzso
