The zzso region of zzso hormone zzso and zzso protein zzso interacts with a common zzso zzso in zzso These cells zzso zzso but its role in bone turnover is zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso or zzso stimulates bone growth in zzso possibly by increasing local bone zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso which does not bind to the zzso zzso appears to affect bone zzso in zzso and in zzso although its effect on bone formation in zzso remains zzso Bone zzso is an often overlooked but critical event in the process of bone zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been shown to induce gene expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso factor, by zzso zzso However, no data are available on the effect of zzso zzso on zzso expression in these zzso Using zzso reverse zzso followed by zzso we found that zzso zzso between 10 zzso and 1 zzso increased zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso This effect of this zzso at 10 zzso was zzso zzso for zzso and twofold for zzso compared to zzso within 1 to 4 zzso This effect was similar to that induced by zzso zzso in these cells, as well as in human zzso zzso cells, using Northern zzso zzso Moreover, the effect of both zzso added together at 100 zzso was not higher than that observed with each zzso alone in zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso were abolished by zzso D in zzso zzso In these cells, the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso but not the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso inhibited the increase in zzso zzso induced by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso into the medium zzso by zzso or zzso cells for 24 zzso which was zzso zzso 10 zzso 1 or 5 zzso 3 zzso respectively, and 21 zzso 1 or 11 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, medium zzso by these cells for 24 h in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso with or without 10 zzso zzso zzso increased about zzso bovine zzso zzso cell zzso growth at 48 zzso This effect was inhibited by adding a specific zzso zzso to the zzso incubation zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso a main zzso factor, in zzso cells and zzso zzso This relationship between zzso and zzso has potential implications for both bone zzso and bone formation, and zzso in zzso zzso
