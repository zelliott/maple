zzso the zzso of viruses is an attractive zzso strategy for targeting cancer zzso The Ras signal zzso zzso is a central hub for a variety of zzso events with a fundamental role in normal and zzso zzso In this work we were interested in linking Ras zzso to zzso replication in a direct manner in order to generate a novel zzso zzso virus which can target cancer zzso To establish such zzso we developed a zzso zzso in which the expression of zzso zzso cell zzso a viral protein necessary for zzso is controlled by zzso of zzso a zzso factor zzso of the Ras zzso and mainly activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso an important Ras zzso zzso This zzso zzso was named as zzso 1 zzso A series of prostate cells were infected with the zzso zzso zzso with elevated levels of zzso zzso were zzso infected by the zzso virus, as demonstrated by increased levels of viral zzso zzso zzso C and overall zzso viral protein zzso Upon exposure to zzso the zzso zzso and colony formation capabilities of prostate cancer cells with increased zzso zzso were significantly decreased zzso while the rate of zzso in these cells was zzso Additionally, high Ras signaling cells infected with zzso showed a prominent arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle as compared to cells exposed to parental zzso The results of this study reveal the potential for zzso the zzso interaction to specifically interfere with the life of cancer cells with increased Ras zzso zzso also serves as a zzso for development of a family of zzso viruses which can target cancer cells on the basis of their signaling zzso
