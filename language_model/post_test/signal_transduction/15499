The zzso zzso system recognizes and discriminates between thousands of structurally diverse zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is zzso by zzso receptors zzso which comprise the largest zzso of G zzso receptors zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso couple to G zzso resulting in an increase in zzso zzso levels and subsequent zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss recently published studies outlining the molecular basis of odor discrimination, focusing on zzso G protein zzso and zzso of zzso A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying OR activity may help in the discovery of zzso and zzso of zzso and of zzso with potential therapeutic zzso
