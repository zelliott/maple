In signal zzso of zzso cells, zzso channels of the family of transient zzso potential zzso have been identified to respond to diverse external and internal zzso amongst them zzso zzso This report highlights findings pertaining to the zzso zzso focusing on zzso zzso Of the six zzso zzso channels, zzso 2 and 4 were demonstrated to function in zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels have been found to function in cellular as well as systemic zzso zzso In a striking example of evolutionary conservation of function, zzso zzso has been found to rescue zzso deficits of the zzso zzso strain zzso in zzso zzso despite not more than zzso zzso of the respective zzso
