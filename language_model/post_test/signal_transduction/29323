zzso zzso exerts both short-term and long-term effects in the zzso by stimulating zzso zzso zzso Here we have examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso a zzso cell zzso zzso involved in many zzso including zzso and zzso zzso When primary cultures of rat cortical zzso were treated with zzso zzso protein expression increased in a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso treatment caused an increase in zzso zzso in both the zzso and on the cell surface zzso Interestingly, experiments with zzso revealed that zzso of zzso to the cell surface membrane were independent of protein zzso The zzso increase in zzso protein expression was blocked by zzso blue 2 and zzso suggesting involvement of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was partially blocked when signaling from zzso receptors to zzso signal regulated protein zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso By using an in zzso model of traumatic zzso injury, we found that zzso expression was increased when zzso were subjected to rapid and zzso mechanical zzso The findings presented here demonstrate a role for zzso zzso zzso receptors and protein zzso signaling in regulating zzso expression and suggest a role for this mechanism in zzso zzso
