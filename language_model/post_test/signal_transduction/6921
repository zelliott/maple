zzso plant development is strongly dependent on nitrogen availability in the soil and on the efficiency of its recruitment by zzso For this reason, the understanding of the molecular events underlying root adaptation to nitrogen fluctuations is a primary goal to develop zzso tools for sustainable zzso However, knowledge about molecular responses to nitrogen availability is derived mainly from the study of model zzso zzso oxide zzso has been recently proposed to be implicated in plant responses to environmental zzso but its exact role in the response of plants to nutritional stress is still under zzso In this work, the role of NO production by zzso roots after nitrate perception was investigated by focusing on the regulation of zzso of genes involved in NO zzso and by measuring NO production in zzso Moreover, its involvement in the root growth response to nitrate was also zzso The results provide evidence that NO is produced by nitrate zzso as an early response to nitrate supply and that the coordinated induction of zzso zzso zzso could finely regulate the NO steady zzso This mechanism seems to be implicated on the zzso of the root zzso in response to nitrate zzso Moreover, an improved zzso system for growing zzso zzso was zzso This system, which allows localized treatments to be performed on specific root portions, gave the opportunity to discern between localized and systemic effects of nitrate supply to zzso
