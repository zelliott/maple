The molecular mechanisms by which gastric acid causes zzso injury in the stomach and zzso an inflammatory reaction are poorly zzso We aimed in the present study to investigate the role of the early growth response gene zzso and zzso in gastric zzso cells following acid exposure, and the signaling pathways zzso Western zzso was used to assess zzso protein levels in zzso zzso A quantitative measurement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed using a high content analysis zzso zzso functionality was assessed by transient zzso with zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso conditions induced zzso protein expression in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly increased as the pH was reduced from pH zzso to zzso High content analysis of zzso zzso showed zzso zzso nuclear zzso a maximum observed at 1-2 h followed by a decline to zzso levels beyond 4 zzso zzso pH also activated zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocked both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, acid exposure zzso zzso zzso which was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso Our results also demonstrate that exposure to acid zzso zzso via zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso might play a crucial role in gastric zzso inflammation and associated zzso zzso
