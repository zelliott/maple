Little is known about global gene expression patterns in the human neurodegenerative disease zzso lateral sclerosis zzso To address this, we used zzso zzso zzso technology to compare expression levels of approximately zzso genes in zzso spinal zzso gray matter obtained from individuals with ALS as well as normal zzso Using Fisher zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso we discerned an zzso zzso Moreover, it was possible to distinguish familial ALS zzso from sporadic ALS zzso gene expression zzso zzso of the specific genes significantly altered in ALS uncovered a zzso terminal zzso Moreover, we found zzso in genes involved in zzso function, zzso stress, zzso zzso zzso architecture, zzso zzso and translation, zzso function, and growth and zzso It is apparent from this study that DNA zzso analysis and appropriate zzso can reveal distinct zzso changes that zzso the terminal stages of zzso in zzso
