Ras zzso is common to many human zzso and promotes cell proliferation and survival by initiating multiple signaling zzso zzso zzso cells are generally considered too resourceful to become addicted to a single zzso In contrast to this tenet, we now demonstrate an absolute, cell autonomous requirement for zzso in the development and maintenance of zzso skin zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso inhibitor dimming the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in the context of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the zzso of zzso and zzso expression and promotes zzso in zzso zzso These data link the zzso complex to zzso zzso and delineate a zzso crucial for cell fate decision in zzso zzso
