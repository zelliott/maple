Current treatments for zzso zzso are not zzso zzso Among new agents, zzso seems to play a pivotal role in the regulation of several cell pathways involved in the development of zzso After results were obtained with clinical trials, we aimed to observe treatment with zzso in everyday clinical zzso We performed a zzso retrospective analysis to assess the efficacy of zzso in heavily zzso zzso number of previous therapies 4, range zzso zzso patients in an zzso zzso zzso therapy was scheduled for 4-6 cycles zzso zzso Data from 50 patients were zzso zzso had a complete zzso zzso obtained a partial response and the remaining zzso was zzso According to zzso we observed an overall response rate zzso of zzso in mantle cell zzso an zzso of zzso among zzso zzso patients, and an zzso of 50% in the zzso zzso zzso None of diffuse large zzso zzso patients obtained a zzso zzso toxicity was really mild, and peripheral zzso occurred in only 5 zzso zzso toxicity was grades zzso zzso in nine patients and grades zzso zzso in only three zzso In conclusion, treatment with zzso as single agent resulted safe and effective in a subset of heavily zzso zzso patients with usually poor zzso New future hypotheses of investigation are zzso
