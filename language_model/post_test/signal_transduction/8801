The zzso is a zzso stage in the malaria life cycle which forms in the zzso blood meal from the zzso zzso use an zzso motor to glide towards and penetrate the zzso wall to establish infection in the zzso The regulation of gliding zzso is poorly zzso Through genetic interaction studies we here describe a zzso module that identifies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an important second zzso regulating zzso differentiation and zzso In zzso lacking the zzso zzso degrading zzso delta zzso zzso zzso through zzso results in zzso up of the normally zzso zzso This zzso is suppressed in a double zzso additionally lacking zzso zzso beta zzso showing that in zzso zzso is an important source for zzso and that zzso is the relevant zzso degrading zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso blocks zzso whereas enhanced zzso through zzso restores normal gliding speed in a zzso lacking calcium dependent protein zzso 3, suggesting at least a partial overlap between calcium and zzso dependent zzso These data demonstrate an important function for zzso through zzso and most likely zzso in zzso regulating zzso gliding during the transmission of malaria to the zzso
