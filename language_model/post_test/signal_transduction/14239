zzso a tumor zzso in several types of zzso has been suggested to be an nuclear factor zzso B zzso target zzso conversely, the zzso activity of zzso is required for zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is activated in a zzso zzso zzso that causes human zzso zzso tissue zzso is known to be essential for zzso zzso in B zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in B zzso upon zzso zzso engagement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells indicate that zzso can activate the zzso promoter, which contains zzso zzso We also construct a theoretical structure of mouse zzso and analyze the structure by molecular modeling and molecular dynamics zzso Lastly, we found that marginal zone B cells from zzso mice zzso more readily than zzso B cells, zzso surprisingly, the transgenic zzso B cells from these mice zzso comparably to zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is an essential regulator of zzso gene expression and zzso proliferation zzso by zzso zzso zzso
