Previous studies showed that zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso by reducing both zzso and zzso zzso Although a high affinity binding site for zzso was identified on cardiac zzso the molecular mechanisms activated by the zzso hormone were not zzso We isolated cardiac zzso from zzso rat hearts to investigate signaling pathways activated by zzso that participate in zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso incorporation into cardiac zzso zzso with serum or the zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso hormone decreases DNA, protein and collagen zzso The reduction in DNA synthesis by zzso was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso showing specificity of the zzso Treatment of cardiac zzso with zzso reduced the zzso zzso or zzso increase in zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso hormone increases zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cardiac zzso with zzso increased zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso blocked the increase in both zzso suggesting that the zzso hormone alters the concentration and the balance between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso in maintaining cardiac zzso by reducing proliferation and collagen production by cardiac zzso in association with zzso of zzso to reduce zzso zzso activities and zzso of the synthesis of zzso zzso Increased zzso or agents that enhance production of the zzso hormone may prevent abnormal zzso that occurs during cardiac zzso
