zzso a zzso finger zzso is proposed to participate in zzso differentiation through interactions with the zzso zzso family of zzso factors and mediate zzso zzso signaling zzso These activities are associated with distinct zzso of the zzso zinc finger zzso zzso zzso zzso expression arrests zzso sensory zzso zzso at an immature state and alters zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism remains zzso We show here that zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice that selectively zzso zzso interaction while retaining other activities, exhibits apparently normal zzso zzso Additionally, interfering with potential zzso signaling pathways by zzso zzso expression in adult mice does not alter the zzso lineage or differentiation zzso Our results indicate that zzso processes are essential for the differentiation of zzso and the establishment of a mature zzso zzso signaling zzso if they are active in normal adult zzso zzso may play a minor role in this zzso
