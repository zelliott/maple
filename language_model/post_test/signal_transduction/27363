zzso and blue light stimulate zzso of key zzso zzso genes in a range of higher zzso Here, we provide evidence that several distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways regulate zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and transcript zzso in zzso leaf zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed that separate zzso pathways mediate responses to zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso light induction of zzso expression involved the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and blue light each act zzso with zzso to stimulate zzso transcript zzso and zzso activity driven by a zzso promoter in transgenic leaf zzso The zzso and blue zzso pathways responsible for zzso are distinct because they produce transient and relatively stable signals, respectively, and can function zzso to stimulate zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso retains the synergistic interactions between zzso and both zzso and blue light, indicating that neither zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso Our findings reveal considerable complexity in both zzso and signal zzso in regulating zzso gene expression by zzso and blue zzso
