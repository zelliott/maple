The zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso to pattern a field of cells in animal zzso Previous studies in zzso have demonstrated that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso movement across receiving zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso movement is poorly zzso We show that zzso and zzso zzso two zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, are the zzso of zzso and are essential for zzso zzso We show that zzso lacking zzso activity exhibit defects in zzso distribution and its subsequent zzso However, both zzso and zzso are involved and are functionally redundant in zzso movement during wing zzso We further demonstrate that zzso movement in its receiving cells is regulated by a zzso mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso We propose that zzso transfer zzso along the cell membrane to pattern a field of zzso
