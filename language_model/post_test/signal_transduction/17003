zzso do not yield direct evidence for functional connections between zzso However, zzso factors zzso and their binding sites zzso in promoters are important for inducing and zzso changes in zzso levels, and thus represent the first layer of functional zzso Similar to zzso zzso act only in context, which is why a zzso promoter analysis of genes needs to be done in the form of zzso networks, not individual zzso or zzso In addition, integration of the literature and various databases zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the adding of genes relevant for the functional context of the data even if they were initially missed by the zzso as their zzso levels did not change zzso Here, we outline a zzso network-based strategy to assess the involvement of zzso factors in zzso signaling and demonstrate its utility in deciphering the response of human zzso zzso cells zzso to leukemia zzso factor zzso Our strategy identified a central core of eight zzso of which only zzso had previously been definitively linked to zzso in zzso zzso We also found potential molecular mechanisms of gene regulation in zzso upon stimulation with zzso that allow for the prediction of changes of genes not used in the zzso Our approach, which is readily zzso to a wide variety of expression zzso and next generation sequencing zzso results, illustrates the power of a zzso networking approach for zzso of the underlying zzso
