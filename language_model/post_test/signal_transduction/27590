zzso (or proteins from the zzso 4 zzso zzso form membrane complexes with zzso receptors and are implicated in zzso cell zzso Here we characterized cellular zzso structural zzso and signaling properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso within zzso structures that are particularly abundant at the cell zzso zzso extraction in conjunction with chemical zzso indicated that the cell surface fraction of zzso protein complexes may not be directly linked to the zzso However, in cells treated with zzso B zzso protein complexes are relocated into zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso plays an important role in the distribution of zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso are partially zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso is not detected within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to the immobilized zzso zzso induced zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso in cells attached to collagen enhanced zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells affected zzso zzso zzso of zzso that correlated with the reorganization of the cortical zzso zzso These results show that zzso can zzso zzso zzso and point to a mechanism by which zzso proteins regulate cell zzso
