In most cell types, zzso and zzso are tightly coupled such that zzso occurs only once per cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso divides using an zzso zzso ring and is an attractive model for the study of the links between zzso and zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso initiation network zzso a zzso pole body zzso zzso signaling zzso function zzso to ensure proper coordination of zzso and zzso Here, we find a novel interplay between the zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso that appears to not involve other zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso led to an increase in the presence of zzso cells, which correlated with a zzso in zzso ring maintenance and zzso of the zzso component protein zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso indicative of defective zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso function led to increased zzso zzso characterized by the persistent zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso and assembly of multiple zzso rings and division zzso zzso appears to function independently of the checkpoint with zzso and ring finger zzso protein zzso a known inhibitor of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses established that zzso might influence the zzso state of zzso zzso a key regulator of the zzso We propose that zzso by zzso the zzso after cell division, prevents further deleterious zzso events, thereby contributing to zzso zzso
