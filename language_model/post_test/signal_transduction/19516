zzso zzso regulates zzso differentiation and zzso formation via zzso autonomous mechanisms that are incompletely zzso This study shows that zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso caused zzso zzso focal detachment from the underlying zzso and hair zzso In addition, there was zzso zzso of T zzso and zzso cells, some of which zzso to the zzso at the zzso zzso The T cell zzso was responsible for hair zzso but not for other zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were heterogeneous, expressing markers of neural zzso zzso smooth muscle and peripheral zzso Although zzso expression was expanded in the zzso the zzso cells did not arise through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of jagged 1 in both zzso and zzso When zzso was activated in the absence of zzso jagged 1, jagged 1 was not zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso of T cells and zzso cells were zzso Gene expression profiling revealed that zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of several growth factors and zzso including zzso the expression of which was dependent on zzso jagged zzso We conclude that jagged 1 is a key zzso of zzso autonomous zzso zzso in zzso
