zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that play important roles in the development of the nervous system and other zzso Human zzso are also involved in a number of pathological situations, such as cancer and zzso zzso exert their effects by zzso receptors of the zzso zzso family, which resemble cell zzso molecules in their zzso and have large, mainly zzso zzso zzso HS zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso The hallmark of zzso proteins is a tandem of four zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediate binding to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A major question is how zzso binding is translated into the recruitment of zzso molecules to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that the second zzso domain of zzso zzso binds to the first two zzso zzso of zzso and that HS serves to stabilize the zzso interaction and is required for biological activity of zzso zzso Very recently, the crystal structure of a minimal zzso complex revealed that the zzso domain of zzso is bound by the zzso face of zzso zzso confirming earlier zzso zzso To define the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso these structural insights will have to be zzso by new cell biology and zzso zzso
