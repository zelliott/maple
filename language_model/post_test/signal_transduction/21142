WW zzso are zzso protein motifs of zzso zzso acids found in a broad spectrum of zzso They mediate zzso interactions by binding zzso zzso in zzso A 10 zzso acid zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso is bound in zzso by both the WW domain of the zzso protein 11 zzso and the zzso domain of zzso To explore whether the zzso WW domain and zzso zzso domain bind to similar zzso we screened a mouse limb bud expression library for putative zzso of the zzso WW zzso In so doing, we identified eight zzso zzso through zzso each of which contains a zzso region or zzso zzso sequence comparisons of the zzso revealed a zzso motif of 10 zzso acids that acts as a modular sequence binding the zzso WW domain, but not the WW domain of the putative signal zzso factor, zzso Interestingly, the consensus zzso for the zzso WW domain contains zzso that are also required for binding by the zzso zzso zzso These findings support the notion that the zzso WW domain and the zzso zzso domain can compete for the same zzso zzso and suggest that at least two zzso of WW zzso exist, namely those that bind a zzso zzso and those that bind a zzso zzso
