The recent identification of several novel zzso compartments has challenged our current understanding of the zzso and functional organization of the zzso zzso Using quantitative single zzso imaging and acute manipulation of zzso we show that zzso zzso which participate in growth factor zzso trafficking and zzso represent an early zzso intermediate common to a subset of zzso derived zzso zzso and zzso Most zzso zzso are precursors of classical zzso positive zzso and zzso plays a critical role in promoting this zzso zzso of zzso causes a striking zzso of zzso positive zzso to the zzso stage, and results in enhanced growth factor zzso These findings reveal a surprising plasticity of the early zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a switch to zzso regulate maturation and signaling of zzso zzso
