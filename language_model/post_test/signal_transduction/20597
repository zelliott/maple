The effects of human Wharton's zzso zzso zzso cells zzso on acute and chronic kidney injury induced by zzso injury zzso were zzso 

zzso were injected zzso immediately after solitary kidney zzso for 45 zzso zzso were labeled with zzso zzso for tracing in zzso At 48 h zzso serum zzso and blood zzso nitrogen zzso were zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso signal were identified by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was employed to determine gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso of human zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-two weeks later, zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso collagen content and zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso 

There was no sign of labeled cells residing in the damaged zzso Acute zzso dysfunction zzso by zzso was considerably improved by zzso in parallel with a stronger zzso response and less zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso in injured zzso cells was substantially zzso Cell treatment also caused a remarkable zzso of kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso was detected in cell zzso and the serum of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was zzso by cell therapy, zzso with function zzso 

zzso alleviate acute kidney injury, thereby rescuing the ensuing zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso signal in impaired zzso cells is reinforced by zzso zzso cell resistance to zzso and cell zzso zzso either delivered or induced by zzso is an important zzso
