zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the formation of various tumors in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Several genes have been shown to be activated in zzso cells, but the underlying mechanisms have only been partially zzso Among the genes regulated by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene seems to be of primary importance for the development of the transformed zzso We have found that the zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso cells derived from a zzso expressing zzso zzso cells show negligible levels of zzso zzso but its expression was highly induced by infecting with a zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using a zzso gene construct and a zzso expression zzso showed that high zzso zzso levels are due to increased zzso promoter zzso zzso of various signaling molecules by transient zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso established that a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is activated by zzso in zzso cells, resulting in the zzso of the zzso gene promoter via zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells zzso gene induction is only partially dependent on this pathway, suggesting the involvement of additional signaling molecules in zzso zzso
