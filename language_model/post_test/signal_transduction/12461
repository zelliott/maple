The DNA damage checkpoint is a stress response zzso detecting pathological structures of nuclear DNA and inducing appropriate zzso These responses include cell cycle arrests, zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso and zzso modifications of proteins involved in DNA zzso zzso of the DNA damage checkpoint responses can occur under two circumstances: either DNA damage has disappeared and the whole zzso is zzso in a process termed recovery, or DNA damage persists but all or part of the zzso is nevertheless zzso which is called zzso We present here a review of these zzso processes of the DNA damage checkpoint primarily in the budding zzso zzso zzso but also with reference to studies in zzso zzso and in animal zzso
