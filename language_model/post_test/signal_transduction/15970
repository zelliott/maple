zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of multiple growth factors on the cell surface and zzso zzso However, it remains unclear how the HS chains control the movement and reception of growth factors into targeted receiving cells during zzso zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso fail to respond to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso expression analyses revealed that cell zzso HS chains are crucial for local retention of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Fine zzso studies with zzso resolution and expression studies with specific zzso for HS movement demonstrated that zzso zzso of HS chains can spread zzso signaling to adjacent cells within a short zzso Together, the results show that zzso expression of cell zzso HS chains regulate the local reception of zzso activity during zzso zzso
