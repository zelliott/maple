Depression has been zzso as a disorder driven by zzso pathways and zzso and zzso zzso These factors couple to the induction of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso damage to zzso increases zzso responses, changing the nature of the neural zzso of zzso depression, which leads to zzso and drives treatment zzso A number of zzso zzso are linked to these zzso Here, we focus on the role of zzso zzso in depression and its associated disorders; we highlight the progress made since the first paper showing increased zzso levels was published 20 years ago by zzso and zzso When coupled with increased levels of the soluble zzso zzso in depression, higher levels of zzso may indicate increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling occurs in cells not normally expressing the zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso is intimately associated with two crucial aspects of depression, as well as central inflammation more zzso First, the regulation of the local inflammatory response via its interactions with zzso and zzso zzso production is coupled to local zzso zzso via zzso zzso protein 2 zzso Second, the more systemic regulation of zzso availability occurs via the zzso induction of zzso zzso to its role in the regulation of zzso associated zzso 17 cells and zzso production, zzso has wide and differential impacts on processes driving depression and a wider range of psychiatric and neurodegenerative zzso
