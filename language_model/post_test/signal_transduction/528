zzso zzso after zzso coronary intervention zzso is a major clinical zzso However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly zzso The present aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that zzso oxygen species zzso enhance zzso zzso expression and increase zzso zzso zzso activity zzso major factors that contribute to zzso in zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured rat zzso zzso were exposed to different zzso zzso 50 and 100 zzso of zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso The activity of zzso was determined by gelatin zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso was enhanced by zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso at all zzso tested (which are comparable to those seen in diabetic vascular zzso significantly increased zzso activity in zzso zzso Because vascular zzso production is significantly increased in patients with zzso disease and zzso and zzso have been shown to play critical role in zzso the results of the present study strongly suggest that a zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in accelerated zzso after zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso the zzso system may be a new therapeutic target in reducing zzso in patients undergoing zzso
