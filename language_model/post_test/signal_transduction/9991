zzso specifically zzso expression of the zzso zzso in peripheral T cells through zzso of zzso However, how zzso mediates zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we examined the zzso relationship between zzso signaling and zzso induction during zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs within minutes of zzso zzso zzso engagement and this zzso is sustained for at least 48 h following zzso zzso We used zzso inhibitor zzso to prevent the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso family zzso We demonstrate that zzso blocked the later, sustained zzso zzso but did not affect the initial zzso of zzso Using zzso approaches, as well as zzso zzso we show that the zzso domain of zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso and competes with zzso leading to retention of zzso in the zzso Additionally, we show that zzso can directly regulate zzso expression through complexes formed on the zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that there are two zzso of zzso zzso an initial, zzso phase, and a later, sustained zzso of zzso which is zzso zzso
