The zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in the migration, zzso and differentiation of neural crest zzso zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso type B zzso cause three zzso zzso pigmented disorder and hearing zzso In addition, the zzso zzso mice show abnormal zzso zzso with zzso In this study, we examined whether similar zzso are reproduced in three zzso rat strains that we established zzso zzso strain showed a low white blood cell count, significant size reduction and abnormal zzso of zzso zzso displayed a marked reduction in the size, but maintained a normal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was reduced to zzso zzso and zzso B and T cell numbers were reduced, showing a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso rats in the zzso and zzso genetic background did not show these zzso These data show that proper T and B cell development is dependent on the zzso signaling pathway, however, modifier zzso might be zzso expressed in these strain to zzso or compensate for the effect of the zzso zzso
