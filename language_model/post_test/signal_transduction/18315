The zzso on zzso can serve as a signaling unit during cell zzso and zzso and to further clarify this important property we investigated the possible mechanisms of zzso zzso of zzso zzso It has previously been demonstrated that zzso of zzso activates zzso by a zzso zzso pathway, and here we show that active zzso interacts with its downstream target, zzso zzso zzso of zzso also activates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and causes them to associate with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest a mechanism zzso zzso and zzso are directly involved in the zzso of zzso zzso No zzso between zzso and zzso could be zzso hence these zzso probably trigger independent but parallel signals to zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso activity was monitored as the zzso of protein zzso B zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was abolished by zzso and zzso but not by using zzso zzso zzso to abrogate the influence of zzso zzso Thus, even if zzso zzso is not activated by zzso it can maintain full zzso activity due to the mentioned interaction with zzso or zzso These zzso zzso apparently activate similar pathways that operate in parallel and therefore have the potential to substitute for each other in zzso zzso and regulating cell zzso
