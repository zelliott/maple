During early zzso development, members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso family play important roles in a variety of zzso including germ layer zzso zzso cell zzso migration, and zzso The activities of zzso need to be tightly controlled to ensure their function at the right time and zzso Despite identification of multiple regulators of Bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso class of zzso zzso are zzso and include zzso zzso and zzso Recently, a membrane zzso zzso zzso originally named zzso was isolated and found to contain two zzso zzso in addition to an zzso Growth Factor zzso domain, suggesting that zzso may participate in regulation of zzso zzso Here, we show that, unlike zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso in zzso Interestingly, both the zzso zzso and the zzso motif contribute to zzso zzso A soluble protein containing the zzso and the zzso zzso however, is not sufficient for zzso zzso the location of zzso at the membrane is essential for its zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso through a novel zzso zzso also blocks zzso but not zzso induction by zzso Unlike zzso zzso regulation of zzso activities by zzso requires the latter's zzso tail, while deletion of either the zzso zzso or the zzso motif does not interfere with the zzso zzso function of zzso These results imply that zzso may employ different mechanisms in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso is expressed from zzso stages zzso and is enriched in neural tissue zzso This expression pattern suggests that zzso may zzso zzso and zzso activities during neural zzso In zzso our data demonstrate that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso and zzso signaling during early zzso zzso
