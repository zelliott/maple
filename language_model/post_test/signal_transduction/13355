zzso a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major binding protein of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Its signaling mechanism remains largely zzso We report here an important regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling zzso that mediates zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso cells induced rapid zzso zzso of zzso and its association with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was also zzso associated with zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain or a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso binding sites resulted in significant reductions in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that enforced expression of zzso zzso molecules dramatically reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Furthermore, zzso of primary zzso zzso cells from viable zzso mice with these zzso zzso molecules also significantly ameliorated their enhanced migration capacity associated with the zzso gene zzso Taken together, these results suggest an important signaling role for zzso in regulating zzso cell zzso and zzso
