zzso and zzso immunity are the major zzso mechanisms of higher organisms against inherent and environmental zzso zzso immunity is present already in zzso organisms but evolution has added novel zzso immune mechanisms to the zzso zzso Interestingly, during aging, zzso immunity significantly declines, a phenomenon called zzso whereas innate immunity seems to be activated which zzso a characteristic zzso zzso This process is called zzso The recognition and signaling mechanisms involved in innate immunity have been zzso during zzso The master regulator of the innate immunity is the zzso system, an ancient signaling zzso found in both insects and zzso The zzso system is in the zzso point linking together the zzso assault signals and cellular danger signals and then organizing the cellular zzso Recent studies have revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the key regulators of aging in budding zzso and zzso zzso models, regulate the efficiency of zzso signaling and the level of inflammatory zzso We will review the role of innate immunity signaling in the aging process and examine the function of zzso system in the organization of zzso mechanisms and in addition, its interactions with the protein products of several zzso Our conclusion is that zzso signaling seems to be the culprit of zzso since this signaling system zzso the zzso regulation of immune responses in both aging and age-related zzso
