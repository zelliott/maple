zzso zzso a key event for successful zzso is critically controlled by zzso cell proliferation and zzso One hallmark event of zzso is the acquisition of zzso cell zzso through terminal differentiation at the zzso pole of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulated zzso zzso factor, is highly expressed in zzso zzso cells, and targeted deletion of zzso in mice shows severe zzso zzso primarily due to reduced zzso cell responsiveness to zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which zzso regulates this process remains largely zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso diminished core cell cycle activity during zzso cell proliferation without disturbing zzso suggesting that these events depend on local regulators that impact cell cycle zzso To further address this question, we compared global gene expression profiles in zzso of zzso and zzso mice after inducing zzso Our studies show two major aspects of zzso downstream of zzso First, zzso zzso results in the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth differentiation factor 10 zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso Second, zzso zzso compromises natural killer zzso cell differentiation without altering trafficking of zzso precursor cells during zzso zzso the results provide evidence that zzso influences a host of genes and cell functions necessary for zzso normal zzso development during the zzso zzso
