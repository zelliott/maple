zzso of zzso zzso has become part of the standard approach to studying gene function during development of the sea zzso The method is simple and reliable, protocols for the preparation of synthetic zzso are well zzso and the technique to transfer them into eggs is zzso The protein zzso by these zzso can be designed to address a variety of biological questions and their DNA zzso are easily constructed by standard molecular biology zzso The method aims to simulate gain or loss of gene function, and the zzso obtained are characterized using an increasing number of molecular zzso With the completion of the zzso zzso zzso project, the complete set of genes from the sea zzso will become zzso zzso of zzso will be an invaluable tool to study the function of newly identified genes and their protein products and to determine their positions within the networks of gene and protein interactions that control zzso
