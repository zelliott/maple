zzso zzso zzso zzso is a short woody shrub widely found in semi-arid areas of China, and can survive severe environmental zzso To understand its potential signaling zzso zzso in stress zzso we investigated the participation of zzso protein zzso zzso as possible zzso of zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a 374 zzso acid protein was isolated from zzso zzso zzso belongs to the C1 zzso which is still functionally zzso compared to groups A and zzso and contains all 11 of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso leaf and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The transcripts of zzso were rapidly accumulated at high levels when zzso zzso was subjected to dehydration, zzso conditions and treatment with zzso acid or hydrogen zzso Growth analysis of zzso coli zzso cells transformed with zzso showed that the expression products of zzso do not act as an zzso But, the zzso of zzso expression by the inhibitor zzso induced a decrease of zzso zzso activity under zzso indicating that zzso is involved in the regulation of the zzso defense system in the response to stress zzso
