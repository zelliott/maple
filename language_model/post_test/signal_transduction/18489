zzso zzso factor zzso is a member of the nerve growth factor family of zzso and plays a vital role in synaptic zzso This study investigated the involvement of the zzso zzso system in molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and zzso zzso Male Sprague zzso rats were zzso targeting central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was manipulated using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso behaviors were measured after infusion of zzso sense and zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso using the elevated zzso test and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso infusions into the zzso and zzso but not zzso provoked zzso behaviors in rats, which were rescued by zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were decreased by zzso zzso but not by sense, zzso zzso which were restored to normal after zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso infusions into the zzso or zzso but not into zzso increased alcohol zzso which was attenuated by zzso zzso These novel results suggest that decreased zzso levels in the zzso and zzso but not in the zzso are crucial in regulating zzso and zzso behaviors in zzso
