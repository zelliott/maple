Clinical studies suggest that an imbalance in the actions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is associated with invasion of tumors of zzso zzso Both zzso have been detected in the zzso zzso zzso Our previous study together with other reports suggests that an imbalance between zzso and zzso contributes to the zzso and biological behavior of PA including zzso However, the roles of the two zzso in zzso of PA have not been zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in 41 cases of zzso PA zzso were determined to evaluate whether zzso were related to the zzso of zzso Furthermore, we aimed by analysis of the correlation between zzso and zzso or zzso to understand molecular mechanisms related to zzso 

zzso zzso and Western zzso were zzso 

Nuclear zzso zzso was significantly stronger in invasive zzso than zzso ones zzso zzso zzso In contrast, nuclear zzso zzso was significantly weaker in invasive zzso than in zzso ones zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and protein were decreased in invasive zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a zzso of zzso was significantly increased in invasive over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were significant correlations between zzso and zzso or zzso in zzso in which zzso was positively correlated with zzso and zzso correlated with zzso whereas zzso was positively correlated with zzso and zzso correlated with zzso 

zzso and zzso may act in opposite directions to regulate the zzso zzso and to affect zzso of zzso
