zzso muscles in the limb and body trunk are composed of zzso zzso expressing different zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso including type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fast, zzso While the contraction force and speed of a muscle are known to be determined by the relative abundance of zzso expressing each zzso zzso it is unclear how specific combinations of zzso types are formed and regulated at the cellular and molecular zzso We report here that myostatin zzso positively regulates slow but zzso regulates fast zzso zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels in the fast muscle zzso and zzso than in the slow muscle zzso Interestingly, zzso knockout led to a shift of zzso towards faster zzso suggesting an zzso role of zzso in fast zzso zzso zzso when induced to zzso zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso expressing fast zzso zzso treatment of zzso with a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but zzso zzso gene expression in newly formed zzso zzso both zzso zzso and soluble zzso type zzso zzso inhibited slow zzso and promoted fast zzso zzso indicating that myostatin acts through zzso zzso zzso to regulate the expression of zzso zzso These results demonstrate a role of myostatin in the zzso of zzso types during zzso zzso
