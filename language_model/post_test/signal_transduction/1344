In just a few years, the discovery and subsequent characterization of several members of the zzso family of zzso channels have provided us with surprising new insights into unknown aspects of cellular zzso zzso This includes reports about zzso functioning as a novel zzso second zzso and gating zzso of the zzso zzso channel, studies demonstrating the central role of mouse zzso in taste zzso as well as the unexpected involvement of zzso and zzso in regulating zzso or the cool properties of zzso acting as a cold and zzso sensor in sensory zzso At least four of the eight known zzso proteins have been shown to be present in the immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although we currently lack animal models allowing a detailed assessment of the potential involvement of zzso family members in modulating the immune response, the powerful combination of molecular and cellular biology, zzso and zzso have provided the first clues as to how these molecules could contribute to zzso
