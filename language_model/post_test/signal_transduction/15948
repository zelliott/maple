zzso zzso zzso losses have been extensively demonstrated for the zzso zzso zzso zzso little is known about adult age changes regarding D1 zzso In this study, we demonstrate marked age-related D1 zzso losses in zzso zzso and cortical areas using zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso correlations of binding potential zzso values were high for areas within zzso pathways in younger and elderly adults zzso Furthermore, zzso correlations in D1 zzso between zzso pathways were zzso high in younger adults, indicating that D1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso and cortical areas are not regulated zzso despite zzso zzso from different zzso zzso For elderly adults, zzso correlations of D1 zzso zzso were preserved only between zzso and zzso areas, whereas zzso zzso were zzso related to those in zzso and zzso zzso zzso weak zzso correlations in elderly adults were found only for the slower half of the sample when zzso was estimated during a cognitive interference zzso These results suggest that D1 zzso zzso in different pathways are not regulated independently in younger adults, but segregate in older age, and that this segregation of D1 zzso systems may be related to age-related cognitive zzso
