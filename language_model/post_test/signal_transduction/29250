Signaling by zzso protein zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso However, it has not been determined how zzso signaling leads to changes in zzso and specific proteins responsible for these changes have not yet been identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected a zzso protein with a relative molecular weight of 270,000 zzso which was zzso within 1 zzso after incubation in a medium supporting zzso zzso of zzso was induced by zzso or a zzso zzso but was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating that zzso is likely a zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso by zzso associated with an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is the major zzso sheath protein of zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred in zzso lacking zzso suggesting that zzso is not involved directly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was enriched in zzso zzso tails and appeared to be present in multiple compartments including a zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso within 1 zzso of incubation under zzso conditions suggests that this protein may have an important role in the initial signaling events that lead to the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso
