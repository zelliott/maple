The diversity of cellular zzso functions is attained by the zzso of zzso zzso complexes, which initiate the zzso of zzso zzso into a zzso zzso filament at defined zzso zzso Next to zzso functions at the cell zzso including different forms of membrane zzso and zzso zzso dynamics at zzso zzso has recently become a research zzso zzso addressing the zzso zzso zzso domain containing zzso zzso have provided novel zzso insights into the function of zzso dynamics at zzso zzso zzso proteins are targeted by a modified zzso zinc finger motif toward zzso and zzso zzso where they interact and cooperate with the distinct zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso in the nucleation of zzso zzso The function of the zzso zzso zzso complex is closely related to the zzso small G zzso which is a key regulator of recycling and zzso transport zzso Together with the zzso motor protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso filaments mediate zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and mouse genetic studies as well as cell biology experiments point toward an important role of the zzso complex in zzso maturation and in the structure and signaling of the nervous zzso
