The remarkable discovery of the zzso receptors zzso over the past 5 years has opened up an entirely new era in the understanding of the molecular events that initiate the inflammatory zzso These type 1 zzso receptors are expressed on a large number of immune cells as well as zzso cells and play an essential role in the zzso of the innate immune response to microbial zzso They impact on zzso immune reactions and contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory response to a multitude of potential microbial pathogens through recognition of zzso molecular zzso zzso also interact with a variety of zzso human zzso and influence the activity of a wide range of zzso and cell zzso Among the common and important processes in which zzso play a role are zzso acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac zzso coronary artery disease, zzso zzso vascular collapse, inflammatory zzso disease, acute zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis, zzso birth, zzso cancer zzso and transplant zzso From this zzso diverse list, many important opportunities for disease modification through zzso manipulation can be zzso Their role as potential targets for therapeutic intervention is just beginning to be zzso and the current status of these treatment strategies is reviewed in this zzso
