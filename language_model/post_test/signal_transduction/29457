zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to inhibit cardiac zzso However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso We investigated the regulation by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso production and cell growth in cardiac zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and cell growth were assessed in zzso rat cardiac zzso cardiac zzso and zzso production was examined in zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso cell proliferation and expression of zzso collagen zzso collagen zzso and zzso An accompanying increase in zzso expression and zzso was also zzso These zzso effects were attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso inhibited in part the expression and zzso of zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II infusion in rats markedly increased left zzso production of zzso collagen and zzso with a concurrent increase in the ratios of heart zzso weight and left zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso significantly decreased these levels and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso suppress zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso probably via interactions between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso and its zzso may have potential applications in preventing cardiac zzso
