zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are essential for diverse biological zzso However, the function of zzso signaling in zzso development remains to be identified, despite the preferential expression of zzso and zzso within developing blood and zzso zzso cells in zzso In this report, we aim to delineate the functions of zzso signaling during zzso zzso 

We investigated the functions of zzso signaling during zzso development using zzso zzso and found that zzso of zzso signaling substantially decreased the formation of the zzso vessel and the number of zzso zzso cells within the developing zzso zzso indicating an essential role of zzso signaling during the early phase of zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso signaling selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso without affecting the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso abnormalities caused by the reduction of zzso signaling were significantly exacerbated by the zzso partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso zzso signaling provide a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso B during zzso development because zzso of zzso or zzso was unable to rescue the zzso defects caused by the lack of zzso or zzso zzso 

Taken together, our data present compelling evidence suggesting that zzso signaling regulates zzso development by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso B activity in a zzso zzso zzso manner during zzso zzso
