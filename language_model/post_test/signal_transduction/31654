zzso zzso of zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso is the most common genetic cause of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice prepared by us displayed progressive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of motor zzso zzso is a member of mixed lineage zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, leading to zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso and resulting in zzso of zzso death signal zzso zzso with our hypothesis, zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells exhibited an zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso at zzso and protein expression of active zzso was zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso level of active zzso and zzso downstream targets of zzso was increased in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso target genes of zzso and formation of active zzso zzso and zzso were also observed in the zzso of zzso zzso transgenic zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso in the zzso and causes the resulting zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso transgenic zzso
