zzso zzso is a bone zzso protein zzso zzso involved in the control of systemic iron zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to severe iron overload in humans and mice due to marked suppression of the zzso hormone zzso To investigate the role of zzso in body iron zzso zzso mice and zzso wild type controls were placed on a moderately low, a standard or a high iron diet for four zzso zzso mice developed systemic iron overload under all zzso zzso zzso was highly saturated regardless of the dietary iron content, while liver iron deposition was zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression responded to fluctuations in dietary iron zzso despite the absence of zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso of zzso was more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that seen in wild type zzso Likewise, iron signaling via the zzso zzso was preserved but substantially zzso These findings suggest that zzso is not required for sensing of body iron levels and merely functions as an zzso for iron signaling to zzso
