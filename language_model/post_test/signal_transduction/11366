zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be induced by zzso and numerous other physical and chemical factors, many of which cause cellular zzso This has led to the realization that zzso is a major highly zzso stress or heat shock zzso Recent work has implicated zzso of zzso protein zzso and other zzso in the mechanism of induction of zzso and suggested that signal zzso pathways through zzso zzso are involved in induction of zzso gene expression by stress zzso We hypothesized that zzso oxide zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso might zzso the zzso zzso Here, we show that a remarkably brief zzso zzso exposure of normal zzso to low zzso zzso zzso of zzso produces a marked increase in zzso and protein of zzso This increase is comparable to the level obtained by addition of zzso (20 zzso and occurs without producing changes in cellular zzso levels or stabilization of zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso of protein synthesis decreased the ability of zzso to increase levels of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect requires de zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso donors zzso the zzso induction of zzso in a dose dependent zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso blunted the induction produced by both zzso and zzso After brief zzso with zzso or zzso cell extracts showed comparable increases in levels of protein zzso zzso in general, and specifically in zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the proposition that induction of zzso by zzso involves zzso of specific zzso and that the mechanisms of induction of zzso by zzso and by zzso may share some common zzso
