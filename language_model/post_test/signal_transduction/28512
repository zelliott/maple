Two zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which are possibly involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso were cloned and their expression profiles in response to biological stress were zzso Four distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso were isolated with the degenerative zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso activity of zzso expressed in zzso coli was found using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 130 zzso acid zzso with zzso to zzso identities to the zzso sequences from other plant zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts increased zzso with zzso zzso by the treatment of zzso a specific zzso in zzso lines carrying the zzso zzso zzso approaches indicated the involvement of zzso zzso and protein zzso in the signaling pathways of zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso leaves were zzso with zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso and zzso increased in both incompatible and compatible interactions but more rapidly in incompatible zzso Interestingly, however, significant zzso zzso was observed only in incompatible interaction during the experimental period, suggesting that zzso zzso may be inhibited in one or more zzso processes in the compatible zzso
