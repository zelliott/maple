zzso zzso is known to zzso with zzso zzso in the induction of zzso zzso expression in zzso leukemia cells and proliferation of mouse zzso We used a zzso construct containing the bacterial gene for zzso zzso under the control of the human zzso promoter to study the nature of this zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso Although zzso induction of the zzso promoter in these cells required zzso with zzso zzso zzso the signal induced by zzso was zzso zzso We provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso signal is zzso by protein zzso C, and we show that the zzso signal is zzso That zzso and zzso zzso zzso represent different stimuli was shown by their response to protein zzso C zzso capacity to zzso with increased zzso free zzso and requirement for protein zzso In addition we show that zzso with zzso can prime zzso cells to subsequent zzso by zzso of zzso zzso not normally sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso cells remained primed for at least 40 h after removal of the zzso Neither zzso zzso zzso nor a calcium zzso was capable of zzso zzso zzso
