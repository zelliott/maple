G proteins may serve as targets for pharmacological zzso of signaling pathways bypassing the regulatory events that may counteract the effect of the external stimulus on the level of zzso We sought to identify peptides as lead structures interacting with G proteins utilizing a commercially available zzso zzso The zzso library was screened for binding to human G zzso which was modified with a zzso tag and immobilized on a zzso zzso After several rounds of zzso selection a number of zzso clones with consensus sequences were zzso zzso with such sequences were chemically zzso and their effect on zzso gamma S binding to G zzso and other G protein alpha zzso was zzso Through this process two zzso zzso with the capability to activate G proteins were zzso The peptides showed no structural similarity to known zzso or zzso G protein zzso with a zzso zzso structure like zzso or zzso The functional relevance of the zzso protein interaction was shown by an increased sensitivity for zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso The zzso G protein zzso may, therefore, serve as novel tools for further investigation of zzso zzso of G zzso
