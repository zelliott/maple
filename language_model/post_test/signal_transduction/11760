This study investigated the extent to which a zzso zzso and a commercial zzso zzso C zzso acute insulin action in rat zzso The zzso zzso insulin stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and breakdown of a zzso proposed as a precursor for an zzso zzso of insulin action, but were much less effective in stimulating zzso transport and zzso These observations corroborate recent suggestions that insulin may activate a zzso C to generate a zzso that can account for insulin zzso of zzso from a zzso precursor with a zzso zzso This zzso precursor is probably an outer membrane component since effects were obtained with intact zzso It is unlikely that this mechanism accounts fully for insulin action since zzso and commercial zzso C stimulation of zzso transport was significantly less than that zzso by zzso
