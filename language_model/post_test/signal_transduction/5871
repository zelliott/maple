The molecular mechanisms by which resistance exercise zzso muscle mass, particularly the mass of zzso type II zzso are likely to involve enhanced zzso of key zzso regulating protein zzso The hypothesis is that resistance exercise influences the zzso of such key signaling proteins to a greater extent in type II than in type I zzso Six zzso active male subjects performed four sets of six zzso lengthening zzso with one zzso Muscle zzso were taken from the zzso zzso before and immediately after exercise and following 1 and 2 h of zzso zzso were zzso and individual muscle fibers were dissected out and identified as type I or type II after zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso in type II fibers was increased zzso fourfold and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, 1 and 2 h after exercise, whereas zzso in type I fibers remained zzso zzso of zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso in both fiber types, whereas that of zzso zzso factor 2 zzso was attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso in type II fibers during zzso zzso of zzso was elevated zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso immediately after exercise, and zzso zzso zzso was increased three- to fourfold zzso zzso zzso for as long as 1 h after exercise in both types of zzso although the level was markedly higher in type II fibers zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso of zzso and the reduction of zzso zzso in the type II fibers following resistance exercise suggest stimulation of protein zzso which may contribute to a more pronounced enlargement of these zzso Our findings also suggest that zzso is zzso at least in part, via pathways not involving zzso and zzso
