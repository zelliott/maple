zzso zzso factors zzso are robust zzso of serum response factor zzso zzso contain three copies of the zzso motif at their zzso and they bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies illustrate that zzso binding zzso zzso activity by preventing the zzso nuclear zzso In the living cells, the majority of zzso is zzso by zzso binding proteins that prevent spontaneous zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the most abundant zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and activity of zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso thus, interfering with zzso complex zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso whose affinity for zzso is very low, was lower than that by zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso which has a lower affinity for zzso more effectively suppressed zzso activity than zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an important zzso regulator that controls the zzso zzso
