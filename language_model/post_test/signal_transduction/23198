We have previously reported evidence of cell proliferation and increased zzso in rat zzso zzso slice cultures zzso after a transient zzso injury to the zzso zzso area induced by low zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso An increased baseline rate of zzso may contribute to recovery from zzso mild injury but the zzso zzso responsible for zzso proliferation remain zzso The current study investigated the key zzso pathways responsible for zzso zzso in zzso including the effects of transient zzso on the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso a well-known regulator of zzso cell zzso 

Application of a low concentration of zzso (2 zzso for 24 h followed by recovery induced a significant and long lasting increase in zzso protein levels expressed by both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the mild zzso toxicity zzso both zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso and induced a significant increase in zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the zzso marker zzso 

Our results suggest that transient zzso insult induced by zzso produces zzso and zzso zzso via zzso and zzso pathways and that both pathways zzso at least in part, the increased neural proliferation resulting from mild zzso
