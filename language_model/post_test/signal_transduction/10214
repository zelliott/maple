zzso is a member of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso family, which is important in zzso zzso Gene zzso studies have revealed a requirement for zzso in diverse biological processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Levy, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, the function of zzso had been attributed exclusively to its zzso activity in the zzso In this study, we reveal an interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso did not overtly affect zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso is required for the stabilization of zzso and cell zzso We further demonstrate that zzso cells are resistant to the zzso effect of zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso protein levels in zzso cells partially reversed the zzso and migration zzso zzso zzso was also capable of reversing zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso the zzso network by binding to the zzso zzso domain of zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso
