zzso is a surface zzso able to induce zzso zzso and survival of human and mouse zzso this zzso is expressed on the surface of both mature and immature B zzso In this work, the function of zzso in the maturation of zzso B zzso in the zzso was zzso The results showed that zzso is highly expressed on Transitional 2 zzso B zzso with an intermediate expression on Transitional 1 zzso and mature zzso B cells zzso zzso with a high expression of zzso zzso cells are also larger and more zzso than zzso or M B zzso zzso cells also showed high levels of other zzso which indicate an activated zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation and maturation of zzso B zzso in contrast, zzso subset died by zzso Finally, zzso stimulation of zzso B zzso obtained from zzso zzso or zzso mice showed a defective zzso similarly, drugs interfering with zzso or zzso decreased the proliferation or differentiation of this zzso This suggests that these molecules participate in the zzso signaling zzso As a whole, the results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso maturation in the zzso
