zzso zzso can induce plant tolerance to a variety of zzso stresses by triggering the generation of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso in cucumber zzso Whether zzso oxide zzso also plays a zzso role and, if so, what is the relationship between NO and zzso zzso in zzso stress tolerance are zzso zzso of NO and zzso zzso in zzso tolerance was zzso NO zzso and zzso related gene transcripts were monitored by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso NO content was elevated after treatment with zzso zzso and reduced with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso NO production was blocked by zzso with inhibitor of zzso zzso and a zzso oxygen species zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso generation was not sensitive to NO scavenger or inhibitor of NO zzso zzso or zzso of NO production inhibited zzso tolerance to zzso and cold stress and partly blocked zzso expression and activities of several zzso zzso zzso of the zzso NO zzso on the other hand, led to both increased stress tolerance and increased expression of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that NO plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso induction of plant stress tolerance by zzso
