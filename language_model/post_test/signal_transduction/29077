The zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is a nuclear zzso factor that controls the genes involved in metabolism and zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso of gene expression in zzso human zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso The zzso zzso data revealed a list of target genes commonly induced zzso zzso and zzso (32 zzso by tested zzso zzso These genes were analyzed by zzso software and zzso zzso analysis and revealed that zzso zzso are involved in cell zzso focal zzso and several signaling zzso Eight genes were selected to confirm the zzso data by zzso and real-time zzso from which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso This study zzso the commonly induced genes modulated by tested zzso zzso involved in the different signaling pathways and zzso probably zzso in a zzso manner in zzso cancer cells and helps to better understand the zzso actions of zzso zzso
