zzso of zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso triggers an zzso stress zzso the unfolded protein response zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated zzso signaling events in mice in the absence of the zzso zzso family members zzso and zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso mice responded zzso to zzso zzso stress in the liver, with extensive tissue damage and decreased expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 and its target zzso zzso zzso cells showed deficient zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed a protein complex with the zzso domain of zzso that was essential for zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso function at the zzso membrane to activate zzso signaling and to provide a physical link between members of the core zzso zzso and the zzso
