zzso resistance is the primary characteristic of type 2 zzso Cocoa and its main zzso zzso zzso display some zzso effects, but the mechanisms for their preventive activities related to zzso metabolism and insulin zzso in the liver remain largely zzso In the present work, the preventive effect of zzso and a zzso zzso extract zzso on insulin zzso and on both zzso production and zzso are studied in zzso human zzso cells treated with high zzso zzso of cells with zzso or zzso reverted decreased zzso and total levels of zzso zzso and zzso triggered by high zzso zzso and zzso zzso also prevented the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso as well as the diminution of zzso levels induced by high zzso Furthermore, zzso of cells with zzso and zzso avoided the increase in zzso levels and the diminished zzso zzso provoked by high zzso returning enhanced levels of zzso production and decreased zzso content to control zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso improved insulin sensitivity of zzso treated with high zzso preventing or delaying a potential zzso dysfunction through the zzso of the insulin zzso blockade and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
