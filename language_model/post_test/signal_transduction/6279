The zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso regulate the expression of a concise set of zzso genes zzso zzso target zzso required for de zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Several components have now been identified that control both the zzso zzso as well as activity of the zzso complex, yet the precise upstream regulatory signals involved remain zzso For example, it has been proposed that zzso activity is zzso by zzso acting through the zzso retrograde response zzso or, zzso by zzso acting through the zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso target gene regulation is remarkably complex, with zzso and zzso as well as zzso collaborating as potentially distinct signals to regulate zzso target gene zzso We show that both zzso and these zzso signals zzso on zzso the immediate upstream inhibitor of zzso and that a direct correlation exists between the degree of zzso zzso and the extent of zzso target gene zzso Finally, we find that zzso and zzso zzso gene repression can be zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso act, at least in part, independently to inhibit this zzso
