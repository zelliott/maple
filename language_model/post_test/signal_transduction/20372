Current evidence suggests that zzso a stomach derived zzso exerts its zzso action through specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which ultimately increase the expression of zzso protein zzso and zzso Y zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso However, there is a paucity of data about the possible action of zzso on alternative zzso pathways at this zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso elicits a marked zzso of the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso Of note, central zzso of zzso signaling with zzso decreased zzso zzso action and zzso the zzso expression of zzso and zzso as well as their key downstream zzso factors, namely zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso box zzso zzso total and zzso Taken together, these data indicate that, in addition to previous reported mechanisms, zzso also promotes feeding through zzso of zzso zzso zzso
