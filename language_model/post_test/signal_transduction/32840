A zzso that mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso has been identified via zzso analysis of a primary zzso precursor cell zzso library and is identical to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family member zzso The zzso zzso was highly expressed by isolated bone zzso zzso zzso and by mature zzso in zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso expressed by zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice expressing a soluble zzso fusion protein have severe zzso because of a reduction in zzso similar to zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso binds with high affinity to zzso in zzso and blocks zzso differentiation and zzso in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso against the zzso zzso domain promotes zzso in bone zzso cultures suggesting that zzso zzso mediates the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso is directly zzso through zzso on zzso precursor zzso
