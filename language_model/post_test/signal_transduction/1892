zzso of new zzso is an energy costly and thus highly regulated zzso zzso protein synthesis is controlled by regulating translation of the corresponding zzso protein zzso In zzso cells a zzso zzso tract zzso is a zzso feature of these zzso that has been demonstrated to be essential for their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been proposed to be regulated by zzso of zzso protein zzso which is a common effect of zzso stimulation of zzso However, as demonstrated here, zzso zzso is not zzso in zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso appears to be due to the action of a zzso that acts downstream of zzso zzso presumably on zzso zzso Despite the absence of changes in zzso zzso translation of zzso zzso is zzso during differentiation of zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of a mechanism for regulating zzso zzso that is distinct from zzso zzso as well as the existence of mechanisms for regulating translation of zzso zzso that are independent of zzso zzso
