The hormone zzso protein zzso physically interacts with zzso zzso C zzso and with the zzso protein zzso as shown by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso in either the presence or absence of zzso whereas the zzso association depends on the presence of zzso zzso interactions between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso acts together with zzso and zzso in a growth control zzso operating in parallel to the zzso zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso or zzso fail to form zzso upon nitrogen zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso strains is rescued by zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso via zzso or by zzso a zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso is also required for efficient expression of the zzso reporter gene under nitrogen zzso In conclusion, we have identified two physically interacting zzso zzso and zzso as novel components of a nitrogen signaling zzso controlling the zzso switch from zzso to zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso C zzso the interaction of the putative zzso sensor zzso with the zzso protein zzso as a downstream zzso of zzso zzso
