The year 2009 marked a real turnaround in our understanding of the mode of zzso acid zzso zzso Nearly zzso had elapsed since the first zzso detection of zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso guard cells was zzso This zzso zzso is owed largely to the discovery of the soluble zzso receptors whose major interacting proteins happen to be some of the most well-established components of earliest steps in zzso zzso These soluble zzso with the double name of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso OF zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso proteins of about zzso acids that share a zzso zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso zzso under zzso conditions is muted by the zzso A protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso During the initial steps of zzso zzso the binding of the hormone to the zzso zzso a zzso change in the latter that allows it to zzso the zzso This excludes them from the negative regulation of the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus unleashing the zzso by freeing them to zzso downstream targets that now include several zzso zzso factors, zzso channels zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The discovery of this family of soluble receptors and the rich insight already gained from structural studies of their complexes with different zzso of zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso lay the foundation towards rational design of chemical switches that can bolster drought zzso in zzso
