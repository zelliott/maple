Recent studies have led to a model of the molecular zzso that specifies the zzso during zzso zzso The zzso box zzso factor zzso is a key component of this zzso and is essential for zzso zzso however, the molecular events controlled by zzso are largely zzso We have identified several direct zzso targets of zzso including zzso and zzso We show that zzso a component of zzso signaling pathway, physically interacts with zzso and zzso its zzso zzso of target zzso We identify a motif in the C zzso of zzso which is zzso in all the zzso zzso of Sox zzso and this motif is required for the ability of zzso to both zzso target genes and bind zzso Nuclear zzso is present in zzso cells of the zzso and depletion of zzso from zzso results in a repression of zzso target zzso These data suggest that in a mechanism analogous to zzso interacting with zzso zzso and zzso interact to transcribe zzso target zzso
