During zzso zzso long-term zzso zzso zzso are strengthened by trafficking zzso receptors to the zzso through a zzso zzso cascade following zzso of zzso zzso This process results in a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength that is thought to be a cellular mechanism for learning and zzso Over the past 20 years, many signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in the induction and maintenance of zzso including the zzso zzso However, the crucial link between zzso receptors and the signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso trafficking during zzso remains zzso In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize zzso zzso signaling proteins that link zzso zzso zzso to downstream signaling pathways that lead to trafficking of zzso zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso interacting signaling zzso zzso zzso contains multiple signaling zzso a zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and an zzso domain, and exists as a component of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways during chemically induced zzso in rat primary zzso zzso Finally, knocking down zzso expression leads to zzso of zzso zzso trafficking during chemically induced zzso Together, zzso is an essential signaling component of the zzso zzso complex that links zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
