Type 2 helper T cells zzso are critically involved in zzso and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly and selectively expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso caused impaired zzso responses and reduced allergic airway inflammation in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that although the zzso polarization of zzso cells was zzso these cells had a zzso in migration and were retained in peripheral zzso zzso This was associated with reduced expression of zzso and zzso We also found that zzso could directly bind the zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso signaling and activate zzso zzso Our data identify a previously unknown function of zzso in regulating zzso cell migration through control of zzso and zzso zzso
