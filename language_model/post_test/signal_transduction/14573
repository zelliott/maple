Toll like zzso the critical zzso family in innate zzso have been shown to signal via both zzso 1/2 and zzso factor zzso zzso 1 and 2 have recently been implicated in zzso of zzso signaling and zzso 1/2 zzso Using a number of zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 double zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the double zzso cells, zzso interference zzso specific zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso it was demonstrated that zzso 2 positively regulates zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and both zzso 1 and 2 zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso Also zzso 2 positively regulate zzso zzso production and both zzso 1 and 2 positively regulate zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and zzso production suggesting that zzso and zzso production is, in part, zzso by zzso 1/2 zzso Over expression of wild type zzso 1 and 2 had no effect on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production suggesting that zzso zzso 1 and 2 are sufficient to mediate maximum zzso 1/2 activity and zzso zzso zzso thus not only zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso but also positively regulate zzso 1/2 zzso and specific zzso gene zzso zzso the role of zzso in regulation of zzso signaling pathways may provide novel insights into control mechanisms for inflammatory gene zzso
