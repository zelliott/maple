The zzso signaling zzso zzso regulates gene expression in target cells in part by preventing zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso at three sites by zzso zzso A zzso We show that these zzso prime further zzso at adjacent zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso sites prevents zzso zzso and activates zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso is also inhibited if cells lack activity of the zzso zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are reduced in zzso cells by zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a regulator of zzso zzso
