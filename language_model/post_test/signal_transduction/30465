Recent findings demonstrate that nutrition during the fetal and zzso periods can affect the life span of an zzso Our previous studies in zzso using a maternal low protein diet have shown that limiting protein and growth during zzso zzso low protein zzso zzso increases zzso while in zzso growth restriction zzso followed by zzso up zzso zzso zzso shortens life zzso The aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms in early zzso life that could zzso these substantial differences in zzso At zzso zzso animals had improved insulin sensitivity as suggested by lower zzso of insulin required to maintain zzso of zzso similar to those of the control group and significant zzso of insulin zzso IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso These animals also had significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was elevated in these zzso In contrast, zzso animals had a significantly increased zzso zzso zzso while insulin levels remained comparable to those of the control group suggesting relative insulin zzso zzso expression was increased in these zzso These data suggest that early nutrition can lead to zzso in insulin sensitivity and zzso capacity very early in life, which may influence life zzso
