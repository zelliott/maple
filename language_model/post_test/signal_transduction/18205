zzso of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso receptors occurs as a consequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their subsequent zzso zzso zzso consist of a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain of unknown function, and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 to 7, implicated in zzso zzso We analyzed the functional roles of the different protein zzso in zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that the zzso domain but not zzso zzso 3 to 7 zzso regulated the zzso activity of zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso domain of zzso however, this requirement was lost upon deletion of the zzso domain of zzso Investigation of the mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggested that this regulation did not involve protein zzso zzso Instead, analysis of interactions between the zzso zzso domain and zzso suggested that the zzso domain zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso domain inhibited the activity of the single zzso zzso zzso Finally, deletion of the zzso domain of zzso zzso signal zzso through the gamma zzso zzso by significantly increasing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso domain zzso regulates the activity of zzso probably through an interaction with the zzso domain, and this regulation is required to keep zzso inactive in the absence of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain may have a role in regulation of zzso zzso
