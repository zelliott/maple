The zzso G protein zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso nervous system and zzso neural activities in response to various zzso However, zzso functions in living animals are less well zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso has a fundamental role in zzso adaptation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function and excessive zzso of zzso zzso cause a zzso in adaptation to zzso zzso These pathways zzso zzso zzso adaptation in zzso zzso zzso zzso animals treated with zzso zzso and zzso animals of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also have a zzso in adaptation, suggesting that elevated zzso signals disrupt normal zzso zzso active zzso can suppress the adaptation zzso of zzso zzso double zzso whereas it fails to suppress the adaptation zzso of animals with zzso active zzso zzso that zzso acts upstream of zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso adaptation and plasticity of zzso
