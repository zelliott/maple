The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso is a zzso channel that is expressed in many zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso by protein zzso is thought to be an absolute prerequisite for the opening of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso were shown to regulate the opening of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso activates human zzso resulting in zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to open zzso but zzso opens zzso zzso after application of zzso The effect of zzso is independent of protein zzso as zzso activates zzso in the complete absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activate zzso less efficiently than zzso zzso application to zzso zzso may inhibit the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that regulation of zzso by zzso is a previously zzso alternative mechanism to control zzso zzso
