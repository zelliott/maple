zzso signaling critically regulates emotional and motivational states via zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso in the zzso The nucleus zzso zzso functions to gate emotional and motivational zzso Although expression of zzso in the zzso is low, manipulation of zzso signaling within the zzso triggers robust zzso zzso related to drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders, and these effects cannot be exclusively attributed to zzso located at zzso to the zzso Rather, zzso zzso in the zzso although zzso appear to be critical for emotional and motivational zzso However, the cellular properties of these zzso remain largely zzso Here, we generated a zzso mouse line in which zzso zzso expressed the fluorescent protein zzso zzso Using these mice, we demonstrated that zzso zzso within the zzso were exclusively zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso coupled with each other, and thus may help zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also form zzso zzso on adjacent medium zzso zzso zzso providing zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the membrane zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso after withdrawal from cocaine exposure, an effect that might increase zzso zzso Taken together with our previous findings that the membrane zzso of zzso zzso is decreased during cocaine withdrawal, the present findings suggest that the zzso functional output of the zzso is inhibited during cocaine withdrawal by multiple zzso As such, zzso zzso are targeted by cocaine exposure to influence the overall functional output of the zzso
