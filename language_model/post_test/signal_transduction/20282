zzso stem cells zzso have the capacity to zzso and remain zzso while continuously providing a source of a variety of differentiated cell zzso zzso what zzso these properties at the molecular level is crucial for stem cell biology and its application to zzso zzso Of particular relevance is to zzso those molecular interactions which govern the zzso of zzso cells into zzso A zzso approach can be used as a framework to explore the dynamics of a simplified network of the zzso with the aim to understand how stem cells differentiate and also how they can be zzso from zzso zzso 

We propose a zzso model of the embryonic stem cell network, in which a core set of zzso factors zzso interact with each other and are induced by external zzso A zzso treatment of the network dynamics suggests that zzso zzso is the deciding factor for the stem cell zzso In particular, our results show that the decision of staying in the ground state or commitment to a differentiated state is fundamentally zzso and can be modulated by the addition of external factors zzso zzso which have the effect of reducing fluctuations in zzso zzso Our model also hosts zzso of a committed cell into an zzso by zzso zzso In this context, we zzso the important experimental result that zzso efficiency zzso when zzso is zzso within a specific range of zzso 

We have demonstrated how a zzso zzso model based upon a simplified network of zzso in zzso can zzso several key observed zzso zzso It accounts for zzso the observed zzso of key regulators, zzso characterizes the zzso under certain external stimuli conditions and zzso describes the occurrence of transitions from the zzso to the differentiated zzso Furthermore, the model zzso provides a framework for zzso from zzso cells and conveys an understanding of zzso efficiency as a function of zzso zzso
