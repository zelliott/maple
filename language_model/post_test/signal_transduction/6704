In newborn zzso the innate cellular system plays a crucial role in the first line of defense against zzso zzso are the most abundant zzso and their response to the commonly encountered zzso bacterial zzso zzso infection in newborns remains largely zzso In this study, a zzso expression array analysis was performed on CB zzso after challenge by zzso in zzso and compared with zzso in zzso cultures without zzso We investigated responses of zzso to zzso and zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso production, cell death, and pathways of zzso zzso Our results provide the first comprehensive zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso levels of 16 zzso genes and 6 zzso genes were validated by zzso Their regulatory networks were identified downstream of zzso and zzso which work in concert toward signals of death, zzso zzso and stress zzso Members of the zzso family were significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared with those in zzso zzso We confirmed protein zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and their transcription, induced by zzso but not by zzso zzso We found increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are capable of vigorous molecular and functional responses to zzso and suggest that zzso plays a critical role in the host defense zzso possibly involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso
