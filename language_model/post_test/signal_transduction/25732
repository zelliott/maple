The zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells plays a key role in early resistance to zzso zzso zzso infection through specific recognition of the zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso expressed on infected zzso The zzso zzso is also recognized by the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso mouse zzso The zzso gene is highly sequence variable among zzso zzso with many zzso zzso unable to bind zzso In this study, we have sought to define if zzso zzso leads to a wider spectrum of interactions with other zzso molecules and if this zzso host zzso to zzso We have identified novel zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso receptors from zzso zzso and zzso mice, as well as the zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso virus in which zzso was replaced with zzso which interacts with both zzso and zzso we show that the zzso interactions cause no apparent attenuating effect on viral clearance in B6 zzso zzso when zzso can bind both zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso the outcome is still zzso Thus, these data indicate that whereas zzso zzso predominately interact with zzso zzso zzso these interactions do not profoundly interfere with early zzso cell zzso
