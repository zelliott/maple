zzso tissue is a critical zzso in zzso insulin zzso Previously we have demonstrated that pharmacological lowering of zzso and subsequently zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso improves zzso zzso Here we studied the effects of zzso on zzso tissue function and inflammation in detail to provide an explanation for the observed improved zzso zzso zzso obese zzso mice were fed zzso and its effects on insulin zzso zzso and inflammation were monitored in fat zzso We show that reduction of zzso zzso in zzso tissue of zzso mice restores insulin zzso in isolated ex zzso zzso zzso We observed improved zzso as the number of larger zzso was reduced and expression of genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin responsive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso gene expression and protein were increased by zzso As a consequence of this improved function of fat tissue we observed less zzso which was characterized by reduced numbers of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and reduced levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, pharmacological lowering of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso improves zzso function and as a consequence reduces inflammation in zzso tissue of obese zzso
