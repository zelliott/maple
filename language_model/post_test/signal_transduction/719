The abundance of zzso acid zzso is determined by the balance between its synthesis by zzso zzso zzso and its degradation by zzso In particular, the dynamic expression of three zzso genes controls the regional level of zzso within the zzso zzso mouse zzso express zzso but not zzso We now show that mice lacking all three zzso genes manifest zzso of the body axis as a result of expansion of the zzso expression domain throughout the zzso Mouse zzso was found to contain an zzso element in zzso 1 that is highly zzso among zzso In the absence of zzso zzso derived zzso activates zzso expression in the entire zzso of zzso zzso via this zzso These observations suggest that maternal zzso must be removed by embryonic zzso for correct zzso expression during embryonic zzso
