The zzso of signaling molecules close to their targets is the central principle of cell zzso The zzso of zzso signaling complexes is realized through protein scaffolds that provide better specificity than zzso diffusion zzso same zzso zzso complexes have been suggested to follow this principle by specific zzso zzso of zzso production and the limitation of zzso diffusion zzso However, the lack of adequate methods did not allow direct detection of local zzso production to confirm the model zzso signaling zzso Nevertheless, zzso of local zzso production and restriction of diffusion were provided by kinetic modeling and data on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso their adapter proteins and local restriction of zzso zzso Here we shall discuss the properties of zzso system which prevents uncontrolled zzso diffusion from the sites of generation to the adjacent zzso zzso the current data of the specific zzso zzso activity and its influence on zzso zzso the recent zzso of the zzso diffusion zzso
