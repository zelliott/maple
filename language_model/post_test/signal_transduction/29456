The finding that zzso a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso opposes zzso zzso effect on food intake and gastric zzso has been zzso The effect of zzso has been mostly investigated in zzso zzso a condition associated with high blood levels of zzso which may mask the effect of zzso We therefore investigated the effect of zzso on food zzso gastric zzso and gastric zzso in zzso knockout zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso cumulative food intake was studied in zzso zzso zzso and zzso knockout zzso zzso In both zzso the effect of zzso and/or zzso was studied in zzso on gastric zzso measured with the zzso acid breath test and in zzso on neural responses zzso by electrical field stimulation zzso of zzso smooth muscle zzso 

Administration of zzso did not influence zzso zzso or gastric zzso in both zzso zzso of zzso accelerated gastric zzso in zzso and zzso mice but the effect was not reversed by zzso with zzso In zzso strips from zzso and zzso mice, zzso increased zzso zzso but zzso was without zzso However, zzso with zzso tended to reduce the zzso effect of zzso in both zzso 

In zzso mice, zzso failed to affect food intake and gastric zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso does not mask the effect of zzso and confirm that zzso administered peripherally is not a major regulator of zzso zzso or gut zzso
