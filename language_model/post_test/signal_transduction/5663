There is an emerging and significant body of research that suggests that zzso zzso may be a critical zzso in dysfunctional zzso formation and, zzso zzso initiation and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso found in zzso and is abundant in zzso surrounding zzso zzso Several lines of evidence support the role of zzso zzso of proteins in zzso The generic mechanism of zzso protein zzso has been zzso recently and has been identified as a potentially crucial zzso that links smoking, inflammation and zzso HDL zzso zzso exerts a zzso beneficial effect of reducing zzso cholesterol zzso however, there are considerable gaps in current understanding of the molecular basis of dysfunctional HDL zzso Especially deserving of attention is a contextual understanding of dysfunctional zzso HDL formation in light of inflammatory changes in zzso The present review is especially timely in light of the solved structures of nascent and zzso HDL and zzso the zzso significance of zzso zzso in the context of these zzso Various avenues of experimental investigation are explored which will be crucial in understanding the vascular consequences of dysfunctional HDL formation and the identification of novel zzso pathways in vascular zzso It is anticipated that further knowledge on the intricacies of dysfunctional HDL formation, potentially by an zzso pathway, will lead to considerable progress in identifying novel drug targets for zzso and characterization of the primary zzso zzso
