zzso zzso grow long distances along precise pathways to connect major zzso zzso However, during embryonic development, it remains largely undefined how the first zzso zzso choose specific positions and grow along zzso Here, we review recent evidence identifying a critical role for zzso signals to guide pioneer zzso zzso in the embryonic brain zzso These studies indicate that zzso signals from the floor plate have dual zzso to repel zzso zzso away from the zzso zzso and also to maintain straight zzso zzso These dual functions likely cooperate with other guidance cues to establish the major zzso tracts in the zzso
