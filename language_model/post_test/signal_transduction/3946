We are evaluating strategies to enhance the in zzso proliferation and function of zzso transferred zzso T zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso is important for T cell zzso and zzso the expression of the zzso for zzso is highly zzso We have generated a zzso zzso composed of the signaling zzso of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso which binds the widely expressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was introduced into zzso cells via zzso infection and was shown to be expressed on the cell zzso By monitoring early and late components of the zzso signaling pathway, the zzso zzso was demonstrated to trigger the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The possible utility of the zzso zzso zzso for adoptive zzso is zzso
