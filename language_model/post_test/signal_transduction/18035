There is increasing evidence that zzso ultraviolet zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso such as zzso light zzso as well as zzso In order to fully understand these zzso effects it is critical to analyze the zzso and molecular mechanisms by which UVA radiation affects the function of human skin zzso In this review, our current knowledge about the signal zzso zzso involved in UVA zzso expression of zzso genes relevant to the zzso of zzso light zzso will be zzso In addition, recent studies on the role of zzso DNA zzso in UVA zzso zzso of human skin will be zzso For both biological zzso the UVA zzso generation of zzso oxygen within human skin appears to be of critical zzso These studies are of enormous clinical relevance because they indicate that prevention of the generation of zzso oxygen or zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathways may prove to be critical for effective protection of human skin against UVA zzso zzso
