zzso adapter proteins zzso and zzso constitute a family of proteins that are expressed in a variety of cell types but are studied most extensively in zzso They have been shown to associate with zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso An interaction of SLAP with zzso leads to the zzso and degradation of zzso components of the zzso and zzso zzso The absence of this process in immature zzso T and B cells leads to increased zzso levels due to decreased zzso retention and zzso We propose a model in which zzso regulation of zzso levels allows for finer control of zzso zzso Thus, SLAP functions to dampen zzso zzso thereby influencing zzso development and repertoire zzso
