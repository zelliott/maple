The zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso signal zzso system plays key zzso and zzso communication roles in the zzso In the guinea zzso chronic prenatal ethanol exposure zzso via maternal ethanol administration, suppresses the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fetus and decreases zzso zzso release in the zzso of young zzso zzso with no effect on zzso zzso number or zzso zzso At present, the effect of zzso on zzso a key second zzso of the zzso signal zzso system, in the zzso is not zzso The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso suppresses the zzso zzso signal zzso system in the zzso guinea pig at the levels of zzso content and zzso zzso Timed pregnant guinea pigs received chronic oral administration of 4 g zzso maternal body zzso zzso or water treatment throughout zzso zzso decreased brain and zzso weights at zzso day zzso 1 and zzso 5 zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso 10, or 100 zzso or zzso (15 or 30 zzso zzso content in zzso zzso slices at zzso 1 or zzso At 60 zzso zzso however, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso content at zzso 1 zzso and increased zzso zzso content at zzso 5 zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso or zzso (40 or 45 zzso zzso release at zzso 1 or 5, or zzso zzso zzso zzso release at zzso 1, but did decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso release at zzso 5 zzso The data demonstrate that the effects of zzso on zzso zzso content and zzso release in the zzso of the zzso guinea pig are stimulating zzso and zzso
