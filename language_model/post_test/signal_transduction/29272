In zzso humans, cat scratch disease zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is characterized by a benign regional zzso the zzso of which is poorly zzso Here, we describe a novel mouse model of zzso zzso disease that allowed us to investigate the mechanisms leading to zzso in zzso In zzso mice, a subcutaneous zzso of either viable or zzso zzso zzso led to a strong swelling of the draining zzso zzso which was long-lasting despite the rapid elimination of the zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso enlargement resulted from modified immigration and enhanced proliferation of zzso zzso of B zzso A comparative analysis of zzso zzso and the zzso pathogen zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso I zzso mice revealed that zzso is not only zzso induced by these two zzso species but also exerts an zzso effect on the development of zzso both in zzso and in zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso of human zzso can be reproduced and studied in a mouse model and provide the first insights into the underlying zzso zzso
