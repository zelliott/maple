It is well known that trauma is frequently accompanied by spontaneous functional recovery after spinal zzso injury zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso In this study, zzso scores showed a gradual return of locomotor functions after zzso zzso analysis revealed 16 differential protein spots in the zzso muscle between zzso and normal zzso Of these differential zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso throughout zzso exhibited marked zzso in the zzso muscle after zzso To study the role of zzso in the restoration of zzso locomotor functions following zzso we used zzso to zzso the zzso level of zzso Compared with zzso zzso control rats, those subjected to zzso zzso exhibited impaired functional zzso Moreover, gene expression zzso and zzso analysis showed high correlation between three main signal pathways zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso and zzso These signal pathways regulate cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso played a pivotal role via these signal pathways in zzso locomotor functional recovery after zzso which could pave the way for the development of a new strategy for the treatment of spinal zzso injury in clinical zzso
