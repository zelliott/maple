A critical event in neural tube closure is the formation of median hinge points zzso and zzso hinge points zzso Together, they buckle the zzso zzso and elevate and zzso the neural folds for proper neural tube zzso Dynamic cell behaviors occur at hinge points zzso but their molecular regulation is largely zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso have been implicated in a variety of neural tube closure zzso although the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso 

In this study, we used in zzso zzso high-resolution zzso and zzso analyses to explore the role of zzso signaling in chick zzso neural tube zzso 

We identified a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso neural plate, which results in low-level zzso activity at the zzso We show that although zzso signaling does not have a role in zzso zzso zzso its zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso blockade zzso zzso formation by regulating zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Furthermore, zzso signaling is critically important for maintaining zzso organization by zzso interacting with zzso polarity proteins zzso zzso As a result, prolonged zzso blockade zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn is sufficient to induce zzso zzso 

zzso have a critical role in maintaining zzso organization, a role that is zzso across species and tissue zzso Its zzso zzso in the neural plate zzso regulates zzso polarity and helps to zzso shape, and close the neural zzso
