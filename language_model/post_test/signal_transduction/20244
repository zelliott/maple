zzso is a feature common to both adult and embryonic stem zzso cells, as well as tumor stem cells zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a known tumor zzso that can inhibit zzso of tumor cells or adult stem zzso Here, we demonstrate an opposite effect of zzso on zzso cells in comparison with zzso zzso Our results unexpectedly showed that zzso of zzso accelerated the growth of mouse zzso cells and embryonic bodies zzso on the contrary, inhibited the growth of late stage zzso zzso of zzso cell markers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in both zzso and zzso cells, while zzso zzso of various differentiation markers was observed in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso has an opposite effect on zzso cells as compared with tumor cells and adult stem zzso zzso expression of zzso was significantly increased with zzso of zzso in zzso cells, likely leading to a release of zzso from the zzso by zzso and zzso As a result, zzso of zzso cells was zzso Our current study suggests that targeting zzso in different cell types may yield different zzso thereby having implications for therapeutic zzso of cell cycle machinery in stem zzso
