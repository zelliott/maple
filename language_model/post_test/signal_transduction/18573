The main role of the plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso is in the removal of zzso from the zzso Recently, we and others have suggested a new function for zzso as a zzso of signal zzso zzso This paper shows the physical interaction between zzso zzso 1 and 4) and zzso zzso and proposes a zzso complex of interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cardiac zzso We have identified that the zzso region between the zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso unique zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso is crucial for interaction with zzso and zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso alone failed to interact with zzso The functionality of the interaction was demonstrated by investigating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso NO production, and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso resulted in strongly increased zzso of NO zzso Analysis of the expression levels of zzso zzso protein in the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, zzso zzso or liver of zzso mice, did not reveal any differences when compared with those found in the same zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso to the zzso complex as a regulator of zzso but its absence does not cause collapse of the complex, contrary to what has been reported for other proteins within the complex, such as zzso In conclusion, the present data demonstrate for the first time the zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso complex in the heart and provide a specific molecular mechanism of interaction as well as zzso
