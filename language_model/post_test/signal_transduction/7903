A fundamental zzso question in cell biology is how the cell controls the size of its zzso zzso and zzso are an ideal test case to study the mechanism of zzso size control, because their size is easily measured and can be represented by a single zzso Moreover, the involvement of zzso in many zzso and zzso processes suggests an understanding of their size control system is critical for understanding zzso diseases, many of which zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney disease) are known to involve zzso short zzso The zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso provide the best genetic and zzso system to study length control of zzso Studies in this zzso using zzso zzso imaging, and mathematical modeling have revealed many genes involved in length control of zzso and zzso and have suggested several testable models for length zzso
