zzso is a critical neurotransmitter of the central nervous system zzso and also an important regulator of cell survival and zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso receptors zzso signal zzso zzso that lead to zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso which regulates cell proliferation and survival, is activated by zzso however, the zzso zzso signaling pathways that lead to this zzso are not clearly zzso Here we investigate the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells of the zzso including primary zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso function of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso targets the zzso of zzso but not zzso Finally, we show that the ability of zzso to activate zzso requires zzso signaling with the zzso growth factor zzso Our results provide insight into a zzso regulatory zzso distinct from that described for zzso zzso zzso and have important implications with regard to both normal zzso cell physiology and zzso
