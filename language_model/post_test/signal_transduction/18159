We determined the effects of zzso the most effective estrogen, acutely zzso on the zzso zzso with or without treatment with zzso zzso At zzso to 1 zzso zzso which itself had no effect, reduced the heart rate and developed pressures in the isolated zzso heart treated with zzso M zzso One zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso At 10 zzso to 1 zzso zzso itself reduced the heart rate and zzso of zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso The effects of zzso on heart rate, zzso and mean pressures, and zzso were significantly enhanced in the zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso did not antagonize the effect of zzso on the zzso current in zzso zzso treated with zzso nor did it alter the effect of the hormone on the zzso production zzso by zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso current in the presence or absence of tamoxifen and/or zzso were similar in male rats, which do not possess the zzso zzso and female rats, which have the zzso zzso In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso actions of zzso on the heart rate and cardiac zzso The effects may result from zzso of an unknown membrane zzso and the zzso zzso pathway, which enhances zzso influx across the zzso zzso zzso
