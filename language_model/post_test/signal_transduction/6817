Heat stress has long been zzso as a cause of zzso in farm zzso The objectives of the present study were to zzso the effect of heat stress on zzso function and involvement of the zzso protein zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso incubated for 4 h at a zzso temperature zzso exhibited significantly zzso reduced zzso plasma membrane integrity and zzso potential compared with zzso zzso the reductions in these parameters were more severe following incubation at a zzso zzso temperature zzso zzso of zzso and zzso development were highly affected in zzso incubated at zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso quality was adversely affected by zzso incubation at zzso as indicated by a higher zzso cell ratio in Day 7 zzso compared with that in the zzso control group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso Using zzso (10 zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso pathway, during zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso vs zzso increased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and reduced DNA fragmentation zzso vs zzso compared with the zzso control group, but did not improve subsequent zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, heat stress significantly affects the potential of zzso to penetrate zzso as well as subsequent zzso development and zzso zzso the data show that the zzso zzso zzso is largely involved in zzso zzso zzso However, further research is needed to zzso other zzso pathways possibly involved in zzso zzso zzso
