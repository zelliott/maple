A loss of functional zzso zzso and an enhanced expression of growth factor receptors and associated zzso are zzso genetic events in prostate cancer zzso zzso These genetic zzso lead to an zzso mechanism where a feedback zzso loop between membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling in human zzso at an advanced and zzso zzso We rationalized that zzso these zzso events could be useful in controlling advanced zzso zzso Recently, we found that grape seed extract zzso a dietary supplement rich in zzso zzso zzso advanced and zzso human zzso zzso cell growth in culture and nude zzso Here, we performed detailed zzso studies to define the effect of zzso on zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in zzso to almost complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 50% to complete zzso of zzso zzso which zzso with a comparable decrease in zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited only by lower doses of zzso in fact, higher doses showed an zzso Additional studies showed that zzso alone causes a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso in starved zzso cells that is inhibited by an zzso inhibitor zzso Independent of this increase in zzso zzso zzso showed a strong zzso of zzso zzso activity to zzso in both cellular and zzso zzso zzso treatment of cells also inhibited both zzso and zzso active zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment also showed DNA synthesis zzso in starved and zzso cells as well as loss of cell viability and zzso death that was further increased by adding zzso zzso Since zzso strongly induced zzso independent of its affect on an increase in zzso we hypothesized that zzso effect of zzso could be by other zzso including its effect on zzso zzso the zzso Indeed, zzso cells showed a strong and sustained increase in zzso levels, zzso activity and zzso zzso An zzso of zzso zzso zzso by a novel zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in a significant reversal of zzso zzso death suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso by zzso in its zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso effects of zzso in zzso be zzso via impairment of zzso zzso signaling and zzso of zzso causing growth zzso and zzso zzso
