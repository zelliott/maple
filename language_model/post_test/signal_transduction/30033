The extent to which zzso raft proteins are organized in functional clusters within the plasma membrane is central to the debate on structure and function of zzso zzso zzso proteins are characteristic components of zzso defined zzso Several studies report a function for zzso in zzso zzso but it is unclear whether molecules involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso are recruited to (or excluded zzso zzso zzso through zzso distribution of raft zzso or through specific zzso zzso Here we used zzso analysis in live cells to determine whether zzso proteins are clustered in the plasma membrane of zzso cells, and at regions where zzso zzso has been activated using zzso zzso Multiple criteria suggested that zzso between different zzso fluorescent proteins in zzso or zzso zzso zzso is generated by a random, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in localized increases in zzso of zzso fluorescent proteins and zzso toxin zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso and ratio imaging showed that there was no zzso zzso and no overall enrichment of zzso proteins or zzso in these zzso
