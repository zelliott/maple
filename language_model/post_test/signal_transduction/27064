The knowledge of transforming growth factor zzso receptors has greatly progressed in the recent zzso zzso receptors type I and II have been implicated in the zzso of cell zzso whereas type III zzso may act as a component presenting zzso to its signaling zzso In addition, four other proteins that bind zzso 1 or zzso 2 have been recently identified in some cell lines, three being anchored to the membrane through a zzso zzso Despite this knowledge, the molecular mechanism of signal zzso through the zzso receptors remain an zzso zzso family does not signal via any of the classical zzso As zzso anchors of membrane proteins have been implicated in the zzso of some hormonal effects, we investigated the putative role of zzso in signaling the zzso effects on the proliferation of rabbit zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso 1 increased DNA replication rate of zzso with a recruitment of cells in zzso followed by a subsequent zzso zzso Here, we find that the factor causes specific zzso zzso with correlated increase of zzso zzso zzso This effect was specifically inhibited by zzso that bind zzso zzso Using zzso labeling and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that a zzso material from the membrane is zzso by treatment of cell cultures with zzso specific zzso C zzso or by exposure to zzso supporting that a zzso zzso gives rise to zzso by zzso zzso The biological relevance of this zzso was demonstrated by the enhancing effect of zzso zzso on the DNA synthesis rate, which zzso the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso could be an early zzso in the cellular signaling that mediates the effect of zzso on zzso zzso
