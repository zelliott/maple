zzso of the zzso of the retinal zzso zzso zzso is indispensable for zzso signaling in zzso zzso However, the zzso molecular interactions important for signaling are not well zzso To explore this issue, we created a functional zzso analogue in which the zzso group was replaced with a zzso zzso group, a novel zzso analogue with a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso invariably yielded a zzso product zzso reflecting a zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso In addition to the zzso zzso a zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso with a zzso indicating molecular interaction of the zzso group with cellular zzso The zzso zzso was observed only in the presence of both zzso and zzso and was abolished by the addition of zzso or by replacing zzso with zzso These findings suggest a transient zzso interaction occurs only in a signaling state formed in a zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of zzso in a soluble complex with zzso a negative regulator of zzso yielded a zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso These results illustrate that, rather than being a zzso membrane anchor, the zzso zzso plays an active role in the dynamics of zzso and zzso interactions at defined steps in the signal zzso zzso
