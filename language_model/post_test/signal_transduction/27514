zzso spinal zzso injury often results in complete loss of voluntary motor and sensory function below the site of zzso The long-term neurological deficits after spinal zzso trauma may be due in part to widespread zzso of zzso and zzso in regions distant from and relatively unaffected by the initial zzso The zzso family of zzso zzso regulates the execution of the zzso zzso cell death zzso zzso zzso several essential downstream zzso involved in the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso including zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and the zzso zzso of DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be triggered by upstream events, leading to the release of zzso c from the zzso and the subsequent zzso of zzso by zzso We report here that these upstream and downstream components of the zzso zzso zzso are activated after traumatic spinal zzso injury in rats, and occur early in zzso in the injury site and hours to days later in zzso adjacent to and distant from the injury zzso Given these findings, targeting the upstream events of the zzso cascade has therapeutic potential in the treatment of acute traumatic injury to the spinal zzso
