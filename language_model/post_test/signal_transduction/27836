zzso zzso cells form large zzso zzso that break up into groups of zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso Each group then becomes a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso an unknown factor that causes zzso zzso to break up into groups of approximately 5 zzso zzso cells and thus form very small zzso zzso We have zzso the counting factor and find that it behaves as a complex of zzso with an effective molecular mass of 450 zzso One of the zzso is a zzso zzso protein we have named zzso In zzso with a disrupted counting zzso there is no zzso zzso of counting factor, and the zzso zzso do not break up, resulting in huge (up to 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
