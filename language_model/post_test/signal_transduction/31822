Many zzso and zzso pathogens differentiate a feeding structure named the zzso to extract nutrition from the plant zzso zzso The zzso resistance zzso protein zzso activates salicylic acid zzso zzso defenses against zzso zzso the zzso agents of powdery zzso diseases on multiple plant zzso How zzso activates defense remains zzso Here, we report that zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso type zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso as evidenced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso in zzso plants lacking zzso leads to leaf spontaneous cell death and enhanced disease resistance to powdery zzso via the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso in the zzso background results in strong zzso cell death, which zzso with elevated zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso prepared from tobacco leaf cells zzso transformed with zzso possesses zzso zzso In addition, zzso a rice gene zzso zzso to zzso also results in spontaneous cell death in zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso is functionally connected with zzso and that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso defense against powdery zzso in zzso
