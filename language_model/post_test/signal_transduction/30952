Cellular zzso requires coordinated regulation of zzso and zzso zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso factors trigger an zzso gene program that counters zzso zzso However, downstream molecular events are not yet well zzso 

Here, we report that expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with these results, zzso proteins decrease zzso zzso activity and repress both zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso a direct downstream target of the zzso zzso Furthermore, hearts from zzso mice exhibit increased zzso abundance and a zzso zzso with normal zzso function at zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso proteins repress cardiac growth at least in part through zzso of the zzso zzso Given that zzso growth of the heart occurs in multiple zzso our findings also suggest that certain zzso signals are capable of overriding the zzso program induced by zzso zzso with this, multiple zzso zzso triggered zzso of zzso proteins in zzso through a mechanism requiring the zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso are zzso and consequently zzso in hearts undergoing zzso growth induced by zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso of the zzso signaling cascade by zzso and release of this repressive action by the zzso zzso are important mechanisms zzso zzso factors govern cell growth in the zzso
