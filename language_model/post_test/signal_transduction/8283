zzso zzso and zzso II zzso play pivotal roles in the control of two vital and closely related zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso A failure in the proper action of each of these hormones results, to a variable degree, in the development of two highly prevalent and commonly overlapping zzso zzso zzso and hypertension zzso In recent years, a series of studies has revealed a tight connection between the signal zzso pathways that mediate zzso and zzso actions in target zzso This molecular zzso occurs at multiple levels and plays an important role in phenomena that range from the action of zzso drugs to cardiac zzso and energy acquisition by the zzso At the zzso level, the zzso zzso controls zzso synthesis but also interferes with zzso signaling through the proper regulation of zzso and the zzso of zzso At an early zzso level, zzso acting through zzso zzso and zzso may induce the zzso zzso and zzso of key elements of the zzso zzso Finally, by inducing the expression of the regulatory protein zzso zzso may impose a late control on the zzso zzso This review will focus on the main advances obtained in this field and will discuss the implications of this molecular zzso in the common clinical association between zzso and zzso
