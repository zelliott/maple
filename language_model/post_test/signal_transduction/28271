We have characterized the zzso for a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso mapping to zzso zzso The zzso was characterized by determining the complete sequence of a zzso zzso zzso clone that represents the zzso untranslated region zzso the translated region, and the 3' zzso The protein has a sterile zzso zzso a distinct GAP domain, and a zzso zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso The zzso has 5 instability motifs zzso in the 3' zzso and one motif in the translated region between GAP and zzso zzso The zzso transcript is truncated in some breast zzso cell lines and it has low expression in other breast cancer cell lines as compared to a normal breast cell zzso We have previously observed the absence of zzso transcript in a breast tumor zzso A zzso of the zzso was tested for its specificity on zzso zzso and zzso The protein was most active for zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells significantly inhibited cell zzso The introduction of the zzso construct into zzso cells that had previously been zzso with a zzso construct did not affect cell zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in zzso proliferation of cancer zzso zzso cells zzso zzso showed considerable zzso of stress fiber zzso Several zzso were identified as zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso The interaction with zzso zzso zzso may partially explain the growth zzso of breast zzso cells by zzso class of cholesterol lowering zzso The biological significance of the interacting proteins is discussed in the context of their involvement in zzso Our results indicate that loss of zzso or its altered activity suppresses the growth of breast tumor zzso The presence of various motifs in zzso and its interaction with several other proteins suggest that the protein may regulate zzso signaling in multiple ways and possibly function in a zzso zzso
