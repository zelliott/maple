To study the gene expression changes in pancreatic zzso zzso in zzso transgenic mice model and to provide information about the zzso clinical diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic zzso 

Using the zzso transgenic mice model of pancreatic zzso zzso we studied the gene expression changes by applying zzso zzso zzso of part gene expression profiling data was performed using real-time zzso 

By using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 453 were increased and 760 decreased in pancreatic zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso Among these, we confirmed the changes in zzso zzso and zzso signal pathways with real-time zzso The results of real-time zzso showed similar expression changes in gene zzso 

all the altered expression genes are associated with cell cycle, DNA damage and repair, signal pathway, and zzso zzso may cooperate with several proteins in promoting zzso
