The positioning and density of leaf zzso are regulated by three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso Several lines of published evidence have suggested a regulatory zzso as zzso zzso and zzso are perceived by zzso complexes consisting of a zzso zzso zzso MANY zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso These receptors activate a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and destabilize the zzso factor zzso zzso resulting in a decrease in the number of zzso lineage zzso zzso acts zzso to zzso and zzso However, there is no direct evidence that zzso and zzso activate or that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso through which they might regulate the zzso zzso Experimental zzso of these peptides in zzso zzso would change the number of zzso lineage cells in developing leaves, which in turn would change the expression of zzso making the interpretation zzso Here we reconstructed this signaling zzso in differentiated leaf cells of zzso zzso to examine signaling without the zzso effect of cell type zzso We show that zzso and zzso are able to activate the zzso zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso are able to decrease the zzso level, whereas zzso is able to increase zzso Our data also suggest that zzso can be recognized by zzso together with any zzso family zzso zzso whereas zzso can be recognized by zzso together with zzso or zzso but not by zzso together with zzso
