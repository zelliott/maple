zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a potent zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso It functions by binding the free zzso zzso zzso with a high affinity and is also known to export nuclear C zzso to the zzso The significance of these actions with respect to zzso zzso role is not well zzso To address this, we have generated by zzso zzso zzso mice that are deficient in zzso one of the three zzso of zzso The mice completely lack zzso activity in skeletal muscle and, surprisingly, show decreased zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso Further examination revealed reduced levels of the zzso zzso form of the zzso factor zzso zzso response element binding zzso in the zzso This phenomenon zzso at least in part, from lower zzso zzso activity levels in the zzso arising from a zzso increase in the level of the zzso zzso of zzso The deficit in gene zzso however, is not easily explained by current models of zzso function and suggests that zzso may play an as yet zzso role in zzso zzso
