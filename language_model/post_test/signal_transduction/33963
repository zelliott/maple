The zzso family member zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and serves as a key death factor in the immune zzso It is involved in the termination of immune responses by zzso cell death, the selection of zzso and T and zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso in the establishment of immune privilege and contributes to tumor cell zzso Besides its zzso capacity, zzso has been implicated in retrograde signal zzso into zzso expressing cells by so-called zzso zzso In this context, zzso may also act as an zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso in a severe impairment of the functional integrity and maintenance of immune zzso As its zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in several zzso the expression of zzso has to be tightly regulated to prevent unwanted zzso At the zzso level, this is achieved by several independent mechanisms, for example the safe zzso storage, an zzso zzso the association with zzso zzso and the shedding by zzso Of interest, the zzso portion of zzso contains a unique zzso domain, which plays a major role in the control of zzso transport and expression due to interactions with proteins containing zzso or WW interaction zzso The detailed analysis of zzso proteins and their functional characterization provided novel insights into the complex processes regulating zzso expression and signal zzso This knowledge should allow to improve zzso zzso approaches that are currently under zzso
