This review begins with the premise that an zzso life span is determined by the balance between two countervailing zzso zzso the sum of zzso effects and zzso the sum of protective zzso zzso Against this zzso the role of zzso is discussed, both as zzso factors and as signals that induce protective zzso Because most biological zzso contain zzso centers, zzso are particularly zzso and toxic in a biological zzso The majority of cellular zzso are generated from zzso fatty acids by a zzso chain reaction that is readily triggered by zzso zzso but zzso without further input of zzso oxygen species zzso Thus, the formation of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso is proposed to be relatively insensitive to the level of initiating zzso but to depend mainly on the availability of zzso fatty zzso This is consistent with numerous observations that life span is zzso correlated to membrane zzso and with the hypothesis that zzso may constitute the zzso link between high zzso of membrane lipids to zzso and shortened life zzso Experimental interventions that directly alter membrane composition (and thus their zzso or zzso zzso levels have the expected effects on life span, establishing that the connection is not only zzso but zzso zzso molecular mechanisms are considered, by which zzso could zzso destabilize biological systems via zzso reactions with cellular zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways that control zzso zzso
