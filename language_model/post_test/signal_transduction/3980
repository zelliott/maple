zzso results have been published in the past regarding the functional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and its degradation product zzso In this study we performed binding and calcium zzso experiments with zzso human zzso zzso and zzso Blood Mo displayed zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso but responded to zzso with a transient release of the zzso calcium concentration zzso whereas zzso was completely zzso In contrast, binding of zzso to zzso zzso and the mast cell line zzso which have been shown previously to express zzso binding sites could be blocked by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso release in blood Mo was zzso toxin zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted similarly to blood Mo as no specific binding of zzso to these cells could be demonstrated, whereas an zzso release of calcium zzso in response to the zzso was zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso zzso to zzso was detected in further zzso The functional effect of zzso but not the unspecific binding of zzso to blood Mo and zzso zzso zzso could be blocked by the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the expression of the recently cloned zzso zzso for zzso on human blood Mo and zzso zzso zzso However, the total number of specific zzso binding sites on these cells is distinctly lower as compared to zzso zzso and cells of the mast cell line zzso The small number of zzso receptors on zzso zzso may be masked by a pronounced zzso binding of zzso This zzso however, may contribute to the recently described biological effects of zzso on zzso
