zzso proteins mediate many of the zzso interactions that determine cell fate during embryonic zzso zzso signaling has been shown to regulate slow muscle fiber type zzso We report here that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene disrupt many zzso processes involving zzso zzso zzso zzso have a zzso reduction in the number of slow muscle fibers and a complete loss of zzso muscle zzso In addition, zzso zzso have partial zzso and defects in jaw cartilage, circulation and fin zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by treatment of zzso zzso with zzso which zzso the response of cells to zzso signaling by indirect zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of Sonic zzso zzso or dominant negative zzso zzso in zzso zzso causes all zzso cells to develop into slow muscle zzso zzso of zzso does not rescue slow muscle fiber development in zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso Cell transplantation experiments confirm that zzso function is required zzso within the muscle zzso zzso muscle cells rescue slow muscle fiber development in zzso zzso whereas zzso muscle cells cannot develop into slow muscle fibers in zzso zzso Slow muscle fiber development in zzso zzso zzso is also rescued by expression of rat zzso zzso zzso signaling through zzso is necessary for slow muscle fiber type zzso We propose that zzso encodes a vital component in the zzso response zzso
