zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent regulator of zzso affecting zzso differentiation and migration of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cells depends on the origin of the cells and on the experimental zzso Global analysis of zzso zzso is expected to unveil mechanisms of this zzso and identify novel targets of the growth zzso Here, we report zzso profiling of human zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso which were treated with zzso and compared to zzso zzso We identified 54 proteins affected by zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso mass zzso Thirteen of the identified proteins are involved in various zzso zzso Seven proteins are involved in zzso zzso and six are involved in regulation of zzso Ten proteins were identical to predicted hypothetical proteins with no assigned zzso In agreement with the effect of zzso on components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also affected expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso A1 and zzso light chain proteins as shown by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso correlated with a weak zzso activity of zzso on zzso zzso Twenty-five of the identified proteins have not previously been described as being regulated by zzso providing new insights into zzso zzso in zzso zzso
