Signaling via zzso G protein coupled receptors triggers zzso of zzso on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in nuclear export of zzso and zzso of downstream target zzso In the previous paper we reported the important role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Huynh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 450 zzso zzso In the present paper, we provide evidence that zzso can directly zzso zzso of zzso The evidence is based on the following facts zzso isolated zzso fraction from human failing heart zzso contained zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and no significant activity was found for the zzso fraction after they were zzso with zzso specific zzso zzso specific zzso for zzso inhibited zzso activity from isolated fraction and zzso human zzso with similar zzso values; zzso zzso human zzso can directly zzso full length zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that in addition to zzso of protein zzso D zzso by zzso zzso and zzso at their zzso sites, zzso may also play a role in the regulation of zzso by zzso of zzso
