zzso stress is a strong zzso for depression in humans and is used to generate animal models of zzso It commonly leads to several major symptoms of depression, including zzso feeding zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although hypotheses defining the neural zzso of depression have been proposed, the critical synaptic adaptations in key brain circuits that mediate zzso depressive symptoms remain poorly zzso Here we show that chronic stress in mice decreases the strength of zzso zzso on D1 zzso zzso nucleus zzso medium zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso 4 zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso of zzso but not increases in zzso of zzso despair, are prevented by blocking these zzso 4 zzso synaptic changes in zzso These results establish that zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso synaptic adaptation in the nucleus zzso and that distinct circuit adaptations mediate other major symptoms of zzso zzso
