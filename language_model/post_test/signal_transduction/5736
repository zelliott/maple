The zzso zzso signaling zzso has been characterized as zzso for zzso growth, zzso and structural plasticity in the adult zzso central nervous zzso zzso and its zzso are highly expressed when zzso growth is abundant, however, the function of this zzso in neural development is zzso We have characterized zzso zzso zzso members and examined their role in the developing nervous system using zzso zzso that inhibit protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or a zzso zzso causes truncated outgrowth of peripheral nervous system zzso zzso of the head and lateral zzso zzso nerves also show increased zzso and numerous guidance zzso including zzso invading regions along the body flank that are normally zzso We propose that localized zzso expression defines zzso territories that through zzso restrict zzso growth to zzso zzso
