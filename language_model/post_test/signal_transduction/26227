zzso and zzso act in zzso to produce the factors required to maximize the production of zzso and male zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which these hormones support zzso are not well zzso Recently, we identified a zzso mechanism of testosterone signaling in cultured rat zzso zzso We found that testosterone binding to the zzso zzso recruits and activates zzso zzso zzso zzso then causes the zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso which results in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso In this report, we find that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso cells via the protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso as well as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso activity, reduced germ cell attachment to zzso cells in zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso is required for zzso increases in germ cell attachment to zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso zzso determined that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity is required for the release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest the zzso zzso zzso acts via zzso and zzso zzso to facilitate the zzso of immature germ cells to zzso cells and through zzso to permit the release of mature zzso In contrast, zzso acts to limit zzso zzso zzso activity and germ cell zzso
