The zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso triggers a variety of cellular responses that may be important for inflammatory reactions to tissue zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso can mediate zzso signaling in zzso expression zzso However, other candidate zzso receptors have been zzso and the extent to which one or more zzso account for zzso signaling in relevant differentiated cells is zzso We examined zzso signaling in zzso cells from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells responded to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso Relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, by zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, and by approximately zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells treated with a zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso zzso was used to assess zzso zzso Thus zzso is the main zzso zzso zzso in these zzso cell preparations and, together, zzso and zzso appear to account for approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso By contrast, in zzso zzso by itself accounted for virtually all zzso zzso zzso This information is critical for the design and interpretation of knockout mouse studies to probe the possible roles of zzso signaling in zzso
