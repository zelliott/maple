During early urinary tract infection zzso the interplay between invading bacteria and the zzso elicits a zzso response aimed at clearing zzso Unfortunately, the zzso inflammation and associated local tissue injury are responsible for patient zzso zzso zzso a zzso released during acute zzso has both zzso and zzso effects on other body zzso Within the zzso the zzso zzso origin, the target cell zzso and ultimate effect of the zzso on target cells are largely zzso In the present study we modeled the zzso zzso response ex zzso using canine zzso zzso mounted in zzso chambers to determine the inflammatory and zzso role of zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso coli infection stimulates the synthesis of zzso by all zzso cell zzso with the zzso cells alone representing the only site of unequivocal zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso were supported by the zzso of zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso a zzso approach, and quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso 5 target genes zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2) that have direct or indirect roles in promoting a zzso state were zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2, are also potentially important zzso of wound repair via the production of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso during acute zzso may serve a dual biological role by initiating the inflammatory response while also repairing zzso zzso
