zzso growth factor type beta zzso is a zzso factor that regulates proliferation and differentiation of many cell zzso zzso mediates its effects by binding to and zzso cell surface receptors that possess zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso signaling pathways through which zzso receptors act remain largely zzso Here we show that zzso activates a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso 5 zzso after zzso addition to the cells and occurred exclusively on zzso and zzso zzso This zzso is distinct from zzso zzso type II, as well as several zzso zzso zzso of similar size, including protein zzso C, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Indeed, these zzso can be separated almost completely from zzso zzso by zzso with specific zzso Furthermore, using different cell lines, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is activated only in cells for which zzso can act as a growth zzso zzso These data raise the interesting possibility that protein zzso zzso contribute to the zzso relay of biological signals originating from zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso
