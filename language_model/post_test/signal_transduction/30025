The zzso zzso domain 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to regulate the zzso zzso is suggested to result in the positive effect of zzso on cell zzso Whether zzso regulates zzso growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the level of zzso has yet to be zzso Furthermore, the identification of the zzso zzso target engaged by zzso in cell survival also has yet to be zzso Here, we show that zzso of a zzso inactive zzso of zzso inhibited zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the observation that zzso zzso in zzso signaling zzso expressing a deletion within zzso 3 of zzso which results in a zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso were hypersensitive to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso exhibited enhanced levels of zzso zzso 3 activity as compared to zzso zzso and the enhanced level of zzso 3 activity was suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso rescued the hypersensitivity to zzso zzso 3 zzso The effects of zzso zzso function on cell survival were not specific to the loss of the zzso zzso domain of zzso since zzso zzso of zzso also reduced cell zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the zzso activity of zzso is required to regulate the zzso zzso and thus likely zzso in zzso signaling by suppressing zzso zzso zzso
