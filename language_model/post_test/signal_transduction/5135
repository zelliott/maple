zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso recognizes zzso and zzso viral zzso and then zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand the roles of zzso in the fish immune system, zzso gene zzso was identified from Japanese zzso zzso zzso which consisted of 4 zzso and 3 zzso Its expression in peripheral blood zzso increased upon stimulation with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Exposure to viral zzso zzso virus increased expression of zzso in the blood, liver, head kidney and zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso zzso cells significantly induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells was significantly induced by zzso zzso zzso while expression of zzso genes and zzso reporter activity in zzso zzso cells increased upon stimulation by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the induction of zzso immune zzso
