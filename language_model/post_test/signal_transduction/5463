The zzso zzso zzso transmission in prefrontal zzso zzso is implicated in cognitive processes such as working zzso Our previous study has found that zzso current is subject to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso critically involved in various mental disorders associated with zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the cellular mechanism underlying zzso zzso of zzso We found that the density of surface clusters of zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso suggesting that the zzso reduction of zzso current is associated with a decrease in functional zzso at the plasma zzso Moreover, the zzso reduction of zzso current was blocked by the zzso stabilizer zzso and was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulates zzso trafficking via an zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso factor whose activity is strongly increased by zzso at zzso provides the possible link between zzso signaling and the zzso zzso Because zzso motor proteins are important for the transport of zzso along zzso zzso we also tested the potential involvement of zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso We found that dialysis with a zzso zzso which competes with zzso zzso proteins for zzso sites, prevented the zzso reduction of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity presumably via its zzso resulting in zzso zzso thus causing a decrease in the zzso transport of zzso clusters to the zzso
