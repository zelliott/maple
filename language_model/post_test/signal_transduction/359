The molecular mechanisms that control zzso aging and zzso age in females are poorly zzso Here, we provide genetic evidence that zzso protein zzso zzso signaling in zzso preserves zzso lifespan by maintaining the survival of zzso primordial zzso In mice lacking the zzso gene zzso in zzso the majority of primordial zzso are depleted around the onset of sexual maturity, causing premature zzso failure zzso during early zzso We further showed that suppressed zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso protein zzso zzso signaling in zzso appears to be responsible for the loss of primordial zzso and mice lacking the zzso gene in zzso show zzso similar to that in zzso zzso In combination with our earlier finding that zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso in zzso suppresses zzso zzso we have now zzso the molecular network involving zzso 3 zzso zzso signaling in zzso that controls the survival, loss and zzso of primordial zzso which together determine zzso aging and the length of zzso life in zzso zzso or zzso of this signaling zzso in zzso is shown to cause pathological conditions in the zzso including zzso and zzso
