The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the main zzso inhibitor zzso play important roles in cell migration and invasion in both zzso and pathological zzso Both factors are clinically zzso zzso markers in zzso breast cancer patients that are used to zzso patients for zzso zzso In addition to their classical functions in zzso regulation, both factors are key components in zzso cell zzso Such zzso zzso are well described in cell culture systems, but a better understanding of zzso and zzso zzso networks in clinical zzso is zzso We examined the expression of zzso zzso and 21 zzso molecules in 201 primary breast cancer zzso using protein zzso zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with the expression of zzso and zzso while expression of zzso was correlated with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso presumably via zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression did not reveal any significant correlation with staging, grading or age of the zzso The zzso expression was correlated with zzso zzso Network monitoring for zzso and zzso in breast cancer reveals interactions with main zzso zzso and extends the findings from cell culture zzso Our results reveal possible mechanisms underlying cancer zzso
