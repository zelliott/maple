zzso growth factor 2 zzso the potent bone anabolic agent, regulates the bone development, as well as the growth, zzso and healing of the zzso The zzso signaling of zzso leads to zzso of genes involved in cell zzso migration, differentiation and zzso However, little is known about zzso proteins in the zzso zzso in this study, protein profiling in zzso zzso zzso cells was evaluated using zzso zzso Six proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso translation termination factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein 84 zzso zzso sorting zzso 9 zzso and alpha zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso were increased more than zzso after the zzso zzso Also, two proteins including zzso and zzso 2 were decreased to zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso more than zzso The zzso of zzso significantly increased the proliferation of both the zzso and the primary mouse zzso zzso In contrast, significant reduction of the zzso expression of zzso by zzso remarkably suppressed the proliferation and induced the death of zzso After the zzso treatment, the resistance to zzso induced by serum deprivation was also significantly zzso The level of zzso was also reduced and the activity of zzso 3 significantly zzso In addition, zzso protection against zzso was abolished by the treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso is one of the important zzso of zzso induced survival signaling in zzso through the zzso of zzso survival zzso
