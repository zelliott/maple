Recent experiments demonstrated that forced expression of few critical genes drives conversion of a zzso into a zzso cell zzso These induced zzso cells zzso were first generated from zzso zzso by zzso zzso laboratory in zzso By using zzso zzso to express combinations of zzso zzso they identified zzso zzso zzso factor 4 and zzso as essential factors for zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments applied this technology to human and rat zzso as well as other cell types and several groups showed that zzso can be generated by an even smaller number of zzso zzso The efficiency of conversion and maintenance of a zzso state can be supported by small zzso such as zzso acid and specific pharmacological zzso This technology is a milestone for a basic understanding of cell zzso cell fate and zzso as well as for development of cell therapies and potential applications in animal zzso
