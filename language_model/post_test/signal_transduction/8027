Little is known about the role of the central zzso system in the control of fuel metabolism in peripheral zzso zzso muscle zzso protein zzso zzso is activated by zzso and serves as a master regulator of fatty acid zzso To zzso an unidentified role of the central zzso system in muscle zzso regulation, we treated conscious, unrestrained mice zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its target zzso zzso zzso independent of caloric zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso by the zzso of zzso or in zzso mice, which centrally express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso transgenic mice was not reversed by central zzso but was markedly restored by zzso Our data provide evidence for the critical role of the central zzso system in the zzso muscle zzso axis and highlight the system as a therapeutic target in zzso zzso
