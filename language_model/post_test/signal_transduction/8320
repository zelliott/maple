Treatment of sporadic cardiac zzso zzso has always been a challenging zzso Currently, surgical zzso remains the only zzso however, targeted drug discovery schemes are in progress in order to improve treatment strategies and zzso The molecular mechanisms behind CM zzso are still not totally unveiled thus drug target identification is still at early steps, trying to compile structured data on the zzso of zzso targets and targeting zzso Five critical disease pathways involving molecules of seven functional groups have been recently shown by us to be associated with the zzso of zzso In addition, 15 to 20 drug targets and their targeting molecules have also mapped on pathways in an effort to start decoding the molecular profiles based on which early efforts for CM patient zzso into targeted therapeutic zzso The present review describes the current data and discusses critical issues in the field of targeted and personalized medicine of zzso
