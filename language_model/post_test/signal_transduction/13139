We have isolated zzso defining a new zzso zzso that affect zzso cell fates and zzso during the development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause defects in the zzso of zzso cell fates in the descendants of the T blast cell, whose polarity is controlled by zzso signaling and cause abnormal male tail development leading to the formation of a zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso or pointy zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso which have a zzso or rounded tail, zzso of the tail tip zzso involves a temporally ordered set of cell zzso and changes in cell shape that appear to be zzso delayed in zzso zzso suggesting that subtle changes in these events can bring about evolutionary changes in zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein is expressed in the zzso of many cells during early zzso and then becomes restricted primarily to zzso zzso At zzso it is expressed in several head zzso the zzso zzso cells, tail zzso cells, the T cells and specific zzso zzso in a pattern that suggests zzso may be zzso expressed during the divisions of the T cell zzso Furthermore, the asymmetry of zzso expression and function appears to be controlled by zzso signals that control T cell zzso These results suggest that zzso encodes a zzso factor required for cellular asymmetry that functions downstream of zzso signals that control cell zzso as well as in cell fusion and patterning in the zzso zzso zzso
