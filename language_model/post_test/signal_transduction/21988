The innate immune system of insects include the Toll pathway, which is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso In the tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso promotes the synthesis of zzso proteins by zzso zzso the putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been observed to form a complex in zzso with zzso zzso zzso which has multiple alternative zzso zzso To investigate the regulation of zzso and its processing of zzso we characterized the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso formed an zzso complex with zzso in zzso The association rate constant of zzso and zzso was zzso with a zzso of zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso larvae resulted in decreased zzso zzso activity in zzso and reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in fat zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso functions to inhibit zzso and thereby zzso the concentration of active zzso to regulate the Toll zzso response in zzso zzso
