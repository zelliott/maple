zzso have multiple functions during peripheral nervous system development such as controlling zzso survival, target zzso and zzso zzso specificity has been attributed to the selective expression of the zzso zzso zzso receptors in different zzso zzso However, despite overlapping expression of zzso and zzso in many sensory zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso mice display selective losses in zzso zzso In the present study we have replaced the coding part of the zzso gene in mice with that of zzso zzso to zzso the specificity and selective roles of zzso and zzso during zzso Analysis of zzso mice showed striking differences in the ability of zzso to promote survival, short-range zzso and zzso in different sensory zzso In the zzso specificity is achieved by a tightly controlled spatial and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso system zzso or zzso zzso is sufficient to promote zzso zzso zzso survival, while zzso zzso is required to promote proper zzso and zzso In the zzso system, zzso is unable to replace the actions of zzso possibly because of a temporally selective expression of zzso in taste zzso We conclude that there is no general mechanism by which zzso specificity is attained and that specificity is achieved by zzso a tightly controlled spatial and zzso expression of zzso zzso different zzso receptors playing distinct roles within the same zzso zzso or zzso selective zzso expression in sensory zzso zzso
