After birth, the zzso zzso zzso dramatic transition from a sterile protected site to an environmentally exposed and permanently zzso zzso The mechanisms that facilitate this transition are ill zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso repression and zzso degradation of the essential zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso 1 zzso associated zzso 1 zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso innate immune tolerance and provide protection from zzso zzso damage in zzso Despite low zzso protein levels, continuous zzso and zzso signal zzso induced by zzso zzso persistence during the zzso period maintains tolerance through sustained zzso zzso zzso it additionally zzso zzso of a distinct set of genes involved in cell survival, zzso and zzso Thus, our results identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso innate immune tolerance during the zzso period and characterize tolerance as an active condition involved in the establishment of zzso zzso zzso
