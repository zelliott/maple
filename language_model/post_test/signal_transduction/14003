zzso zzso the zzso formation of zzso bone, occurs as a common complication of trauma or in genetic disorders and can be disabling and zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso restricts bone formation to the skeleton by zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso In progressive zzso zzso a human disease caused by zzso zzso in zzso which encodes zzso zzso signaling is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In animal models, we show that zzso zzso zzso signaling is sufficient to induce zzso zzso whereas zzso of this signaling zzso by genetic or pharmacological means strongly reduces the severity of this zzso As our previous work has shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells, resulting in their defective differentiation and zzso zzso we identify zzso as a key regulator of proper zzso differentiation through its maintenance of a balance between the zzso and zzso zzso Also, given the results here of the pharmacological studies in our mouse model, we propose that zzso zzso currently used in the clinic for other conditions, such as cancer, may possibly be zzso for treating zzso zzso and other diseases caused by zzso zzso
