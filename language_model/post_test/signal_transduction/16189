The zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsive to stress stimuli leading to zzso of zzso proteins and zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso has been zzso To selectively target zzso zzso zzso we exploited zzso interaction with its zzso scaffold, zzso using small interfering zzso zzso and a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso Gene zzso and zzso interference of this interaction disrupted zzso zzso to the zzso and reduced zzso of zzso without significant impact on zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented these three zzso zzso selectivity was also demonstrated in zzso zzso cells where zzso prevented zzso zzso cell death, loss of zzso membrane potential, and zzso generation but not zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented all aforementioned zzso zzso This probe introduces a means to evaluate zzso events on the zzso without intervening in nuclear functions of zzso
