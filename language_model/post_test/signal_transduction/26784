Physical activity zzso is beneficial to overall health, in part due to zzso changes that lower risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including reduced zzso However, the mechanism by which PA reduces inflammation is zzso One possible zzso is that PA improves body composition which in turn reduces zzso To test this hypothesis, we used structural equation modeling zzso to assess zzso composition zzso zzso as well as influences of zzso In a sample of 72 healthy males with a range of PA profiles (age zzso mean zzso zzso zzso ), we measured PA as zzso equivalent tasks (as per the International PA zzso body composition as percent body fat, lean mass, and fat mass, and inflammation as plasma zzso zzso We treated body composition in the zzso analysis as a zzso variable indicated by the three zzso We performed statistical corrections for missing values and one zzso The model demonstrated significant effects of PA on zzso both directly and through body zzso zzso body fat, fat mass, and lean mass were significant indicators of the body composition zzso zzso Additionally, age showed an indirect effect on zzso through body zzso but no direct zzso The findings suggest that PA does improve inflammatory profile through improving body zzso but that other pathways also zzso
