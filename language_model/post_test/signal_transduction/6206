Using a zzso approach, we searched for protein changes dependent on zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso nuclear zzso C1 and C2 zzso zzso two nuclear restricted zzso binding zzso are zzso to the zzso compartment in a zzso manner in zzso zzso cells, where nuclear envelopes remain zzso The zzso zzso change of zzso zzso appears to be dependent on zzso zzso change and independent of zzso execution and new protein zzso Such a zzso zzso is also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso the dominant active form of zzso we showed that a zzso signal is sufficient to induce zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso By using nuclear yellow fluorescent protein zzso fusion, we determined that the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso is a novel nuclear export signal responsive to zzso We conclude that a novel nuclear export is activated by the ROCK signaling zzso to exclude zzso zzso from nucleus, by which the zzso of specific zzso components is disturbed in zzso zzso
