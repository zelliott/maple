The zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be critical for cellular events, especially for those evoked by several environmental chemicals such as zzso zzso Whereas the function of the zzso in zzso toxicity is well zzso the importance of the recently cloned zzso in the zzso zzso signaling cascade is still zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene seems to be zzso expressed and its expression is altered by various zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso levels were found to be highly zzso zzso and zzso An zzso activity of the zzso on zzso signaling was proposed from zzso zzso However, there are not sufficient data showing such functional activity of the zzso in zzso This short overview summarizes the present knowledge about the zzso and should stimulate research in the zzso field to zzso its zzso function and its zzso importance in zzso zzso
