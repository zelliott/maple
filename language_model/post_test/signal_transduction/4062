The effect of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso was investigated in zzso mouse zzso and in zzso human zzso These cells have been shown recently to be sensitive and resistant to zzso respectively, in terms of cellular zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso induced a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso an increased zzso packing zzso in the plasma membrane of zzso The zzso effect, at 37 degrees C, was observed between 20 and 60 zzso after zzso administration, and followed by a gradual decrease of zzso zzso at longer times zzso zzso zzso did not change membrane fluidity of zzso below the phase transition temperature (at 18 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso of zzso zzso blocked the zzso decrease in membrane zzso Low zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to induce distinct signals zzso in membrane potential and zzso zzso zzso the plasma membrane of zzso This effect was partially blocked by zzso a blocker of zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso showed any change in their zzso zzso upon zzso in the plasma membrane of the resistant human zzso zzso zzso No other zzso event zzso potential change, zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in this cell zzso These data suggest that the changes in the membrane fluidity are likely consequences of specific, zzso zzso events, such as zzso zzso of the plasma membrane or zzso zzso These signals may induce changes in the zzso or lateral organization of membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso
