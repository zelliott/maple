Previous studies have shown that human airway zzso cells zzso can stimulate zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso We now sought to determine which zzso surface zzso zzso are involved in this zzso zzso zzso proliferation was inhibited by 25 zzso zzso or zzso A zzso and zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso after zzso with zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether zzso associated zzso or zzso and zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso were involved, we zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso line zzso expressing human zzso zzso or human zzso zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso an zzso cell line lacking class II zzso zzso After zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso peaked at 2 zzso whereas zzso zzso activity continued to rise at 8 zzso zzso zzso class II zzso stimulate zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso This zzso of zzso was not blocked by zzso of zzso with zzso I or zzso zzso An zzso generated in our laboratory, which recognizes an zzso specific surface zzso zzso zzso and which blocks zzso driven zzso zzso was shown to block zzso activity of peripheral blood zzso zzso though not of zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso are capable of stimulating zzso and zzso associated zzso and zzso associated zzso zzso through class II dependent and independent zzso
