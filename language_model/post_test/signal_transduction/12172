zzso and zzso execute a zzso relay to import the small Tim proteins into the zzso zzso zzso Here, we have zzso the zzso folding zzso in zzso with zzso as a zzso and determined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Specifically, zzso served as a direct zzso of zzso and zzso was required to zzso zzso During zzso four electrons were transferred from zzso with the zzso of two zzso bonds in zzso The extent of zzso zzso was directly dependent on zzso concentration and independent of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that electrons flowed from zzso with a more negative zzso potential of zzso zzso via zzso with an intermediate zzso potential of zzso zzso to the zzso pair of zzso with a positive zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso complexes between zzso and zzso were zzso zzso mutating zzso of the zzso zzso pair or zzso of the shuttle zzso pair in zzso abolished zzso of zzso whereas mutating the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso but not the structural zzso linkages of the zzso motif of zzso prevented zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso zzso and oxygen are the minimal machinery for zzso zzso
