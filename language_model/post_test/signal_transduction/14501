Plants recognize microbial pathogens by discriminating zzso molecular patterns from zzso We study the zzso disease resistance of soybean zzso max zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso senses a specific molecular pattern consisting of a zzso zzso that is present in the zzso cell zzso zzso of this zzso may be achieved through a zzso zzso which forms part of a proposed zzso zzso zzso soybean mounts a complex defense response, which includes the increase of the zzso calcium zzso the production of zzso oxygen species, and the zzso of genes responsible for the synthesis of zzso We now report the identification of two zzso protein zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso that may function as signaling elements in triggering the resistance zzso The use of specific zzso enabled the identification of zzso 3 and 6 whose activity is enhanced within the signaling zzso leading to defense zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso as well as the sensitivity against zzso suggested these zzso as part of the zzso signal zzso zzso An upstream zzso was identified based on sequence similarity to other plant zzso and its interaction with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly with zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, a preferential physical interaction between zzso and zzso was demonstrated in zzso These results suggest a role of a zzso cascade in zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso similar to other triggers that activate zzso during innate immune responses in zzso
