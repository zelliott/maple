In this study, we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with tolerance to zzso zzso infection and markedly decreased zzso of zzso as well as other genes regulated by the immune zzso innate immunity signaling zzso We present genetic evidence that this zzso affects a locus previously implicated in zzso zzso This genetic zzso which we have named mustard zzso contains a zzso domain, often involved in zzso recognition, and a zzso domain of unknown zzso More than 20 zzso zzso containing one or both of these zzso zzso are zzso We establish that the zzso zzso represents a gain of function and can be zzso by increased expression of a short, zzso localized zzso zzso comprised almost entirely of the zzso zzso We show that this zzso zzso does not block zzso zzso or zzso into the zzso Lastly, we present evidence suggesting that the zzso zzso previously attributed to the zzso locus may be the result of the zzso action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in resistance to zzso zzso However, to our knowledge this is the first evidence that zzso or its zzso alter the output of an innate immunity signaling cascade from within the zzso
