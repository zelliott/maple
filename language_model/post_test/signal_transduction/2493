To investigate the regulation of free zzso calcium concentration zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling system in zzso zzso zzso recordings were made in single zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a low concentration zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso step responses or repetitive zzso zzso which were blocked by the removal of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso with the protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso Thus zzso of the zzso system in alpha zzso zzso stimulates zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso spike was independent of zzso zzso and similar responses were observed by zzso of individual cells with zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso C zzso signaling zzso The zzso plateau depended on zzso influx, was blocked by zzso zzso but was only partially blocked by zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso increases in alpha zzso zzso through both the zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, this is the first clear demonstration that the zzso system can mediate changes in zzso in zzso zzso
