To investigate whether zzso acid zzso induced the zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in zzso and the underlying zzso 

zzso were treated with AA zzso 10 or 20 zzso for 12, 24 and 48 zzso Cell zzso were determined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to examine the zzso of zzso Western zzso was used to evaluate zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured using Western zzso and zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso with AA significantly decreased the cell zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso were observed in zzso zzso AA inhibited zzso zzso which was attenuated by zzso of the cells with zzso (20 zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, AA reduced zzso levels and increased zzso zzso 

AA zzso zzso of zzso in zzso via the zzso signaling zzso and by modulating the ratio zzso and zzso
