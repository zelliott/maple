Cellular and molecular mechanisms of methamphetamine zzso zzso may involve zzso of cellular zzso status and induction of inflammatory genes in zzso zzso To study these zzso molecular signaling pathways of zzso inflammatory responses via zzso of zzso zzso factors were investigated in human brain zzso zzso cells zzso A zzso depletion of total zzso levels was detected in zzso exposed to zzso In addition, zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed significant increases in DNA binding activities of zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso in zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was accompanied by induction of zzso of zzso or zzso as measured by dual zzso zzso using specific reporter zzso Because zzso and zzso are known to regulate expression of inflammatory zzso expression of the gene zzso for tumor necrosis zzso zzso was also studied in zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso gene was observed in zzso treated with zzso The importance of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso gene was confirmed in functional promoter studies using zzso of the zzso promoter with zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso disturbances in cellular zzso status and zzso of zzso and zzso can play critical roles in the signaling pathways leading to zzso of inflammatory genes in human brain zzso zzso
