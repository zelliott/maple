zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso or in zzso directly to zzso zzso zzso specific zzso interactions and cell signaling zzso zzso and zzso add zzso in zzso to the reducing terminal zzso zzso of zzso In zzso and other zzso zzso can also be added in zzso to the same zzso These zzso zzso are recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso providing a well-established marker for insect neural zzso To understand the mechanisms and consequences of zzso zzso zzso we identified a single zzso zzso that produces the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are temporally and zzso restricted to cells that express the zzso zzso and are missing in a zzso that lacks neural zzso zzso expression of zzso but not of any other candidate zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the embryonic nervous system of this zzso Mass zzso characterization of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms that this zzso is indeed responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Whereas zzso expression of zzso in the zzso wing disc produces mild wing zzso the zzso zzso expression of zzso in early zzso zzso generates zzso and cell migration zzso this latter effect is associated with reduced zzso levels in the zzso and indicates that the diversion of zzso resources towards zzso of zzso has an impact on zzso signaling associated with zzso
