Natural zzso zzso of zzso zzso dynamics have long been recognized as valuable molecular zzso for zzso complex mechanisms of cellular zzso More recently, their potential use as zzso drugs has become a focus of scientific zzso The primary focus of this review is the molecular mechanism by which different zzso natural products function, with an emphasis on structural considerations of toxins for which high-resolution structural information of their interaction with zzso is zzso By comparing the molecular interactions made by different toxin families with zzso the structural themes of those that alter filament dynamics in similar ways can be zzso This provides a framework for novel zzso designs with tailored functional properties that could be applied in both research and clinical zzso
