zzso a pathological condition defined by zzso zzso architecture resulting from progressive fibrosis, is the final common zzso through which nearly all chronic diseases of the liver produce morbidity and zzso Historically, treatments for zzso zzso have been directed against specific causes of chronic liver injury, and include zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso B and C, and iron depletion for zzso However, there is no effective treatment for most causes of chronic liver zzso Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed great advances in our understanding of the fundamental zzso mechanisms underlying zzso of the zzso It is now zzso that zzso zzso cells zzso cells that zzso the zzso are primarily responsible for zzso zzso and subsequent progression to zzso In response to liver injury zzso cells undergo a zzso transformation that is termed zzso and zzso by zzso zzso contraction, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Under conditions of persistent injury the zzso responses of these zzso cells act in concert to bring about zzso of the zzso Recent investigations zzso the signal zzso pathways that link zzso injury to zzso cell function suggest novel targets at which treatment for zzso may be zzso For example, antagonism of zzso zzso signaling has been shown to zzso zzso in animal zzso This work, as well as other studies in both humans and animals, indicates that zzso zzso may be slowed or zzso These results suggest that a rational approach to treatment can be developed based on our detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying zzso which will have a major impact on the clinical management of patients with chronic liver zzso
