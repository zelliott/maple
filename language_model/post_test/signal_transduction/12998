zzso can activate zzso zzso T cells and induce zzso Here we show in a zzso T zzso model of type 1 diabetes that zzso zzso cells prevent beta cell destruction following localized inflammation in the zzso of zzso These zzso cells accumulate zzso in the pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso but not other zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells are extremely zzso only 2 zzso zzso cells are needed to prevent diabetes development, and their capacity to regulate is dependent on zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, blockade of this zzso results in decreased frequency of zzso zzso cells in the zzso resulting in zzso differentiation of zzso T cells into zzso and rapid progression to zzso
