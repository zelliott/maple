Increased zzso germ cell zzso has been reported in zzso zzso We studied intrinsic or zzso zzso of zzso by detecting zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso expressions in the bilateral zzso of experimental zzso zzso 

Experimental left zzso zzso was created by partial zzso of left zzso vein in a study group of 24 adult male zzso zzso The other 24 rats were as control zzso Eight rats from each group were killed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks following zzso zzso zzso zzso of both groups were sampled for zzso zzso and zzso 

Increased zzso germ cell was found in the zzso zzso of zzso group at 8 and 12 weeks after operation zzso zzso zzso Increased activated zzso expression in the zzso (right) zzso was noted at 12 weeks following zzso creation zzso zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates zzso of zzso expression and increased expressions of zzso and activated zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso rats at 8 and 12 weeks, indicating gradually increased zzso zzso zzso through the intrinsic zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in the zzso zzso was observed at 12 weeks zzso zzso zzso following zzso creation zzso
