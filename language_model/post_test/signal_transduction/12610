The pancreatic duct zzso is remarkable for its capacity to zzso zzso zzso at zzso as high as 140 zzso The properties of the key zzso involved in this process and the central role played by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso are the main focus of this zzso 

The zzso zzso at the zzso membrane of pancreatic duct cells is now known to be zzso The 1: 2 zzso and zzso of this zzso enable it to contribute to the zzso of zzso at high zzso The zzso zzso channels also appear to have sufficient zzso zzso to contribute directly to zzso zzso There is a strong possibility that the zzso zzso channels at the zzso membrane are members of the zzso family which, like zzso are also permeable to zzso More has been learned about the complex interactions between zzso and other zzso within zzso complexes coordinated at the zzso membrane by scaffolding zzso Further details are also emerging of the protective zzso roles of zzso zzso zzso acids and zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso 

Most of the key zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso have now been identified and zzso Current research focuses on the molecular interactions between these zzso and the ways in which they are regulated by zzso zzso
