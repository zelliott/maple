zzso factor 1 zzso is unique among the zzso family, lacking most zzso features, and showing marked zzso following zzso zzso However, the biological roles that zzso plays in immune cell signaling have been zzso with many reports assigning contradictory roles to zzso The overlapping binding site for zzso 1, 2, and 3 on many zzso zzso zzso together with the early zzso of mice deficient in zzso 2 and 3, has complicated the quest for a clear understanding of the functions of zzso Using a new method for gene targeting by zzso zzso in zzso cells, we produced and studied signaling by zzso and its viral zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso in mouse B cell lines lacking zzso zzso or both zzso zzso indicate that zzso 1 and 2 cooperate in zzso zzso of the B cell lines, with a dual zzso leading to a markedly greater loss of function than that of either zzso zzso In the absence of zzso an increased amount of zzso was recruited to zzso zzso and zzso more robust degradation of zzso and zzso was induced in response to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not require either zzso 1 or 2 to induce zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso and zzso cooperate in zzso but not zzso signaling and suggest that cellular levels of zzso may play an important role in modulating the degradation of zzso and zzso in response to signals from the zzso zzso
