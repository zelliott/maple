zzso and zzso are members of the zzso family of zzso factors that are both expressed in the developing visual system of zzso zzso zzso protein is present in all cells that form the neural zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso is located primarily in cells that will give rise to the zzso zzso In this study, we have addressed the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso and in the subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is severely zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulting in an absence of zzso zzso zzso tissue and fusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso in a bridge of tissue around the anterior pole of the neural zzso in the position normally occupied by cells that form the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protein is almost completely absent from this region in zzso zzso zzso with the changes in zzso protein distribution, cells in the position of the zzso stalks differentiate as zzso These results suggest that a signal emanating from the zzso which is absent in zzso zzso zzso may be required to promote zzso and inhibit zzso expression in cells destined to form the zzso zzso Sonic zzso zzso also known as zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is absent from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at early zzso zzso To test the possibility that zzso might be able to regulate the spatial expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso it was zzso in the developing zzso The number of cells containing zzso was increased following zzso zzso and zzso developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the changes in zzso distribution, there were fewer zzso cells and zzso zzso and neural zzso were zzso Our results suggest that zzso or a closely related zzso zzso emanating from zzso tissue in the zzso zzso either directly or indirectly zzso the expression of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and thus may regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso stalks and retinal zzso
