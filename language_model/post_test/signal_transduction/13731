The brain is astonishing in its complexity and capacity for zzso This has fascinated scientists for more than a century, filling the pages of this journal for the past 25 zzso But a paradigm shift is zzso It seems likely that the plasticity that drives our ability to learn and remember can only be meaningful in the context of otherwise stable, zzso and predictable baseline neural zzso Without the existence of potent mechanisms that stabilize neural function, our capacity to learn and remember would be lost in the chaos of daily experiential zzso This underscores two great mysteries in zzso How are the functional properties of individual zzso and neural circuits zzso maintained throughout life? And, in the face of potent stabilizing mechanisms, how can neural zzso be modified during neural development, learning, and zzso Answers are emerging in the rapidly developing field of zzso zzso
