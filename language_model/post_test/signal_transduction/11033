Many of the genes that affect aging and longevity in model organisms, such as mice, fruit flies, and zzso have human zzso This article reviews several genetic pathways that may extend lifespan through effects on aging, rather than through effects on diseases such as zzso or zzso These include some of the genes involved in the regulation of DNA repair and nuclear structure, which cause the zzso syndromes when zzso as well as those that may affect zzso zzso since shorter zzso have been associated with shorter zzso Other potential longevity zzso such as zzso are involved in regulating the response to cellular stress, including caloric zzso The zzso zzso involves insulin and zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso in zzso of these genes have extended lifespan up to zzso in model zzso Other potential candidates include zzso DNA and the genes that regulate the inflammatory zzso Despite the challenges in study design and analysis that face investigators in this area, the identification of genetic pathways that regulate longevity may suggest potential targets for zzso
