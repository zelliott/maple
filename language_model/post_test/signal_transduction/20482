zzso coupled receptors zzso have long been known as receptors that activate G zzso cellular signaling zzso In addition to the G zzso zzso recent reports have revealed that several zzso called zzso zzso elicit G zzso and zzso signaling through zzso zzso zzso Several zzso are known as biased zzso All zzso inhibit the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso In addition to zzso action, some zzso are reported to induce cellular responses through G zzso and zzso signaling zzso However, the zzso significance induced by the zzso zzso remains much to be clarified in zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a zzso zzso blocker, could induce cardiac zzso through a G zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso increased the expression of zzso genes responsible for cardiac zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso induced the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and zzso by zzso was impaired in the G zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso led to cardiac zzso However, the zzso zzso and cardiac dysfunction were not evoked in zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a biased zzso that selectively activates a G zzso and zzso pathway, and zzso cardiac zzso This study demonstrates the zzso importance of biased zzso and suggests that G zzso and zzso signaling is a reason for the diversity of the effectiveness of zzso
