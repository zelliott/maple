zzso is an important factor in zzso signal zzso zzso with ability for signal zzso it could zzso from zzso to nucleus after the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is found recently to be able to function in the regulation of zzso zzso However, no zzso data have been yet reported, and it still keeps zzso whether or not zzso could regulate zzso activity by depending on zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work, by analyzing the zzso location in zzso cells according to the zzso zzso Analysis zzso based on IN Cell zzso 1000 platform, zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated by zzso was zzso zzso The results showed that zzso could induce zzso zzso from zzso to nucleus by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso could impede the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a zzso zzso could zzso such a zzso zzso activity by almost one order of zzso This result thereby implies that zzso might inhibit zzso zzso through zzso zzso Further investigation discovered that different from the case for zzso zzso another zzso zzso could enhance zzso zzso to nucleus, suggesting that zzso and zzso might take different modes in the zzso of zzso within the signaling zzso
