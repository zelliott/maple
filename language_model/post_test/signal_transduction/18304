zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso induced a transient increase in vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso were similar in zzso challenged with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso peaked at 2 hours and decreased to control levels by approximately 6 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with a zzso increase of zzso protein expression that displayed similar zzso in response to either zzso or zzso zzso Both the increase in zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in response to either zzso or zzso II were inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso synthesis was tightly coupled to expression of zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis may be associated with differential usage of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso increases in DNA content and cell number by approximately zzso These findings suggest that a zzso derived from zzso possibly zzso may contribute to zzso zzso in vessel injury or zzso conditions associated with elevated levels of either zzso or zzso zzso
