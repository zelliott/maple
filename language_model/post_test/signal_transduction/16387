The zzso signal zzso zzso is an zzso signaling cascade that zzso environmental signals from activated zzso zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface and other zzso to zzso factors in the nucleus, thereby linking zzso stimuli to changes in gene zzso Largely as a consequence of its role in zzso zzso signaling has been the subject of intense research efforts for many zzso More recently, it has been shown that milder zzso in Ras signaling during zzso also contribute to the zzso of a group of human zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of the first zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso A single zzso acid substitution zzso in the highly zzso switch II region of Ras causes a defective protein with reduced intrinsic zzso activity, but with normal sensitivity to GAP zzso The zzso zzso is zzso viable but causes various zzso defects associated with elevated Ras zzso including cell fate changes and zzso survival of cells in the nervous zzso These zzso and functional properties are reminiscent of zzso Ras zzso found in patients afflicted with zzso Costello or zzso zzso Finally, we used zzso to identify novel genes that interact with Ras and suppress cell zzso
