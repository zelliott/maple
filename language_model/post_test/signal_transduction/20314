The zzso hormone zzso is a zzso zzso factor that plays a major role in the regulation of zzso balance in fish, with demonstrated actions mainly in the zzso and zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso transport remains little zzso In marine fish, which have high drinking rates, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso produces zzso zzso zzso believed to play a key role in water and zzso zzso The present study was designed to establish the putative role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in a marine zzso zzso addition of zzso to the anterior zzso of sea zzso mounted in zzso chambers caused a rapid zzso zzso decrease of zzso zzso measured by zzso A clear zzso zzso curve was zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The threshold concentration of zzso for a significant effect on zzso zzso was 10 zzso zzso which is comparable with putative plasma levels in seawater zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso was independent of the generation route for zzso as shown in a preparation devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso caused a zzso reduction in the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and demonstrated the involvement of zzso zzso In addition to rapid effects, zzso has actions at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of anterior zzso of the sea zzso in zzso for 3 h demonstrated a specific effect of zzso on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso but not on the zzso or zzso zzso zzso We propose a new role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso an essential function for zzso zzso in the zzso of marine zzso
