zzso was first identified and characterized from rat stomach as an zzso zzso for the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also acts as an zzso factor and regulates energy balance in zzso In zzso native zzso consists of 11 molecular zzso the major form being a zzso zzso with zzso acid modification zzso zzso and zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso central actions such as stimulation of food intake and suppression of locomotor activity through zzso zzso Four types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso and one zzso zzso can activate only zzso in zzso However, there is no information about the effect of zzso on food intake and locomotor activity in goldfish in zzso zzso in the present study, we examined whether zzso zzso would mimic the zzso action of zzso zzso and its suppression of locomotor zzso zzso administration of zzso at zzso body weight zzso zzso food zzso and was zzso to the zzso action of zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso zzso also induced a significant decrease of locomotor activity, as was the case for zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso The action of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso at 160 zzso zzso These results suggest that the central action of zzso might be zzso via the zzso pathway, and subsequently through zzso zzso in zzso
