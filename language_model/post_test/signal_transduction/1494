Exposure to ethanol during fetal development zzso brain damage, causing cell loss in several brain areas and affecting synaptic zzso Because zzso signaling plays an important role in zzso survival and zzso we have investigated the effect of ethanol exposure on cell death in the developing cerebral zzso and whether this effect zzso with zzso in zzso zzso factor zzso levels, expression of its zzso zzso and its zzso We report that chronic ethanol intake during gestation and zzso enhances natural cell death and zzso cell zzso decreases zzso levels, and increases the ratio of the truncated to full-length zzso zzso receptors during zzso developing cerebral zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that during brain development zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso cell signaling throughout the zzso survival pathways is significantly reduced by ethanol zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso in zzso availability and in its zzso function might impair zzso signaling pathways involved in cell survival, growth, and zzso leading to enhanced natural cell death during cerebral zzso zzso
