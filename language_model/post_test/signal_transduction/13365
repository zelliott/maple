The zzso family of zzso zzso encodes three highly similar proteins with the same modular zzso a WW domain and two zzso zzso The zzso domain of these proteins binds to the zzso zzso of the Alzheimer's zzso precursor protein zzso and related proteins zzso and zzso generating a highly redundant system that is hard to dissect by reverse zzso By searching potential zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso we identified a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein with a high sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso is also functionally related to zzso zzso in fact its zzso domain binds to zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with specific zzso show that the zzso structures of the zzso are the sites in which zzso is present at highest zzso zzso studies with reporters indicate that the zzso gene is also expressed by a subset of the zzso zzso We generated and isolated a deletion zzso of zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso arrest as late zzso or as zzso larvae, demonstrating for the first time an essential role for a zzso gene in zzso The zzso of zzso larvae does not contract and the worms cannot zzso Analysis of zzso pumping in zzso worms and in zzso zzso worms indicates that dosage of zzso function affects the rate of zzso contraction in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed a similar effect on zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are involved in the same zzso The zzso system of the zzso will prove useful for studying the basic biology of the zzso interaction and the molecular events regulated by this zzso zzso system of interacting zzso
