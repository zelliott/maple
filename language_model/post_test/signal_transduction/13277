zzso excess leads to insulin zzso This study explores the effects of zzso on the zzso transport system and insulin zzso in rat zzso The interaction between zzso and high levels of insulin and zzso is also zzso 

zzso rat zzso were cultured for 24 h at different zzso zzso (5 and 15 zzso with or without the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso After the culture period, the cells were washed and then zzso and zzso zzso zzso insulin binding and zzso as well as cellular content of insulin zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso in the medium markedly decreased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso at both 5 and 15 zzso zzso (by approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso Combined long-term treatment with insulin and zzso exerted additive effects in decreasing zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso compared with zzso alone, but this was seen only at high zzso (15 zzso zzso binding was decreased (by approximately zzso zzso in zzso cells independently of surrounding zzso zzso Following zzso treatment a approximately zzso decrease zzso in zzso expression and an increase in zzso (by approximately zzso zzso was zzso zzso also induced a subtle decrease in zzso (by approximately zzso zzso and a substantial decrease in zzso content (by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased (by approximately zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not alter the amount of total cellular zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso per zzso on zzso transport and insulin zzso proteins were mainly unaffected by the surrounding zzso and insulin zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso but did not alter the zzso effect of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso independently of the surrounding zzso and insulin zzso impair zzso transport capacity in fat zzso This is not due to zzso in zzso zzso Instead zzso insulin resistance may be zzso via reduced cellular content of zzso and zzso accompanied by a parallel reduction in zzso zzso of zzso
