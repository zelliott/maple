Drug addiction and obesity share the core feature that those afflicted by the disorders express a desire to limit drug or food consumption yet persist despite negative zzso Emerging evidence suggests that the zzso that defines these disorders may zzso to some degree at least, from common underlying zzso zzso In particular, both disorders are associated with diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso likely reflecting their decreased maturation and surface zzso In zzso zzso are expressed by approximately half of the principal medium zzso projection zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the so-called zzso zzso zzso are also expressed zzso on zzso terminals and on zzso zzso This zzso of zzso expression has hindered attempts, largely using traditional pharmacological approaches, to understand their contribution to compulsive drug or food zzso The emergence of genetic technologies to target discrete populations of zzso coupled to zzso and zzso tools to manipulate their activity, have provided a means to dissect zzso and zzso contributions to zzso Here, we review recent evidence supporting an important role for zzso zzso signaling in compulsive drug use and food zzso We pay particular attention to zzso projection zzso and their role in compulsive responding for food and zzso Finally, we identify opportunities for future obesity research using known mechanisms of addiction as a zzso and leveraging new tools to manipulate activity of specific populations of zzso zzso to understand their contributions to addiction and zzso
