Since their zzso display technologies have proven useful for the selection of zzso against a variety of zzso however, most of the zzso selected with the currently available platforms need to be further modified for their use in humans, and are restricted to accessible zzso Furthermore, these platforms are not well suited for in zzso zzso We present here a novel cell based zzso display platform, which takes advantage of the functional capabilities of T zzso The display of zzso on the surface of T zzso as a part of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso link the zzso interaction to a zzso change in T cell zzso due to subsequent expression of the early T cell zzso marker zzso In this zzso an in zzso selection was carried out using a human T cell line zzso to express a zzso zzso on the surface, against a human tumor cell line expressing the zzso zzso Based on an effective interaction between the zzso and the tumor zzso we demonstrated that combining zzso zzso with zzso sorting of zzso T cells, it is possible to isolate zzso to tumor specific cell surface zzso with an enrichment factor of at least zzso after two zzso resulting in a homogeneous population of T cells expressing zzso zzso
