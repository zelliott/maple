The zzso zzso lateral line zzso is a sensory system that comprises clusters of zzso zzso called zzso zzso that are zzso positioned along the surface of the zzso The zzso are deposited by a zzso zzso zzso which is organized into polarized zzso zzso During migration, mature zzso are deposited from the trailing part of the zzso while zzso cells in the leading part give rise to new zzso zzso signaling is active in the leading zone of the zzso and global zzso zzso leads to dramatic disorganization of the zzso and a loss of zzso zzso However, the exact cellular events that are regulated by the zzso zzso are not zzso We identified a zzso strain, zzso that contains a zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso lack zzso zzso and live imaging reveals that zzso renewal fails during later stages of zzso Surprisingly, the overall zzso zzso as zzso by the expression of various zzso appears zzso in zzso zzso zzso tracing and mosaic analyses revealed that the leading cells zzso zzso move out of the zzso and are incorporated into zzso this results in a decrease in the number of zzso zzso cells and eventual zzso zzso We concluded that zzso function is not required for initial zzso organization or migration, but is necessary for zzso renewal during later stages of zzso zzso These findings revealed a novel role for the zzso signaling zzso during zzso organ formation in zzso
