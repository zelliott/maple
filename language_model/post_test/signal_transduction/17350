Members of the zzso zzso binding domain, zzso repeat zzso zzso family of proteins are key zzso of innate immunity regulating zzso To date, microbial zzso molecules and toxins have been identified as key triggers of zzso of zzso However, recently, zzso and neurodegenerative stimuli have been identified that lead to zzso release by means of zzso zzso plays a crucial role during brain zzso and zzso appears to be a key zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regulation of gene expression within the brain during zzso We show here that exposure of a human zzso cell line zzso zzso to zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso synthesis is investigated through specific zzso of this zzso zzso The effect of zzso was abolished in the presence of zzso zzso as zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells do not respond to zzso stimulation in spite of zzso zzso These results provide a mechanism by which danger signals and particulate matter mediate inflammation via the zzso in the absence of microbial zzso
