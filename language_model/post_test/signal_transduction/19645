zzso taste zzso cells depend on distinct calcium signals to generate appropriate cellular responses that relay taste information to the central nervous zzso Some taste cells have conventional chemical zzso and rely on calcium influx through zzso calcium zzso Other taste cells lack these zzso and depend on calcium release from stores to formulate an output signal through a zzso Despite the importance of calcium signaling in taste cells, little is known about how these signals are zzso This review summarizes recent studies that have identified 2 calcium clearance mechanisms expressed in taste cells, including zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso zzso These studies identified a unique zzso calcium influx that contributes to maintaining appropriate calcium zzso in taste cells and the role of the zzso and zzso in this zzso The additional role of zzso in the regulation of evoked calcium responses is also zzso Clearly, calcium signaling is a dynamic process in taste cells and appears to be more complex than has previously been zzso
