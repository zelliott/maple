To identify functions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso that require zzso activity, we generated an zzso zzso zzso containing zzso instead of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso mice are healthy and zzso but females display a severe zzso zzso due to impaired proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells during pregnancy and in response to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also required for optimal zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso signaling or zzso D1 expression results in the same zzso effect as the zzso zzso which is completely suppressed by a zzso specific zzso D1 zzso Thus, zzso is a critical intermediate in a zzso that controls zzso zzso proliferation in response to zzso signaling via zzso zzso
