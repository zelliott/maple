The zzso characteristics of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by using the cat iris zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated for each zzso The relative zzso zzso zzso of the compounds were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso The maximum response induced by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso maximum response relative to zzso was significantly greater than that induced by all the other PG compounds zzso zzso zzso - P zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso behaved as a moderate efficacy partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 190 zzso 63 zzso zzso maximum response relative to zzso indicating that the cat iris contains an extremely zzso zzso population, and/or the tissue contains an extremely high density of the zzso and/or spare zzso The cat iris contraction data were well correlated with other zzso zzso zzso including zzso binding in bovine corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in human iris zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso muscle and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso turnover in rat and mouse cells zzso zzso zzso - zzso and via cloned human zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso contraction zzso zzso zzso These data confirm the presence of functional zzso in the cat iris zzso which are exquisitely well coupled and which respond to a variety of zzso PG zzso with differing zzso
