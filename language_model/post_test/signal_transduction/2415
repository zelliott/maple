The zzso family protein zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso development and T cell zzso zzso signal zzso zzso has been shown to associate with the zzso complex, the protein zzso zzso zzso and several zzso such as zzso which are crucial for initiating T cell zzso and zzso The molecular basis of how zzso is associated with these zzso proteins is largely zzso To investigate the zzso association with the zzso complex, zzso and zzso at the molecular level, various zzso fusion proteins were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso experiments applying zzso zzso and double zzso zzso techniques were used to study the association of these fusion proteins with the zzso complex, zzso and zzso Our results revealed that zzso of zzso with the zzso complex requires the unique N zzso whereas zzso with zzso depends on the unique N zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso molecules that contain the N zzso and a functional zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso association with the zzso complex, zzso and zzso is zzso by different molecular zzso
