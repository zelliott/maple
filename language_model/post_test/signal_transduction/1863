The zzso hormone, zzso acts via the central nervous system to zzso zzso metabolism by skeletal muscle, but the direct effects of zzso on zzso metabolism by skeletal muscle are zzso In this study, we have examined effects of zzso on zzso zzso by cultured zzso muscle cells assessed with the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso muscle cells express a short zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but not the long zzso zzso In the absence of added insulin, incubation of zzso muscle cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso and 1 h increased zzso zzso by 15 % - 23 zzso This effect of zzso was lost by 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso initially (after 10 zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso by 14 - 16 zzso but had no effect in the longer zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso can act directly on zzso muscle zzso a short zzso zzso zzso to acutely stimulate zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso
