zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to play important roles in zzso cell injury, and tumor zzso However, the cellular site of action has not been clearly defined as it has long been recognized that group zzso zzso is both a zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso target of the group zzso zzso and its role in zzso zzso by growth factor zzso Cloning of the rat liver group zzso zzso demonstrated a typical zzso signal and no alternative zzso of the primary zzso When a sequence including the signal zzso and first 8 zzso in the mature zzso or the entire zzso (including the signal zzso was fused to enhanced green fluorescent zzso the fusion protein was directed to the zzso zzso rather than zzso in baby zzso kidney zzso zzso To examine the role of group zzso zzso in cell injury, wild type zzso rat group zzso zzso and a zzso group zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso (at the zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cells and cells zzso expressing these zzso were zzso After deprivation of growth factors, both normal zzso cells and zzso cells expressing zzso zzso underwent massive zzso while zzso cells expressing zzso zzso showed considerable resistance to growth factor zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso resistance to zzso in the zzso zzso expressing zzso These two zzso did not induce cell death in the presence of fetal bovine serum, suggesting that they induce cell death by blocking zzso generated survival zzso This study demonstrates that group zzso zzso generates zzso survival signals in zzso cells targeting the zzso pathway, and suggests that high levels of group zzso zzso accumulated at inflammatory sites may not only regulate zzso but also may protect cells from unnecessary death induced by zzso zzso
