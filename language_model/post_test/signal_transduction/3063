The mechanism underlying remote zzso conditioning zzso remains zzso We investigated whether zzso protects the heart through the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at the onset of zzso zzso 

Domestic pigs zzso zzso were subjected to in zzso left anterior descending coronary artery zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso No additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycles of lower limb zzso were administered prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso an zzso zzso zzso were administered zzso 30 s before zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycles of lower limb zzso were applied 1 zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso were given 30 s before zzso zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso versus zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso versus zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence the zzso effects of either zzso or zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

In the zzso heart, both zzso and zzso both reduce zzso zzso size and with zzso but not zzso this zzso effect is associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso
