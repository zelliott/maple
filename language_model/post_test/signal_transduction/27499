We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of zzso zzso through the human zzso zzso zzso By functionally expressing zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso we could show that zzso zzso zzso within the zzso alpha chain are zzso for zzso zzso zzso However, disruption of a zzso zzso sequence motif zzso in either zzso of the zzso zzso abolished not only zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso A zzso version of zzso but not of zzso zzso with zzso DNA synthesis in zzso cells, suggesting an involvement of zzso in the control of cell proliferation through zzso zzso gene experiments finally showed that zzso from promoters of zzso target genes can be specifically induced by challenging cells with zzso and that both zzso and zzso can contribute to zzso zzso zzso
