Recent evidence suggests that the rare and progressive lung disease zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso of the tumor zzso genes zzso sclerosis complex zzso in particular zzso zzso of zzso enhances both cell proliferation and zzso Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the role of zzso in abnormal zzso cell proliferation and its pharmacological zzso the mechanisms underlying the enhanced migratory capacity in zzso are not well zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso in cell attachment, zzso and migration, processes that contribute to the zzso zzso Here we show that loss of zzso increased both the attachment and spreading of mouse embryonic zzso to the zzso zzso proteins collagen type I and zzso and that zzso of zzso reduced these zzso zzso modulated cell migration with the zzso involved in cell attachment and spreading as shown by using functional blocking zzso Loss of zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso zzso reduced cell zzso The enhanced attachment and spreading were independent of the zzso signaling pathways zzso target of zzso complex 1 and zzso zzso as pharmacological zzso with zzso or zzso respectively, was without zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso controls cell migration, attachment, and spreading through the zzso zzso and thus suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of increased cell zzso in zzso
