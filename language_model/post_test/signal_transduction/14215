Aging zzso impacts on the function of resident human cardiac zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of the injured heart requires zzso of zzso to the sites of zzso In the young heart, signaling by the guidance zzso zzso in response to the zzso A1 zzso promotes zzso zzso and improves cardiac recovery after zzso 

We report that old zzso are characterized by zzso zzso of their migratory ability ex zzso and impaired zzso in zzso in the damaged zzso zzso expression was not decreased in old zzso however, the elevated level of zzso oxygen species in aged cells induced zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso family zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Cellular aging altered the zzso zzso route, affecting the maturation of zzso zzso and causing premature signal zzso zzso of functionally intact zzso in old zzso corrected the defects in zzso and downstream zzso enhancing cell zzso Based on the ability of zzso young zzso to respond efficiently to zzso zzso we developed a novel methodology for the prospective isolation of live zzso with preserved migratory capacity and growth zzso 

Our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso may serve as a target to facilitate trafficking of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function can be implemented for the selection of zzso with high therapeutic potential, a clinically relevant strategy that does not require genetic manipulation of stem zzso
