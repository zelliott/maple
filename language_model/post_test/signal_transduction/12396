The zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso is probably the zzso zzso system in zzso cells, and it also has become a popular example for employing mathematical modeling to cellular signaling zzso Dynamic models have the highest explanatory and zzso zzso however, the lack of kinetic information restricts current models of zzso signaling to smaller zzso This work aims to provide a large-scale qualitative model that comprises the main and also the side routes of zzso signaling and that still enables one to derive important functional properties and zzso Using a recently introduced logical modeling zzso we first examined general zzso properties and the qualitative zzso behavior of the zzso With species zzso classes, we introduce a new technique for logical networks that reveals sets of zzso strongly coupled in their zzso We also analyzed a model zzso which explicitly accounts for uncertainties regarding the logical combination of signals in the zzso The zzso power of this model is still high, indicating highly redundant zzso in the zzso Finally, one key advance of this work is the introduction of new techniques for assessing zzso data with logical models (and their underlying interaction zzso By employing these techniques for zzso data from primary zzso and the zzso cell line, we demonstrate that our approach enables one to uncover inconsistencies between experimental results and our current qualitative knowledge and to generate new hypotheses and zzso Our results strongly suggest that the zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso are independent of zzso in both primary zzso and zzso Furthermore, we detected that the zzso of zzso in response to zzso follows a zzso signaling zzso
