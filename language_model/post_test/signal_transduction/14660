zzso zzso acid zzso is a naturally occurring compound found in dairy and beef zzso In recent years, it has received considerable attention because several studies showed a lower zzso of certain zzso in animals fed zzso zzso In zzso studies further showed growth zzso activity on tumor cell zzso the zzso being effective above all against colon cancer zzso The aim of the present work was to investigate the growth zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso Under our experimental conditions, zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and the zzso action increased by repeating zzso However, in zzso cells, zzso was unable to induce zzso as revealed by zzso analysis and Western zzso zzso To determine the mechanism by which zzso zzso cell growth, we studied its effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid reduced expression levels of zzso and zzso of zzso which was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the downstream zzso factor zzso Our data suggest that zzso is dependent, at least in part, on the zzso zzso zzso for its ability to inhibit the growth of zzso cancer zzso
