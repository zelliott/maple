The formation of the hair zzso and its cyclical growth, zzso and zzso depend on zzso signaling between its zzso and zzso zzso The zzso organizing center, the zzso zzso zzso regulates development of the zzso zzso and is dependent on signals from the zzso for its development and zzso zzso specifically expressed in zzso cells of a transgenic mouse was used to purify this population and study the signals required to maintain zzso We demonstrate that specific zzso but not Sonic zzso zzso maintain zzso gene expression in zzso and hair zzso activity in a skin zzso zzso
