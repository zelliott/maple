A great variety of cellular functions are regulated by protein zzso zzso zzso This review zzso the current knowledge of the structural features, patterns of expression and involvement in signal zzso pathways of protein zzso zzso related to zzso and zzso Designated now as zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Cohen in her 1997 study published in Trends in zzso Sciences, zzso 22, zzso zzso this zzso group comprises zzso zzso containing regulatory zzso with zzso repeats, zzso which possess zzso zzso zzso sites, and, recently discovered in plants, zzso zzso is zzso expressed and appears to be a zzso zzso involved in a number of different zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso and zzso is confined primarily to zzso sensory cells in animals and plants, respectively, which may be indicative of their more zzso roles in sensory signal zzso
