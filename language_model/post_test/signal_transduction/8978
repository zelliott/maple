The use of zzso and zzso derivatives has acquired clinical relevance as a means of accelerating wound zzso zzso beneficial effect is attributed to the release of growth factors and other zzso substances able to regulate cellular zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effects of zzso zzso zzso on human primary skin zzso We studied cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso profile of zzso exposed to a zzso zzso zzso obtained from blood zzso Crystal violet and neutral red zzso zzso showed the zzso effects of zzso on cell viability and metabolism at 3 and 6 days of zzso Western zzso demonstrated a more sustained zzso of zzso than of zzso A zzso approach was applied to identify soluble cellular components in primary zzso that are zzso expressed in response to zzso zzso zzso identification was performed by mass zzso The data demonstrate that human zzso respond to zzso exposure by zzso a number of zzso related principally to stress response, metabolism and the zzso
