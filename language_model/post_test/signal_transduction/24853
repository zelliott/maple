zzso necrosis zzso zzso production accompanies zzso insults of all zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have potent zzso effects in the zzso we investigated whether these effects extend to the zzso zzso zzso was induced within 2 zzso after rat spinal zzso zzso and its zzso was suppressed by a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso were used to examine the mechanisms underlying this zzso because zzso are the likely source of zzso in injured zzso In culture, increases in zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso stimulation were reduced significantly by zzso m zzso and completely eliminated by zzso at the same zzso zzso protein levels were reduced zzso by zzso or zzso at zzso zzso An zzso of zzso receptors blocked the action of zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso blocked the action of zzso A direct demonstration of zzso binding on zzso and the existence of zzso for zzso and zzso (but not zzso receptors argue for a zzso zzso The action of zzso is zzso because zzso zzso of zzso by zzso mimics the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso reverses the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which does not use a zzso pathway, fails to duplicate the zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso inhibit the production of zzso from activated zzso by a zzso zzso
