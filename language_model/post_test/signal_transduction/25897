It is well known that zzso imbalances are associated with many psychiatric disorders and that the zzso zzso zzso is the main target of zzso Recently it was shown that levels of two proteins implicated in zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso and zzso are altered in the prefrontal zzso zzso of both schizophrenic and bipolar disorder zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of both zzso zzso which is a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso the pathways of several zzso and is zzso in the zzso of both zzso Here, we used zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to address the function of this protein in zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso cells displayed zzso of the zzso pathway, with decreased levels of zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso We also observed decreased levels of total and zzso zzso at zzso However, these cells did not show zzso in the levels of zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Identification of the cellular mechanisms linking zzso and zzso may help in the understanding the signaling machinery with potential to be turned into targets for the treatment of schizophrenia and other debilitating psychiatric zzso
