In this study, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso syndrome protein zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso which is defective in patients with zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum zzso resulted in large cluster formation of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso In contrast, when the zzso zzso cells were cultured in the absence of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso was required to induce cluster zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso domain failed to induce the large cluster formation in zzso cells even in the presence of zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso which is known to regulate the zzso zzso binds to the zzso domain of zzso and the binding was abolished by the introduction of a zzso zzso into the zzso but not the zzso of the zzso zzso Together with the observations that most of the zzso zzso observed in patients with zzso and zzso are located within the zzso domain, these results indicate that the zzso domain of zzso plays important roles in the regulation of zzso zzso and suggested that the binding of zzso to the zzso domain is necessary for zzso to function zzso
