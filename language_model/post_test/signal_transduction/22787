zzso zzso natural killer T zzso cells are thought to play a crucial role in various immune responses, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso cells produce large amounts of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso upon in zzso stimulation with a specific zzso zzso zzso or after treatment with zzso zzso a regulatory role on helper T zzso cell differentiation has been proposed for these zzso However, the identity of the zzso produced by zzso zzso cells that play a dominant role on the zzso cell differentiation still remains zzso Here, we demonstrate by using zzso zzso mice that zzso zzso cells are zzso for the induction of zzso zzso zzso responses induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, upon in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells are found to suppress zzso zzso zzso The suppression appeared to be zzso specific, and was not detected in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with these results, we also found that zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso cell differentiation in an in zzso induction culture zzso Thus, it is likely that activated zzso zzso cells exert a potent zzso effect on zzso cell differentiation and subsequent zzso production by producing a large amount of zzso In marked contrast, our studies have revealed that zzso produced by zzso zzso cells has only a minor effect on zzso cell zzso
