Studies in transgenic and knockout mice have made a major contribution to our current understanding of the zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso The generation and analysis of mice with targeted modifications of individual components of the zzso zzso tremendously advanced our knowledge of the roles of the zzso proteins themselves, and also of the many zzso and negative regulators of zzso These studies have highlighted the complexity of the zzso system, by revealing the multiple zzso zzso but also diverse functions, performed by the different molecules participating in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso or enforced zzso of zzso in transgenic mice has uncovered the critical roles that zzso plays in the zzso of various diseases such as liver failure, diabetes and zzso
