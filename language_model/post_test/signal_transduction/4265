Mice zzso for the zzso lethal zzso zzso which have a complete deletion of zzso zzso fail to form zzso cells in the zzso large zzso and are nearly devoid of zzso zzso These zzso features stem from incomplete colonization of the zzso and skin by neural zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have used expression of a zzso zzso to study colonization of the enteric nervous system in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Enteric zzso derived from the zzso neural crest colonize the developing zzso zzso and zzso small zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso manner indistinguishable from zzso or zzso zzso However, colonization of the large zzso is retarded and the zzso large zzso is never zzso a zzso zzso identical to that observed in lethal spotted zzso zzso zzso The coat pigmentation and relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso associated with zzso zzso gene deletion is not strictly zzso autonomous zzso of environmental zzso Instead, zzso interactions downstream of the zzso zzso mediate complete colonization of the skin and gut by neural crest zzso
