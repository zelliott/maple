Despite the beneficial effects of zzso zzso on cardiovascular disease and life span, its effects on type 2 diabetic zzso remain zzso This study examined the zzso effects of zzso in zzso mice, a model of type 2 zzso 

zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso mixed in zzso for 8 zzso We measured urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso changes (including zzso expansion, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress markers zzso zzso and zzso content of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity together with its zzso modification and zzso zzso in the zzso Blood zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso profiles were also zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and expression of silent information regulator 1 zzso in the kidney were assessed by zzso 

zzso significantly reduced zzso and attenuated zzso pathological changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso were enhanced in zzso zzso however, zzso activity was reduced through increased zzso zzso zzso ameliorated such zzso and partially improved blood zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso profile in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was decreased in the kidney of zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso neither modified zzso zzso nor zzso expression in the zzso 

zzso ameliorates zzso injury and enhanced zzso zzso with zzso dysfunction in the kidney of zzso mice, through improvement of zzso stress via zzso of zzso function and zzso zzso zzso has zzso activities via zzso zzso
