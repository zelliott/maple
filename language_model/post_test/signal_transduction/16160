We previously demonstrated that the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso formation and the associated zzso dependency of spinal zzso zzso are most robust during zzso Using Sprague zzso rats, we now demonstrate that zzso spinal synthesis of zzso is critical to these zzso and zzso blockade of either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso substantially reduces zzso and eliminates mediation by zzso of spinal zzso zzso zzso of blocking zzso were manifest within 15 zzso whereas those of zzso blockade were manifest after 18 zzso indicating the requirement for rapid signaling by zzso and zzso effects of zzso Individual or combined blockade of zzso produced the same magnitude of effect, suggesting that they work in tandem as part of a zzso complex to regulate zzso zzso zzso with this zzso we found that zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in the spinal zzso zzso Reduction of zzso by zzso or zzso blockade or spinal zzso zzso shifts spinal zzso zzso from zzso dependent to zzso zzso This indicates a sex zzso plasticity of spinal zzso zzso which could explain the greater zzso potency of zzso zzso in women versus zzso We suggest that zzso is a molecular switch that shifts the function of zzso and thereby zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso could thus serve as a novel molecular target for pain management in zzso
