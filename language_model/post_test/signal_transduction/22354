zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso that alters host nuclear and zzso function upon zzso We have investigated the effect of zzso infection on cellular signaling through the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso at both zzso 308 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in cells infected with zzso This zzso was rapid zzso within the first 2 to 3 h zzso and correlated with the zzso of downstream zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso occurred in the presence of growth factor stimulation and was not overcome through zzso membrane targeting of zzso or high levels of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was not a result of zzso in zzso zzso or activity, changes in zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso levels, or the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was caused by the expression of the viral M protein in the absence of other viral zzso and an M protein zzso that does not inhibit zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport was also defective in zzso zzso zzso These data illustrate that zzso zzso a novel mechanism to alter this central player in cell signaling and zzso It also suggests an zzso model of signal zzso where zzso interruption of nuclear events has a rapid and significant effect on membrane signaling zzso
