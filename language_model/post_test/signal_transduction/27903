zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a visual zzso that controls the zzso zzso behavior via two independent zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of an zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibits zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the entire animal zzso family, thus providing new perspectives on zzso zzso zzso accumulates within the eyes of zzso zzso However, the zzso transcript is zzso only in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels increase zzso during zzso when zzso develop in darkness, whereas the zzso transcript does not accumulate when zzso develop in the zzso An zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso produces 10 times less zzso than does the wild zzso In zzso the zzso transcript is virtually zzso whereas the zzso transcript is zzso and light zzso It follows that zzso expression is under zzso zzso control but that zzso itself is not the regulatory zzso zzso zzso is zzso but its zzso sensitivity is reduced zzso relative to the parental zzso strain zzso Thus, we offer definitive genetic evidence that a zzso serves as the zzso for zzso in a green zzso
