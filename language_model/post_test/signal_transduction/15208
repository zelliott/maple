zzso zzso disposal is impaired in obesity and type 2 diabetes zzso zzso and is tightly linked to impaired skeletal muscle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by insulin is a well-established zzso in both obesity and zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso 

zzso action was investigated in a matched cohort of lean healthy, obese zzso and obese type 2 diabetic subjects by the zzso clamp technique combined with muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and upstream signaling of zzso were evaluated in skeletal zzso 

zzso activity correlated zzso with zzso of zzso site zzso and zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso in lean subjects only and induced a larger zzso at site 3 in lean compared with obese zzso The exaggerated insulin resistance in zzso compared with obese subjects was not reflected by differences in site 3 zzso but was accompanied by a significantly higher site zzso zzso during insulin zzso zzso of another zzso zzso target, zzso was also evident in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso treatment fully restored zzso activity in all zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso plays a major role in impaired insulin regulation of zzso in obesity and zzso In zzso independent of zzso this is associated with impaired regulation of site zzso and likely site 3, whereas the exaggerated insulin resistance to activate zzso in zzso is linked to zzso of at least site zzso Thus, zzso per zzso seems unrelated to defects in the zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso
