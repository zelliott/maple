The zzso signaling zzso plays crucial roles in early zzso formation, and its zzso activity is associated with a subset of human zzso a zzso childhood tumor of the zzso zzso However, the precise function of zzso signaling during zzso development is still zzso We generated zzso mice with a conditional knockout for the zzso zzso coli zzso gene that displayed a zzso activity of zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso zzso Such mice showed normal survival without any tumor formation but had a significantly smaller zzso with a complete disruption of its cortical zzso The zzso of the zzso signaling zzso resulted in a severely inhibited proliferation and premature differentiation of zzso zzso zzso precursors in zzso and in zzso zzso mice hardly developed an internal zzso layer, and layering of zzso zzso was zzso zzso these mice presented with significantly impaired motor coordination and zzso In zzso we conclude that zzso zzso zzso essentially require appropriate levels of zzso signaling to balance their proliferation and zzso
