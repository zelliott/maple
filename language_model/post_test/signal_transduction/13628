During viral infection, production of zzso zzso including type I zzso zzso is under stringent control to avoid zzso zzso The protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso family proteins have been recognized as zzso molecules by restraining type I zzso induced amplifying zzso Here we identified zzso as an important negative regulator of zzso type I zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso type I zzso transcription, whereas zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso production of type I zzso zzso with a zzso in the zzso domain retained the zzso function in zzso zzso transcription, but abolished the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity dead zzso zzso still had the comparable zzso function with zzso zzso Further study indicated that zzso zzso with zzso and inhibited the DNA binding activity of zzso The zzso region of zzso around a cluster of zzso zzso acids is critical for the interaction with zzso and the zzso functions of zzso zzso these results unveil zzso functions both at the zzso early signaling stage and zzso zzso amplifying stage with distinct zzso zzso is important in maintaining proper amounts of type I zzso and zzso its magnitude when the zzso response zzso
