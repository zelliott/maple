G zzso receptors are usually thought to act as zzso receptors that bind zzso and then interact with G proteins to initiate signal zzso In this study we report an zzso peripheral membrane protein named the zzso zzso zzso zzso component protein zzso required for signal zzso at the G zzso zzso for zzso Cell lines were made that expressed an zzso construct of the zzso zzso and in these cells diminished zzso expression correlated with loss of zzso signal zzso In contrast, loss of zzso did not diminish zzso density or zzso therefore zzso does not appear to act as a zzso zzso Instead, zzso represents a novel class of protein required to couple the zzso zzso to the cellular signal zzso zzso A candidate zzso zzso named the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso which forms high affinity zzso receptors when zzso with the accessory protein zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso indicating that a functional zzso zzso is composed of at least three zzso the zzso binding protein zzso an accessory protein zzso and a zzso protein for signal zzso zzso
