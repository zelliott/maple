Data mining published zzso experiments require that expression profiles are directly zzso We performed linear global zzso on the data of 1967 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or cell zzso The mathematical transformation effectively zzso zzso or zzso differences between zzso The correctness of expression values was validated by quantitative zzso Using the database we analyze components of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso signaling zzso in various zzso We identified lineage and differentiation specific zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso lineage and high expression of zzso in immature B cells and zzso zzso Performing zzso analysis we found zzso expression of the zzso in the absence of zzso particularly in stem cell zzso and can reject the hypothesis that zzso takes over and is highly expressed when zzso expression is low or zzso zzso the zzso shows no zzso with any other transcript present on the zzso Analysis of differential gene expression under 308 conditions revealed 53 conditions under which the zzso is zzso numerous conditions under which an intrinsic zzso action is modified as well as conditions zzso the zzso even in the absence of known zzso zzso Thus zzso of published expression profiles is a powerful tool to gain novel insights into known and unknown zzso
