Our goal was to test whether zzso zzso protein 1 zzso plays a significant role in the regulation of smooth muscle cell zzso differentiation and, if so, whether zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain is an important signaling mechanism that controls zzso activity in zzso 

zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso and in zzso with a significant zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso active zzso but not zzso strongly activated zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso at zzso and this effect was completely prevented by zzso of ROCK with zzso zzso zzso to ROCK target zzso enhanced zzso activity, suggesting that zzso interferes with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso strongly inhibited zzso increases in zzso differentiation marker gene expression and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a major role in zzso signaling in zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso Thus, additional studies on the role of zzso during development and the progression of cardiovascular disease will be zzso
