This work focuses on the main DNA repair zzso highlighting their role in gastrointestinal zzso and the role of zzso DNA zzso zzso being described in several tumor types, including those of the gastrointestinal zzso The mismatch repair zzso system is inherently altered in patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer, and plays a role in zzso in a subset of sporadic zzso gastric and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also contribute to the development of pancreatic zzso Gene zzso of some X-ray zzso zzso zzso proteins involved in the base zzso repair pathway, have been investigated in relation to zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso Yet only one zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in zzso zzso and in early onset pancreatic zzso Although evidence in the literature indicates that zzso zzso zzso play a role in gastric and zzso zzso no sound conclusions have yet been drawn regarding this issue in pancreatic cancer, although an zzso zzso at zzso is believed to zzso the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients, possibly because it is involved in altering cellular zzso
