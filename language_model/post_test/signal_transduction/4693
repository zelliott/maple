Acid zzso zzso mediates the formation of membrane raft zzso zzso zzso in a process that depends on a local acid zzso in coronary zzso zzso cells zzso However, it is not known how this local acid zzso is formed and zzso The present study hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso provides a hospitable acid zzso for zzso of zzso when zzso traffic and fuse into the cell zzso zzso zzso showed that local pH change significantly affected zzso with more fluorescent patches under low zzso zzso the zzso product, zzso increased locally in the cell zzso zzso spin resonance zzso showed that local pH increase significantly inhibited zzso zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso resulted in localized areas of decreased pH around zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso fusion and zzso apparently attenuated zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity on cell zzso were substantially suppressed by the zzso of zzso fusion or zzso These results provide the first direct evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso critically contributes to the formation of local acid zzso to facilitate zzso of zzso and zzso MR zzso forming MR zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling in zzso
