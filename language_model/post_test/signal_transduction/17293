zzso smoke is a zzso hazard associated with zzso zzso zzso and reduced clinical pregnancy rates in female zzso Despite an increased awareness of the adverse effects of cigarette smoke exposure on systemic health, many women remain unaware of the adverse effects of cigarette smoke on female zzso This issue is compounded by our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind cigarette smoke induced zzso In this study we used a direct zzso exposure mouse model of cigarette zzso chronic zzso pulmonary disease to zzso mechanisms of zzso induced zzso zzso smoke exposure caused increased levels of primordial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress in exposed zzso resulting in fewer zzso available for zzso Evidence of zzso stress also persisted in zzso zzso which escaped destruction, with increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso tissue correlated these insults with a complex mechanism of zzso involving genes associated with detoxification, zzso zzso zzso immune cell zzso zzso and membrane zzso In particular, the phase I detoxifying zzso zzso was found to be significantly zzso in developing zzso an zzso known to cause molecular zzso resulting in zzso zzso Our results provide a preliminary model of cigarette smoke induced zzso through zzso zzso and zzso stress, resulting in developing zzso depletion and zzso zzso
