zzso zzso sclerosis zzso is a spectrum of zzso tissue diseases characterized by zzso and zzso inflammation and zzso and tissue zzso that often leads to excessive zzso and zzso in both zzso and vascular zzso zzso investigations and gene association studies have led to improved understanding of the cell and molecular mechanisms underlying disease zzso and to the identification of key molecular candidates that may represent potentially useful disease zzso and effective therapeutic zzso Studies on the zzso zzso system, zzso zzso and the cell surface receptors zzso A zzso and type B zzso have provided evidence for an important role of this system in the vascular and zzso zzso in zzso To date, promising clinical results, utilizing zzso zzso zzso antagonism have been obtained in two of the vascular complications associated with zzso zzso digital zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso Evidence suggests that zzso is able to activate and zzso the functional zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso zzso and tissue zzso into zzso cell populations with zzso zzso The impact of zzso over zzso antagonism has also been studied in zzso with respect to cell differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso production and deposition and in pathological cellular zzso However, the complexity of the zzso system, potential for zzso zzso interactions with zzso signal zzso zzso as well as the potent zzso with other important zzso pathways have made in zzso studies difficult to zzso Moreover, little information is available on the role of the zzso system and zzso selectivity in the recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso cells in tissue zzso and zzso or on the early inflammatory zzso Here, we discuss the available zzso evidence for the role of the zzso system in tissue repair, zzso and fibrosis, using the zzso tissue diseases zzso and model systems of zzso
