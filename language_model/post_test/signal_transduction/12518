Small zzso zzso are critical for zzso and understanding signaling pathways at the molecular zzso zzso 6 zzso is a zzso that signals via the zzso zzso and is implicated in cancer and zzso To identify zzso of this pathway, we screened a chemical collection against an zzso responsive cell line zzso expressing a zzso reporter gene fused to a zzso element zzso zzso This zzso was zzso for a zzso zzso format and screened against 11 zzso small molecules using quantitative zzso screening zzso a method that zzso a chemical library at multiple zzso to generate zzso profiles for each zzso The zzso recovered zzso zzso with zzso zzso that clustered into 32 distinct chemical series of 13 zzso and 19 zzso A retrospective analysis of the zzso data indicated that single concentration data at zzso and zzso zzso scored 35 and zzso of zzso zzso respectively, as inactive and were therefore false zzso Following counter screens to identify fluorescent and zzso series, we found four zzso and one inhibitor series that modulated zzso cells but did not show similar activity in reporter gene zzso induced by zzso and zzso Small molecules within these series will make useful tool compounds to investigate zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso
