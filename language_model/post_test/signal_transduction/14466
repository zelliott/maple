We have studied the involvement of zzso interacting protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in external zzso zzso and zzso cell death in zzso T cell zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays an imported role in zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrated that contrary to zzso protein synthesis is inhibited in zzso Here, we show that zzso of translation initiation factor zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and its zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso but not in zzso These events are zzso and coincide with the appearance of the zzso zzso fragments, zzso domain zzso and zzso domain zzso Our zzso experiments demonstrated that both fragments could independently zzso with full-length zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso protein translation, whereas that of zzso does zzso zzso of zzso and zzso promotes their interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and suppresses protein translation better than zzso zzso Our findings suggest a zzso mode of zzso of zzso in zzso in which the zzso zzso interacts with and activates intact zzso zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with full-length zzso and thus the zzso of the zzso and zzso the translation zzso zzso
