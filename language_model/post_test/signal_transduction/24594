The effects of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied in rat cerebral cortical zzso The two zzso systems were zzso either by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed were determined by a double label zzso In zzso all drugs, except zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited alpha zzso production but did not modify the zzso zzso zzso Otherwise, chronic zzso but not zzso administration decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso no change was observed in zzso zzso metabolism after administration of these two zzso These data support previous investigations showing a decrease in zzso zzso production after chronic treatment with zzso zzso zzso but do not confirm the hypothesis of a modification of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso
