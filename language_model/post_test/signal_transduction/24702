The relative zzso of the zzso respiratory burst to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso is widely considered as evidence against the involvement of protein zzso C in signal zzso by zzso In this study we compared the effect on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with the effect of its protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates secondary zzso release by itself and enhances zzso primary zzso zzso it zzso zzso production in response to zzso zzso at low zzso but zzso production in response to zzso only at considerably higher zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not interfere with zzso release, but inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso production with similar zzso These results suggest that many of the zzso effects, including its low potency to inhibit zzso zzso production, are due to protein zzso zzso zzso The results obtained with zzso zzso are compatible with a role of protein zzso C in the mediation of the zzso respiratory burst of human zzso
