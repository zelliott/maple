zzso are proteins of zzso structure without zzso zzso Their capacity to zzso large, temporary protein complexes by linking proteins together in a regulated and selective fashion makes them of outstanding importance in the establishment and maintenance of specificity and efficiency in all known signal zzso zzso This review focuses on the structural and functional zzso of zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be distinguished by their domain composition and binding zzso However, such structural zzso have proven inadequate as indicators of functional zzso A better way to understand the logic of zzso networks might be to look at functional aspects of zzso proteins such as zzso zzso negative versus positive contribution to signal zzso or their position in the zzso zzso All of these functions are zzso suggesting that zzso have important regulatory roles rather than acting only as stable zzso in signal zzso
