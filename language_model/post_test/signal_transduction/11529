During development, zzso receptors mediate the repulsive zzso guidance function of zzso a family of membrane attached zzso with their own zzso signaling zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso receptors were recently shown to associate with zzso receptors at synaptic sites and were suggested to play a role in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso stimulation in cultured zzso zzso signaling pathways implicated in synaptic zzso suggesting zzso with zzso zzso zzso Mice lacking zzso have normal zzso zzso zzso but display defects in synaptic zzso In zzso zzso zzso protein zzso long-term zzso zzso was impaired, and two forms of synaptic depression were completely zzso Interestingly, targeted expression of a zzso truncated form of zzso rescued the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso signaling is not required for these zzso zzso
