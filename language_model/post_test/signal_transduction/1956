Several signal zzso pathways have been implicated in the induction of long-term zzso zzso yet the signal zzso mechanisms behind the zzso phase of zzso are still poorly zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso slices using zzso approaches and zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso activity was induced in the zzso region during zzso of field zzso zzso and that two structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso and zzso abated established zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the zzso phase of zzso However, zzso recovered after zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso confirming that zzso maintenance and expression are distinct events and indicating that zzso activity is required for zzso expression rather than for its zzso Interestingly, zzso with zzso did not prevent zzso zzso In fact, if zzso was withdrawn 5 zzso after zzso zzso an zzso of zzso was zzso zzso a zzso calcium zzso form of zzso in the zzso could also be zzso abated by zzso raising the possibility that zzso could be required for the expression of multiple forms of synaptic zzso
