Previous mode of action studies identified zzso zzso 2 zzso as the target of the zzso natural product zzso and its drug candidate zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso which plays a critical role in development, cell zzso and zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso zzso zzso injection in zzso zzso zzso zzso defects seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or depletion blocks signaling downstream of the zzso zzso zzso but upstream of zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso does not block the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso selectively regulates zzso over zzso zzso signaling and provides a unique means to explore and dissect the biological systems zzso by these zzso
