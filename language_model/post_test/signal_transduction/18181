zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso that serve as second zzso for zzso zzso Currently, precise roles of individual zzso in the actions of zzso remain to be zzso In this report, we investigated the roles of zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso produced zzso and underwent zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso or treatment with a pharmacological scavenger of zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso was not affected either by zzso with zzso zzso or by treatment with zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso Similarly, although zzso precursor zzso induced zzso treatment with a scavenger of zzso zzso acid, or an inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso Like zzso zzso treatment with a zzso agent, zzso induced typical zzso even in the concurrent presence of zzso for zzso and zzso These results suggested that, in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso through selective zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso was identified as the crucial zzso for the zzso zzso zzso
