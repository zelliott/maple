Nuclear receptors are zzso factors that regulate diverse cellular zzso In zzso zzso zzso availability is sufficient to produce zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso The zzso zzso zzso is normally activated by zzso which is produced in both volume depletion and zzso states that require different zzso zzso We report zzso at zzso in the MR zzso domain that prevents zzso binding and zzso In zzso zzso is found exclusively in zzso cells of the zzso zzso In volume zzso zzso II and zzso signaling decrease zzso levels, whereas zzso increases zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso increases of the zzso cell zzso zzso pump and zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso and promoting increased plasma volume while zzso zzso zzso These findings reveal a mechanism regulating nuclear hormone zzso activity and zzso selective MR zzso in zzso cells in the distinct zzso responses to volume depletion and zzso
