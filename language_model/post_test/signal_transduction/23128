Fish oil consumption has been associated with a reduced zzso of cardiovascular zzso However, the precise mechanisms involved are not completely zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that a fish zzso diet improves zzso in response to zzso 

zzso mice were fed a diet containing either zzso fish oil, rich in zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso or zzso corn oil, rich in zzso zzso After 4 weeks, zzso zzso was surgically induced by zzso artery zzso We found that blood flow recovery was significantly improved in mice fed a fish oil diet compared to those fed a corn oil diet zzso flow ratio zzso at day 21 after surgery 78 zzso 5 zzso 56 zzso 4; p zzso zzso zzso this was associated with a significant reduction of ambulatory impairment and zzso damage in the fish oil zzso At the zzso level, zzso density was significantly improved in zzso muscles of mice fed a fish oil zzso This correlated with increased expression of zzso and zzso in zzso muscles, and higher NO concentration in the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso have been shown to have an important role for zzso zzso We found that the number of zzso was significantly increased in mice fed a fish oil zzso In addition, zzso stress levels zzso zzso were reduced in zzso isolated from mice exposed to fish oil, and this was associated with improved zzso functional activities zzso and integration into zzso In zzso treatment of zzso with fish oil resulted in a significant increase of cellular zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso growth factors including zzso and zzso was significantly increased in zzso exposed to fish zzso 

Fish zzso diet is associated with improved zzso in response to zzso Potential mechanisms involved include zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso together with an increase in the number and the functional activities of zzso
