In the plant, zzso growth is required for zzso of the corn zzso pathogen zzso zzso Earlier, we identified a role for the zzso signal zzso zzso in the switch between budding and zzso growth for this zzso A gene designated zzso (for zzso bypass of zzso was found to be required for zzso growth and to zzso the regulatory zzso of a zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is important for the zzso of the zzso Specifically, zzso zzso are able to colonize zzso plants and, like the zzso zzso cause localized symptoms in association with the presence of zzso However, in contrast to plants infected with zzso cells that often developed zzso from initially zzso zzso plants infected with the zzso zzso did not produce zzso These data suggest that zzso regulation is critical for the transition from zzso to zzso growth and from zzso to zzso zzso Plate mating zzso in which zzso zzso was applied suggested that the zzso and b zzso zzso pathways may be zzso
