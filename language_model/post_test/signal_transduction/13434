zzso factors are involved in proliferation and zzso To understand the role of zzso in the zzso we screened wild type and zzso zzso zzso for genes zzso expressed in the two cell zzso We demonstrate the reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso associated with reduced zzso of zzso terminal zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso As a consequence of altered zzso expression and function, zzso zzso also show impaired migration, zzso to zzso zzso zzso and a blunted zzso response to transforming growth zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso exhibit altered patterns of zzso including significant delays in transit through both zzso and S zzso of the cell zzso Recognizing that proliferation and migration are key for proper wound healing in zzso we zzso that zzso mice may exhibit abnormal zzso repair upon zzso zzso with our hypothesis, zzso mice exhibited impaired zzso wound zzso This zzso is associated with substantially reduced local inflammatory responses and rates of zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso is indispensable for a zzso unidentified cell zzso and unique role in zzso zzso zzso and migration as well as in proper wound repair and zzso zzso in zzso
