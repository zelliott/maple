Growing zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were found to show an avoidance response when colonizing a zzso zzso suggesting a zzso communication mechanism between zzso There may be a second sensing mechanism involved in shaping the zzso of zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso was dependent on and possibly shaped by the release of zzso a zzso zzso zzso yielded two zzso with zzso zzso and each had a disrupted zzso gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso unlike the parental strain, were unresponsive to zzso tip growth by zzso suggesting disruption of zzso zzso zzso sensing and avoidance could be zzso relevant in zzso such as plant roots, where some limiting zzso might induce this type of zzso behavior, promoting avoidance of previously explored areas by sibling zzso
