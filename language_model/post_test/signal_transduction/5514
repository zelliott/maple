Ras proteins are small zzso zzso involved in the regulation of important cellular functions such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso trafficking of Ras proteins is crucial to identify novel Ras signaling zzso In this study, we report that zzso growth factor triggers Kirsten Ras zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein zzso C zzso through a zzso zzso From early zzso zzso but not Harvey Ras or zzso Ras is sorted and transported to late zzso zzso and zzso Using yellow fluorescent zzso and the zzso probe, we identified for the first time in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso a signal output through zzso On these zzso we also identified the zzso scaffolding complex and activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function leads to a sustained late zzso zzso protein zzso signal zzso Altogether, this study reveals novel aspects about zzso zzso trafficking and zzso shedding new light on the mechanisms controlling Ras regulation in the zzso
