Numerous studies have demonstrated that zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso exposure during pregnancy is associated with negative zzso consequences in adulthood, such as reduced zzso production and zzso destruction in human and laboratory zzso However, the zzso underlying these zzso findings is still zzso largely due to the lack of an in zzso model of zzso Here we established an in zzso model of zzso through zzso acid zzso differentiation of chicken primordial germ cells zzso that progressed through zzso to generate zzso of zzso zzso Using this system, we demonstrated that zzso exposure directly suppressed zzso initiation and completion in chicken zzso and promoted the zzso of zzso eventually leading to reduction of zzso cell formation by zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments suggested that zzso was essential for the adverse effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso these findings offer novel insight into the dynamic mechanism by which zzso affects zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso might be the cause of reduced zzso zzso This study also provides a novel model for direct examination of the molecular and genetic pathways of environmental zzso on zzso
