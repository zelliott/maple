Although zzso zzso are involved in many biological zzso the mechanisms zzso zzso regulate zzso differentiation are poorly zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso differentiation of bone zzso zzso zzso cells was promoted and zzso after zzso of sense and zzso zzso zzso A reporter zzso demonstrated that the zzso A zzso type zzso zzso gene was a target for zzso Furthermore, zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells with zzso promoted zzso zzso We conclude that zzso acts as a positive regulator of zzso differentiation by zzso the zzso signaling zzso through zzso of zzso
