zzso acid zzso is an important signaling zzso that plays roles in a range of biological processes including both zzso and zzso zzso PA is one of a number of signaling lipids that can act as zzso zzso for protein receptors in binding events that enforce membrane association and generally regulate both zzso function and zzso zzso However, zzso of the full scope of PA activities has proven problematic, primarily due to the lack of a consensus sequence among zzso zzso Thus, experimental approaches, such as those employing zzso zzso are necessary for characterizing interactions at the molecular zzso zzso we describe an efficient modular approach to the synthesis of a range of PA zzso that employs a late stage introduction of reporter zzso This strategy was exploited in the synthesis of PA zzso bearing fluorescent and zzso tags as well as a zzso probe containing both a zzso zzso and an zzso as a secondary handle for zzso zzso To discern the ability of these PA zzso to mimic the natural zzso in zzso properties, each compound was incorporated into zzso for binding studies using a known PA zzso the C2 domain of zzso In these studies, each compound exhibited binding properties that were comparable to those of synthetic zzso indicating their viability as zzso for effectively studying the activities of PA in cellular zzso
