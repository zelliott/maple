Mechanical zzso zzso deformation plays a fundamental role in regulating cellular activities; however, little is known about its underlying zzso To understand the effects of zzso deformation on zzso we characterized primary zzso cultured on three-dimensional collagen zzso which can be loaded mechanically with a computer-controlled zzso zzso zzso zzso deformation greatly zzso proliferation of immature zzso but not that of zzso zzso This indicates that mechanical stimulation of zzso proliferation is zzso stage zzso zzso of cartilage zzso protein zzso a mature zzso marker, and type X zzso a zzso zzso marker, was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso and type X collagen are responsive to mechanical zzso Mechanical stimulation of the zzso levels of zzso and type X collagen occurred exactly at the same time points when these markers were zzso by zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso deformation does not alter the speed of zzso but affects the extent of zzso The addition of the zzso channel blocker zzso during loading abolished mechanical stimulation of zzso zzso but did not affect the zzso of zzso zzso by mechanical zzso In contrast, the calcium channel blocker zzso inhibited both the zzso proliferation and the increase of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso deformation regulates zzso proliferation and differentiation via two signal zzso zzso with zzso channels involved in zzso the zzso signals and calcium channels involved in zzso the signals for both proliferation and zzso
