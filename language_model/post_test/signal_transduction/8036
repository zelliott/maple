The zzso zzso nucleus zzso is an important site for the regulation of sympathetic zzso zzso II zzso zzso can activate zzso receptors to stimulate zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso However, little is known about the downstream zzso involved in this zzso action of zzso II in the zzso In this study, using whole cell recording from zzso labeled zzso zzso in rat brain zzso we determined the signaling mechanisms responsible for the effect of zzso II on synaptic zzso release to zzso projecting zzso zzso Bath application of zzso II zzso decreased the frequency of zzso miniature zzso zzso currents zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso II failed to change the frequency of zzso in labeled zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso of zzso persisted in the presence of either zzso a zzso zzso channel blocker, or zzso a blocker of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso decrease in zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso radical formation with the zzso zzso zzso did not significantly alter the effect of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso action of zzso II on synaptic zzso release in the zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso proteins but not by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso input to zzso zzso zzso through zzso oxygen species, especially zzso zzso
