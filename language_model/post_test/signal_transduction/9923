zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses are zzso via zzso zzso but the lack of a systematic comparison of different receptors or zzso has hindered a better understanding of these zzso Such a comparison may be provided by an zzso zzso that is activated by compounds that have no effect on zzso zzso We therefore expressed an zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in rat cortical zzso and compared zzso zzso responses with those zzso by the group I zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in rat cortical zzso zzso of either zzso did not result in a calcium response in zzso zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso a calcium increase in zzso zzso zzso cells, while enhancing the zzso zzso calcium increase and the electrical zzso The increased zzso was caused by inward currents resulting from a reduction in the leak zzso which was zzso and blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that, in cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso in mushroom bodies activated the same cell signaling zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the diverse zzso responses zzso by zzso receptors are due to the properties of different zzso rather than to the properties of the zzso
