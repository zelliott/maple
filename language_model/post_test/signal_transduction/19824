zzso acid zzso is an important zzso involved in zzso stress tolerance in zzso The group A zzso zzso factors play important roles in the zzso signaling zzso in zzso but little is known about their functions in zzso In our current study, we have isolated and characterized a group A zzso zzso factor in rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding factor zzso It was found to be expressed in various zzso in rice and induced by different types of zzso stress treatments such as drought, zzso cold, zzso stress, and zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso using a zzso fusion zzso indicated that zzso is a nuclear zzso In zzso experiments, zzso was shown to bind to zzso elements zzso and its zzso region found to be necessary to zzso a downstream reporter zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is more sensitive to zzso drought, and zzso stress compared with wild type zzso In addition, this zzso zzso showed a significantly decreased sensitivity to high levels of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso our present results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso regulator that zzso the expression of zzso zzso genes through an zzso zzso
