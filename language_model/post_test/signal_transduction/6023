In this review, we zzso recent results on the understanding of zzso organization and cell polarization with an emphasis on the critical role of zzso during this zzso We first report on the advances made in understanding the function and mechanism of zzso family proteins in the nucleation of zzso zzso We also discuss how zzso and other regulators of zzso dynamics are thought to be involved in the generation of cell zzso In the second part we discuss new findings indicating that, rather than using a linear zzso from signal zzso to zzso zzso cell polarity is established through zzso interplay between these zzso We describe the various types of feedback zzso identified and point out common zzso Finally we briefly zzso the emerging role of zzso proteins in the generation of polarity in zzso that implies an early origin of zzso role in cell zzso
