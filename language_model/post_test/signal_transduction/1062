Cell signaling pathways interact with one another to form networks in zzso zzso Such networks are complex in their organization and exhibit emergent properties such as zzso and zzso Analysis of signaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including the development and analysis of zzso This review focuses on theoretical approaches to understanding cell signaling zzso Using zzso G protein pathways an example, we demonstrate how interactions between two pathways can result in a network that contains a positive feedback loop and function as a zzso Different mathematical approaches that are currently used to model signaling networks are zzso and future challenges including the need for databases as well as enhanced computing environments are zzso
