Since the identification of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso most of the critical roles of zzso in plant development have been assessed using various zzso zzso zzso The characterization of individual zzso zzso has shown that both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are important to its proper zzso zzso in the zzso domain, regions near the zzso acid island are known to be critical to zzso zzso In comparison, the exact function of the zzso zzso zzso region located before the zzso acid island domain in the zzso cellular portion of zzso has not yet been zzso due to a lack of specific zzso zzso 

Among the zzso showing altered growth patterns compared to wild type, we further characterized zzso which displayed defective growth and reduced zzso zzso We zzso the zzso DNA spanning zzso in the zzso and found that zzso has a point zzso in the region zzso the 13th zzso of zzso resulting in a change from zzso to zzso zzso We renamed it zzso We also showed that zzso of the wild type zzso protein rescued the zzso of zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we detected the zzso protein in the plasma zzso and showed that the zzso defects in the zzso leaves of zzso a zzso weak zzso of zzso can be restored by the zzso of the zzso proteins in zzso We also produced zzso zzso that were wild type in appearance by performing a genetic cross between zzso and zzso zzso 

We identified a new zzso zzso zzso whose zzso site has not yet been found or zzso Our results indicated that the zzso zzso regions before the zzso acid island domain of zzso are important for the appropriate cellular functioning of zzso Also, we confirmed that a successful zzso zzso occurs between the zzso domain zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
