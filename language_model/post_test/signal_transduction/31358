The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso gene family comprises three human zzso that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies have reported the genetic association of zzso with zzso Additionally, decreased zzso protein expression and the reduced zzso of zzso were reported in this disease, leading to a new theory of attenuated zzso signaling in schizophrenia zzso We have evaluated this theory by performing both genetic and protein expression zzso A family based association test of zzso did not show association with schizophrenia in Japanese zzso The expression levels of total zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected in the schizophrenic brains from two different brain banks also failed to support the zzso In addition, no attenuated zzso signaling was observed in the zzso from Japanese zzso contrasting with previous zzso zzso we found that the level of zzso zzso at zzso tended to be zzso correlated with zzso zzso and that the zzso levels of zzso were zzso correlated with brain zzso issues not assessed in the previous zzso These data introduce a note of caution when zzso the zzso levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso this study failed to support reduced signaling of the zzso molecular cascade in zzso
