The pattern of synaptic interactions between zzso of the nucleus zzso zzso zzso has been analyzed using whole cell recording in rat zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso zzso presented a prolonged (up to 300 zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso presented a prolonged (up to 200 zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso sensory input all zzso showed spontaneous synaptic zzso zzso synaptic activity in zzso cells was zzso and characterized by the absence of zzso zzso zzso while in zzso cells it was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synaptic currents in zzso cells and zzso synaptic currents in zzso were studied using probability density and intensity zzso Distribution of time intervals between synaptic events indicated the latter were generated, in both zzso and zzso cells, by two simultaneous zzso zzso a close to zzso process generating independent zzso and zzso a subsidiary zzso process generating synaptic events separated by intervals shorter than 20 zzso zzso of zzso transmission by zzso zzso 10 zzso or blockade of action zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso suppressed the subsidiary zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso cells zzso form a zzso network contributing to generation of zzso activity in the zzso and zzso are located zzso with respect to zzso zzso
