zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso is assumed to provide specific local information to neighboring zzso Here, we report the remarkably selective presence of zzso at the very tip of hair zzso where zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso cells lining the zzso junction at this location may receive different signals from the two zzso This hypothesis was tested in zzso by characterizing with functional and molecular zzso the zzso of zzso exposed to zzso and zzso The two zzso induced zzso distinct focal zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso persistent migration of zzso The different impact on cellular behavior was associated with distinct zzso patterns of zzso zzso and other signaling zzso In particular, while zzso triggered a robust zzso of zzso zzso provoked a strong and sustained zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso was necessary but not sufficient to promote migration because there was no directed migration on zzso despite zzso zzso In contrast, zzso antagonized directional migration, since zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso zzso migration on zzso zzso analysis of the role of zzso strongly suggested that the mechanisms involve zzso of zzso zzso loss of the cortical zzso network, zzso of zzso zzso out of stable zzso and displacement of the zzso from its association with the zzso pool of intermediate zzso
