The importance of zzso in regulating the zzso of proteins involved in cell signaling has been demonstrated by four recent zzso First, a new family of zzso zzso zzso zzso highly zzso throughout evolution, was shown to be distributed in a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regions of these molecules points to the existence of a wide diversity of zzso These zzso are thought to mediate zzso of signals to the cell interior by means of the zzso activity occurring within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso tumor zzso such as zzso acid, were shown to be potent zzso zzso that have multiple effects on signaling zzso Third, the zzso of the type 2A zzso were found to associate with transforming zzso zzso by DNA tumor zzso indicating a role for zzso in zzso abnormal zzso zzso Fourth, several zzso zzso were found to zzso zzso This review focuses on the significance of the zzso zzso zzso and on the possible ways in which zzso zzso function in signaling zzso
