zzso and their receptors direct zzso migration among blood, zzso and zzso Evidence has recently accumulated that, besides their zzso functions, zzso receptors are highly versatile players that fine tune immune zzso During human T cell zzso by zzso cells, the zzso receptors zzso and zzso are recruited into the zzso zzso where they deliver zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms allowing signaling versatility of zzso receptors are zzso Here, we describe the functional interaction between zzso and zzso to exert specific biological functions and zzso T zzso zzso We demonstrate that simultaneous expression and cooperation between zzso and zzso are required for zzso T cell zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, we provide evidence for a physical association of the two receptors in a signaling complex that activates distinct T cell zzso We suggest that cooperation between receptors represents one key strategy for the functional plasticity of zzso
