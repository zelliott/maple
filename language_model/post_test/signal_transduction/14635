zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation in a number of leukemia cell lines and under various conditions is able to either stimulate or inhibit nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso Here we report a zzso zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso leukemia zzso After zzso treatment there was an early approximately 4 h suppression and a late zzso h prolonged zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso with increased zzso activities, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso recruitment to the zzso D responsive element zzso In parallel with zzso zzso there was an zzso of zzso controlled inflammatory and zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso gene zzso The early approximately 4 h zzso zzso suppression coincided with a prolonged increase of zzso protein which require de zzso protein zzso lasted for as least 72 h and was insensitive to zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data suggest a novel zzso regulation of zzso in zzso leukemia cells and our results may have provided the first molecular explanation for the contradictory observations reported on zzso zzso
