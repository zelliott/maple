zzso zzso a zzso zzso is an extremely toxic zzso This fact suggests that its synthesis and degradation should be tightly zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms that protect zzso cells against zzso zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso zzso exposure increased the internal zzso content and activated the expression of zzso and zzso two genes involved in zzso zzso zzso the gene for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso This response was specific as demonstrated by the analysis of marker genes and zzso of the general stress zzso zzso experiments with zzso cells showed that this compound triggers the overproduction of zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso double zzso showed enhanced zzso contents compared with the zzso Overall, these results appeared to indicate that zzso in the zzso content of the toxic compound are perceived by the cell as a primary signal to trigger the zzso zzso In agreement with this, zzso zzso zzso was enhanced in strains lacking zzso and this effect correlated with the internal zzso zzso Finally, induction of zzso zzso and zzso and enhanced zzso contents were also observed in zzso cells subjected to a sudden increase in zzso zzso The implications of this regulatory mechanism on protection against zzso are zzso
