zzso responses in zzso coli are zzso by the membrane zzso zzso a recently identified member of the zzso of zzso domain zzso which includes sensors of light, zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso suggested that it might use a zzso zzso zzso zzso prosthetic group to monitor cellular zzso zzso To test this idea, we zzso zzso zzso zzso protein by zzso affinity zzso and showed by high performance liquid zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso that it bound zzso zzso zzso fragments spanning the zzso 290 zzso of zzso which contains the zzso zzso were able to bind zzso Fusion of this portion of zzso to the zzso signaling domain of zzso the zzso zzso yielded a functional zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso portion of zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso identified two regions, in addition to the zzso domain, that play roles in zzso zzso Those regions flank a central zzso segment needed to anchor zzso to the zzso zzso They might contact the zzso zzso directly or stabilize the zzso zzso However, their lack of sequence conservation in zzso zzso of other bacteria suggests that they play less direct roles in zzso zzso One or both regions probably also play important roles in zzso zzso zzso changes to the zzso zzso signaling domain to trigger zzso behavioral zzso
