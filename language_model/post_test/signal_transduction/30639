Chemical signaling plays an important role in ecological zzso such as communication and zzso zzso Since zzso species cannot physically escape zzso many contain compounds that deter zzso however, it is largely unknown how predators zzso detect deterrent zzso Few studies have investigated ecologically relevant aversive taste responses in any zzso Our objective was to determine if a signaling zzso for detecting marine zzso deterrent compounds could be zzso in a zzso expression system to ultimately facilitate investigation of the molecular mechanism of such an aversive behavioral zzso zzso zzso zzso rejected artificial diets laced with sponge chemical defense compounds that were previously shown to deter a zzso marine zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso can recognize deterrent compounds relevant to coral reef zzso zzso made from a zzso zzso library were expressed in a zzso system, zzso zzso zzso and tested for zzso zzso via zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso as a zzso zzso expressing gene sequences from the library and zzso exhibited a zzso zzso response to zzso and zzso A and B, sponge defense zzso zzso the chemical zzso signaling zzso can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the responses suggested that the responses to zzso and zzso A and B were zzso and capable of using the zzso signaling zzso in this zzso This zzso has the potential to lead to the identification of genes that zzso receptors capable of interacting with deterrent zzso which would enable understanding of zzso detection of chemical zzso
