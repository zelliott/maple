zzso are growth zzso in a target cell specific zzso The signaling pathways that characterize each cell type play a crucial role in determining the responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso A has been shown to suppress the growth of primary zzso Similarly, the human zzso zzso cell line was growth arrested by zzso A as judged by lack of cell proliferation and suppression of DNA zzso In zzso cells zzso A further induced zzso of zzso protein in the zzso form known to prevent entrance into S zzso This finding implies the involvement of zzso dependent zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells following addition of zzso A revealed reduced expression of zzso and conversely, an increase in the zzso zzso This zzso of zzso protein was partly due to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso that zzso with zzso and abrogates DNA zzso abolished the ability of zzso A to induce zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Thus, zzso A, like transforming growth factor zzso seems to suppress cell growth through the downstream target zzso However, each of these zzso seem to operate through a distinct zzso
