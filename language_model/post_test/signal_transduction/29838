zzso zzso rapid functions (from seconds to minutes) can be attributed to a fraction of nuclear zzso zzso zzso localized at the plasma zzso As a potential zzso we zzso that zzso of the zzso zzso may explain the ability of zzso to associate to plasma membrane making possible zzso rapid functions zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso Here, we report direct evidence that the zzso of the zzso zzso to Ala zzso human zzso zzso and zzso rapid zzso zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso significantly decreases the zzso zzso of an zzso responsive element construct zzso Similar effects were obtained treating zzso cells zzso with wild type zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Moreover, the deletion of the zzso zzso zzso the DNA binding zzso of zzso had no consequences on zzso zzso whereas no zzso occurred in the zzso zzso devoid of the E domain zzso zzso binding zzso These results point to the pivotal role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
