zzso zzso is involved in injury, zzso diabetes and zzso It is partly regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While these pathways have been investigated, questions such as zzso effects and the dynamics of zzso regulation remain to be fully zzso zzso modeling of these pathways zzso such zzso Based on the published ordinary differential equation models of the zzso zzso we developed an integrated model of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our model was validated against experimental data for calcium release and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The simulated effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso and the collective zzso by zzso and zzso are consistent with experimental zzso Our model was used to predict enhanced zzso zzso by zzso zzso and by synergistic action of zzso and zzso at low zzso zzso These may have impact in zzso zzso and zzso in cancer patients with blood zzso 

Our model was validated against a number of experimental findings and the observed synergistic effects of low zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso of zzso It can be used to predict the effects of altered zzso zzso collective actions of multiple zzso and the potential impact to various zzso Similar to the published models of other zzso our model can potentially be used to identify important disease genes through sensitivity analysis of zzso zzso
