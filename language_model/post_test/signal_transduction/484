The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso basic zzso nuclear zzso zzso is regulated by an zzso mechanism and acts as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso duplication, zzso have two zzso genes zzso and zzso but their functions in zzso are not well zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso liver cell line zzso to characterize the interaction of zzso and zzso in normal embryonic development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso (2 and zzso during early development showed strong induction of zzso zzso and zzso at 48 and 72 hours zzso zzso An zzso targeting zzso inhibited zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso in 48 zzso zzso demonstrating a primary role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso in zzso cells enhanced zzso induction of zzso but not other zzso zzso In zzso dual zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso alone, enhanced the induction of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and decreased the zzso expression of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso did not affect zzso expression or zzso zzso zzso zzso with each of two different zzso targeting zzso and exposed to zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso resembling those typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower jaw zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate distinct roles of zzso and zzso in regulating zzso signaling in zzso and suggest that they have undergone zzso zzso since the zzso zzso zzso
