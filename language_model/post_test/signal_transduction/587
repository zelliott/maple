zzso proteins are a large family of zzso factors that play important roles in embryonic development, including axis zzso cell fate zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was recently demonstrated that zzso zzso related to zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso interactions guide zzso zzso down the spinal zzso during zzso Here, we report that the zzso signal mediates the zzso of zzso zzso growth in the adult spinal zzso The expression of zzso is induced in zzso zzso around the injury site following a spinal zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In rats with zzso spinal zzso zzso zzso administration of a zzso zzso to zzso resulted in significant zzso growth of the zzso tract and enhanced functional zzso Thus, zzso of the embryonic repulsive cues in adult zzso contributes to the failure of zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso
