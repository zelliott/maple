zzso zzso is pivotal for the development of zzso zzso Features such as a large repertoire of zzso interacting zzso rapid assembly and zzso and a connection to a zzso zzso zzso make zzso junctions ideal structures for the execution of complex changes in cell and tissue zzso during zzso Recent findings highlight the role of zzso proteins as critical regulators of major zzso zzso We re-evaluate the significance of zzso zzso structures and propose that in addition to zzso zzso they may be used as zzso of the external cellular environment that help adjust the behavior of individual cells to ensure survival of the entire zzso
