To study the effect of zzso on inducing zzso of cultured human airway smooth muscle cells zzso 

Human zzso were isolated and cultured in zzso containing zzso fetal bovine zzso zzso of Passes 4 approximately 6 were used in zzso The cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso for 24 or 48 zzso zzso changes were observed by light zzso and electron zzso DNA fragmentation was analyzed by zzso zzso SP zzso zzso method was performed to detect the changes of expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cell was detected by zzso end labeling technique zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso decreased the number of viable zzso At 48 hour, at 300 zzso number of viable cells was the zzso zzso Human zzso incubated with zzso zzso zzso or 300 zzso for 48 h revealed zzso features of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed a characteristic zzso of DNA bands representing zzso multiples of the zzso DNA length (about 180 approximately 200 zzso zzso The expression of zzso or zzso gene in zzso or zzso zzso group was significantly higher than that in control group, but the expression of zzso gene was lower than that in control zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso positive rate of human zzso was significantly different following 100 zzso 300 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso but zzso zzso before zzso not affected zzso level of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso respectively), as compared with the zzso 

zzso zzso induced zzso in human zzso in zzso in time and concentration dependent zzso zzso A zzso zzso A zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso analogue may prevent airway zzso in zzso
