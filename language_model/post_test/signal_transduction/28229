zzso between inflammatory infiltrates and resident zzso zzso cells may play important roles in the development of zzso fibrosis, by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso after treatment with activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels for zzso muscle zzso collagen I, and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso were increased, whereas those for zzso and zzso 19 zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify other changes in gene expression that might point to novel molecular mechanisms driving zzso Of zzso array zzso 61 demonstrated at least a twofold change at at least two consecutive time points, of the five time points examined zzso 4, 8, 16, and 48 zzso Of these zzso 59% were zzso and zzso were zzso The array indicated zzso of expression of the zzso M zzso zzso beta zzso from 4 to 48 h after exposure of kidney zzso cells to activated zzso zzso zzso which contained high levels of zzso In additional experiments, it was demonstrated that zzso induced zzso zzso activated the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, and a specific inhibitor of zzso blocked both its zzso after exposure to zzso and the induction of zzso and loss of zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso of zzso and is likely to be one of several zzso produced by inflammatory infiltrates that contribute to this and subsequent zzso zzso
