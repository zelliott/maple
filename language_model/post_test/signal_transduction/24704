We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso of both zzso and cell surface forms of the alpha and beta zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso Cell proliferation was partially inhibited by zzso zzso but was completely blocked by the drug zzso zzso treatment markedly reduced zzso cell surface zzso but had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso must attain a cell surface zzso to functionally couple with the zzso zzso Additionally, we were able to demonstrate a functional zzso loop involving zzso in human tumor cell zzso Exposure to zzso resulted in diminished zzso zzso and/or zzso of the zzso A subset of the tumor cell lines possessing a zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant reduction in proliferation after exposure to zzso These findings indicate that a zzso zzso loop contributes to the uncontrolled zzso drive in some human zzso
