Women exhibit an enhanced capability for zzso metabolism during endurance exercise compared with zzso The underlying regulatory mechanisms behind this sex-related difference are not well understood but may comprise signaling through a zzso zzso factor 2 zzso regulatory zzso The primary purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the protein signaling of zzso regulatory zzso components at rest and during 90 zzso of bicycling exercise at zzso zzso in healthy, moderately trained men zzso zzso 8) and women zzso zzso 9) to zzso the potential role of these proteins in zzso zzso during zzso A secondary purpose was to screen for zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor zzso family members of zzso factors at rest and during zzso Muscle zzso were obtained before and immediately after zzso Nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso No significant sex differences were observed at rest or during zzso At rest, no significant sex differences were observed in zzso expression of the measured zzso zzso zzso for zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso by zzso Of these, zzso zzso increased zzso specifically in women zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso tended to increase in men zzso zzso zzso Although minor sex differences in zzso expression were observed, the main finding of the present study was the implication of a joint signaling action of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso in the immediate regulatory response to endurance zzso This signaling response was independent of zzso
