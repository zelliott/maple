Lung cancer, like many other zzso zzso is thought to be the outcome of genetic and zzso changes that result in a constellation of zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso rate, and changes in expression of cell surface zzso particularly zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso family zzso The zzso family is a group of four structurally similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso on binding with a number of zzso including zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is pronounced in virtually all zzso zzso and is also found in zzso or zzso zzso of large cell and zzso It is not expressed in zzso by small cell lung zzso zzso of zzso is one of the earliest and most consistent abnormalities in zzso zzso of high-risk zzso It is present at the stage of zzso cell zzso and persists through zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Recent studies of the effect of zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggest that patterns of zzso of multiple members of the zzso family could be important in determining zzso Intermediate zzso of such trials could include monitoring of zzso levels in signal zzso molecules downstream of the zzso zzso These trials represent a new targeted approach to lung cancer treatment and zzso that will require greater attention to molecular zzso than required in past zzso
