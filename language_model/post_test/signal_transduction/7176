The complex connectivity of the cerebral zzso suggests that zzso communication is a primary zzso Using zzso zzso we show that anatomical connectivity may be a major zzso for global information flow in brain zzso A zzso brain network was implemented as a communication network in which signal units flowed between zzso matter zzso along white matter zzso Compared to zzso surrogate networks, information flow on the zzso brain network was characterized by higher loss rates, faster transit times and lower zzso suggesting that neural connectivity may be zzso for speed rather than zzso Much of global communication was zzso by a zzso zzso of hub zzso a zzso comprised of zzso zzso that are more densely interconnected with each other than predicted by zzso First, zzso communication patterns most closely resembled those observed for a synthetic rich club network, but were less similar to those seen in a synthetic small world network, suggesting that the former is a more fundamental feature of brain network zzso Second, rich club regions attracted the most signal traffic and likewise, connections between rich club regions carried more traffic than connections between zzso club zzso Third, a number of rich club regions were significantly zzso suggesting that zzso connectivity actively shapes information flow, funneling traffic towards some zzso and away from zzso Together, our results indicate a critical role of the rich club of hub zzso in dynamic aspects of global brain zzso
