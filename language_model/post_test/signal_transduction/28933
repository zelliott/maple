Recently, using the zzso zzso bundle zzso zzso zzso zzso rat model of Parkinson's disease zzso we have demonstrated that blockade of central IGF-1 receptors zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but exacerbated zzso zzso in IGF-1 only treated rats zzso and zzso zzso J zzso Res zzso This suggested that the IGF-1 system is a central mechanism through which zzso acts to protect the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these results also suggest that zzso zzso signaling pathways are involved in the zzso mechanism that promotes zzso zzso In zzso two zzso zzso signaling pathways used by zzso and IGF-1, the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be zzso Continuous central infusions of zzso and zzso zzso were used to test the hypothesis that one or both of these signal zzso pathways mediates zzso and/or IGF-1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso after a unilateral administration of zzso into the zzso of zzso Motor behavior tests and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso blocked the survival effects of both zzso and IGF-1, while an inhibitor of the zzso signaling zzso was zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso and IGF-1 treatments increased zzso zzso in the zzso however, zzso zzso was decreased in the zzso Indeed, continuous infusions of zzso blocked zzso of zzso and zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protection is dependent on zzso zzso but not on the zzso zzso
