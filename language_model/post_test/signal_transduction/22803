zzso if not most, bacterial species zzso The synthesis and operation of the zzso the most complex zzso of a zzso takes a significant percentage of cellular energy, particularly in the zzso limited environments in which many zzso species are zzso It is obvious that zzso zzso cells a survival advantage over zzso zzso under normal, poorly mixed conditions and is an important zzso in the development of many associations between bacteria and other organisms, whether as pathogens or zzso and in colonization of niches and the development of zzso This survival advantage is the result of sensory control of swimming zzso Although too small to sense a zzso along the length of the cell, and unable to swim great distances because of zzso by zzso motion and the zzso resulting from a rotating zzso bacteria can bias their random swimming direction towards a more zzso zzso The zzso environment will vary from species to species and there is now evidence that in many species this can change depending on the current zzso growth state of the zzso In general, bacteria sense changes in a range of nutrients and zzso compounds altering electron zzso zzso or donors into the electron transport chain, zzso temperature and even the magnetic field of the zzso The sensory signals are zzso and may be balanced with other sensory pathways such as zzso zzso to identify the optimum current zzso The central sensory zzso in this process is common to most bacteria and most zzso The environmental change is sensed by a sensory zzso In most species examined this is a zzso zzso sensing the external environment, but there is increasing evidence for additional zzso receptors in many zzso All zzso whether sensing zzso zzso acids or zzso share a zzso zzso domain that controls the activity of a zzso protein zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso A reduction in an zzso generally leads to the increased zzso of zzso zzso passes its zzso to a small, single domain response regulator, zzso zzso can interact with the zzso motor to cause it to change zzso direction or zzso Signal termination either via a zzso zzso which increases the zzso rate of zzso or via a second zzso which acts as a zzso sink, allows the cell to swim off again, usually in a new zzso In addition to signal termination the zzso must be zzso and this occurs via zzso of the zzso to return it to a zzso zzso The way in which bacteria use these systems to move to optimum environments and the interaction of the different sensory pathways to produce zzso zzso response will be the subject of this zzso
