zzso expression of the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso and its zzso such as zzso has been demonstrated in zzso cell zzso of the upper zzso zzso However, the question whether zzso signaling is zzso linked with zzso transformation of zzso in zzso zzso has not been addressed so zzso We used the well-established mouse model of zzso zzso induced zzso to investigate tumor development in control and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso induced zzso of the tongue and the esophagus showed strong induction of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso we did not observe any significant difference in tumor zzso or zzso between control and zzso zzso Furthermore, detailed analysis of tumor sections by zzso and zzso zzso revealed no difference in either the size or zzso architecture of zzso zzso tumor cell zzso or the number of inflammatory immune cells in the tumor zzso Finally, we detected induced transcript and protein levels of the zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso induced zzso suggesting that signaling via the zzso axis may compensate for the lack of zzso in early stages of tumor zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is zzso in the onset of zzso induced oral and zzso zzso cell zzso and provide evidence for an alternative zzso of zzso signaling via zzso
