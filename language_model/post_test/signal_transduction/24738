We have recently shown that changes in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso Turner, zzso zzso and Juliano, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 88, zzso One component of the zzso protein complex zzso with an zzso generated against zzso which is a focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reynolds, zzso zzso and Parsons, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells to zzso leads to increased zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso with zzso of cells to zzso and is zzso prior to cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced when zzso cells are allowed to adhere to zzso collagen type IV, or zzso but is not induced on zzso When zzso cells are subjected to indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in focal zzso These data provide additional evidence that zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso
