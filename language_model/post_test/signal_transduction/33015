zzso line zzso in one of two distinct zzso zzso or zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso dominant disorder of localized zzso Both genes zzso zzso cell receptors for the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso to the type III zzso zzso although its exact role in zzso signaling is zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso has zzso to the type I zzso family, but its zzso and corresponding type II zzso are zzso In order to identify the zzso and type II zzso for zzso and to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we devised a zzso zzso signaling zzso by exchanging the zzso domain of zzso with either the zzso type I zzso or the zzso type zzso zzso both of which can activate an zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso as well as a third unknown zzso present in serum, can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain abrogate zzso The zzso interaction is zzso by the type II zzso zzso for zzso and most likely through the zzso type II or type zzso receptors for the serum zzso zzso is a zzso zzso partner since it can bind to zzso as well as to type I zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso involves disruption of a complex network of positive and negative zzso factors, involving zzso a new unknown zzso and their corresponding zzso
