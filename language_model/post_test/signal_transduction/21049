The zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso and has also been implicated in directing zzso recruitment to inflammatory zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate a novel level of regulation of zzso expression that involves the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso is a member of a zzso cell surface complex in zzso that includes zzso (target of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso of zzso was shown to rapidly zzso zzso surface density on normal and zzso human zzso and to markedly inhibit zzso zzso of zzso to soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso and to zzso zzso high zzso zzso Through the use of zzso and zzso potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to involve a zzso zzso pathway, and was attributed to increased zzso shedding from surface zzso zzso direct zzso zzso modeling zzso interactions with zzso cell zzso similarly zzso zzso surface expression through a zzso zzso zzso In sharp contrast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso that is closely linked to zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for zzso and zzso zzso activity in control of zzso zzso thus providing insight into the complex molecular mechanisms that potentially regulate zzso zzso zzso in zzso
