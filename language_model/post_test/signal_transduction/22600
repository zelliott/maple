The growth of rat zzso zzso in zzso is zzso by the zzso of zzso acid zzso and its metabolism to zzso acid zzso an important zzso signaling zzso within this zzso zzso the growth of a variety of experimental zzso in zzso is inhibited by either zzso or pharmacological levels of the zzso zzso hormone zzso although the zzso are zzso We tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of zzso zzso action in zzso involves the zzso of tumor LA zzso and metabolism to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of LA and release of zzso measured in zzso rat zzso zzso at zzso intervals over a zzso period, were highest during the light phase and lowest during the zzso phase, when plasma zzso levels were lowest and zzso zzso zzso eliminated this rhythm of tumor LA zzso and zzso production, indicating that it was driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumors in zzso with zzso (1 zzso rapidly and zzso inhibited the zzso of plasma fatty acids zzso including zzso and its metabolism to zzso These zzso effects of zzso on tumor zzso zzso and zzso release were completely reversed by zzso of tumors in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of tumors in zzso with zzso also decreased tumor zzso incorporation and DNA zzso these effects on DNA synthesis were also prevented by the zzso of tumors with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso tumor growth, LA zzso and metabolism to zzso and zzso storage in zzso zzso whereas zzso administration zzso zzso was zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that, compared with normal liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts for a plasma zzso zzso transport protein zzso zzso zzso expression was unaffected by the treatment of zzso rats with daily afternoon zzso injections or exposure to constant zzso These results support a novel mechanism of tumor growth zzso by zzso involving a zzso zzso suppression of zzso levels, resulting in diminished tumor zzso zzso possibly via decreased zzso zzso The zzso of these signal zzso events by zzso culminates in the suppression of LA zzso LA metabolism to the zzso signaling zzso zzso and cancer zzso
