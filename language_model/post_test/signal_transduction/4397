The elimination of tumor cells by zzso T zzso zzso could become the basis of a biological cancer zzso The recognition specificity of zzso T zzso zzso can be genetically modified by stable introduction of zzso T cell zzso genes and thus be directed towards tumor zzso We designed a zzso T cell zzso zzso component consisting of a single chain zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso serving as the zzso zzso domain and the zzso of the zzso complex serving as a signal zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso differing in their molecular structure were derived and their functions in zzso T cells zzso A construct in which the zzso domain, specific for the zzso zzso was fused directly to the zzso and two zzso containing different hinge regions between the functional zzso were zzso The hinge regions serve as zzso which increase the distance of the zzso zzso from the plasma zzso Only the two zzso zzso containing a hinge region showed zzso binding activity, when expressed in T zzso The zzso construct which lacks a zzso segment did zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso signals following zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso expressing tumor cells were efficiently zzso by zzso which expressed the zzso zzso zzso Our results will help to zzso the design of zzso T cell zzso components useful in the zzso of a specificity of recognition on to zzso T cells and possibly the gene therapy of zzso
