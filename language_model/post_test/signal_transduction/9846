In well-trained animals, zzso zzso release is zzso during zzso ethanol zzso but the time course of development of this zzso response, particularly during the acquisition of ethanol drinking behavior, remains zzso To examine this, we trained male zzso rats to zzso zzso ethanol plus zzso zzso using a protocol in which the concentration of ethanol was kept constant throughout the zzso The animals were required to press the lever four times to gain continuous access to the drinking solution for 20 minutes, and zzso was performed on either the first or second day of zzso ethanol plus zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as zzso Ethanol and zzso were both analyzed in the zzso All groups zzso 1 and 2 ethanol and their corresponding zzso zzso showed an increase in zzso zzso during the transfer from the home cage into the zzso zzso Our main finding was an increase in zzso in the nucleus zzso zzso border during the first 5 minutes of consumption on the second day but not on the first day of ethanol zzso Our results suggest that a single exposure to a zzso ethanol plus zzso zzso drinking solution may be sufficient to learn the association between ethanol cues and its reinforcing zzso Furthermore, we speculate that the zzso response during ethanol consumption likely reflects the zzso role of the zzso zzso zzso
