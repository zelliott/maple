Recent studies have described that the zzso signaling zzso is activated in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso II zzso plays a key role in the progression of kidney zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso by zzso of zzso factors, induction of zzso zzso transition and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In cultured human zzso zzso cells the zzso zzso by transforming growth zzso zzso has been involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso mimics many zzso actions of zzso For these reasons, our aim was to investigate whether zzso could regulate the zzso system in the zzso and its potential role in zzso zzso In cultured human zzso zzso cells, zzso but not zzso increased the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and caused nuclear zzso of the activated zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, pharmacological zzso zzso did not modify zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion of zzso into rats for 2 weeks caused zzso fibrosis, but did not zzso zzso expression of activated zzso or zzso as observed in spontaneously zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso system was not modulated by zzso type I zzso blockade in the model of unilateral zzso obstruction in zzso These data clearly indicate that zzso does not regulate the zzso signaling system in the zzso in zzso and in zzso Our findings showing that the zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso could provide important information to understand the complex role of zzso system in the regulation of zzso zzso vs damage zzso
