In zzso organisms, the coordination of cell behaviors largely relies on zzso and zzso zzso zzso how such signals control development is often challenging, because their distribution relies on the activity of individual cells and, in a feedback loop, on tissue behavior and zzso This review focuses on one of the zzso structures in biology, the shoot zzso zzso zzso This tissue is responsible for the production of all the aerial parts of a zzso In the zzso a population of stem cells continuously produces new cells that are incorporated in lateral zzso such as leaves, zzso and zzso zzso from stem cells involves a tight regulation of cell identity and patterning as well as large-scale zzso zzso The gene regulatory network controlling these processes is highly coordinated in space by various signals, such as plant hormones, zzso zzso mobile factors, and mechanical zzso Many zzso and feedback zzso zzso these pathways have emerged in the past zzso The plant hormone zzso and mechanical forces have received more attention recently and their role is more particularly detailed zzso An integrated view of these signaling networks is also presented in order to help understanding how robust shape and patterning can emerge from these zzso
