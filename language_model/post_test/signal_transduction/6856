zzso zzso a prominent periodic event in the development of zzso is instructed by zzso expression of several zzso including zzso and zzso fringe zzso zzso regulation accounts for the zzso zzso In addition, because the expression patterns vary in a cycle, rapid turnover of zzso should be involved in the zzso zzso although its contribution remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso rapid turnover of zzso and zzso plays a critical role in their dynamic expression zzso The regions active in the zzso of zzso and zzso are wholly overlapped in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso However, their distribution patterns are slightly zzso zzso zzso shows a broader distribution pattern than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is less stable than zzso zzso where their zzso are responsible for the different zzso Using transgenic mice expressing Venus under the control of the zzso promoter, which leads to zzso zzso in the zzso we reveal that the zzso zzso provides the narrow distribution pattern of zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso contributes the relatively broad distribution pattern of zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso zzso stability accounts for the differential distribution patterns of zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso regulation of zzso turnover plays a crucial role in the diverse patterns of zzso distribution during zzso
