The present work has examined the effects of zzso acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein zzso on the regulation of zzso expression during zzso differentiation of zzso leukemia zzso The results demonstrate that zzso acid treatment is associated with induction of a differentiated zzso zzso characterized zzso zzso growth zzso zzso increases in zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso induction of tumor necrosis factor gene zzso This induction of zzso differentiation was associated with transient increases in zzso zzso levels, which were zzso at 6 zzso Similar effects were obtained for the zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso levels of zzso zzso in zzso cells and that this rate is increased approximately zzso following zzso acid zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in cells treated with both zzso acid and zzso whereas zzso of protein synthesis had little, if any, effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was similar zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with both zzso acid and zzso was associated with stabilization zzso 1/2 zzso 90 zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that the induction of zzso zzso by zzso acid is controlled primarily by a zzso zzso Since previous studies have demonstrated that the zzso gene is zzso by zzso we also studied zzso of zzso promoter zzso zzso gene zzso with and without a zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
