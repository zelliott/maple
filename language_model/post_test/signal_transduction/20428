The powerful tumor zzso zzso takes charge of a regulatory network to guard over the living cells from harmful effect of different forms of stress and eradicate the tumor cells for normal zzso condition zzso However the zzso function of zzso is often attenuated or even omitted mainly due to two alternative mechanisms, direct gene zzso in zzso or negative controlled by zzso zzso In this article, overview on different therapeutic strategies that are exploited to restore the zzso therapeutic effect to zzso will be zzso including pharmacological rescue of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We attempt to focus on the medicinal chemistry aspects of small zzso agents targeting the zzso zzso and recent progress in these zzso In addition, the mechanism of action and zzso activity of different classes of compounds targeting the zzso pathway, as well as zzso zzso are zzso
