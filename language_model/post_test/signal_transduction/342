zzso zzso is a model species for the study of the unique secondary metabolism in zzso zzso analysis was used to identify and profile zzso zzso and free zzso in leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso infected with the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Use of a high resolution zzso with a collision induced zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso permitted structural zzso of target secondary zzso and four new zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Changes in the zzso zzso and its zzso precursors were zzso monitored at various time points after zzso spore zzso Application of spores induced disease symptoms in the leaves of infected plants and resulted in an increase in the zzso precursors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between one and three days zzso Relative zzso of zzso were highest five days zzso The rapid increase of these molecules was clearly positively correlated to the infection process as certain of them were absent in zzso leaves, suggesting that the relative rate of their synthesis is tightly related with the infection zzso
