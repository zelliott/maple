zzso the role of zzso zzso zzso in the pathological process represents a unique experimental challenge especially when the zzso occur outside of coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso region of Kirsten rat zzso viral zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of cancer and the response to targeted zzso This zzso zzso is thought to affect the binding of the zzso zzso which allegedly zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we inserted the zzso zzso gene zzso in the zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso and assessed the cellular and zzso zzso We observed a significant increase in cellular zzso as well as a reduction in the levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed no zzso change in the zzso protein expression or zzso of the downstream zzso activated zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso exerts a biological effect not through zzso zzso of zzso but rather by tuning the expression of the zzso zzso
