Ethanol zzso consumption by juveniles and adolescents is an important public health zzso Recent studies have indicated that adolescent animals are less zzso by zzso than adult animals and experience less motor zzso Thus, human adolescents may be able to consume more zzso prior to zzso putting them at greater risk for zzso addiction and other negative consequences of zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying this zzso difference are zzso One contributing factor may be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to produce zzso We have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso are less powerfully enhanced by zzso in zzso from juvenile or adolescent animals than in those from adult zzso however, the mechanisms of this zzso difference in sensitivity are zzso 

Using zzso recording, we tested the response of spontaneous and miniature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso in rat zzso slices from animals representing two distinct zzso zzso adolescent and zzso 

We found significantly greater zzso enhancement of the frequency of zzso in cells from adult animals compared to those from adolescent zzso Although zzso also increased the frequency of zzso this effect was not age zzso zzso did not significantly affect the zzso of zzso 

We conclude that the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso processes to zzso increases with development from the adolescent period to adulthood, and that this is likely zzso by zzso changes in the effect of zzso on zzso zzso
