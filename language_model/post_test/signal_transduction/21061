The great advances made over the last few years in the identification of zzso molecules that pattern the limb bud along the three axes make the limb an excellent model system with which to study zzso mechanisms in zzso The understanding of the zzso networks and their mutual interactions during limb development requires the zzso of the corresponding downstream zzso In this study we report the expression pattern of zzso a zzso gene of the snail family, during the development of the zzso and its regulation by distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is highly zzso and at different stages of limb development can be correlated with the zone of polarizing activity, the progress zone and the zzso zzso We show that the maintenance of its expression is dependent on signals from the zzso zzso zzso and independent of Sonic zzso We also report that, in the zzso zzso cells lie outside of the zzso of zzso zzso The correlation of zzso expression with areas of zzso zzso at stages of tissue differentiation is consistent with its role in early development, in maintaining the zzso zzso and zzso differentiation zzso We suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso interactions that lead to the maintenance of the progress zzso
