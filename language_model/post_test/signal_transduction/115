zzso of the zzso process is a common feature of developing zzso but most studies on zzso cell division have focused on cells dividing in zzso Here, we used in zzso zzso zzso zzso to explore the role of zzso in governing cell division in the developing neural zzso of zzso zzso We find that zzso is crucial for stable positioning of the zzso zzso in these cells, but was not required for zzso positioning in zzso zzso zzso We also find that divisions in the zzso neural plate are zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso are essential for establishing this zzso When zzso is zzso zzso zzso and the final orientation of divisions is zzso Finally, the zzso orientation of cell divisions in this tissue seems to be independent of zzso cell polarity zzso signaling and does not require normal neural zzso Our data provide new insights into the coordination of cell division and zzso in zzso cell sheets and reveal novel, zzso roles for zzso in zzso positioning and zzso zzso
