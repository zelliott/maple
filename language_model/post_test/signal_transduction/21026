zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso clone 15 zzso has been described as a zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been shown to bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is present at zzso pits and zzso Upon stimulation of cells with zzso or transforming growth factor zzso zzso becomes rapidly and zzso zzso on zzso zzso This zzso zzso with an increase of 8 zzso in molecular zzso Here we show that this increase in molecular mass is not due to zzso zzso Instead, we found both by Western zzso and protein sequencing that this zzso increase in molecular mass is the result of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was inhibited under conditions that blocked zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our results establish zzso as a second form of zzso zzso modification of zzso
