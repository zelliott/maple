zzso zzso and lettuce plants zzso zzso showed zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused a dramatic induction of early zzso genes in zzso zzso transgenic zzso Plant small heat shock proteins function as zzso in protein zzso In addition, they are involved in responses to various zzso zzso such as dehydration, heat and high zzso in zzso However, it remains elusive how they play a role in the zzso stress responses at the molecular zzso In this study, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso positively regulates the zzso stress responses by modulating zzso acid zzso signaling in zzso and also in lettuce, a zzso plant when zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso and lettuce leads to hypersensitivity to zzso and enhanced resistance to zzso and high zzso zzso Moreover, early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were rapidly induced in zzso transgenic zzso and zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso stress responses by positively modulating zzso signaling in both zzso and zzso Moreover, our results suggest that zzso lettuce can be engineered using the genetic and molecular resources of zzso
