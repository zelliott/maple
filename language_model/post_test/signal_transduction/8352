Growth factor zzso signaling via zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the basic cellular communication principals found in all zzso zzso signals are transferred via membrane spanning receptors into the zzso zzso zzso zzso being the hallmark of all zzso In recent years zzso approaches have yielded detailed descriptions of cellular signaling zzso zzso zzso is able to characterize the exact position and strength of zzso modifications zzso providing essential information for understanding the molecular basis of signal zzso Numerous new zzso modification sites have been identified by quantitative mass zzso zzso In addition, plentiful new players in signal zzso have been identified underlining the complexity and the modular architecture of most signaling zzso In this review, we outline the principles of signal zzso via zzso and highlight some of the new insights obtained from zzso approaches such as protein zzso and quantitative mass zzso
