zzso inhibit zzso zzso axis zzso however, the neural zzso and pathways zzso this effect are not well zzso The zzso is a zzso structure that provides zzso drive to the zzso axis under conditions of zzso The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of zzso signaling within distinct zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso axis in response to psychological zzso Exposure of rats to zzso restraint stress increased the zzso activity of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso throughout the zzso In stressed rats, zzso content in the zzso was zzso correlated with serum zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity within the zzso zzso complex zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso this effect was blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso decreases in zzso zzso zzso by zzso contribute to zzso of the neuroendocrine stress zzso Local administration into the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso whereas administration of a zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the degree to which stressful stimuli reduce zzso zzso zzso signaling contributes to the magnitude of the zzso zzso
