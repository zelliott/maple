The innate immune response induced by Hantavirus is responsible for zzso cell dysfunction and viral zzso Recent studies demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso and mediates the zzso of several zzso in zzso virus zzso zzso zzso To examine viral interactions with host zzso cells and characterize the innate zzso responses associated with zzso zzso we selected zzso as the target zzso to investigate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells were used to investigate signaling molecules downstream of zzso The expression of the zzso protein zzso was higher in zzso zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso However, there was no apparent difference in the expression of zzso in either cell zzso The zzso factors for zzso and zzso were zzso from the zzso into the nucleus in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso may play an important role in the zzso immunity of the host against zzso infection through an zzso signaling zzso
