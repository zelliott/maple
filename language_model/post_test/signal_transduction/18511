zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso acid zzso are ubiquitous zzso zzso that play important roles in zzso cardiovascular zzso and immunity and are also known to zzso gene expression of specific zzso zzso The mechanism of action of these lipids is thought to be primarily dependent on their specific plasma membrane receptors belonging to the zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso evidence suggests the existence of a functional zzso zzso zzso It has been proposed that immediate effects are zzso via cell surface receptors whereas long-term responses are dependent upon zzso zzso zzso Indeed, receptors for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the cell nucleus of cerebral zzso zzso cells of newborn zzso rat zzso and cells zzso each zzso zzso of isolated zzso with these lipids reveals biological functions including zzso regulation of major zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso oxide zzso In the present review, we shall focus on the nuclear zzso and signaling of zzso recognizing zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso on how nuclear zzso zzso and zzso receptors activate gene zzso and nuclear zzso pathways are zzso zzso signaling for zzso zzso uncover novel pathways to elicit their zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a distinctive mode of action for gene zzso
