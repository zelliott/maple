zzso zzso has emerged as a novel approach to zzso zzso Numerous natural compounds, such as zzso acid, have been tested in zzso and in zzso as zzso agents for cancer prevention and zzso However, whether zzso acid has zzso properties when combined with zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso cells is still zzso In an effort to investigate this effect, human leukemia zzso cells, mouse zzso zzso cells and zzso cell zzso were treated with zzso acid, a zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso or the combination of both, followed by measurement of cellular zzso zzso induction and tumor growth zzso We report, for the first time, that: zzso the combination of natural product zzso acid and the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso results in a synergistic zzso effect on growth of zzso cells and tumors in zzso animal models and zzso there was no apparent systemic toxicity observed in the animals treated with the zzso zzso the findings presented in this study demonstrate that natural product zzso acid is a valuable candidate to be used in combination with zzso zzso thus representing a compelling zzso zzso
