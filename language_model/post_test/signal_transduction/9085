Wall zzso Stress zzso has been identified as an important factor in the zzso of zzso We zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso model to acutely create a region of low magnitude zzso zzso in zzso We employed this model to test the hypothesis that acute changes in zzso in zzso induce zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso by zzso oxygen species zzso zzso generation and zzso expression both increased in regions of low magnitude zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was attenuated by zzso treatment, but was unchanged in zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso However, in both the zzso zzso zzso mice and the zzso mice, low magnitude zzso zzso produced an increase in zzso expression comparable to control zzso Additionally, this same zzso expression was observed in zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that although the zzso state is important to the overall zzso of zzso the initial zzso inflammatory response leading to zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso
