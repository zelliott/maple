zzso are key components in all zzso However, our knowledge of bacterial metabolism is based solely on the study of cultivated organisms which represent just a tiny fraction of microbial zzso To access new zzso reactions and new or alternative zzso we investigated bacterial metabolism through analyses of zzso bacterial zzso 

We applied the gene context approach to assembled sequences of the zzso of the zzso zzso of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, and identified a new gene which may participate in an alternative zzso of zzso zzso 

We characterized a novel, unique zzso that acts exclusively on zzso A zzso zzso and proposed a zzso route for zzso zzso zzso suggest that most of the zzso zzso organisms use this new zzso in the zzso Its presence in organisms representative of two distinct bacterial divisions indicate that it may also be present in other zzso
