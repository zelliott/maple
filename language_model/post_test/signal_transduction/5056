zzso zzso is epidemic in obese zzso males with type 2 diabetes, but the direction of causality remains zzso zzso males and global zzso zzso zzso knockout mice are insulin resistant with increased fat, but it is unclear whether zzso signaling in zzso tissue mediates body fat zzso and alters zzso zzso To investigate this, mice with selective zzso of zzso in zzso zzso were zzso Male zzso mice on normal diet had reduced zzso fat but were zzso and by age 12 months, were insulin deficient in the absence of zzso On high-fat diet, zzso mice had impaired zzso insulin zzso and zzso with increased zzso to visceral zzso zzso screening in zzso mice revealed a selective increase in plasma and zzso zzso binding protein 4 zzso that preceded zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso signaling in zzso not only protects against high-fat zzso visceral obesity but also regulates insulin action and zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso in zzso in mice resembles human type 2 diabetes, with early insulin resistance and evolving insulin zzso
