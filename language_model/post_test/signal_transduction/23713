zzso stem cells offer several potential advantages over other types of stem cells for cardiac zzso Nevertheless, poor survival of donor cells is one of the major concerns that zzso a better zzso zzso which involved in zzso zzso zzso interaction and zzso zzso with a dual role as an zzso and zzso zzso can effectively resolve this zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso may play a role in stem cell survival and zzso zzso activates several signaling pathways in stem cells, particularly the survival zzso zzso which is also an important zzso of zzso and zzso Based on these characteristics of zzso we investigated the potential of zzso zzso to induce zzso and zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso stem cells were zzso with zzso for increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression as well as zzso expression levels were evaluated using Western zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso in zzso Increased zzso elevated membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso which was activated by zzso zzso This mechanism may serve to improve zzso stem cell viability in host zzso
