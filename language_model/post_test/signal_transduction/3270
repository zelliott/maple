The host response to the low zzso avian influenza zzso zzso zzso and zzso viruses were examined in zzso zzso and zzso cells using a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso viruses zzso efficiently in zzso and zzso cells, while the zzso virus zzso least efficiently in these cell zzso However, all zzso viruses exhibited similar and higher replication efficiencies in zzso zzso A comparison of the host responses of these viruses and the zzso virus and low passage zzso clinical zzso was performed in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso virus zzso exhibited a robust induction of Type I and Type III zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso zzso from between 3 and 6 zzso which correlated with large increases in zzso gene zzso expression by 10 zzso In contrast, cells infected with the zzso or zzso virus showed only small increases in Type III zzso zzso low levels of zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of the zzso zzso protein was observed in zzso cells infected with all viruses except the zzso virus, while zzso zzso zzso was only observed in cells infected with the zzso and the zzso virus zzso No zzso expression and low zzso expression levels were generally observed in zzso cells infected with either zzso while increased zzso and zzso expression was observed in response to the zzso zzso These data suggest differences in the replication characteristics and antivirus zzso responses both among the different zzso zzso and between these viruses and the zzso viruses zzso These zzso differences in host cell zzso highlight the importance of examining the host response to avian influenza viruses that have not been extensively adapted to zzso tissue zzso
