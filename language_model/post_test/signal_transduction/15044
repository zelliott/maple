Cystic zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Wild type and zzso zzso channels can be activated by zzso a well tolerated dietary compound with some appeal as a prospective zzso zzso However, we show here that zzso has the unexpected effect of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso This effect occurred for zzso channels in zzso as well as in intact cells and at the same zzso that are effective for promoting zzso channel activity zzso zzso Both mature zzso zzso at the cell surface and immature zzso protein in the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso although the latter pool was more susceptible to this zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso as well as a variety of deletion zzso that lack the major zzso zzso In zzso zzso could be prevented by high zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and sodium zzso indicating a possible zzso reaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso that lack the zzso beta zzso zzso had no zzso zzso One of these zzso derivatives zzso the activities of wild type zzso channels, Delta zzso channels, and zzso channels in excised membrane zzso Like the parent compound, the zzso zzso zzso activated zzso channels in excised patches during prolonged exposure zzso zzso Our results raise a note of caution about secondary zzso effects of zzso compounds like zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso derivatives may have better therapeutic potential in this zzso
