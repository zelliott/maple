zzso zzso Growth Factor 9 zzso has been demonstrated by zzso studies in mouse to be critical for the proliferation of the zzso We now show that zzso is also expressed at significant levels in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Using zzso lung zzso culture, we show that zzso triggers the proliferation of the zzso zzso leading to the formation of a zzso zzso On embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation of the zzso but fails to trigger a similar effect on the zzso therefore involving the zzso zzso in the zzso response of the zzso to zzso While zzso zzso the differentiation of the zzso the zzso appears to differentiate zzso At the molecular level, zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso likely via increased expression of zzso and 5 and controls the zzso of zzso targets zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso by increasing zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Our work shows for the first time that zzso acts on the zzso involving zzso to control its proliferation but not its differentiation and contributes to the regulation of zzso zzso signaling in the zzso
