zzso with highly zzso avian influenza viruses zzso in humans lead to systemic disease associated with zzso storm and zzso zzso In this study we aimed to identify the role of zzso for the host response to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, we surprisingly demonstrate a reduced immune response of human zzso to zzso H5N1 compared to human influenza A zzso In zzso analyses we could reveal a potential role of the zzso orphan zzso alpha zzso for the gene expression pattern induced by zzso zzso is known as an inhibitor of zzso zzso We provide evidence that in zzso zzso is activated by zzso resulting in inhibited zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso signaling upon H5N1 infection, confirming the biological relevance of zzso as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso our study reveals a novel zzso escape mechanism by which H5N1 prevents an effective inflammatory response of zzso blocking zzso gene zzso
