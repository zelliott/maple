zzso zzso and zzso mediate their effects on zzso through the classic vitamin D zzso zzso as well as through rapid zzso mechanisms, which result in both zzso and zzso zzso In intact cells, it is difficult to distinguish between zzso responses via the zzso and zzso and zzso responses via zzso zzso In this study, we used two zzso of zzso that have been modified on the zzso zzso zzso and are only zzso as effective in binding to the zzso as zzso to examine the role of the zzso in the response of rat zzso resting zone zzso and growth zone zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso production zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso were measured after treatment with zzso M zzso zzso M zzso or the zzso at zzso zzso Both zzso inhibited proliferation of both cell types, as did zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso had an effect on zzso production by zzso or zzso zzso caused a zzso stimulation of protein zzso C zzso that was not inhibited by zzso or zzso D in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, had no effect on zzso activity in zzso and only a slight zzso effect in zzso Both cells produce zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the initial stages of zzso in culture that are regulated by vitamin D zzso Since these zzso contain no DNA or zzso they provide an excellent model for studying the mechanisms used by vitamin D zzso to mediate their zzso zzso When zzso zzso were isolated from zzso cultures of growth zone cells and treated with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso activity was observed that was similar to that found with zzso Plasma zzso contained increased zzso activity after treatment with zzso but the magnitude of the effect was less than that seen with zzso zzso zzso had no affect on zzso activity in either membrane zzso When zzso zzso from resting zone zzso cultures were treated with zzso a significant decrease in zzso activity was zzso No change in zzso activity was found for either zzso or the zzso zzso activity in the plasma membrane zzso however, was increased by zzso as well as by analogue zzso This study shows that these zzso with little or no binding to the vitamin D zzso can affect cell proliferation and zzso activity, but not zzso zzso The direct membrane effect is analogue specific and cell maturation zzso Further, by eliminating the zzso component of the cellular response, we have provided further evidence for the existence of a membrane zzso involved in zzso zzso effects of vitamin D zzso
