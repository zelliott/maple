The zzso zzso protein family has seven members zzso The zzso proteins share structural similarities characterized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso target motifs in the zzso zzso indicating an adapter zzso Indeed, zzso was originally identified as a 62 zzso protein that binds with zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso upon zzso zzso by a variety of protein zzso zzso Among the zzso family, only zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and its closest relative zzso act as negative regulators of the zzso zzso downstream of many zzso signaling systems, and it is believed that recruitment of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is critical to their negative zzso By contrast, zzso does not bind with zzso zzso However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso where the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso appears to be zzso Here, we review the zzso roles and underlying mechanisms of zzso family zzso
