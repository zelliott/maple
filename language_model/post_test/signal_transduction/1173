Recent studies have revealed that zzso bone zzso cultured mast cells zzso which are zzso immature mast cells, express functional zzso and zzso that recognize distinct zzso zzso However, it remains relatively uncertain whether mast cells express other zzso We recently established a method to obtain large numbers of zzso fetal zzso cultured mast cells zzso these cells exhibit important features of zzso tissue type mast zzso Working with zzso and zzso the zzso zzso expression profiles were compared between both cell zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso were detected in both cells at comparable levels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed by zzso at higher levels than by zzso suggesting distinct zzso expression profiles among different mast cell zzso With respect to their functional aspects, zzso but not zzso dose zzso produced zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso failed to induce zzso and zzso production by both mast cells, although zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso production by both zzso zzso cells, thus, may have potential to recruit other immune cells to the infected sites by responding to various bacterial and viral components through zzso signaling zzso presumably being involved in initiating innate immunity and subsequently linking innate and acquired immune zzso
