The zzso growth factor zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso plays a crucial role in cellular zzso both in embryonic development and in adult zzso By zzso of zzso proteins on zzso signals may be transmitted which result in gene zzso zzso flux and zzso to name but a few of the zzso effects of zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso is relatively well studied amongst an increasing family of zzso zzso and makes a good model system for studying zzso relationships involved in signal zzso Here, the zzso relationships for cellular transformation by the zzso zzso zzso are reviewed as well as data pertaining to its zzso in human zzso
