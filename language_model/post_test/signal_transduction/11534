A zzso substitution zzso at position 825 of the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso G proteins is associated with alternative zzso and enhanced signal zzso There is accumulating evidence from different populations that the zzso zzso is associated with increased prevalence of hypertension, zzso and left zzso zzso However, it is unclear to what extent the zzso zzso has a direct influence on left zzso structure, independently of the effects of pressure and body mass zzso Therefore we explored whether the zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased left zzso mass index in a selected and homogeneous group of young, never treated, mild zzso 

Young subjects zzso zzso zzso aged 18 to 45 zzso were zzso at the zzso 825 zzso In each patient, zzso ambulatory blood pressure zzso measurement and two-dimensional guided zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso distribution among patients was in zzso zzso Patients carrying the zzso zzso had an increased left zzso mass index zzso zzso zzso v zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in comparison to those with zzso zzso The association between left zzso mass index and zzso zzso was independent of zzso age, zzso heart rate, alcohol zzso and physical zzso 

In young patients with mild hypertension without heart disease the zzso zzso is associated with an increased left zzso mass zzso These zzso data suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be considered as one genetic marker zzso to an increase in left zzso mass in zzso and justifies larger zzso
