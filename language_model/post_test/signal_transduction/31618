The zzso production of precursor zzso zzso in skin zzso that are derived from systemic sclerosis zzso is associated with the induction of zzso and zzso which contributes to the zzso of zzso However, little is understood about how zzso zzso regulates the expression of the other molecules in zzso We report here that zzso can form a complex with zzso proteins that is zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso that used zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear extracts of zzso showed three specific bands zzso equal to 31, 35, and 65 zzso The zzso zzso was identified as zzso and the zzso and zzso molecules might be zzso zzso A partial sequencing for the 10 zzso from the zzso of the molecules showed zzso zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso type II zzso zzso of the genes of zzso or zzso induced the zzso effects of zzso signal zzso including production of zzso and zzso by zzso In particular, zzso was not zzso into the nucleus by an zzso of zzso These findings reveal that nuclear zzso of zzso depends on the binding to zzso and that biological activities might be zzso by the binding to both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
