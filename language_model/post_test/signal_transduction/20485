zzso oxygen species are byproducts of zzso zzso and thus potential regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex, thereby regulating entry of carbohydrates into the zzso acid zzso zzso Here we show that zzso activity is inhibited by low levels of hydrogen zzso zzso generated by the respiratory zzso This occurs via zzso zzso of zzso zzso 45 and zzso on zzso and results in increased zzso zzso complex zzso zzso derives from zzso zzso and we show that conditions that inhibit zzso also zzso the zzso cycle zzso zzso These findings suggest that under conditions of high zzso zzso production, such as may occur under zzso excess and low zzso demand, the increase in zzso and zzso may provide feedback signals to zzso zzso zzso
