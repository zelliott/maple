zzso zzso zzso are not viable and die because of defects in zzso development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso might advance zzso medicine by avoiding zzso However, previous reports suggest that zzso may fail to differentiate and contribute to some zzso in zzso including muscle and zzso and it remains unclear whether zzso themselves can form all tissue types in the zzso We found that derivation of zzso is more efficient than of zzso derived from zzso zzso in association with reduced zzso protein zzso signaling in zzso zzso and their inner cell mass zzso Furthermore, in zzso culture zzso the expression of imprinted genes in zzso and these cells, being functionally indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso can contribute to all zzso in zzso Even more surprisingly, our study shows that live zzso zzso were produced from zzso through zzso zzso zzso which contributes to zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso are capable of zzso development and can differentiate into all cell types and functional zzso in the zzso
