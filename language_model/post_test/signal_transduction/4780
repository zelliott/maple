zzso of zzso proteins to various zzso compartments depends on specific signals present within their zzso zzso Among these sorting signals, the zzso motif zzso is one of the best characterized and is recognized by zzso of the four zzso zzso complexes zzso to zzso Despite their overlap in zzso each zzso has a distinct sequence preference dependent on the nature of the zzso Moreover, combinations of these zzso exert cooperative or zzso effects towards interaction with the various zzso This complexity makes it impossible to predict a zzso the specificity of a given zzso for a particular zzso Here, we describe the results obtained with a zzso approach based on the zzso zzso Network zzso paradigm that addresses the issue of zzso zzso enabling the prediction of zzso interactions with zzso over zzso zzso this approach constitutes a powerful tool to help predict mechanisms of zzso protein zzso
