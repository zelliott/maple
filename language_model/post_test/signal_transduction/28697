When attacked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso acid zzso and salicylic acid zzso zzso as well as genes outside known wounding and zzso signaling zzso A collection of zzso zzso was obtained by differential zzso with zzso prepared from zzso zzso infested by zzso zzso and those from zzso zzso zzso expression profiling using DNA zzso and zzso analyses identified 82 transcript types from this collection responsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso DNA sequencing analyses indicated that these zzso proteins functioning in direct defense, defense zzso zzso burst, secondary zzso zzso stress, cell zzso and photosynthesis, as well as proteins of unknown zzso In response to insect zzso zzso increased transcript abundance of numerous defense zzso with some zzso zzso genes responding to zzso more strongly than to zzso In contrast, only weak induction of zzso defense genes was observed after zzso zzso However, infestation tests confirmed that zzso pathways were effective in plant defense against zzso zzso of certain transcripts exclusively by zzso infestation was observed, and may represent unique signal zzso events independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate that plants zzso regulate defense gene expression when attacked by zzso zzso but also suggest that zzso are able to avoid triggering zzso of some otherwise potentially effective plant defensive machinery, possibly through their particular mode of zzso
