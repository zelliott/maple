zzso root and stem rot zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso is controlled by zzso zzso However, little is known regarding the zzso molecular responses to zzso zzso and how they actually zzso We thus zzso zzso and compared the zzso of 10 near zzso lines zzso each with a unique zzso zzso and the susceptible parent Williams, zzso and zzso with the zzso 

A total of zzso zzso expressed genes zzso were identified in Williams versus zzso to zzso zzso in individual zzso upon zzso with the zzso Comparisons of the zzso between the zzso and Williams identified incompatible interaction genes zzso and compatible interaction genes zzso zzso cluster and zzso analyses consistently grouped the zzso into three zzso zzso I zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso and zzso III zzso zzso zzso 4, 5, and zzso suggesting an overlap in zzso defense signaling among certain zzso Gene zzso zzso analysis revealed associations between members of the zzso family and incompatible reactions and between a number of zzso signaling pathways and zzso zzso These associations appear to be distinguished according to the zzso zzso 

This study characterized genes and multiple branches of putative regulatory networks associated with resistance to zzso zzso in ten soybean zzso and depicted functional zzso of individual zzso resistance responses through comparative zzso zzso Of particular interest are dramatic variations of detected zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso among these soybean zzso implicating their important roles of these signaling in zzso molecular defense zzso We zzso that different timing and zzso in defense signaling to the same pathogen may be largely responsible for such zzso
