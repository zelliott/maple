The role of membrane fluidity in the process of signal zzso after binding of zzso zzso to its specific zzso zzso was investigated in zzso from normal donors and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluidity was assessed by zzso polarization analysis of the zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso incorporated in the zzso core of the cell zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso for zzso disclosed marked membrane zzso in normal zzso without affecting zzso phase separation lacking in zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced a significant decrease of the zzso transition temperature and overall membrane zzso within zzso These effects were not observed in zzso zzso zzso are discussed in terms of defective zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso implications for zzso from proliferation and differentiation signals in the development of zzso
