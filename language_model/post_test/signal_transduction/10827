The zzso zzso is a downstream target of zzso signaling zzso The zzso family of zzso factors has a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation since it controls the timely expression of many genes that are required for cell cycle zzso Moreover, at least one member of this family, zzso can mediate zzso cell zzso We show here that zzso also zzso the activity of a major signal zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity through a zzso zzso We identify the zzso protein zzso associated zzso 2 zzso as a direct zzso target gene and an essential zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso our results suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop involving zzso and zzso
