zzso zzso show a high prevalence of zzso in the zzso zzso which are zzso associated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso The possibility of using zzso on the zzso zzso as became an interesting therapeutic zzso In zzso cancer cells the target zzso implicated on the cellular effects, zzso by zzso of zzso are not well zzso In order to fill this lack of knowledge we studied the proliferation and survival pathways and associated molecules induced by zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines zzso distinct genetic zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso was achieved using zzso interference zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso incorporation and zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso of protein expression were zzso by zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso of zzso zzso lead to a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso D1 levels and an increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in cells with zzso zzso had no effect on zzso In the case of zzso treatment, cells zzso zzso zzso showed increase levels of zzso due to a balance of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso 

Our results in zzso cancer cells, namely those zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso provides important proliferation zzso We have shown that in zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso by affecting zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells which was independent of zzso These results suggest that zzso may prove useful in the treatment of zzso zzso particularly those zzso to conventional treatment and zzso zzso zzso
