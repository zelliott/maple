The purpose of this work was to develop an zzso upper punch to measure the zzso force which occurs when the punch zzso itself from the upper surface of the tablet after zzso A specially designed zzso force sensor zzso with semiconductor strain zzso was inserted into an upper punch with a zzso punch face diameter suitable for a zzso zzso II eccentric zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and a zzso of a new active ingredient resulted in characteristic zzso signals, providing a quantitative measure of the zzso zzso With zzso substances such as zzso zzso tension signals could not be zzso only zzso 1500 showed small zzso force signals that indicated a sticking zzso The zzso force had a specific influence on the extent of the zzso zzso increasing the zzso force caused an increase zzso or a decrease zzso of the zzso force signals due to the plastic and elastic behavior of the zzso Depending on running time, zzso showed an increase in the zzso force, reaching a plateau after 150 zzso The addition of zzso such as zzso zzso resulted in smaller zzso zzso The zzso upper punch is a new helpful tool for the zzso of sticking and a valuable instrument in the development of zzso
