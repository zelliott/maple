Here we review evidence of roles for zzso in the regulation of zzso and synaptic zzso and cell survival in zzso and pathological zzso Signaling pathways modulating zzso activity include those engaged by zzso factors, zzso electrical activity, zzso and zzso zzso Emerging findings support a pivotal role for zzso as a zzso of zzso enduring changes in the structure and function of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may uniquely affect zzso and behavior by regulating specific target zzso zzso zzso can prevent the death of zzso by inducing the production of zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent findings indicate that zzso plays important roles in disorders such as zzso stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as zzso zzso pathways upstream and downstream of zzso in zzso are being zzso and may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention in various neurological zzso
