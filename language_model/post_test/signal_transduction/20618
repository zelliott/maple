zzso is the most common protein synthesis zzso and is believed to specifically inhibit the zzso protein zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso to early zzso in zzso cells independent of zzso zzso zzso but dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or its downstream zzso was not zzso zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited upon zzso with zzso but did not activate zzso The observed effects of treatment with zzso alone are significant and therefore results involving the use of zzso for zzso of protein synthesis must be interpreted with zzso
