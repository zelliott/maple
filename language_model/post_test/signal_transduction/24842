zzso zzso zzso in cell growth, differentiation and zzso via zzso of several zzso in a variety of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are important zzso of the signal zzso zzso from the cell surface to the nucleus, leading to zzso of zzso zzso There are no reports on the effect of zzso on these pathways in gastric zzso zzso 

To investigate whether zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso a zzso factor, in gastric zzso cells zzso 

The activities of zzso and zzso were estimated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was measured by in zzso zzso zzso at various time points zzso zzso after addition of zzso zzso zzso for 20 zzso The activity of zzso was zzso using gel mobility shift zzso at times from 0 to 4 h after addition of zzso 

zzso of zzso was zzso at 10 zzso peaked at 20 zzso and continued at increased levels until 40 zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso during zzso zzso and then decreased within 40 zzso zzso of zzso occurred at 30 zzso and increased activity continued for 6 zzso zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso induced by this zzso may play an important role in the initiation of the inflammatory process in gastric zzso
