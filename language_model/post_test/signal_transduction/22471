zzso zzso zzso zzso account for approximately zzso - zzso of all zzso zzso but its zzso is still zzso This study aimed to explore mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

We used fiber-optic zzso to examine gene expression in three zzso zzso compared with three normal zzso Four zzso expressed genes from the three zzso zzso and three normal zzso were chosen randomly for validation by reverse zzso time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso We then analyzed the zzso expressed gene profile with zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of 28 genes and 8 expressed sequence tags zzso were significantly increased and the expression of 412 genes and 31 zzso were significantly zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the transforming growth factor zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso may play important roles in zzso and progression of zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that numerous zzso expressed genes and several pathways are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso analysis of differential gene expression appears to be a valid method of investigating zzso zzso
