zzso contamination has become a major public health concern zzso zzso data show that long-term zzso exposure results in the risk of skin zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso effects of zzso on skin remain to be zzso 

In the present study we evaluated zzso zzso zzso the signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso and its zzso function in the response to zzso exposure in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We used the zzso reporter zzso and Western blots to determine zzso induction by zzso We zzso dominant negative zzso genetic zzso gene zzso and gene zzso approaches to zzso the signaling zzso involved in zzso induction and its protective effect on cell zzso 

The induction of zzso by zzso was inhibited in zzso cells zzso with zzso a dominant zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso induction exerted an zzso effect on the cells exposed to zzso because cell zzso was significantly enhanced in the zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso small interference zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso showed more resistance to zzso zzso compared with the same control zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso exposure can induce zzso expression through the zzso pathway, which thereby exerts an zzso effect in response to zzso In light of the importance of zzso evasion during zzso we anticipate that zzso induction may be at least partially responsible for the zzso effect of zzso on zzso
