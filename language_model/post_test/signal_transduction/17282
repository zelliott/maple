As one of the key molecules in the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso has been receiving particular zzso Here, we have investigated the expression and regulation of different molecular weight zzso on the biological behaviors of primary human zzso during the first zzso of zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by human first zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso from normal pregnancy or miscarriage by zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso of zzso by primary zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso We also investigated the signaling pathways involved in zzso zzso in human zzso 

The higher zzso expression and zzso zzso were observed in normal zzso than that of zzso and the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso High molecular weight zzso zzso and medium molecular weight zzso zzso promoted proliferation and zzso while inhibited zzso of zzso However, low molecular weight zzso zzso had no obvious effect on the growth or zzso of human zzso In addition, zzso showed more efficiently than zzso on the growth while zzso displayed a more obvious effect on the zzso of zzso than zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling inhibited the zzso growth and zzso of human zzso 

Our results suggest that higher level and greater molecular mass of zzso can promote zzso growth and invasion in an zzso manner, which was beneficial to zzso and maintenance of human early zzso
