Recent studies have shown that zzso possess zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso could differentiate into zzso zzso zzso Although zzso cells are also present in the zzso their origin remains zzso An zzso of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso cells was observed in the zzso and zzso of zzso mice, which were transplanted with a single zzso stem cell isolated from zzso mice and treated with carbon zzso zzso Because the vast majority of zzso cells in the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso they were characterized as pancreatic zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were also observed in zzso mice zzso transferred with zzso but not with other cell lineages isolated from zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso increased in the zzso of zzso mice and their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso II type 1 zzso zzso were expressed on zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso We examined the effect of an zzso zzso zzso which is also a zzso zzso on the migration of zzso into the zzso zzso migrated toward zzso but not zzso II in zzso zzso inhibited not only their in zzso zzso but also in zzso migration of zzso transferred zzso from peripheral blood into the zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced the numbers of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso mice receiving zzso bone zzso zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso inhibited the occurrence of zzso zzso in injured zzso We propose that zzso zzso migrate into the zzso possibly via the zzso zzso and give rise to zzso
