The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has not been fully zzso in human zzso We explored a possible role for zzso in developing lung by determining the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We tested discarded surgical samples of developing human lung tissue using quantitative zzso zzso and zzso for expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We assessed possible functionality of the zzso system by treating lung zzso cultures with zzso zzso and analyzing the cultures for evidence of changes in proliferation and zzso of zzso a signaling zzso associated with zzso zzso analyses of 22 developing lung tissue samples with zzso ages zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is most abundant in developing zzso whereas zzso for zzso and zzso are minimally zzso zzso zzso levels correlated with zzso age zzso zzso zzso and zzso was localized predominantly to airway zzso zzso zzso analysis detected zzso expression in 16 of 19 developing lung zzso Supporting functional capacity in the immature zzso zzso treatment of lung zzso cultures resulted in significantly increased zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, which is downstream from zzso suggesting that proliferation was due to zzso of zzso receptors by zzso We conclude that developing lung expresses the zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso may promote airway zzso proliferation in the developing zzso
