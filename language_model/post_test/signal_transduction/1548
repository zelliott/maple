Recent studies suggest that zzso are involved in numerous cell functions, including membrane traffic and zzso Here we zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 98, that zzso zzso possessing the expected zzso characteristics of zzso are present in the cell membrane at 37 degrees zzso After zzso these zzso are zzso as membrane zzso with a mean diameter of approximately 70 zzso These findings provide further evidence for the existence of zzso under zzso conditions and are the basis of a new isolation method allowing more accurate analyses of raft zzso We found that main components of T cell zzso zzso signal initiation machinery, zzso zzso complex, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso into a subset of zzso zzso studies in both intact cells and isolated zzso showed that upon zzso zzso zzso the signaling in this specialized raft zzso Our data thus strongly indicate an important role of zzso in organizing zzso early signaling pathways within small membrane zzso both prior to and following zzso engagement, for efficient zzso signal initiation upon zzso
