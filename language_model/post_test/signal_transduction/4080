The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity in the rat zzso To examine this zzso action of zzso further, its effects were examined in zzso animals, which reportedly exhibit zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As previously observed, zzso of zzso activity by zzso was zzso with the first phase being zzso whereas the second phase involves a direct action on the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso a marked zzso to the zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso activity was observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for intact and zzso zzso zzso An examination of zzso binding revealed a significant increase in the density of binding sites in zzso zzso with no change in zzso A zzso increase in zzso labeling of two distinct zzso proteins with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 45 zzso suggestive of the alpha zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, was zzso There was a significant increase in zzso zzso binding to both proteins in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso of the zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso activity in zzso zzso may involve zzso of zzso receptors as well as enhanced functional zzso of these receptors to zzso G zzso
