Recently a novel family of zzso the zzso family, has been shown to constitute negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso expression in rat liver is dependent on the presence of growth hormone zzso and that zzso induce zzso zzso expression in cultures of primary rat zzso Furthermore, zzso studies in the rat liver cell line, zzso revealed that zzso expression of zzso but not zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of a zzso reporter gene zzso This indicates a functional role for zzso in the zzso of zzso activated zzso signaling in rat liver zzso In response to the intermittent pattern of zzso zzso in male rats, zzso activates zzso signaling whereas this zzso is blunted in female rats having a continuous pattern of zzso zzso We zzso that zzso induction of zzso could be one mechanism by which sexually zzso zzso signaling via zzso is achieved in the rat zzso
