zzso zzso is known to be zzso and to act as an zzso in melanoma zzso At present, we found that zzso zzso increased pigmentation and protein expression levels of the melanoma zzso recognized by T cells zzso and/or zzso zzso in the human melanoma cells zzso zzso treatment with an inhibitor of zzso zzso the expression level of zzso The target gene of zzso involved in the mechanism was zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which was revealed by gene zzso using short interfering zzso and zzso activity zzso Furthermore, zzso showed obvious zzso of zzso around zzso of human melanoma zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited effects on human zzso zzso isolated from lightly pigmented adult skin similar to those on melanoma zzso In addition, the data indicated that zzso zzso also zzso regulated the zzso response zzso protein 1 zzso zzso factor zzso pathway, which is one of the main pathways active in melanoma zzso In conclusion, our data indicated that zzso zzso had a pivotal role in melanoma through reducing zzso transport and promoting zzso by targeting zzso and through negative regulation of the zzso zzso
