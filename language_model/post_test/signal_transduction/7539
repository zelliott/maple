zzso zzso is a well-known contaminant that has been detected in a wide range of zzso zzso intake represents the greatest source of exposure to zzso In the study, we first found zzso could induce zzso in zzso mice below 1 zzso We investigated serum zzso profile, liver total cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso zzso of Liver and zzso zzso The results showed zzso dose zzso increased serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol zzso decreased serum zzso zzso cholesterol zzso increased relative liver weight, liver zzso and zzso relative zzso tissue weight and enlarged the size of zzso zzso Because zzso signal zzso is important in the process of zzso zzso we further investigated the effects of zzso on zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso ratio, zzso ratio, zzso zzso but increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations indicated that zzso induced zzso in zzso mice at least partially through regulating zzso signaling zzso
