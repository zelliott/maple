The process of zzso zzso after acute kidney injury is thought to zzso zzso development, and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso is a critical step in the zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that class I zzso zzso zzso are required for embryonic kidney gene zzso growth, and zzso The role and underlying mechanisms of class I zzso zzso in zzso zzso however, remain zzso In this study, we used cultured zzso to examine this issue since four class I zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, and 8) are abundantly expressed in this cell zzso zzso class I zzso activity with a highly selective zzso zzso induced global zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and diminished expression of zzso D1 and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso 3, or 8 with small interfering zzso resulted in similar biological zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso was required for zzso zzso and zzso functioned downstream of zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso of zzso 3, or 8 suppressed zzso expression and zzso and zzso zzso and 3 also reduced zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not affect zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso these data reveal a critical role of class I zzso in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
