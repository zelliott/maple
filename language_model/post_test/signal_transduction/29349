zzso protein zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso and fatty acid zzso In muscle cells, zzso stimulates zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso The zzso hormone zzso increases cellular oxygen consumption and is considered to be a major regulator of zzso zzso In this study, we examined the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso action of zzso on zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso rapidly led to zzso of zzso zzso A zzso a direct target of zzso was also zzso after zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso cells enhanced this effect of zzso indicating the involvement of zzso Because zzso cells express only zzso protein zzso zzso zzso one of two known zzso zzso it was suggested that the effect of zzso is zzso by zzso Indeed, experiments using a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso small interfering zzso demonstrated the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to rapidly induce zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso suppressed zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso acids was attenuated by zzso zzso and the small interfering zzso for zzso indicating that zzso zzso of zzso leads to increased fatty acid zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso activates zzso via zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby stimulating zzso fatty acid zzso
