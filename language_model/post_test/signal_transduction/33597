zzso zzso bind to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso to activate a signal zzso cascade that regulates nuclear gene expression and plant zzso Many components of the zzso signaling zzso have been identified and studied in zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso that zzso the signal to downstream components remains zzso zzso studies of plasma membrane proteins lead to the identification of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are zzso by zzso in zzso and interact with zzso in zzso zzso and transgenic studies demonstrate that the zzso represent a small family of zzso that activate zzso signaling downstream of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso are the zzso of zzso zzso that activate downstream zzso signal zzso
