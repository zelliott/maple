zzso hormone receptors zzso are zzso zzso factors that regulate gene zzso zzso also mediate zzso zzso cellular zzso by zzso In vascular zzso cells, the zzso for estrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso is targeted by unknown mechanisms to a functional signaling module in membrane zzso that enables zzso to rapidly activate the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso zzso Here we identify the zzso zzso protein zzso as the molecular anchor that zzso zzso to the membrane and organizes the zzso membrane signaling zzso zzso directly binds to zzso acids zzso of zzso targets zzso to the cell zzso and serves as a scaffold for the formation of an zzso zzso zzso of complex formation between zzso and zzso blocks zzso rapid zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso but has no effect on zzso regulation of an zzso response zzso reporter zzso These findings identify zzso as a molecular scaffold required for zzso zzso zzso zzso of downstream signaling zzso Furthermore, by demonstrating independent regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings provide conceptual support for the potential development of zzso selective zzso zzso
