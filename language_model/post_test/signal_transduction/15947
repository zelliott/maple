zzso is an zzso that is required for the establishment of sister zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome caused by the zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso zzso development disorder characterized by growth zzso limb reduction and zzso abnormalities including zzso lip and zzso Here, we show that zzso protein zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso protein in an zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso might regulate the activity of zzso via attenuating zzso binding to zzso on the promoter of zzso the downstream target gene of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso of zzso promotes the zzso differentiation of zzso embryonic zzso cells and zzso neural zzso cells and the zzso of zzso by zzso blocks the zzso The zzso effects of zzso protein on zzso differentiation of zzso cells was suppressed by zzso zzso Taken together, our study suggests that zzso may play an important role in zzso by attenuating zzso signaling to promote zzso zzso
