The zzso protein zzso zzso interacts with zzso precursor protein zzso and decreases its pathological processing, an effect zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly enriched in zzso zzso a major site of pathological zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso we isolated zzso membrane zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, all of the zzso zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso of total zzso were found in zzso Nearly all of the zzso zzso forms of zzso and zzso were in zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in and out of zzso zzso indicating an association that is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso but increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso deficient zzso or zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso increases, whereas zzso of zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso with these zzso zzso treatment led to increased zzso zzso and decreased association between zzso and zzso zzso also caused increased zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso an effect that was not seen in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso treatment promotes the zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso and affects their zzso by zzso thus regulating their zzso
