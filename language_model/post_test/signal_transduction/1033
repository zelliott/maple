To examine whether zzso is a critical component of the genetic program that directs human zzso zzso we used DNA zzso analyses to characterize the effects of a zzso form of the zzso protein upon in zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso cells zzso zzso were cultured for 3 days in the presence of control medium or medium containing an zzso that expresses a zzso zzso of zzso zzso or an zzso lacking the zzso zzso gene zzso DNA zzso analyses using zzso human zzso zzso were performed on zzso extracted from the three groups of cells immediately prior to and after 3 days of cell zzso zzso infected with zzso or zzso underwent zzso differentiation similar to that of zzso cells, with greater than zzso of the cells in each group fusing to form zzso zzso zzso However, zzso markedly inhibited the induction or repression of many genes that were regulated in the zzso and zzso cells during zzso zzso of the 25 most induced genes and 17 of the 20 most zzso genes during differentiation were zzso dependent, with the majority of these related to zzso organization, cellular communication, and signal zzso Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that zzso plays a critical role for both the induction and repression of genes that comprise zzso gene expression programs of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso however, is not required for the fusion of zzso cells to form a zzso or the expression of zzso
