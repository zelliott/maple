In order to define which structure of zzso hormone zzso zzso plays a critical role for zzso interaction and zzso we zzso zzso and zzso activity in Chinese zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso with zzso and zzso as well as the zzso structures of chemically zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso the linear zzso designated as zzso revealed a preference for the zzso whereas its zzso and zzso values were comparable to those of zzso reported zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso remarkably decreased the zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, maximum zzso activity was observed at a higher concentration zzso zzso of zzso and zzso preference was changed into zzso zzso In contrast, zzso lost its zzso activity almost completely, even though it bound to both zzso Whereas the solution zzso of zzso revealed a stable type I zzso structure, zzso revealed a tight zzso composed of zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso decreased not only the zzso zzso but also the zzso activity in both the zzso and the zzso The structure of zzso exhibited a stable type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a greatly reduced binding affinity and zzso activity with the loss of zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso also demonstrated a zzso zzso around zzso From the above results, we conclude that a type I zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was important for zzso binding and zzso as well as the selectivity of zzso zzso
