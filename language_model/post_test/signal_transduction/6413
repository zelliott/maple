zzso zzso naturally occurring in zzso such as zzso and zzso can play a critical role in major zzso functions in plants and zzso We show that zzso a zzso zzso with zzso activity in tobacco zzso zzso zzso after chemical zzso an zzso of the salicylic acid zzso signaling zzso in tobacco and zzso zzso In tobacco cell suspensions, the zzso burst induced by the zzso zzso zzso was zzso dependent but partially zzso independent, whereas zzso triggered a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso or zzso remained fully responsive to a second application of zzso or zzso respectively, suggesting two distinct perception zzso In tobacco leaves, zzso but not zzso caused zzso leakage and triggered zzso and zzso zzso zzso of different families of zzso zzso proteins was analyzed in zzso and zzso tobacco as well as in zzso zzso induced expression of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso triggered expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso (for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso a minimum chain length is essential for biological activity of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso are essential and cannot be replaced by other zzso groups, and zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso are zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced immunity against zzso mosaic virus infection, whereas zzso induced only a weak zzso The results open new routes to work out new molecules suitable for crop zzso
