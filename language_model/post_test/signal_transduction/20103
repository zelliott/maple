The immune system targets zzso cells by different zzso One of the essential zzso mechanisms is zzso induced by zzso of tumor necrosis factor zzso 1 zzso This zzso can be activated by tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso which upon binding to zzso zzso the assembly of first an inflammatory and later a zzso signaling zzso Here, we report that infection by human zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and 8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso indicating zzso of both the inflammatory and zzso signaling zzso We identified a zzso zzso viral zzso zzso as sufficient for zzso this zzso zzso was shown to locate to the cell zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso 3 and 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that the protein is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso signaling during zzso These results suggest an important novel function of zzso as a viral immune evasion protein during zzso zzso
