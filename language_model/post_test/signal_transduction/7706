The root system is fundamentally important for plant growth and survival because of its role in water and zzso zzso zzso plants rely on zzso of root system architecture zzso to respond to a changing soil zzso Although zzso is a highly plastic trait and varies both between and among species, the basic root system zzso and its plasticity are controlled by inherent genetic zzso These mediate the modification of zzso mostly at the level of root zzso in response to a suite of zzso and zzso zzso Recent progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of these responses suggests that they largely feed through hormone zzso and signaling zzso Novel factors implicated in the regulation of zzso in response to the myriad zzso and zzso signals are also increasingly isolated through alternative approaches such as quantitative trait locus zzso
