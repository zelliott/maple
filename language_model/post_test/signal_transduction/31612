zzso oxide zzso has been suggested to be associated with zzso zzso in diabetic zzso zzso zzso handling in the zzso may play an important role in the development of diabetic zzso This study was designed to investigate the effect of NO generation and action in zzso zzso exposed to high zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso production compared with normal zzso zzso zzso when the incubation period was for 12, 18, or 24 zzso zzso inhibited zzso protein zzso zzso zzso at 4, 8, and 12 zzso Both NO donors and zzso zzso treatment induced high levels of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso at 30 zzso were blocked by NO donors and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were markedly suppressed by NO donors or zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit zzso cell cycle progression was verified by the observation that NO donors and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and increased zzso and zzso (but not zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso significantly blunted NO zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso may zzso zzso zzso response via specific zzso
