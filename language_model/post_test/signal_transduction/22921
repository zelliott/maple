Bone zzso zzso or zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso of embryonic long bones and is thought to play a role in zzso zzso Previously we have shown that zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso and zzso in cultured zzso of embryonic mouse zzso However, the mechanism of this zzso and the target cells of zzso are still zzso In this study we show that zzso zzso terminal zzso differentiation zzso via an interaction with the zzso region of the zzso This region also expresses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates terminal zzso differentiation by zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The zzso center in turn regulates zzso expression via a feedback loop involving Indian zzso zzso which is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso is thought to act on zzso cells, which in turn start to express an as yet unknown zzso that stimulates zzso expression in the zzso zzso It has been suggested that this factor belongs to the zzso We investigated whether the zzso of terminal zzso differentiation by zzso was due to zzso of the zzso feedback loop and whether zzso was the unknown factor in the zzso Here we show that zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso in cultured zzso embryonic zzso Furthermore, zzso could still inhibit terminal zzso differentiation in the zzso of zzso zzso mouse zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso of terminal zzso differentiation in zzso is independent of the zzso feedback zzso We concluded that zzso zzso terminal zzso differentiation and cartilage zzso of fetal bone zzso in zzso via as yet unknown zzso zzso produced in the zzso zzso
