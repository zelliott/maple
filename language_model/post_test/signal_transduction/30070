zzso zzso is a model system for signal zzso noted for its relative zzso high sensitivity, wide dynamic range and zzso Changes in zzso zzso are sensed by a protein assembly consisting of zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso In zzso coli, these components are organized at the cell poles in tight clusters that contain several thousand copies of each zzso Here we studied the effects of variation in the composition of clusters on the activity of the zzso and its sensitivity to zzso zzso monitoring responses in zzso using zzso resonance energy zzso Our results indicate that zzso of bacterial zzso work in a highly cooperative manner, mimicking the zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso steep responses to zzso in zzso with homogeneous zzso populations also enhance the sensitivity of the response in zzso zzso This is consistent with a number of models that assume long-range cooperative interactions between receptors as a general mechanism for signal integration and zzso
