The treatment of zzso zzso cells with the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of cell zzso This was associated to a rapid and significant increase of zzso levels and was zzso by treatments that augment cellular zzso zzso experiments with radioactive zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso oxide strongly reduced the zzso of zzso for the zzso of both zzso and zzso Nevertheless, zzso oxide did not modify the activity of different zzso of zzso zzso The possibility that zzso oxide zzso the availability of zzso for zzso zzso was then zzso The metabolism of zzso demonstrated that zzso oxide did not affect the zzso of zzso but inhibited the zzso zzso of long chain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from the recycled zzso Moreover, results obtained with fluorescent zzso zzso A, zzso zzso as well as in a zzso transport zzso indicate that zzso oxide zzso the traffic of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso All this supports that, in zzso cells, the zzso of zzso traffic can contribute to the regulation of its zzso levels and participate in the zzso zzso signaling zzso involved in the control of cell zzso
