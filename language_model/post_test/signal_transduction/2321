zzso proteins are involved in signal zzso by a number of growth factor receptors and in the organization of the zzso The recently identified zzso zzso which contains an zzso domain, is coupled functionally and physically to the zzso and is zzso zzso by this zzso and other receptors as zzso Here, we examined the regulation of zzso expression in response to zzso or zzso zzso We show that zzso is expressed at low levels in resting zzso but its expression is strongly induced during zzso by serum, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso but not of other zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso is virtually extinguished in zzso terminally differentiated zzso zzso zzso The putative role of zzso protein as a zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and in quail zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected only at the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not zzso zzso whereas it zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso may be a critical zzso of zzso They further establish zzso as an example of a signal zzso whose expression senses the balance between growth and differentiation and might, therefore, be involved in the determination of the zzso
