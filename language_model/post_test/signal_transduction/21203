zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso suppress zzso zzso and zzso administration reduces joint swelling and tenderness in zzso arthritis patients with active zzso In an effort to dissect the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso and other fatty acids influence zzso function, we examined their effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso early signaling events in human T zzso zzso blood zzso cells from healthy individuals were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C with or without 10 zzso fatty acid and then loaded with the calcium binding fluorescent dye zzso zzso acids did not affect the efficiency of zzso zzso and they did not alter cell surface membrane expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso changes were monitored by flow zzso in zzso selected human T zzso The ratio of violet to blue fluorescence, which is zzso to zzso was measured over zzso zzso enriched with zzso and zzso but not cells enriched with zzso acid zzso displayed a significant reduction in zzso zzso early and late zzso zzso T cells loaded with zzso zzso or medium alone displayed similar increases in zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was also diminished in zzso and zzso zzso These experiments suggest that zzso and zzso suppress T cell zzso by interfering with early events in the signal zzso zzso
