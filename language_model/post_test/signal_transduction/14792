Aging is one of the main risk factors for the development of zzso and, therefore, for coronary artery zzso zzso zzso of the vascular wall includes zzso enlargement, zzso and zzso zzso and increased vascular zzso As aging occurs, smooth muscle cells zzso progressively migrate from the zzso media and accumulate into the zzso zzso Aging also associates with changes of zzso zzso and zzso behavior and response to growth factors, such as transforming growth zzso Aging zzso a reduction in the density of the zzso of zzso zzso channels in coronary smooth muscle and increases the response to zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso we have recently shown that the zzso effect of male sex hormone testosterone, which is zzso through large zzso zzso zzso channel opening action, decreases with zzso Apart from zzso zzso of the vascular wall, zzso function declines with zzso This is most obvious from the zzso of zzso zzso responses, which is a consequence of the zzso in the expression and/or activity of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso of the zzso NO zzso and increased formation of zzso oxygen zzso In fact, in the course of aging, there is an zzso in the equilibrium between relaxing and contracting factors released by the zzso zzso there is a progressive reduction in the participation of NO and zzso zzso factor zzso associated with increased participation of zzso free zzso and zzso zzso Also, the zzso and zzso II pathways may play a role in age-related zzso zzso Aging is also associated with a reduction in the zzso capacity of the zzso and zzso zzso which is characterized by an increased rate of zzso cell zzso Thus, aging elicits several changes in the vascular zzso gradually altering its zzso from an zzso to a zzso zzso In conclusion, it becomes increasingly evident that the blood vessel structural and functional zzso which characterize vascular aging, make a major contribution to zzso target organ zzso The use of drugs, including zzso therapy, zzso drugs, and zzso seems to be zzso
