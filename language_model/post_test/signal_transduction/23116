The zzso system is implicated in the zzso of cocaine zzso This study evaluated the status of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso cycle of zzso zzso G zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and associated signaling zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso of drug abusers and zzso and zzso zzso The main results indicate that in cocaine zzso but not in mixed zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in the prefrontal zzso zzso was reduced zzso total zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in zzso and increases in zzso In cocaine zzso the reductions of zzso receptors and zzso zzso to zzso indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was not significantly altered in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cocaine in mice and rats also reduced zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso in the cerebral zzso inducing zzso zzso and/or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso induced opposite effects zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso also behaved as inverse zzso on the zzso of zzso and its target zzso zzso cocaine in mice was associated with tolerance to the acute zzso of zzso and zzso In long-term cocaine zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not altered when compared with controls, indicating that zzso zzso signaling was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling by cocaine may contribute to zzso of zzso and/or zzso in brains of cocaine zzso
