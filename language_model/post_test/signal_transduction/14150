zzso signals are key regulators of zzso and zzso development in zzso zzso It has been observed zzso that in zzso zzso the spatial range of zzso signals is restricted by the signal zzso (also known as zzso zzso signals can activate both zzso and zzso whereas zzso is thought to zzso zzso by binding either directly to it or to its zzso In this paper we develop a mathematical model of this zzso network in a line of zzso We consider the zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms separately and find that, in both cases, the restriction by zzso to the range of zzso signals zzso to wave pinning in the zzso Our analysis indicates that, provided zzso zzso faster than zzso either mechanism can robustly account for the experimental zzso We argue that, in the case of zzso development, it is wave zzso rather than zzso zzso that is underlying zzso zzso This leads to several zzso testable predictions, which are zzso Furthermore, for zzso zzso to prevent waves of zzso expression from zzso the zzso complex must be turned over, and zzso of the complex must be zzso In the absence of molecular mechanisms regulating these, we suggest that zzso restricts zzso signals via zzso and not zzso zzso
