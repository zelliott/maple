zzso zzso zzso 24 h before zzso zzso injury zzso significant zzso in zzso rat zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways play a role in the induction of tolerance to zzso injury in heart and zzso To study the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso zzso we examined the brains of newborn rats at different time points after exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso had no effect on the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, significantly increased levels of zzso zzso were observed zzso h after zzso Double zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso was found mainly in zzso throughout the brain and in zzso in white matter zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso administration of zzso significantly attenuated the zzso afforded by zzso against zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso signaling may contribute to zzso tolerance in zzso rat brain in part by preserving vascular and white matter integrity after zzso
