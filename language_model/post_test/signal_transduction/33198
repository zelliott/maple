The molecular nature, zzso zzso and zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were studied in primary culture of rat zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso express several zzso type I zzso zzso I) zzso including the short zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the latter being restricted to zzso and not found in zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells die rapidly in the absence of a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso which shows that zzso deprivation zzso massive zzso zzso within 12 zzso This effect was reversed by zzso 27 and zzso Both forms of zzso prevent DNA fragmentation and allow long-term zzso survival in the absence of high zzso (as shown by zzso zzso and stimulate a reporter gene driven by the full-length zzso zzso These effects of zzso are fully abolished upon transient zzso of cells with a dominant zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso type I receptors regulate gene expression and promote zzso survival through the zzso zzso
