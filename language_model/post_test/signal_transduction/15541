We introduce a framework wherein various zzso of a zzso network's stationary dynamics can be expanded in terms of the network's zzso Such zzso include the occurrence rate of zzso zzso firing rates within a zzso zzso as well as zzso correlations in activity between various zzso in the zzso The various terms in this expansion can be interpreted as zzso corresponding to zzso of the original network, which span both space (in terms of the network's zzso as well as time (in the sense of zzso
