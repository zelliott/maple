zzso zzso infection is a serious complication in patients with zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso infection triggers zzso of the acid zzso and the release of zzso in zzso zzso zzso reorganizes these zzso into larger signaling platforms that are required to zzso zzso zzso induce zzso and regulate the zzso response in infected zzso Failure to generate zzso membrane platforms in infected cells results in an unabated inflammatory response, massive release of zzso zzso and septic death of zzso Our findings show that zzso membrane platforms are central to the host defense against this potentially lethal zzso
