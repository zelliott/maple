The isolated full-length zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 3 zzso zzso clone was selected from the chili pepper expressed sequence tag database zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso revealed significant sequence similarity to the winter squash zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis disclosed that zzso belongs to a zzso family in the pepper zzso zzso expression was root zzso as shown by Northern zzso zzso The gene was rapidly induced in response to various zzso stress factors and zzso zzso acid application in pepper zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression was induced by an incompatible pathogen and by plant zzso chemicals such as zzso salicylic acid and zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso were investigated using a zzso and zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso proteins retained zzso ability, and displayed zzso activity in zzso in a zzso zzso Further zzso studies showed that zzso fused with soluble modified green fluorescent protein zzso localized to the zzso in chili pepper zzso We propose that zzso is implicated in zzso and zzso stresses in pepper zzso
