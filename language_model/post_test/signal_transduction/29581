zzso zzso zzso a nuclear zzso activated in response to DNA strand breaks, has been implicated in cell dysfunction in zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to participate in zzso and regulation of gene zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso on the signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and heat shock zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Mice genetically deficient of zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant reduction of zzso damage after zzso and zzso of the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery compared with their zzso zzso This zzso was associated with a reduction of the zzso activity of zzso and, zzso reduction of the DNA binding of the signal zzso factor zzso On the contrary, in zzso mice, DNA binding of zzso was enhanced and was associated with a significant increase of the zzso heat shock protein zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that expression of several zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso was altered in zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso may exert a pathological role in zzso injury by functioning as an enhancing factor of zzso zzso and as a zzso factor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
