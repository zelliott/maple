High levels of zzso stress promote cardiac zzso death, though lower levels are potentially zzso We examined the changes in gene expression in rat zzso cardiac zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso or nontoxic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4, or 24 zzso using zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso novel zzso gene zzso zzso transcript 1 zzso which generates two alternatively spliced zzso Using 230 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted significant changes in expression of only 32 zzso all of which were seen with zzso zzso zzso We failed to detect any increase in the rate of protein synthesis in cardiac zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso further suggesting that zzso low zzso of zzso are not anabolic in this zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted significant zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to no established zzso Of the zzso 114 zzso zzso regulators including zzso factors zzso zzso zzso independently verified the changes in zzso zzso Thus, zzso cardiac zzso zzso is associated with dynamic changes in gene zzso The expression of these genes and their protein products potentially influences the progression of the zzso zzso
