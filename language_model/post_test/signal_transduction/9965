The effect of zzso stimulation on cardiac zzso exchange has been zzso To clarify the effect, we measured zzso exchange current zzso in zzso guinea zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso When zzso was defined as a 5 zzso zzso current in guinea pig zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso apparently zzso zzso by approximately zzso However, this increase was probably due to contamination of the zzso zzso current zzso zzso zzso because zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by 1 zzso zzso with a zzso concentration of zzso zzso under conditions where zzso was zzso Five or ten zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso activated by 10 zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acted upstream of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, in a zzso zzso bath solution, 1 zzso zzso did not significantly alter the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso which is close to the reversal potential of zzso No change in zzso zzso was induced by 10 zzso zzso When zzso was activated by zzso zzso it was not significantly affected by 1 zzso zzso in guinea zzso zzso or rat zzso zzso We concluded that zzso stimulation does not have significant effects on zzso in guinea zzso zzso or rat zzso zzso
