High density zzso zzso zzso and zzso remove cellular lipids by two distinct mechanisms, but their relative contribution to reverse cholesterol transport is zzso Whereas zzso cholesterol zzso from cultured cells reflects the activity of the HDL zzso zzso zzso zzso removal is regulated in response to changes in cellular cholesterol content zzso and cell proliferation rates zzso Here we show that zzso of human skin zzso lines with the zzso zzso zzso increased their proliferation rates and selectively reduced the activity of the zzso zzso removal zzso This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in cellular zzso levels and was reversed by treatment with a zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was independent of changes in cellular zzso or activities of zzso zzso cycle zzso The severely impaired zzso zzso removal zzso in zzso disease zzso which persisted after zzso was not improved by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso that the cellular zzso in zzso disease is upstream from this zzso signaling zzso results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso selectively reduces the activity of the zzso zzso removal zzso by a zzso process, perhaps to prevent loss of cellular lipids needed for continual membrane zzso
