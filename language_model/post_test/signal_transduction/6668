The zzso zzso serves as a signal zzso system located in the plasma membrane of apparently every cell type of higher zzso It generates the second zzso zzso zzso which plays an important regulatory role in many diverse biological processes such as zzso and zzso cardiac zzso and zzso vascular tone, neurotransmitter and hormone release in zzso and zzso cells, respectively, and cell zzso zzso zzso acts by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which zzso various ubiquitous and zzso zzso which zzso modifications cause the final cellular zzso The complete zzso zzso signal zzso system is a zzso system consisting of various receptors which recognize the zzso signals, two zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso which zzso the signals from the receptors to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which zzso the formation of zzso zzso from zzso This brief review zzso on our current knowledge about structure and function of the components involved in the stimulation and zzso of zzso zzso and provides some recent data on possible modifications of these zzso
