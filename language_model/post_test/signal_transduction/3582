zzso any discernible sequence zzso zzso zzso and colony stimulating factor 1 zzso signal through a common zzso zzso on cells of zzso zzso zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso fold zzso to zzso and we further show that the complex architecture of zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is similar to the zzso zzso However, unique zzso adaptations in the zzso domain geometry and zzso interface explain the zzso of zzso for two such zzso related zzso The zzso adaptations of the zzso and zzso zzso complexes, when compared to the stem cell factor zzso draw a common evolutionary theme for zzso zzso In addition, the structure of zzso engaged by a zzso zzso reveals the mechanism of a zzso zzso that can help zzso zzso from zzso biology, with implications for therapeutic intervention in diseases with zzso zzso zzso
