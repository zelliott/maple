zzso of the hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been detected in zzso zzso and zzso and in the blood of patients with zzso cancer zzso while their expression is lower in healthy zzso The surface zzso zzso and zzso have been identified as possible markers for zzso stem zzso Our aims were to investigate whether zzso and zzso are expressed by zzso cells in human zzso zzso and in the human zzso cell line zzso and to determine whether this expression is biologically zzso The great majority of the cells expressing zzso also expressed zzso precursors in both zzso cells, which retain a stem zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The zzso cells gave rise to larger zzso in zzso mice compared to zzso zzso The zzso cells displayed enhanced zzso of the zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to regulate the induction of proliferation and/or survival by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells reduced the expression of cancer stem cell markers and abolished zzso development in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso precursors may provide a target for therapies directed against the cells responsible for zzso development and zzso
