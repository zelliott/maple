Previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso NO zzso zzso is involved in high zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso has a protective effect on zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso on human zzso vein zzso cells zzso exposed to high zzso and explored its possible zzso Treatment of high zzso zzso zzso for 48 h significantly induced the zzso of zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso High zzso treatment also decreased zzso and zzso zzso levels with subsequent NO zzso All these zzso induced by high zzso were attenuated by zzso (1 zzso Interestingly, the zzso effect of zzso was inhibited by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The reverse effects of zzso on zzso of zzso and zzso with subsequent NO production were also inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso high zzso zzso in zzso through the zzso zzso
