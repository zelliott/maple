The present study was designed to determine the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso ultrasound zzso induced zzso bone zzso and the role of zzso expression in a rat zzso tooth movement zzso zzso appliances were placed between the zzso upper first zzso and the upper central zzso in rats under general zzso followed by daily zzso zzso or sham zzso treatment beginning at day zzso zzso movement distances and molecular changes were evaluated at each observation zzso In zzso and in zzso studies were conducted to detect zzso zzso growth zzso signaling pathways and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression by quantitative real time zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso At day 3, zzso had no effect on the rat zzso tooth movement distance and zzso zzso bone zzso However, beginning at day 5 and for the following time points, zzso significantly increased zzso tooth movement distance and zzso signaling zzso and zzso expression compared with the control zzso The zzso and Western zzso data in zzso and in zzso to study zzso expression were consistent with the zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso promotes zzso bone zzso by stimulating the zzso signaling zzso and zzso expression in a rat zzso tooth movement model, and zzso increased zzso expression via zzso zzso
