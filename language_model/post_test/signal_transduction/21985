Many functional details of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of immune defense are still zzso We used an established zzso system of zzso zzso signaling to examine if this system would allow for zzso promoter zzso of the serum zzso A zzso gene from rainbow trout zzso zzso and if the key zzso zzso and zzso from trout can functionally substitute for their zzso zzso zzso of the established human embryonic kidney line zzso were zzso zzso with zzso expressing bovine zzso or zzso factors and a reporter gene driven by the promoter of the trout zzso zzso zzso coli stimulation increased reporter gene expression more than zzso zzso series and point zzso identified in the zzso zzso promoter a composite overlapping binding site for zzso and zzso factors as crucial for promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso or different members of the zzso factor family proved this factor as an essential driver for zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of the trout zzso factor reduced zzso zzso promoter zzso confirming functional conservation of its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor from trout also zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso and zzso expression studies confirm the functional zzso of both zzso factors and their zzso zzso We provide for the first time evidence that also the zzso negative loop of zzso signaling may be zzso in zzso zzso
