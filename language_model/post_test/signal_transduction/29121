zzso is well known for its zzso effect on cell cycle zzso checkpoint zzso However, its role in the control of zzso complexes is not well zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at several zzso and zzso zzso and regulates the association of zzso zzso factors with zzso family zzso Recent studies found that predominantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are found to bind to corresponding zzso promoters in zzso zzso As cells progress through zzso zzso complex are replaced by zzso followed by zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso was not zzso in the promoters containing the zzso site in cycling cells but was associated with zzso complexes or zzso complexes during zzso zzso In human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso complexes were found in zzso cells but not in zzso arrested zzso zzso In addition, zzso gel mobility shift zzso zzso could not detect zzso zzso activities either in S or zzso phase but exhibited the existence of zzso in zzso cells and zzso complexes in zzso zzso cells, zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso but not zzso and the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso play a critical role in regulating zzso gene expression in zzso cell cycle control in human zzso leukemia zzso
