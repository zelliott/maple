zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso that has been implicated in the zzso of neurodegenerative diseases, zzso and zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso disease progression have not been zzso In this study we investigate the role of zzso in the cellular response to zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in zzso exposed to oxygen and zzso deprivation zzso and increased zzso expression protects zzso against zzso cell death independent of its zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso factor zzso zzso as a zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso together form the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibited a zzso zzso reporter zzso under hypoxic conditions without affecting nuclear protein levels for zzso or zzso their ability to form the zzso zzso zzso factor, or zzso binding to its DNA response zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso in response to zzso but had no effect on the expression of zzso which has been linked to zzso zzso This study demonstrates for the first time that zzso protects against zzso interacts with zzso and zzso the zzso hypoxic response zzso These results indicate that zzso may play an important role in protecting against the delayed zzso cell death in zzso and zzso
