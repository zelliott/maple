zzso acid zzso and other zzso exert zzso effects through two types of zzso zzso the zzso receptors zzso and zzso X receptors zzso Previous studies demonstrated that the zzso effects of zzso and related zzso are impaired in certain zzso breast cancer cell lines due to their lower levels of zzso alpha and zzso In this study, we evaluated several synthetic zzso for their ability to induce growth zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso particularly in combination with zzso zzso could significantly induce zzso and inhibit the growth and induce the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells but had low activity against zzso zzso cells that express high levels of zzso zzso Using gel zzso and transient zzso zzso we found that the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cells were most likely zzso by zzso zzso that bound to the zzso response element in the zzso promoter and activated the zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso In contrast, growth zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells most probably occurred through zzso alpha zzso that also bound to and activated the zzso zzso In zzso clones zzso expressing zzso zzso both zzso induction and growth zzso by zzso zzso were zzso while the effects of zzso zzso were zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso of zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and suggest that low cellular zzso alpha may regulate the signaling switch from zzso to zzso growth zzso in breast cancer zzso
