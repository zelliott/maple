The responses of single units located in the inferior zzso of zzso mice zzso by zzso were zzso zzso of zzso tone bursts were used as zzso The probability of the response to the second burst in the pair was obtained under two conditions: the presence and absence of spike activity in the reaction to the first zzso With a zzso zzso between the bursts in the majority of units, the probability of response was lower in the presence of spike activity in response to the first zzso In a few number of units, the opposite tendency was zzso As the zzso zzso increased up to 100 and 200 zzso the dependence of the response probability to the second burst on the presence of the firing to the first one gradually zzso The suppression of zzso zzso by zzso emphasized the effect of the zzso decrease in zzso rather than weakened zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso of spike responses to two consecutive signals are zzso
