zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso production by B zzso We previously reported that this zzso production is dependent upon binding of the adapter protein zzso zzso factor 6 to the zzso domain of zzso while binding of zzso zzso factors 2 and 3 is zzso as is the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso The present study was designed to characterize zzso zzso control of the zzso gene in B zzso zzso engagement on B zzso activated the zzso promoter, and zzso in the putative binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso factors reduced this zzso Interestingly, a zzso in the putative zzso B binding site completely zzso the zzso promoter activity, thus also rendering the promoter unresponsive to zzso zzso suggesting that this site is required for binding of zzso B zzso present in the nucleus of mature B zzso The expression of dominant negative zzso or zzso alpha zzso which prevent binding of zzso or zzso complexes to DNA, also reduced zzso zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulation led to zzso of zzso on its zzso domain, implicating zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
