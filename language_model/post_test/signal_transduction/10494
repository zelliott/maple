zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely recognized for its central role in cell proliferation and zzso Although previous work has shown that zzso is localized at zzso zzso no role for zzso in regulating zzso trafficking has been zzso Here, we report that zzso signaling regulates trafficking through the zzso zzso factor 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by a variety of methods leads to a dramatic expansion of the zzso zzso recycling zzso and zzso zzso of zzso such as class I major zzso complex, within the expanded zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduces surface expression of zzso without affecting its rate of zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, under conditions where zzso activity is zzso a large cohort of zzso zzso and the zzso scaffold zzso zzso of Ras 1 accumulates at the zzso recycling zzso The requirement for zzso was highly specific for this zzso pathway, because its zzso had no effect on trafficking of cargo of the classical zzso zzso These studies reveal a previously unappreciated link of zzso signaling to zzso dynamics and zzso zzso
