zzso zzso influx is recognized as a universal second zzso that zzso zzso zzso signals to zzso and nucleus, thereby stimulating zzso and cell zzso To examine the role of zzso factors that regulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso we measured the zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso free calcium zzso in zzso cells of zzso mice, using flow zzso with an indicator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Con A is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of 100 zzso zzso increased with Con A in a zzso manner up to a concentration of 50 zzso In the presence of 50 zzso Con A, zzso was 350 zzso Natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso influx in a zzso zzso zzso was the most effective zzso in desensitizing the zzso zzso and decreased zzso from 350 zzso in the absence of zzso to 250 zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso This effect was not zzso by structurally related zzso or zzso zzso suggesting a specific structural effect of the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso were zzso during incubation of cells in zzso In experiments using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found a differential effect of zzso on zzso influx in zzso and zzso zzso of T zzso For zzso cells, zzso decreased from 625 zzso to zzso zzso in the presence of 500 zzso zzso whereas zzso was not affected by zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that natural zzso have zzso effects on zzso zzso in zzso zzso
