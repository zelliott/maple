This manuscript describes how the zzso of pulmonary artery zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is elevated by zzso and the role played by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso was previously shown by our laboratory to alter the zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso This effect was independent of zzso zzso which was zzso rather than zzso zzso described here show that increased zzso zzso not only does not zzso zzso zzso but may actually augment the zzso zzso zzso causes gap formation between zzso and increases zzso zzso The zzso of zzso which zzso zzso zzso is also increased in zzso In addition, zzso zzso which alters focal zzso zzso is increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso significant zzso stress fiber formation, surprisingly renders zzso resistant to zzso or zzso zzso zzso against zzso reverses the increased zzso stress fiber formation in zzso cells, and zzso zzso stress fibers in zzso zzso renders them more susceptible to zzso Finally, zzso gap formation, as well as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are almost abolished by zzso zzso in zzso These effects of zzso zzso might represent decreased zzso plasticity and increased zzso which zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso activates two pathways one leading to zzso and increased zzso the other leading to zzso stress zzso stronger zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso which tips the balance towards decreased zzso might be targeted in managing zzso barrier zzso
