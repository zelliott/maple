Much attention has been paid to zzso oxide zzso research since its discovery as a zzso zzso in the cardiovascular zzso In recent years, newer roles have been attributed to this zzso and its close relatives, termed collectively zzso nitrogen species zzso These roles relate to different mechanisms of protein zzso among which zzso of zzso has emerged as a potential new paradigm in signal zzso and regulation of protein zzso We review here the chemical basis of this modification compared with other protein modifications related to zzso oxide, as well as the kind of specificity we can expect from zzso We also review the current zzso that can be applied to the study of zzso and identification of zzso proteins in cells, and detail the relevance of this modification in several proteins related to cardiovascular zzso
