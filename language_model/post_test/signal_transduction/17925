zzso centers zzso are an essential part of the zzso immune zzso They develop a clear structure during zzso zzso and zzso are separated into two zones, the dark and the light zzso The mechanisms leading to this specific zzso as well as the reason for zzso during a later phase of the zzso reaction have not clearly been revealed in zzso We discuss and weigh possible mechanisms of dark and light zone development in the framework of two mathematical zzso In a comparative approach we formulate constraints on typical zzso zzso in zzso which are characteristic for the different proposed zzso
