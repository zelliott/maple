We have characterized a zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso T cell zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso zzso was identical to that of zzso in the signal zzso the zzso domain, and the zzso tail, but it was missing a large segment of the zzso zzso domain, which is zzso by the second zzso This zzso zzso whose message level exceeded zzso of zzso was a zzso zzso zzso was found zzso associated with zzso and was zzso following the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso signal was enhanced in T cells expressing zzso These data demonstrate that zzso via zzso association with zzso plays a role as a zzso signal amplifier in human T zzso
