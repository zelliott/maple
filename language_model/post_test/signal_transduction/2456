zzso insulin zzso zzso interacts with its zzso zzso zzso and zzso via the zzso motif centered at zzso This interaction is important for zzso zzso Studies using the zzso zzso system and sequence identity analysis between zzso and zzso have identified two putative zzso the zzso and zzso zzso between zzso acids 108 and 516 of zzso that are sufficient for zzso zzso However, their precise function in zzso zzso zzso is not zzso We expressed the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso infection to investigate their role in insulin zzso In both cell types, zzso of either the zzso or the zzso protein caused a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso However, zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso was unaffected by the zzso zzso These findings were associated with a complete zzso of zzso cell cycle zzso In zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression extinguished zzso zzso with a corresponding zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a downstream target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of either zzso or zzso protein did not affect zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso even though both of these zzso are inhibited by zzso Thus, interference with the zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso In zzso zzso interference with the zzso interaction did not cause zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate a zzso or zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso some targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso are dependent on zzso zzso zzso and other targets zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso interaction is not essential for zzso effect on zzso zzso and zzso or zzso pathways exist in these zzso
