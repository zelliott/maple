The zzso zzso specifically expressed in fat cells, encodes zzso a hormone that zzso zzso and increases energy zzso In this study, we investigated the interactions between zzso and insulin on zzso gene expression in cultured zzso of rat zzso zzso Only low levels of zzso zzso were detected when zzso tissue from zzso rats was cultured for zzso h in minimal essential zzso However, the addition of zzso to the medium increased zzso gene expression in a zzso manner zzso 10 zzso With 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were similar to those in fresh fat pads from fed rats, reaching a maximum after 12 zzso The effect of zzso was blocked by zzso D, which indicates an action on zzso This effect was increased when a minimum amount of fuel zzso or a mixture of zzso and zzso was supplied in the zzso Unlike zzso insulin, even when combined with high zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso although it strongly increased the zzso of zzso species for fatty acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was observed at low zzso of insulin zzso 1 zzso and was delayed in zzso beginning after zzso h of zzso It was zzso by zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso by insulin was only zzso when fuels were present and/or when a critical level of zzso expression was zzso As this zzso effect was reversed by zzso this suggests that it required ongoing protein zzso In conclusion, unlike zzso insulin had no direct zzso effect on zzso gene zzso On the other hand, insulin (and zzso even inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The underlying mechanism involved ongoing synthesis of an zzso protein by insulin, which is in keeping with its delayed zzso Moreover, the expression of genes for zzso zzso and zzso may be zzso related to that of zzso
