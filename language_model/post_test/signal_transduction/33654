zzso is a key zzso growth factor zzso involved in innate and zzso immune zzso It contributes to the proliferation of zzso but not memory T zzso However, the full spectrum of zzso activity on T cells remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso primarily maintains the expression of specific zzso cell surface markers such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso on human zzso T zzso and that the expression of zzso zzso cell migration by means of zzso zzso These effects contrast with those of zzso which induced the marked proliferation of zzso T zzso leading to an zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso maintained cell cycle zzso and expression of proliferation zzso including zzso cell nuclear zzso and zzso and triggered zzso proliferation via zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso decreased the expression of the zzso zzso zzso which correlated with the absence of zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso whose function is the preservation of a pool of zzso T zzso in a zzso zzso with a low proliferation rate but with the persistence of cell cycling proteins and cell surface expression of zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso plays a part in innate and zzso immune response zzso to zzso of T cells and their zzso to secondary zzso zzso
