There is intense interest in the studies related to the potential of zzso foods to prevent age-related zzso and cognitive zzso Recent evidence has indicated that a group of zzso compounds known as zzso may exert particularly powerful actions on zzso zzso and may reverse age-related declines in memory and zzso In particular, evidence suggests that foods rich in three specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso and/or zzso possess the greatest potential to act on the cognitive zzso This review will highlight the evidence for the actions of such zzso found most commonly in zzso such as apples, berries and zzso on cognitive zzso and the underlying cellular zzso Although the precise mechanisms by which these zzso act within the brain remain zzso the present review focuses on their ability to protect vulnerable zzso and enhance the function of existing zzso structures, two processes known to be influenced by zzso and also known to zzso zzso zzso Most notably, we discuss their selective interactions with protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso which regulate zzso factors and gene expression involved in both synaptic plasticity and cerebrovascular blood zzso Overall, the review attempts to provide an initial insight into the potential impact of regular zzso fruit consumption on normal or abnormal zzso in cognitive zzso
