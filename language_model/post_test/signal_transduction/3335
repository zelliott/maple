In premature babies birth an high oxygen level exposure can occur and newborn zzso exposure can be associated with free radical oxygen release with impairment of zzso function, while in adult animal models short exposure to zzso seems to protect heart against zzso zzso Thus, the mechanisms and consequences which take place after zzso exposure are different and related to animals zzso The aim of our work has been to analyze the role played by zzso in the occurrence of the zzso modifications upon zzso exposure in zzso rat zzso zzso exposure zzso zzso compartment increase which seems to allow enhanced blood vessels zzso An increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression has been found upon zzso oxygen exposure to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increase in newborn rats exposed to zzso oxygen can suggest zzso involvement in zzso zzso Since zzso oxide zzso zzso are involved in heart vascular regulation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression has been zzso a lower zzso and an higher zzso expression has been found in newborn rats exposed to zzso oxygen related to the evidence that zzso provokes a systemic zzso and to the zzso zzso action, zzso The occurrence of zzso events, evaluated by zzso and zzso expression zzso seems more evident in sample exposed to severe zzso All in all such results suggest that in newborn rats zzso can trigger oxygen free radical zzso membrane injury through a zzso zzso zzso zzso system, even though specificity of such response could be obtained by in zzso administration to the rats of specific zzso of zzso This zzso zzso can switch molecular events leading to blood vessels development in parallel to zzso events due to an immature zzso defensive system in newborn rat zzso
