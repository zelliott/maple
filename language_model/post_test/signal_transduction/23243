zzso are zzso proteins that mediate zzso zzso in zzso By regulating contact formation and stability, zzso play a crucial role in tissue zzso and zzso Here, we review the three major functions of zzso in zzso contact formation and zzso Two of those functions lead to a decrease in zzso tension at the forming zzso zzso thereby promoting contact zzso by providing zzso tension that lowers zzso tension at the zzso zzso and second, by signaling to the zzso zzso in order to reduce zzso tension and thus zzso tension at the zzso The third function of zzso in zzso contact formation is to stabilize the contact by resisting mechanical forces that pull on the zzso
