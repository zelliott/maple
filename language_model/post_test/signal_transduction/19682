zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which, along with its receptors zzso zzso and zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso nervous zzso In zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in zzso learning, but it is not known if it plays a similar role in zzso To prepare the way for a detailed investigation into the possible role of zzso and its receptors in a suitable zzso model of learning and memory, here, we undertook a study of their expression and zzso role in the central nervous system of the pond snail zzso zzso zzso is one of the best established zzso model systems to study the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory, including the role of zzso zzso signaling mechanisms, which zzso depend on the zzso zzso of zzso However, there was no information available on the expression of zzso and its receptors in sensory structures and central zzso of the zzso nervous system known to be involved in zzso learning or whether or not zzso can actually activate zzso in these zzso Here, using zzso laser zzso zzso time of flight zzso and zzso we established the presence of zzso peptides in the cerebral zzso and the lip region of zzso The zzso data indicated an identity with zzso zzso and the presence of a zzso zzso highly zzso to zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso in zzso cerebral zzso zzso and that this effect was blocked by the appropriate general and selective zzso zzso zzso
