zzso of zzso interactions during early life zzso brain function in zzso In previous investigations we showed that early isolation severely affects zzso development in several structures of the zzso region, including the zzso zzso In the present study we investigated the effects of early isolation on signal processing along the zzso zzso system, a major memory circuit of the zzso zzso Male and female zzso were assigned at zzso days of age to either a social or an isolated zzso At zzso days of age the animals were zzso and field zzso were recorded from the zzso zzso circuit, driven by zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso function in the different structures showed that in isolated males there was a small reduction in the zzso function of the population zzso zzso potential and population spike evoked in layer II of the zzso zzso No changes occurred in isolated zzso In isolated males and females there was a reduction in the zzso function of the population zzso zzso potential and population spike evoked in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but this effect was larger in zzso In isolated zzso but not in zzso the population zzso zzso zzso potential ratio was reduced in all investigated structures, indicating that in males the size of the discharged zzso population was reduced more than due to the decreased zzso zzso show that isolation reduces the synaptic function in the whole zzso zzso zzso zzso While the zzso zzso was moderately impaired, the zzso system was more severely zzso The impairment in the signal transfer along the zzso zzso zzso system was heavier in zzso confirming the larger zzso of this sex to early zzso This work provides evidence that malfunctioning of a major zzso network may zzso the learning deficits induced by impoverished surroundings during early zzso
