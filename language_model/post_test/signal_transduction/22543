zzso zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso that is amplified by insulin in the presence of resistance to zzso action to stimulate zzso zzso in muscle and zzso To explore the mechanisms for this paradox, we examined the zzso and zzso actions of insulin and zzso growth factor I zzso in cultured skin zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant decreases in the number or affinity of zzso or zzso sites in zzso compared to control zzso zzso rates were similar, but there were significant decreases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 2 h at zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 2 h at 100,000 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso incorporation into zzso in zzso zzso a zzso action of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso action of insulin, was similar in zzso and control zzso in response to both insulin and zzso There were also no significant differences in zzso or zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso compared to control zzso zzso We conclude that 1) there is a selective zzso in insulin action in zzso zzso that affects zzso but not zzso signaling zzso 2) there is a similar zzso in zzso action, suggesting that insulin and zzso stimulate zzso synthesis by the same zzso zzso and 3) insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by insulin and zzso is similar to the control value, suggesting that the zzso signaling zzso is in another zzso or downstream of this signaling step in zzso zzso
