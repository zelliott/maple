Poly zzso zzso zzso operates in a DNA damage signaling zzso zzso zzso and three zzso structure activity relationship zzso studies were performed on human zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained for each zzso was used as such for zzso zzso zzso were divided into a training set and a test set randomly in four different ways, partial least square analysis was performed to obtain zzso models using the comparative molecular field analysis zzso and comparative molecular similarity zzso analysis zzso zzso models showed good statistical reliability that is evident from their zzso zzso and zzso zzso To obtain a consensus for zzso ability from all the models, average zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso models showed a value of zzso and zzso zzso Information obtained from the best zzso model was applied for zzso of lead zzso and design of novel potential zzso
