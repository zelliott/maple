The nuclear zzso zzso amplified in breast cancer 1 zzso has a zzso role in steroid and growth factor signaling in cancer and normal zzso zzso Less is known about its function in zzso cells, although zzso is zzso in tumor zzso and may, thus, contribute to tumor zzso zzso we show that zzso depletion from cultured zzso cells reduces their proliferation and zzso in response to growth factors and prevents the formation of intact zzso with tight junctions and of zzso zzso In zzso and zzso mice, the zzso responses to subcutaneous zzso implants was reduced by two-thirds, and zzso added zzso growth factor zzso 2 did not overcome this zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso mice showed similarly delayed healing of zzso zzso skin wounds, indicating that both zzso were required for proper tissue zzso Analysis of this defective wound healing showed reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from animals with different zzso zzso and subsequent wounding of the zzso revealed that the defective healing was attributable to local factors and not to defective bone zzso zzso Indeed, wounds in zzso mice showed reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso major local drivers of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso cell responses via zzso with the zzso signaling zzso
