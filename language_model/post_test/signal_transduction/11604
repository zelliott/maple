We report that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically influenced the zzso zzso In behavioral experiments the slowly zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso dramatically prolonged the time for zzso stop response and decreased the duration of zzso reversal in a zzso zzso When zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were used, no essential effects were detected on the zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the highly specific zzso activity inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso exerted an effect opposite to that of zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso The positive zzso effect of zzso zzso was significantly diminished in zzso that were treated simultaneously with zzso In an zzso of cell zzso zzso content, the exposure of zzso zzso to light evoked a transient decrease in the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso in internal zzso levels were more distinct when the intensity of applied zzso was zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso the zzso content of zzso was markedly zzso and the zzso changes in zzso level were less zzso In this paper the possible whole molecular mechanism by which the zzso orientation in zzso is controlled by light is zzso
