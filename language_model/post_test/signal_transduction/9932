zzso cells mediate both zzso allergic reactions and protective responses against acute infections, possibly through the zzso of zzso receptors zzso We find that zzso interacts zzso with zzso and zzso zzso to markedly enhance production of zzso in zzso mast cell zzso However, the zzso zzso neither zzso zzso and release of zzso acid nor influenced such responses to zzso probably because these zzso failed to generate a necessary calcium zzso The enhanced zzso production could be attributed to synergistic zzso of zzso protein zzso in addition to the engagement of a more effective repertoire of zzso factors for zzso gene zzso The synergistic interactions of zzso zzso and zzso might have relevance to the zzso of zzso allergic diseases by infectious zzso
