The signaling zzso of zzso zzso gene expression is still zzso although it has been reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in liver zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso gene expression and its zzso signaling mechanism have been examined in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene expression was zzso by human zzso zzso zzso in a zzso fashion in zzso zzso The specific zzso for zzso remarkably suppressed the zzso zzso gene zzso but zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso failed to block the zzso stimulation of the zzso gene zzso However, zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that does not inhibit zzso and zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso zzso gene zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso that contained the truncated zzso zzso up to zzso showed no zzso gene expression in response to human zzso The zzso form normally has the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso pathway, dependent on signaling from the zzso region of zzso might be involved in the zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
