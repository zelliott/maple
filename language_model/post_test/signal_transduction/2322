While it is known that the zzso activity of a variety of signal zzso molecules leads to cell zzso a key unresolved question is whether these zzso zzso to a common zzso that dictates zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso and zzso cells transformed by human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display common zzso in the components that relay zzso signals in normal zzso The zzso and zzso cells did not show zzso elevated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Instead, the Ras zzso exchange factor zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso as deduced from their zzso mobility shifts in zzso zzso Hence a zzso distinct from zzso and zzso previously known to feedback zzso zzso and zzso is responsible for the zzso of these molecules in the zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso and zzso cells exhibit loss of both the zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso show a zzso reduction in the zzso Moreover, all the transformed cell lines were found to display a zzso increase in zzso of zzso on zzso 63 and 73, which appears to be governed by an as yet unknown zzso
