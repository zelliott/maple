The role of zzso factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, in zzso and cancer has been well zzso Recently, we reported that zzso activates zzso zzso and zzso zzso in insulin zzso and ameliorates zzso However, the effects of zzso in other zzso are poorly zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on skeletal muscle, an important organ involved in zzso zzso We generated transgenic mice that selectively express zzso in skeletal zzso These mice exhibit a slight acceleration in growth prior to adulthood as well as a progressive increase in muscle zzso In zzso transgenic muscle, zzso stores were more than twofold than in zzso mice, and this was associated with an zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso 4, zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso exercise endurance capacity was enhanced in this transgenic zzso Furthermore, insulin sensitivity was enhanced in transgenic mice and exhibited better improvement after 4 zzso of exercise training, which was associated with increased zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso metabolism in skeletal muscle were different from that in the liver, although they did, in part, zzso The potential role of zzso in regulating zzso genes and zzso metabolism within skeletal muscle suggests that it may be used for treating zzso diseases as well as increasing endurance in zzso
