The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a solid zzso of cells, approximately 120 zzso zzso It arises from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and extends deeper into the zzso zzso parallel or perpendicular to the zzso There are up to 6 or 7 such zzso zzso distributed along the zzso in each human zzso zzso and zzso studies on the zzso zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated the presence of zzso stem cells in this zzso The purpose of this zzso study was to zzso the zzso profile of the zzso and compare with other zzso surface zzso regions to support our hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso 

zzso was found to be enriched for SC related Gene zzso zzso terms including those identified in zzso adult zzso however similar to zzso zzso had significant GO terms related to zzso zzso transient amplifying cells zzso and differentiated cells zzso zzso and zzso were metabolically dormant with low protein synthesis and zzso cell zzso zzso had zzso genes for cell cycling and self renewal such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were identified from other SC zzso zzso gene expression for growth factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation were noted in zzso zzso had highest number of expressed sequence tags zzso zzso and unknown zzso compared to other zzso Genes expressed in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to be involved in SC zzso Genes of interest, in zzso belonging to the category of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were validated with real-time zzso and zzso 

Our zzso profiling study identifies the zzso as a preferential site for zzso SC with some characteristics suggesting that it could function as a zzso zzso supporting zzso zzso It also strengthens the evidence for the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These cells are immediate progeny of SC with zzso capacity and could be responsible for maintaining zzso turn over in normal healthy conditions of the zzso surface zzso The zzso has mixed population of differentiated and zzso zzso
