: zzso evidence has shown that insulin producing zzso in pancreatic zzso have the limited potential to zzso zzso have been widely employed to deliver genes of interest into pancreatic zzso This study was aimed at investigating whether zzso infection has any impact on the potential of zzso zzso 

: Human zzso type 5 zzso zzso rat insulin promoter driven reporter genes were used to zzso freshly isolated pancreatic zzso Western zzso zzso were performed to evaluate the expression and zzso of key molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation following zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to identify zzso cells after zzso the infected and control zzso in the presence of zzso an analog of zzso that can be incorporated into the zzso of zzso zzso 

: zzso infection of the zzso resulted in expression and zzso of zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso a higher frequency of zzso cell proliferation was detected in zzso zzso than in control zzso 

: These data suggest zzso infection can activate zzso survival and proliferation machinery, in particular operating through the zzso signaling zzso This information has significant zzso for the use of zzso as a gene delivery vehicle for pancreatic zzso zzso
