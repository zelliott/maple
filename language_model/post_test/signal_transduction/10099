The induction of zzso growth arrest has emerged as a putative contributor to the zzso effects of zzso zzso Clinical trials are zzso to evaluate the efficacy of zzso for class I and II zzso zzso to treat zzso However, a potential zzso effect of inhibitor for zzso which is an zzso zzso and belongs to class III zzso zzso has not yet been zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso induced zzso growth arrest characterized by induction of zzso zzso activity and increased expression of zzso zzso inhibitor 1 in human breast cancer zzso cells and lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso growth arrest was accompanied by impaired zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso Active Ras was reduced in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of the receptors for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso for zzso may have zzso potential, and that impaired zzso of zzso zzso might take part in a zzso growth arrest program induced by zzso
