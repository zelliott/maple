zzso of cortical development are increasingly recognized as causes of mental zzso and zzso However, little is known about the molecular and zzso signals that control the zzso migration, and organization of the cells involved in normal cerebral cortical zzso Analysis of genes required for cortical development will help zzso the zzso of some zzso In humans, two striking examples of abnormal cortical development, with varying degrees of zzso and mental zzso are zzso zzso and zzso Double zzso zzso also known as zzso band zzso shows an abnormal band of zzso in the white matter underlying a relatively normal zzso In zzso DC often occurs in zzso whereas affected males show more severe zzso zzso zzso an zzso thick zzso with decreased or absent surface zzso We and others have identified a novel brain specific zzso zzso that is zzso in Double zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the cellular function of zzso zzso is unknown, sequence analysis reveals a zzso protein with potential zzso zzso zzso sites, as well as a site that is likely to be zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso functions as an zzso signaling zzso critical for the migration of developing zzso Interestingly, the zzso mouse zzso demonstrates abnormal zzso with some similarity to zzso and reflects a zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso disabled zzso zzso which binds zzso Although a direct interaction between zzso and zzso has not been demonstrated, it is plausible that these two proteins may be part of a common signaling zzso zzso abnormalities in signal zzso may be an underlying mechanism for the zzso migration defects in zzso and the zzso zzso but further research is necessary to determine how such abnormalities give rise to cortical zzso and zzso
