zzso of bone destruction is required as part of an effective therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso Although numerous zzso drugs are in clinical use, little is known about whether they inhibit bone destruction by acting on activated T cells or other cell types, such as zzso zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether zzso has a direct action on the zzso lineage and to gain insights into the molecular basis for the zzso effect of zzso 

The direct effect of zzso on zzso differentiation was investigated using an in zzso culture system of bone zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of the zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso The T zzso effect of zzso was examined in zzso zzso 

zzso blocked de zzso zzso synthesis and zzso calcium signaling in zzso precursor cells in zzso zzso the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso was strongly zzso The zzso of this zzso is central to the action of zzso since the zzso was overcome by zzso expression of zzso in the precursor zzso zzso suppressed zzso inflammatory bone destruction even in zzso zzso 

zzso has a direct zzso effect on zzso zzso differentiation by zzso the induction of zzso the master switch regulator for zzso zzso Our study suggests that the direct zzso action of zzso on zzso differentiation constitutes an important aspect in the zzso of bone destruction, and that the zzso zzso induction zzso is a promising target for zzso intervention in zzso bone zzso
