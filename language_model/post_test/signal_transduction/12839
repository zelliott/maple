In contrast to T cell zzso signal zzso cell surface membrane molecules involved in the regulation of responses by cells of the innate immune system employ structures that are zzso in the zzso rather than generated by zzso zzso and that recognize either classical zzso molecules or their structural relatives (such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso progress has recently been made in our understanding of molecular recognition by such molecules based on the determination of their three-dimensional structure, either in isolation or in complex with their zzso zzso Those best studied are the receptors that are expressed on natural killer zzso cells, but others are found on populations of T cells and other zzso zzso These molecules fall into two major structural classes, those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of the zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso Here we zzso in a functional context, the structures of the zzso and human molecules that have recently been determined, with emphasis on how they bind different regions of their zzso zzso and how this allows the discrimination of tumor or zzso cells from normal cells of the zzso
