The concept of zzso tooth movement is based on the hypothesis that teeth move as a result of the biological response of zzso zzso to the mechanical forces zzso There is a widely held hypothesis that mechanical stress generates an electrical signal which sets in motion the subsequent events, as in bone exposed to mechanical forces electrical currents are produced affect bone growth and zzso This implies a zzso mechanism which translates the electrical signal into a zzso message, recognizable by the cellular zzso This study is aimed at the identification of the message and the investigation of its zzso In fact, the effect of zzso zzso Fields zzso on the zzso second messenger, zzso zzso in Human zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The resting zzso zzso calcium concentration zzso of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso increased from 12 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 12 zzso then reached to a steady level through 24 zzso The zzso were also found to decrease the responses towards zzso growth factor zzso and serum, when the degree of response was based on the zzso zzso zzso These effects of zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of protein zzso zzso Some reports have suggested that zzso of the zzso ligament contain high alkaline zzso zzso activity as much as zzso Since similar results concerning the zzso were obtained in zzso zzso cells, this experiment also supports the hypothesis that zzso of zzso ligament have zzso zzso
