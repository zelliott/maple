A strategy has been developed for zzso proteins that are zzso regulated by zzso A key zzso zzso in zzso an zzso zzso zzso was replaced with a zzso zzso The latter conversion ensures that the protein is no longer regulated by zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso was subsequently zzso modified with a zzso charged zzso zzso which zzso mimics the natural zzso zzso present in the inactive zzso zzso zzso of the cage generates an active zzso which cannot be switched off by zzso protein zzso Caged zzso and its zzso counterpart, display the anticipated zzso zzso and severing zzso
