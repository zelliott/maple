zzso zzso which is the product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has an established role as a zzso of zzso drug resistance in acute zzso leukemia zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso zzso resistance in zzso cells deprived of serum and growth factors, zzso was zzso by flow zzso using zzso of the dye zzso D zzso alongside low forward zzso In zzso primary zzso samples, there was a significant increase in zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Likewise, zzso in growth zzso zzso cells cultured for 30 hours increased zzso in the presence of 25 zzso zzso The zzso reversal agent zzso (1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso by a median of zzso in zzso patient samples and to a comparable degree in 6 zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs in zzso blasts in response to zzso drugs, cells were incubated with zzso at the zzso zzso (the concentration of zzso that caused zzso cell death in zzso of zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso which inhibited zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to augment zzso induced by growth factor withdrawal in zzso zzso cells and was significantly more effective at zzso zzso in zzso patient blasts zzso increase in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso samples zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso was associated with zzso and also occurred in zzso patient cells treated with zzso However, this effect was not seen following treatment with the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is able to exert a protective effect on zzso cell viability and that this is associated with a reduced effect of zzso zzso on zzso The zzso reversal agent zzso acts, at least in part, by a zzso independent mechanism to alter zzso distribution and to augment zzso induced in zzso cells by serum and growth factor zzso zzso zzso
