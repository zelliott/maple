We have investigated the possibility that zzso zzso zzso activity and membrane protein levels of the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso in cultured zzso rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso are modulated by zzso C zzso second zzso zzso of cells zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso showed that zzso regulated zzso alpha levels in a zzso zzso manner; a zzso increase followed a zzso initial reduction, while zzso lowered zzso alpha levels by more than 50% at all zzso zzso alpha levels remained unchanged by both zzso zzso but not zzso increased zzso zzso activity without increasing zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso responsiveness to zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated to membrane zzso protein zzso zzso These results demonstrate the involvement of zzso translation regulation as one mechanism of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
