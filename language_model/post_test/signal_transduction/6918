The functions of zzso vessels are to drain the protein-rich zzso from the zzso space, to maintain normal tissue pressure, and to mediate the immune response, particularly in inflammatory zzso 

To evaluate the function of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in chronic skin zzso 

We used zzso zzso or zzso zzso production and investigated the effects of zzso signaling on the resolution of inflammation using the experimental chronic contact hypersensitivity zzso reaction mouse zzso 

zzso gene transfer promoted significant reduction of ear swelling and ear weight in zzso zzso skin zzso zzso there was no significant difference in the number of zzso vessels, the number of zzso zzso inflammatory cells was significantly reduced in the zzso group, which suggested that zzso zzso the drainage of zzso fluid and inflammatory cells via zzso zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso expression resulted in a significant delay in the recovery from zzso zzso skin zzso zzso vessel size was enlarged and a significant increase of zzso zzso inflammatory cells was observed in mice with zzso gene transfer compared to control zzso These results suggested that blockade of zzso inhibited the drainage function of the zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso signaling plays an important role in the resolution of skin zzso the regulation of zzso function may have a great therapeutic potential in inflammatory skin zzso
