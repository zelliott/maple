Bone zzso stem cells develop into zzso and zzso zzso but have not been known to participate in zzso cell zzso zzso factor 1 zzso also designated adrenal 4 binding protein zzso is an essential orphan nuclear zzso for zzso as well as for adrenal and zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we revealed that the zzso forced expression of zzso can transform cultured primary long-term cultured bone zzso cells into zzso cells, showing the de zzso synthesis of multiple steroid hormones in response to zzso hormone zzso This finding may provide an initial step in innovative zzso cell transfer therapy for steroid hormone zzso
