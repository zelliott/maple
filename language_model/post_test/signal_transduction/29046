To examine whether the proportions of blood zzso zzso are altered in zzso and to assess the disturbances in zzso pathways in the zzso of COPD patients, with respect to smoking zzso 

The study was performed at the Faculty of Pharmacy and zzso and University Hospital for Lung zzso Zagreb, zzso zzso counts were determined in 28 COPD male patients (11 smokers, 9 zzso 8 zzso and 42 healthy male subjects (15 smokers, 13 zzso 14 zzso We assessed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso by western zzso 

zzso and zzso percentages were significantly increased, and zzso percentage significantly decreased in COPD patients compared with healthy subjects zzso However, no significant smoking effect regarding zzso zzso was observed when compared current or former smokers with zzso of each studied zzso zzso was activated in zzso only, especially in healthy zzso In contrast, strong induction of zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso levels and increased zzso levels were detected in COPD smokers and COPD zzso but also in healthy individuals who smoke compared with healthy zzso zzso 

These results show that COPD and smoking affect zzso zzso zzso zzso of the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms in COPD is essential for identification of molecules that may serve as targets for diagnosis and therapeutic zzso
