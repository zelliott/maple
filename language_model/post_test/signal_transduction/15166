zzso evidence indicates a role of zzso in immune response, but it remains largely unclear whether zzso signaling is involved in regulating zzso cell development in the bone zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized zzso cell differentiation and maturation in the zzso of zzso deficient zzso mice at a zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso was similar to the control value, the total number of zzso cells was severely reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells revealed significantly decreased zzso of developing zzso cells at various stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells displayed markedly increased zzso but maintained normal cell cycling status and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso could significantly enhance the survival of zzso cells from zzso mice in zzso Further examination on zzso cell functional activity showed that zzso zzso cells exhibited normal intrinsic zzso with significantly increased zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso signaling regulates zzso cell development via enhancing the survival of immature zzso cells in mouse zzso
