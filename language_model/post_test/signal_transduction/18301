zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors are coupled mainly to zzso zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to determine whether different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso when zzso in the same cell, share a common zzso or zzso different pools, of G zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso binding by selective zzso and zzso zzso was tested in zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as in zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso and zzso receptors led to stimulation of zzso binding by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The combined effect of the two zzso was similar to the effect of either zzso or zzso alone, suggesting the zzso of a common zzso zzso by the two zzso zzso zzso The same phenomenon was observed when zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso receptors and either zzso or zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, in zzso zzso cells, which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso cells, which zzso zzso and zzso zzso the combined effects of the various zzso (the selective zzso zzso and the selective zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso the zzso of different pools of G proteins by each zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a fundamental difference between native and artificially zzso cells regarding the zzso of receptors and zzso zzso
