We previously showed that zzso in zzso invasion and in zzso migration of a T cell zzso was blocked in cells zzso a truncated zzso zzso protein zzso The truncated zzso also blocked zzso zzso through zzso filters induced by 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced by 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggested that zzso engagement triggers a signal that zzso a weak zzso signal and that zzso zzso blocks this zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of part of the zzso molecules with zzso causes zzso of free zzso molecules (not occupied by the zzso on the same cell, which then bind to zzso on other zzso This causes cell zzso that was also blocked by zzso zzso Thus, an zzso signal involving zzso activates other zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso signal can be amplified by multiple cycles of zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso signal were both blocked by a zzso C inhibitor and a zzso zzso suggesting that one of the amplified signals is the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Finally, we show that both zzso 2 zzso are required for zzso of invasion, zzso and zzso by the truncated zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso zzso this is not an zzso in the zzso complex because this is not expressed by this T cell zzso
