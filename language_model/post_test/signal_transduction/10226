Several molecules and cellular pathways have been implicated in zzso zzso but their precise molecular mechanisms have not been clearly zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso implicated in the development and disease of the zzso nervous zzso The precise role of this zzso in sensory pathways has not been well zzso Here we report a molecular role for zzso in zzso We identified the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso zzso which is modulated during a peripheral inflammatory zzso Increased zzso activity in sensory zzso after inflammation resulted in the zzso of zzso to zzso which forms a more stable complex with zzso and, consequently, leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso knockout mice zzso which exhibit significantly decreased zzso activity, showed delayed responses to painful zzso stimulation compared with zzso zzso In contrast, mice zzso zzso which exhibit elevated levels of zzso activity, were more sensitive to painful zzso stimuli than were zzso In conclusion, our data demonstrate a role for zzso activity in primary zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be a target for the development of zzso zzso
