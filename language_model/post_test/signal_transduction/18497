zzso of gene expression by zzso of zzso islands in regulatory elements is frequently observed in zzso However, an influence of the most common zzso zzso pathways onto DNA zzso has not yet been investigated zzso To address this issue, we identified genes suppressed in zzso rat zzso but zzso after treatment with the zzso agent zzso and with the zzso inhibitor zzso Analysis of gene expression by zzso and Northern zzso analysis revealed the zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso and zzso to be zzso in the zzso zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of putative regulatory elements in zzso cells as compared to immortalized zzso was detected within a zzso island zzso zzso upstream of zzso within the zzso promoter and within a zzso island of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso promoter was observed 10 days after induction of zzso in immortalized rat zzso and a clear correlation between reduced zzso expression and zzso could also be observed in distinct rat zzso These results suggest that zzso of individual genes by DNA zzso is controlled by zzso zzso zzso yet the mechanisms responsible for initial target gene suppression are zzso
