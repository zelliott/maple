zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes are involved in critical aspects of cellular growth and zzso zzso Each complex contains one of two highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso yet little is known about their specialized zzso We show that zzso zzso associate with different promoters during cellular proliferation and zzso and in response to specific signaling pathways by preferential interaction with certain classes of zzso zzso zzso binds to zinc finger proteins through a unique zzso domain that is not present in zzso zzso interacts with two zzso repeat proteins that are critical components of zzso signal zzso Thus, zzso and zzso complexes may direct distinct cellular processes by recruitment to specific promoters through zzso interactions that are unique to each zzso
