Blood vessels and zzso share guidance cues and zzso receptors to control their zzso during zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso 1) is present on both blood vessels and nerves and binds two structurally diverse zzso the class 3 zzso zzso and an zzso of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso termed zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding to zzso to zzso the migration of zzso cells and zzso zzso It was therefore hypothesized that zzso zzso controls zzso zzso by zzso competing zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso but not zzso is required for zzso patterning of motor and sensory nerves, and, vice versa, zzso rather than zzso is required for blood vessel zzso zzso competition for zzso therefore does not explain zzso zzso Instead, these zzso control different aspects of zzso patterning that have an impact on cardiovascular zzso Thus zzso zzso guides the zzso zzso crest zzso precursors of sympathetic zzso as well as their zzso zzso In addition, zzso and a second class 3 zzso termed zzso contribute to the zzso of the embryonic zzso arch arteries and primitive heart zzso tract by acting on zzso and zzso zzso zzso loss of either of these zzso zzso zzso blood flow into and out of the zzso Multiple zzso zzso therefore zzso to orchestrate cardiovascular zzso
