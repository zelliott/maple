The zzso adapter protein zzso links zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso to downstream signaling zzso among which zzso zzso zzso zzso Ras signaling and the human zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso changes, have been zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso with a number of zzso proteins including the zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1992 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso that directly interacts with zzso and to distinguish it from indirectly associated zzso zzso zzso protein complexes in the cell zzso were zzso by heat and zzso prior to the test for binding to zzso We found that zzso does not directly bind to zzso zzso instead it binds via its zzso domain to a 62 zzso zzso zzso We present evidence demonstrating that the zzso zzso is related to the previously identified zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso with each other in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and GAP compete for binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not bind zzso zzso zzso zzso maps of the zzso and the zzso zzso proteins are zzso However, zzso and GAP do not zzso with each other and apparently bind to different pools of zzso This study suggests that the zzso zzso acts as an zzso domain zzso protein and mediates the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso
