zzso natural killer T zzso cells have the ability to rapidly secret zzso in response to diverse zzso and therefore influence numerous immune zzso Although zzso and zzso are thought to dominate zzso zzso production, a distinct subset of zzso cells, expressing zzso and producing zzso has now been identified in both mice and zzso Although a role in pathogen and allergic responses has been assigned to the zzso zzso zzso factors controlling their development and function remain zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso differentiation obeys transforming growth zzso zzso signaling control, different from that described for conventional zzso zzso We reveal that zzso zzso and particularly its zzso pathway, is required for both the survival of zzso zzso cells during their development and zzso production at the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells drives higher peripheral numbers and increased tissue zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso signaling is mandatory for the peripheral expansion of the zzso zzso cells responding to inflammatory zzso Thus, this work demonstrates that both the development and responsiveness of the newly described zzso zzso cell subset is under the control of a dedicated zzso signaling zzso
