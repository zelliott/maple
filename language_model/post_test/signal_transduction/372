zzso cell populations such as zzso stem cells and memory B and T zzso might be regulated by shared signaling zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso stem cell zzso and zzso by limiting stem cell proliferation and zzso but its role in the generation and maintenance of memory T cells is zzso We found that induction of zzso signaling by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or the zzso protein family member zzso arrested zzso T cell development into zzso zzso By blocking T cell zzso zzso signaling promoted the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso memory stem cells with zzso and zzso capacities exceeding those of central and zzso memory T cell zzso These findings reveal a key role for zzso signaling in the maintenance of zzso in mature memory zzso T cells and have major implications for the design of new vaccination strategies and adoptive zzso
