zzso the product of the zzso reaction between zzso oxide and zzso zzso is a potent zzso involved in tissue damage in neurodegenerative zzso We investigated the modifications induced by zzso in zzso zzso of proteins from zzso zzso treatment zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the major zzso proteins and zzso zzso as one of the major zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso revealed zzso zzso in the synaptic zzso whereas zzso zzso was enriched in the zzso density zzso zzso zzso was increased by treatment with zzso zzso zzso and decreased by higher zzso suggesting a possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso proved that zzso treatment of zzso modulated the zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a moderate enhancing effect on some zzso proteins but significantly protected the activity of zzso against zzso zzso so that at 1 zzso zzso the zzso was still more active than in zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso but significantly protected by zzso Thus, the increase of zzso cannot be attributed to zzso zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso may regulate the zzso modification of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Identification of the major protein targets gives insight into the pathways possibly involved in zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso
