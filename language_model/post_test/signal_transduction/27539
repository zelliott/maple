zzso is one of the immediate early zzso factors that are induced after brain zzso However, the mechanism and the role of zzso induction are not yet zzso In the present study, using mouse cortical cultures, we examined the zzso mechanism of zzso induction and its role in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso or zzso induced comparable zzso death in cortical culture, only zinc increased zzso zzso which was attenuated by blocking zinc zzso It is intriguing that brief exposure to zinc induced sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso 1/2 upstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso blocked zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso death by zzso The present study has demonstrated that zzso rather than zzso zzso lasting zzso expression in cortical culture by zzso zzso 1/2, which is part of a cascade that may play an active role in zinc zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zinc may be the key mechanism of zzso induction and zzso death in brain zzso
