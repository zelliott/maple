zzso flux experiments in isolated guard cells of zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso content is regulated and is reset to a reduced fixed point by zzso acid zzso with no significant change in zzso zzso The effects of changes in external zzso pressure were investigated by adding and removing zzso from the bathing zzso Two effects were zzso In the new steady state of volume and zzso the zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso increased at high zzso and reduced at lower zzso after the addition of zzso These changes were inhibited by zzso oxide and are likely to involve the same channel that is involved in the response to zzso After a zzso transfer, there was an additional effect: a fast transient stimulation of zzso zzso during the period of water flow into the zzso the size of this zzso increased with the size of the zzso zzso with increased water zzso No corresponding transient in reduced zzso zzso was observed upon zzso zzso The fast zzso was not inhibited by zzso oxide and appears to involve a different zzso channel from that involved in the resting zzso the response to zzso or the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso can sense an zzso zzso and respond to water flow into the zzso by increased zzso zzso zzso thereby minimizing zzso zzso An zzso is the most likely sensor and may also be involved in the signal zzso zzso
