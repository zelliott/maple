zzso zzso proteins zzso and bind to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso allows zzso formation and binding to zzso tandem zzso but the functions of zzso versus zzso are zzso We generated zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso mice in which zzso proteins form zzso but not zzso identified zzso genes whose expression required zzso zzso and defined zzso versus zzso consensus zzso Whereas zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso thus, zzso zzso were sufficient for zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso mice had fewer zzso T cells, zzso cells, and zzso T cells, with impaired zzso and zzso proliferation of zzso T zzso Moreover, zzso zzso T cell proliferation after viral infection was diminished and zzso zzso cells did not efficiently control zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is critical for zzso responses and normal immune function, establishing a critical role for zzso zzso in zzso
