It has been estimated that in most zzso countries 1 person out of every 1000 in the population is undergoing zzso treatment to stabilize their episodic mood disturbances due to zzso zzso zzso may stabilize mood swings by altering the action of certain zzso at the synaptic level in the zzso Recent research suggests that zzso alters zzso by affecting zzso second zzso zzso A major second zzso system is the zzso zzso which generates zzso zzso from zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are regulated by zzso and zzso zzso which either stimulate or inhibit the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso signals are transferred to the zzso unit of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The activated zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso G zzso leading to a zzso of the protein into the active zzso and the beta gamma zzso The former stimulates the zzso unit of zzso zzso The stimulation is terminated by a zzso located on the alpha zzso that converts zzso to inactive zzso At present, G proteins are known to play a central role in zzso receptors to zzso zzso In addition to zzso regulation due to zzso some zzso zzso zzso I, zzso are regulated by zzso as a consequence of enhanced zzso zzso of free zzso The zzso stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso is assumed to occur by a direct effect on the zzso zzso The zzso units sensitive to zzso are also subjected to regulation by zzso and zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso activity, since zzso is the zzso zzso Furthermore, one zzso site located on the G protein regulates both the zzso zzso affinity and the zzso of the G protein during the zzso zzso A second zzso site on the zzso unit is responsible for zzso regulation of the zzso zzso The present work aimed at investigating the mechanisms by which zzso in zzso and after chronic treatment zzso zzso affects zzso zzso activities in various regions of the rat zzso zzso in zzso and ex zzso inhibited the selective stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso in the cerebral zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso directly with the zzso unit of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
