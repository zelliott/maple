Heat shock proteins zzso are zzso that are known to have important roles in zzso protein zzso protein assembly and cellular zzso While zzso are known to be induced by damaging exercise, little is known about how zzso actually mediate skeletal muscle zzso to zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a heat shock zzso and the ensuing increase in zzso expression on early zzso and signaling (2 and zzso events of the zzso zzso muscle following a bout of downhill zzso Male zzso rats zzso old) were randomly assigned to control, eccentric exercise zzso downhill zzso or heat shock + eccentric exercise zzso zzso for 20 zzso 48 h prior to zzso zzso zzso of muscle damage, muscle zzso and zzso signaling were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins was also zzso As expected, following exercise the zzso group had increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso compared to zzso The zzso group had an increase in zzso but there was no change in zzso zzso total protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso group had increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso however no changes in zzso were zzso In contrast, the HS group had reduced zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso compared to zzso Moreover, the HS group had increased zzso content (2 and zzso total protein concentration zzso zzso zzso content (2 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lastly, the HS group had reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that heat shock zzso and/or the ensuing zzso response may protect against muscle damage, and enhance increases in total protein and zzso zzso content following zzso These changes appear to be independent of zzso and zzso signaling zzso
