The zzso zzso zzso is the biggest zzso in most cell types, but its characterization as an zzso with a continuous membrane belies the fact that the zzso is actually an assembly of zzso distinct membrane zzso that execute diverse zzso Almost 20 years ago, an essay by zzso and zzso first listed what was known at the time about domain formation within the zzso In the time that has passed since, additional zzso zzso have been discovered and zzso These include the zzso membrane zzso the zzso quality control compartment zzso where zzso degradation zzso occurs, and the plasma zzso membrane zzso Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the zzso Research has also shown that the zzso of zzso and zzso droplets occurs on specialized zzso of the zzso Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these zzso and how they are targeted zzso Moreover, a first set of zzso zzso sorting zzso including zzso zzso cluster sorting protein 2 zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto zzso retention mechanisms and rely on zzso and zzso zzso The crucial roles of zzso domain formation for cell physiology are highlighted with the specific targeting of the tumor zzso regulator zzso to zzso zzso or of the zzso leukemia protein to the zzso
