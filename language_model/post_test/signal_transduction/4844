zzso protein zzso zzso constitute a unique family of zzso involved in many zzso responses in zzso zzso and kinetic properties of a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were examined in this zzso The optimum pH and temperature for activity were pH zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was zzso zzso zzso Yet zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the activity with zzso values of 750 zzso and 350 zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso for half zzso activity zzso was found to be zzso zzso for zzso with zzso zzso as zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a functional zzso zzso regulated by zzso and may have a role in zzso signaling in zzso zzso
