There is an urgent need to identify and develop a new generation of therapeutic agents and systemic therapies targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in breast zzso In this regard, new information on the mechanisms of zzso function and/or cross talk with other zzso zzso should provide the basis for the development of other ideal zzso therapies with the intent to enhance clinical zzso reduce side effects or zzso Our very recent assessment of the mechanisms by which zzso increased zzso and its zzso alters the zzso signaling discovered that fatty acid zzso zzso the zzso catalyzing the terminal steps in the de zzso zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso the state of sensitivity of breast and zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell growth and zzso 1) pharmacological zzso of zzso activity induced a dramatic zzso of zzso zzso gene transcription, whereas interference zzso zzso of zzso gene expression drastically lowered zzso requirements for optimal zzso of zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso conversely, pharmacological and zzso zzso of zzso worked as an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso 2) pharmacological and zzso zzso of zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso of zzso protein and zzso expression in breast cancer cells, whereas specific zzso blockade resulted in a marked zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso and 3) zzso zzso decreased cell proliferation and cell viability by promoting zzso in zzso breast and zzso cancer zzso In this review we propose that, through a complex mechanism involving the regulation of zzso cross talk as well as critical zzso proteins including the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a previously zzso connection exists between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso activities in breast and zzso cancer zzso From a clinical perspective, we suggest that if chemically stable zzso zzso or zzso systems able to deliver zzso targeting zzso gene demonstrate systemic zzso effects of zzso zzso in zzso additional zzso studies to characterize their zzso cancer actions should be of great interest as the specific blockade of zzso activity may also provide a protective means against zzso zzso associated with zzso breast cancer zzso
