zzso disease is a benign zzso of the hands and fingers that leads to zzso zzso We hypothesized that multiple genetic and environmental factors influence zzso to this disease and sought to identify zzso genes to better understand its zzso 

We conducted a zzso association study of 960 Dutch persons with zzso disease and zzso controls (the discovery zzso to test for association between the disease and genetic zzso We tested the 35 zzso zzso zzso most strongly associated with zzso disease zzso in the discovery set in three zzso independent case series zzso a total of zzso affected persons and zzso controls from Germany, the United zzso and The zzso 

Initially, we observed a significant zzso association between zzso disease and 8 zzso at three zzso Tests of replication and joint analysis of all data from zzso patients with zzso disease and zzso controls yielded an association with 11 zzso from nine different zzso zzso Six of these zzso contain genes known to be involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso and zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso 

This study implicates nine different zzso involved in genetic zzso to zzso zzso The fact that six of these nine zzso harbor genes zzso proteins in the zzso zzso suggests that aberrations in this zzso are key to the process of zzso in zzso zzso
