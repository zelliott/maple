The interaction between zzso and its zzso on zzso cells plays a critical role in the clearance of zzso bodies under normal zzso zzso A specific zzso for zzso zzso has recently been identified by zzso display and shown to mediate zzso dependent zzso Here we show that the protein zzso by the zzso zzso is localized in the zzso through multiple nuclear zzso zzso First, a fusion between zzso and zzso is localized in the zzso of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso have intrinsic nuclear zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso identified a 47 zzso protein species in cells zzso with zzso zzso and localized this protein in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, which express zzso zzso zzso a similar 47 zzso species was detected and localized in the zzso Finally, multiple nuclear zzso signals were identified in zzso zzso each capable of targeting zzso to the zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso may serve a dual role both on the cell surface and in the zzso
