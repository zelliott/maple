Signal zzso in B cells is zzso by B cell zzso zzso complexes that are composed of membrane zzso zzso and additional proteins zzso zzso and zzso that have been implicated with several aspects of B cell zzso In this paper, experiments are described that have been designed to characterize new components of the zzso and to zzso their involvement in B cell zzso directly after the binding of zzso The data obtained prove the assumption that zzso is zzso after zzso Neither zzso nor the zzso zzso are zzso after they have disappeared from the cell zzso The newly detected zzso associated proteins are neither degradation products of zzso nor different forms of zzso or zzso In addition, they are not recognized by zzso against any of the zzso known to zzso The zzso molecules are linked to the zzso and zzso On the other hand, the additional zzso associated proteins as well as the zzso zzso could not be detected in the zzso zzso The former molecules remain on the B cell surface where they are attached to the unaffected zzso and might interact with downstream members of the zzso zzso In addition, evidence is presented that the zzso of the zzso complex is not necessary for signal zzso and B cell zzso From these results the authors conclude that the zzso complexes are removed from the cell surface after binding of zzso probably to prevent further zzso of this cell, while the zzso associated proteins interact with the zzso components of the signal zzso zzso to promote the further zzso of the B zzso
