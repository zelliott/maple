Cell death and cell survival are central components of normal development and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates both cell growth and cell zzso To better understand the molecular mechanisms that control cell death or survival, we investigated the role of zzso in the zzso process by zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso following serum zzso as determined by DNA zzso zzso However, zzso is prevented in zzso zzso by the presence of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that this protective effect by zzso is completely zzso To determine the downstream signaling zzso we examined zzso effects on the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner up to 4 h after zzso Furthermore, zzso does not rescue serum zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or in wild type zzso zzso cells in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso in cultured zzso and may serve as a cell survival factor via zzso signaling and downstream zzso zzso signaling zzso
