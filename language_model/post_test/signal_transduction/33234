We tested whether zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in airway smooth muscle zzso First, we zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso with an zzso zzso and a zzso or a zzso active form of the gene zzso zzso and assessed zzso zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso whereas expression of the zzso active zzso induced zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is required and sufficient for zzso zzso in these zzso Next, we assessed the effect of zzso a synthetic zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso confirming that zzso is required for zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso or zzso activity, evidence that zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso in this zzso Finally, zzso reduced zzso zzso incorporation in a zzso manner, suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is required for DNA zzso We conclude that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso are required for zzso DNA synthesis in these zzso
