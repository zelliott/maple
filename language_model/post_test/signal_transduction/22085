zzso regulation of the balance between cell renewal and cell differentiation is of vital importance for embryonic development and adult zzso zzso growth factor signaling relayed from the zzso to the zzso is necessary for zzso maintenance during zzso of most zzso zzso but it is still ambiguous whether the signal is exclusively zzso Furthermore, the downstream mechanisms are largely zzso In order to zzso these questions we performed a complementary analysis of zzso growth factor 10 zzso zzso and zzso in the embryonic mouse zzso where the zzso niche is clearly defined and differentiation proceeds in a zzso organized zzso In agreement with a role in zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso during early development while the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso leads to spatial expansion of the zzso niche and repression of cell zzso while zzso results in premature cell differentiation and subsequent zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso signaling maintains the zzso niche in the embryonic zzso primarily by zzso cell zzso rather than through zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso targets include zzso zzso factors, which have previously been shown to regulate zzso maturation and tumor zzso
