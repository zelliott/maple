zzso zzso activates zzso in zzso zzso but its functional role is not zzso In this report, we first assessed zzso zzso alpha zzso expression during zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso growth arrested zzso zzso of differentiation led to a transient zzso increase in zzso but then levels decreased to zzso amounts zzso days after induction of zzso Depending on the cell type, zzso either increases or decreases cell zzso In growth arrested zzso zzso zzso zzso alone had no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso inhibited zzso growth factor zzso induced zzso zzso zzso but not zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso zzso but the bands showed distinct zzso migration zzso zzso alone and zzso added to the differentiation cocktail had no effect on zzso formation or zzso zzso zzso these studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possibly through zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso expression suggests that the effects of zzso are targeted primarily towards zzso
