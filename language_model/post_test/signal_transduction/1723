zzso receptors zzso which recognize zzso molecular patterns, and members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, share zzso in their zzso zzso called zzso R gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms zzso by zzso are similar, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 9, 10) having critical zzso Signal zzso between zzso and zzso is known to involve the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso functions of the zzso molecules remain zzso and zzso studies have shown that zzso is only partially required for zzso and zzso zzso Here we show by zzso that zzso an zzso zzso closely related to the zzso zzso zzso is indispensable for the responses of animals and cultured cells to zzso and zzso that stimulate various zzso zzso animals are completely resistant to a lethal dose of zzso zzso In addition, animals lacking zzso are severely impaired in their responses to viral and bacterial zzso Our results indicate that zzso has an essential role in innate zzso
