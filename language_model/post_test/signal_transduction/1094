A growing body of evidence concerning zzso effects cannot be explained by the classic model of hormone action, which involves the binding to zzso receptors zzso alpha and zzso and the interaction of the zzso complex with specific DNA sequences associated with target zzso Using zzso zzso expression as an early molecular sensor of zzso action in zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells, we have discovered that zzso zzso and the two major zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso expression through zzso as well as through an zzso manner via the G zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response is zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso with an zzso zzso against zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 231 and zzso breast cancer cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso occurs via a zzso zzso zzso zzso that requires both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to regulate the expression of zzso genes such as zzso even in the absence of zzso has interesting implications for understanding breast cancer zzso
