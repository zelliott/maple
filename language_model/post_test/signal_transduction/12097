zzso of T cells engineered with zzso zzso receptors zzso has been a major barrier to use of these cells for zzso targeted adoptive zzso To address this issue, we created a series of zzso that contain the T cell zzso zzso signal zzso domain with the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso After short-term expansion, primary human T cells were subjected to zzso gene transfer, resulting in large numbers of cells with zzso zzso zzso In an zzso mouse zzso model of primary human zzso acute zzso zzso human T cells expressing zzso zzso containing zzso exhibited the greatest zzso efficacy and prolonged zzso zzso survival in zzso and were significantly more effective than cells expressing zzso containing zzso alone or zzso signaling zzso We uncovered a previously zzso zzso effect of zzso expressing the zzso zzso domain that likely contributes to the enhanced zzso efficacy and survival in tumor bearing zzso Furthermore, our studies revealed significant discrepancies between in zzso and in zzso surrogate measures of zzso zzso Together these results suggest that incorporation of the zzso signaling domain in zzso should improve the persistence of zzso in the zzso zzso and hence maximize their zzso zzso
