zzso cancer has a poor prognosis and few effective therapies are zzso The zzso effect of zzso has been observed in cancer cells with an activated Ras signaling pathway, and pancreatic cancer may be a candidate target for zzso because zzso zzso is frequently found in pancreatic zzso 

In this study, we examined the feasibility of using zzso zzso 3) as an zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso was able to zzso five human pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso We also confirmed that the Ras activity in these cancer cell lines was elevated compared with that in the normal cell line and that zzso to zzso was associated with the Ras activity of these zzso In a unilateral zzso zzso model using zzso and zzso cell lines, each tumor growth was suppressed by zzso injection of zzso Furthermore, local injection of zzso also had systemic zzso effects in a bilateral zzso model using zzso cell zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso replication was observed within the tumor but not in surrounding normal zzso 

These results suggest that zzso can be considered for a novel therapy against pancreatic zzso
