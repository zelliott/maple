zzso capacity is a strong predictor of cardiovascular zzso To determine the relationship between zzso zzso capacity and cardiac gene expression we examined zzso gene expression in hearts of rats artificially selected for high and low running capacity zzso and zzso zzso over 16 zzso The artificial selection of zzso caused zzso of risk factors of cardiovascular disease similar to the zzso syndrome seen in human, whereas zzso had markedly better cardiac zzso We also studied zzso in gene expression in response to exercise training in these zzso Left zzso gene expression of both sedentary and zzso zzso and zzso was characterized by zzso and gene zzso zzso Out of 28,000 screened zzso zzso were zzso expressed between sedentary zzso and zzso Only one gene was found zzso expressed by exercise training, but this gene had unknown name and zzso zzso zzso expressed higher amounts of genes involved in zzso zzso whereas sedentary zzso expressed higher amounts of the genes involved in zzso zzso This suggests a switch in cardiac energy zzso zzso from normal zzso fatty acid zzso in zzso to zzso metabolism in zzso an event that often occurs in diseased zzso zzso were also associated with pathological growth signaling and cellular zzso zzso conditions seemed to be a common source for several of these zzso triggering zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso high zzso low zzso capacity was associated with differences in cardiac energy zzso growth zzso and cellular zzso
