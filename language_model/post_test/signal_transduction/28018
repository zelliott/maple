Signal zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial for the development and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso signaling is frequently associated with zzso of zzso zzso This review focuses on the roles played by the zzso zzso machinery in the regulation of signaling through the zzso network, and discusses potential therapeutic strategies that disrupt zzso zzso zzso and its associated zzso regulate zzso signal zzso through multiple zzso The zzso system controls the stability of the nascent forms of both zzso zzso and zzso while regulation of the mature form is restricted to zzso zzso by the zzso complex extends to downstream zzso of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso the function of zzso results in the degradation of both the receptors and their zzso thereby zzso tumor cell zzso The importance of an zzso motif located within the zzso domain of zzso is discussed, as well as a direct role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso In light of recent zzso we emphasize the ability of specific zzso zzso zzso to selectively target zzso to the zzso degradation zzso zzso drugs are already used to treat zzso and clinical trials are zzso for additional compounds that intercept zzso zzso including drugs that target zzso zzso the dependence of zzso upon zzso reveals an Achilles zzso which opens a window of opportunity for combating zzso driven by the zzso signaling zzso
