A cell surface zzso zzso a zzso on human zzso cell lines, that may play a crucial role in the differentiation of zzso cells, was detected by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were cultured with the zzso zzso following zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso they displayed both cellular spreading and a strong adherence to the culture dish zzso On transforming from their original round shape, the induced cells displayed the well-developed zzso zzso or zzso that are characteristic of zzso or zzso Similar zzso changes were not induced by treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso cell lines did not respond to these zzso These results suggested that a signal for cellular zzso and zzso zzso was triggered by the binding of zzso zzso to an zzso on the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso which is zzso expressed on peripheral blood zzso may represent a cell surface zzso closely associated with zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso protein with zzso of zzso This zzso may prove useful as a tool for both studies on the differentiation of zzso lineage cells as well as on zzso zzso zzso
