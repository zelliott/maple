zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso are discussed with special reference to their zzso zzso The zzso is mainly composed of three distinctive zzso zzso structures, zzso zzso zzso filaments and intermediate zzso zzso associated with such zzso structures are a variety of zzso which have been shown not only to control the formation or breakdown of the zzso structures but also to involve the construction of a higher order of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Thus, these zzso zzso components may form the respective systems, though such systems often interact with each other for the zzso zzso The fundamental function of the zzso is to provide structural zzso for the zzso Through such zzso the zzso is involved in various cellular organizations and activities such as cell shape, distribution of cell zzso cell zzso membrane phenomena, and zzso Much interest has also been drawn to the interaction between the zzso and the zzso Part of such interaction can be assigned to the zzso zzso though it indeed constitutes a part of the zzso The significance of the zzso zzso may be to primarily provide structural supports for the zzso playing various roles in cell zzso
