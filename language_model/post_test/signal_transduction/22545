The zzso gene codes for a zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of a zzso complex that acts as a zzso for four structurally related zzso the zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cause a zzso inherited zzso of the enteric nervous system known as zzso disease zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso results either in a reduction of dosage of the zzso protein or in the loss of zzso zzso Two novel distinct zzso of zzso that led either to the deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso or to the substitution of a Pro for zzso have been identified in five zzso zzso In one large pedigree, two children born from zzso zzso parents presented a severe form of zzso and were found to carry the zzso at zzso 1061 in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso at position zzso is an zzso zzso site that enables zzso to recruit several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso We now report that both zzso zzso impair the fixation of zzso to zzso and consequently prevent its zzso In addition, quantitative analysis in zzso cells reveals that zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to zzso a downstream signal whereas zzso zzso only partially zzso the zzso of zzso Finally, we provide evidence that these effects are partly zzso via the disruption of the zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso can be ascribed to zzso of zzso which interfere with the binding of zzso zzso such as zzso and further provide a zzso explanation for the zzso of patients carrying a zzso zzso at zzso zzso Finally, these data indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso site that zzso to zzso the capacity to engage downstream zzso pathways which exert a crucial role during enteric zzso
