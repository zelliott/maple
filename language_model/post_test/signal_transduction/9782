The effect of zzso zzso zzso on heat sensitivity was investigated using transgenic zzso zzso zzso plants zzso expressing the zzso zzso 1 gene zzso under the control of a heat shock protein zzso gene zzso During heat stress, the zzso expression of the zzso zzso was capable of enhancing Pro zzso zzso zzso were first treated with heat at 37 zzso for 24 h to induce Pro and then were stressed at 50 zzso for 4 zzso After recovery at 22 zzso for 96 zzso the growth of zzso plants was significantly more inhibited than that of control plants that do not accumulate zzso zzso by lower survival rate, higher zzso zzso higher zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso levels, and increased activity of the zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased in all lines after heat treatment, but the increase was more significant in zzso zzso zzso with zzso reported for being able to specifically detect zzso formed in zzso showed that Pro zzso during heat stress resulted in elevated levels of zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso were found to partially rescue the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso levels further confirmed that these two hormones are zzso affected in zzso zzso during heat zzso Our results indicated that Pro zzso under heat stress decreases the zzso probably by increased zzso production via the zzso cycle and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
