zzso scavenging zzso oxygen species zzso are important for cell protection during stress and zzso A zzso in these zzso leads to zzso zzso causing various disorders in many organisms, including zzso In contrast to liquid cultures, where fitness of the zzso population depends on its zzso scavenging zzso the present study suggests that zzso zzso cells growing in colonies capable of zzso signaling use a broader protective zzso Instead of maintaining high levels of zzso zzso for zzso detoxification, colonies activate an alternative metabolism that prevents zzso zzso zzso of the strain deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso thus developed the same way as wild type zzso They produced comparable levels of zzso and underwent similar zzso changes zzso of genes of alternative metabolism and center margin differentiation in zzso production, cell death zzso and activities of stress defense zzso and did not accumulate zzso zzso An absence of zzso zzso zzso however, brought colonies zzso problems, which were even more prominent in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso colonies failed in zzso production and sufficient zzso of the alternative metabolism and were incapable of center margin zzso but they did not increase zzso zzso These new data indicate that colony disorders are not accompanied by zzso burst but could be a consequence of zzso zzso which, however, could be zzso by imbalance in zzso produced in early zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may participate in regulatory events leading to zzso zzso
