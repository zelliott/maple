Although the zzso agents zzso and zzso have improved the survival of patients with zzso breast cancer, resistance to these targeted therapies is a major zzso To investigate mechanisms of acquired zzso resistance, we generated acquired zzso resistance cell models by extended exposure of two zzso breast cancer cell lines to zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso breast cancer cells gained additional zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso in zzso zzso and/or increasing protein expression of existing zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso cells occurred through gene amplification or zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso the other zzso zzso zzso present in zzso cells, inhibited proliferation of zzso cells, especially when combined with zzso zzso zzso growth was inhibited persistently by combination treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso the drug combination was also well tolerated in zzso zzso the combination of zzso plus zzso more effectively inhibited zzso zzso and, surprisingly, zzso zzso than either drug alone in the resistance zzso These findings indicate that zzso resistance can occur through zzso protein zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso targeted therapy, zzso plus zzso effectively overcame zzso resistance in zzso and could be further tested in clinical zzso Finally, our findings indicate that zzso may be zzso for zzso resistance in some zzso This allows the usage of zzso zzso zzso and thus may spare patients the zzso of zzso zzso to allow zzso dosage and zzso
