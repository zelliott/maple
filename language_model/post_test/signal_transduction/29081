In response to a variety of zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso signaling regulates zzso cell zzso and zzso It is likely that cells are not continuously exposed to stimulating zzso in zzso but rather experience transient zzso To study the zzso regulation of zzso and its major regulator, inhibitor of zzso zzso in real time, we zzso a novel zzso coupled zzso zzso fusion reporter and characterized the dynamics and responsiveness of zzso processing upon a short zzso pulse of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso or a continuous challenge of zzso following a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso pulse of zzso robustly activated inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso degradation, zzso nuclear zzso and strong zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we identified a transient zzso period zzso up to 120 zzso following zzso during which the cells were not able to fully degrade zzso upon a second zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity revealed that regulation of zzso activity correlated in part with this transient zzso zzso In contrast, experiments involving sequential exposure to zzso and zzso indicated that zzso dynamics could not explain this zzso zzso a well accepted zzso model of zzso zzso we further identified an additional layer of regulation, downstream of zzso that may govern the zzso capacity of cells to respond to a second zzso zzso Overall, the data suggested that nuclear export of zzso complexes represented another zzso step that may impact this zzso period, thereby providing an additional regulatory zzso
