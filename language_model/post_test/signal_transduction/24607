A two chain model, composed of zzso and signal zzso zzso first identified in the zzso zzso system, has been revealed in several other zzso zzso Common signal zzso shared by several zzso systems may explain a functional zzso characteristic of zzso The signaling zzso from the zzso to gene zzso is now becoming clearer due to the successful molecular cloning of several zzso zzso
