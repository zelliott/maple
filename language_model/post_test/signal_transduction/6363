zzso sensing is a process that enables bacteria to communicate using zzso signaling molecules called zzso This process enables a population of bacteria to regulate gene expression collectively and, therefore, control behavior on a zzso zzso zzso sensing is widespread in the bacterial world and, generally, processes controlled by zzso sensing are zzso when undertaken by an individual zzso but become effective when undertaken by the zzso zzso communication can occur within and between bacterial species, and between bacteria and their zzso zzso which suggests that the chemical lexicon is zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms for enhancing and zzso zzso sensing have been identified, which suggests that manipulation of zzso processes could be common in zzso and zzso zzso
