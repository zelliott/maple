zzso of zzso zzso via contaminated shellfish results in inflammatory zzso zzso by severe zzso zzso and stomach zzso This study investigated the zzso of zzso across a zzso patch M zzso zzso B zzso model system, as M cells represent a primary site of infection for many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across zzso zzso in higher numbers as compared to zzso zzso Moreover, the bacteria induced a greater disruption of the zzso resistance in M zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso factors associated with this pathogen include two type three zzso systems zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on zzso efficiency, with zzso exhibiting a modest enhancing zzso zzso activity was required for optimal zzso zzso zzso however, neither zzso nor the zzso and zzso zzso were required at zzso zzso Additionally, zzso disruption in response to bacterial infection occurred independently of the zzso and zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso causes zzso disruption of M zzso zzso and zzso in high numbers across the M zzso zzso zzso These data zzso M cells as important sites for zzso invasion across the zzso zzso during zzso
