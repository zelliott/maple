The formation of a zzso zzso requires the coordinated development of zzso colonization and zzso zzso Based on its zzso zzso zzso infections zzso zzso functions at an early stage of the zzso symbiotic process, required for both infection thread growth in root hair cells and the further development of zzso zzso We show that spontaneous zzso activated by the zzso and zzso protein zzso is independent of zzso thus, zzso is not necessary for zzso zzso From this, we zzso that zzso predominantly functions during zzso colonization and that the abortion of this process in zzso zzso leads to a suppression of zzso zzso Here, we identify the zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing that it codes for a predicted zzso zzso zzso containing a highly zzso zzso and zzso repeat zzso zzso protein degradation is a universal mechanism to regulate many biological processes by eliminating zzso zzso and key components such as zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a regulator of the zzso of the zzso factor signal zzso zzso and that its function is required for correct zzso and spatial activity of the target zzso
