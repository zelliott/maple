zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso Here, we show induction of a zzso mechanism zzso by the DNA damage response zzso machinery that results in zzso of the zzso checkpoint and cellular zzso at early stages of cellular transformation caused by a zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, we identified the zzso program underlying this intrinsic zzso barrier, and zzso inflammatory regulators that fine-tune the signaling toward zzso thereby modulating the fate of zzso cells in a zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a zzso event for acquisition of stem zzso properties in zzso zzso as experimental zzso of the barrier accelerated the transition to immature cell states and acute leukemia zzso
