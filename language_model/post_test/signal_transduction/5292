The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso related zzso are activated in response to DNA damage, zzso stress and virus zzso Here we show that during infection with zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso accumulate at viral replication zzso but there is minimal zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso complex is recruited to viral zzso only during infection with zzso lacking the early region zzso and zzso signaling is zzso This suggests a novel requirement for the zzso complex in zzso zzso during virus infection, which is independent of zzso zzso activity and recruitment of zzso Unlike other damage scenarios, we found that zzso and zzso signaling are not dependent on each other during zzso We identify a region of the viral zzso protein responsible for zzso of the zzso complex and show that this prevents zzso signaling during zzso zzso We propose that zzso of the zzso damage sensor by zzso protein prevents recognition of viral zzso and blocks zzso aspects of checkpoint signaling during virus zzso
