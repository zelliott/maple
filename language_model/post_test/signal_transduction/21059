During zzso zzso has been reported to be involved in zzso and cardiovascular zzso The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these functions, however remain zzso From mouse and human species, we have recently reported the cloning of zzso receptors which share signal zzso pathways with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition to zzso C zzso it appears that these three zzso of zzso zzso a common zzso zzso activity, which could be important for cell differentiation and zzso We have first investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso Interestingly, a peak of zzso zzso zzso expression was detected zzso days zzso whereas there was only low level zzso and no zzso zzso zzso expression at this zzso zzso of this zzso was confirmed by binding zzso using a zzso zzso which revealed a peak of binding to membrane preparations from 9 days zzso zzso In addition, whole mount in zzso zzso and zzso on similar stage zzso detected zzso expression in neural crest cells, heart zzso and zzso The requirement for functional zzso receptors between 8 and 9 days zzso is supported by culture of zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso induced zzso defects in the zzso region, heart and neural zzso These zzso treatments interfere with zzso neural crest cell migration, induce their zzso and are responsible for abnormal zzso zzso of the zzso layer and for the absence of the zzso cell layer in the zzso zzso This report indicates for the first time that zzso receptors are actively zzso the action of zzso on embryonic zzso probably by preventing the differentiation of zzso neural crest cells and zzso precursor zzso
