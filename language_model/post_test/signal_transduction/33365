During zzso pairings of light and zzso B zzso in the zzso eye undergo an increase in zzso that contributes to a modification of several zzso zzso This zzso increase requires a zzso rise in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso binding to G zzso receptors as a result of zzso zzso hair cell zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso are here reported to be involved in independent signal zzso pathways that zzso both zzso function and zzso zzso of the B zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and C zzso blocked the generation of zzso zzso generator zzso but had no affect on the zzso zzso potential zzso in the B cell that results from hair cell zzso zzso which predominantly blocks the activity of zzso in zzso had no affect on either the light response or the zzso but did block increases in zzso zzso increased input resistance and zzso spike zzso of the B cell that results from pairings of light and zzso zzso stimulation zzso in zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso acid zzso which zzso metabolism of zzso by zzso nor zzso which zzso zzso metabolism of zzso affected the light response or zzso but both blocked the increases in zzso in the B cell that accompanied in zzso zzso In combination with earlier results, these data suggest that zzso activates zzso in a synergistic fashion with zzso and zzso in the B cell, and suggest that zzso zzso release, though not necessary for zzso of light or the hair zzso zzso in the B cell, is a critical component of the convergence of signals that zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
