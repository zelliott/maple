Bone zzso protein zzso molecules are members of a large family of signaling molecules important in numerous zzso pathways throughout the zzso Single members of the zzso class have been found in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In all zzso zzso there are at least two copies, zzso and zzso that play important roles in zzso zzso tissue zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso near the time of zzso origins and is useful for understanding the gene zzso events that led to the increased complexity of the zzso zzso We characterized the sequence and expression pattern of zzso class genes in the sea zzso zzso zzso We uncovered three genes that we named zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is closer than zzso or zzso in sequence identity to both zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso also more closely resembles the combined early expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso appear to play roles only later in zzso Cell labeling showed that the zzso cells in the zzso arches of zzso are of neural crest zzso Taken together, our sequence and expression data support the zzso of zzso genes in the zzso from a single ancestral zzso zzso zzso
