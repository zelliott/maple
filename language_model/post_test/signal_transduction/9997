Ran is an zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously identified a zzso of zzso a novel Ran zzso zzso gene in wheat zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso is associated with regulation of zzso integrity and cell division in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, much less is known about the function of zzso in plant zzso To analyze the possible biological roles of Ran zzso we zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the proportion of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, which resulted in an elevated zzso index and prolonged life zzso Furthermore, it led to increased primordial zzso reduced number of lateral roots, and zzso hypersensitivity to zzso zzso The results suggest that Ran protein was involved in the regulation of zzso progress, either in the shoot zzso zzso or the root zzso zone in plants, where zzso signaling is zzso This article determines the function of zzso in plant development zzso by the cell cycle and its novel role in zzso initiation zzso by zzso zzso
