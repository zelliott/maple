This review article considers the purposes and mechanisms of regulation of zzso transfer in general terms and then illustrates some key points with reference to the zzso zzso zzso a transport protein found in the zzso zzso probably has a role in the zzso of zzso zzso pH and may also be involved in zzso cell volume regulation as well as zzso loss from and zzso transfer to the zzso The activity and expression of zzso in the zzso plasma membrane of the zzso is reduced in zzso from zzso growth restricted babies as compared to their zzso matched normally grown zzso There are differential effects of gestation in normal pregnancy on zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso There is also evidence of acute zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is therefore complex with control at transcription, post zzso and post zzso zzso
