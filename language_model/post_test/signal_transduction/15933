Much is known about G protein coupled zzso trafficking and zzso following zzso zzso However, much less is known about outward trafficking of receptors from synthesis in the zzso zzso to the plasma zzso or the role that trafficking might play in the assembly of zzso signaling complexes, important for zzso zzso and zzso of subsequent signaling zzso Up to now, very little is understood about zzso zzso other than the fact that their assembly is done rapidly after zzso In our study we use zzso zzso zzso to selectively follow zzso zzso when expressed in zzso cells in order to clarify the trafficking itinerary those receptors follow to reach the plasma membrane and the resulting effect on signal zzso zzso and zzso previously shown to form both zzso and zzso were used as our model to understand the zzso of trafficking along the zzso zzso The zzso zzso relies on zzso 6 and 8 for zzso transport regardless of the presence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso relies on zzso and 11 when zzso is zzso but zzso and 8 when zzso was zzso Interestingly, similar to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso relied on zzso and 11 but also required zzso when zzso was zzso and only zzso 1 when zzso was zzso Our results demonstrate that, although the receptors zzso the zzso complex are the same as in the zzso ones, the zzso zzso and signals differently than each zzso Our study demonstrates the importance of considering the zzso zzso as distinct signaling entities that should be carefully and individually zzso
