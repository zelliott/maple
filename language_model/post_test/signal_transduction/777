Several forms of human zzso are due to zzso zzso in zzso highlighting the role of zzso signaling in the growth zzso of zzso Here, we studied the effects of zzso on zzso zzso Treatment with zzso induced growth arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and partial zzso of cells zzso by changes in cell zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso protein zzso B, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso and zzso antagonized zzso growth zzso zzso of a zzso Ras zzso resulted in a partial reversal of growth zzso while expression of zzso activated Ras led to zzso growth arrest, further demonstrating the role of the zzso zzso in this zzso At the molecular level, zzso growth arrest was initiated by disintegration of zzso zzso complex followed by increased association of zzso and zzso with the zzso and zzso complexes leading to zzso of their zzso activities and ultimately to zzso of the zzso and zzso pocket zzso Both zzso and zzso accumulated upon zzso treatment, but this zzso occurred at the protein level at least partially due to interaction with zzso induced zzso zzso
