A typical zzso tumor zzso is a highly zzso childhood brain zzso Most zzso are shown to contain zzso 22 zzso in the region of zzso zzso whose protein product zzso in zzso zzso Although the presence of this zzso is well zzso molecular pathways underlying zzso development are poorly, if at all, zzso In the current paper we evaluate a case of zzso with special consideration of two pathways often implicated in tumor development: protein zzso B zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we confirmed expression of typical protein pattern being unique for zzso including zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In molecular analyses we tested the sample for activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso signaling in the tumor was not zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso were zzso On the other hand, we detected significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the same time, inhibitor of zzso pathway, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not zzso These results strongly support the hypothesis that zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso promoting zzso transformation of zzso
