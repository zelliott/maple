zzso zzso zzso is a zzso abundant, highly zzso zzso that expresses in the zzso Recent genetic studies documented that HS critically zzso various zzso cell zzso However, zzso of the underlying molecular mechanism has been challenging because of the presence of a large number of zzso zzso found in the examined experimental zzso In this report, we used quantitative zzso to examine the global zzso signaling by comparing wild type and zzso zzso cells that were cultured in a zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso were zzso zzso correlation analysis identified 25 zzso functional networks, and the top five are related to cell zzso cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and zzso zzso communication, inflammatory response and disorder, cell growth and zzso cell movement, and cellular survival and zzso This is consistent with cell function studies showing that HS zzso altered zzso cell growth and zzso Mining for the underlying molecular mechanisms further revealed that HS zzso signaling pathways critically related to cell zzso migration, and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso organization, tight junction and zzso zzso zzso this analysis unexpectedly determined that the top zzso signaling is the IGF-1 signaling pathway, which has not been known to be modulated by zzso zzso analysis of growth factor signaling identified 22 zzso growth zzso hormone signaling zzso including those both previously known, such as zzso and zzso and those unknown, such as IGF-1, erythropoietin, zzso zzso and growth zzso Twelve of the identified 22 growth zzso hormone signaling zzso including IGF-1 and zzso zzso were alternatively confirmed in zzso zzso zzso array zzso In zzso our zzso quantitative zzso analysis confirmed previous findings and also uncovered novel zzso functional networks and zzso revealing a much broader regulatory role of HS on zzso zzso
