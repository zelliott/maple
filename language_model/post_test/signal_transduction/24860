The zzso signals which regulate the zzso program are zzso to the nucleus by zzso protein zzso zzso We have investigated the role of two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whose activities undergo significant changes during muscle zzso zzso is rapidly activated in zzso induced to zzso This zzso differs from those triggered by stress and zzso because it is not linked to zzso zzso stimulation and is maintained during the whole process of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is independent of a parallel zzso zzso zzso by zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso prevents the differentiation program in zzso cell lines and human primary zzso zzso deliberate zzso of zzso zzso stimulates muscle differentiation even in the presence of zzso zzso Much evidence indicates that zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for the expression of zzso zzso zzso enforced induction of zzso stimulates the zzso activity of a zzso fusion protein and allows efficient zzso of zzso reporters by zzso and zzso zzso zzso conversion is reduced in mouse embryonic zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso of zzso also enhances the zzso activities of zzso zzso binding factor 2A zzso and zzso by direct zzso With zzso selective zzso of one zzso zzso is a zzso zzso signal in zzso zzso Finally, zzso shows a zzso zzso profile, with zzso of activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso toward zzso zzso in zzso but contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso and regulates zzso responses zzso zzso zzso in zzso
