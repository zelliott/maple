Type I zzso zzso are potent regulators of normal zzso in zzso and in zzso but the mechanisms by which they suppress zzso zzso cell growth and differentiation are not zzso In the present study we provide evidence that zzso alpha and zzso beta induce zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso primitive human zzso zzso Such type I zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso and sequential zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso indicating the existence of a signaling zzso activated downstream of zzso in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso of this signaling cascade by the type I zzso zzso is essential for the generation of the zzso effects of type I zzso on normal zzso This is shown by studies demonstrating that pharmacological zzso of zzso reverse the growth zzso effects of zzso alpha and zzso beta on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso colony zzso In a similar manner, transforming growth factor zzso which also exhibits zzso effects on normal zzso activates zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso whereas pharmacological zzso of zzso reverse its zzso activities on both zzso and zzso colony zzso In further studies, we demonstrate that the primary mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso suppression is regulation of cell cycle progression and is unrelated to induction of zzso Altogether, these findings establish that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common zzso for type I zzso and transforming growth factor beta signaling in human zzso zzso and plays a critical role in the induction of the zzso effects of these zzso on normal zzso
