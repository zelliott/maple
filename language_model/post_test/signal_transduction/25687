Unlike some zzso the heart is unable to repair itself after zzso Human embryonic stem cells zzso grow and divide indefinitely while maintaining the potential to develop into many zzso of the zzso As such, they provide an unprecedented opportunity to treat human diseases characterized by tissue zzso We have identified early zzso precursors derived from zzso zzso using an zzso heavy chain zzso reporter zzso We have demonstrated by zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso that reporter zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso differentiated in zzso and that zzso give rise exclusively to muscle in an in zzso zzso formation zzso We also demonstrate that the reporter does not interfere with zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso give rise to zzso zzso and specialized zzso CM zzso by zzso and zzso array zzso zzso profiling of zzso over the course of differentiation zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso signaling pathways in CM zzso The identification of zzso using this zzso reporter line will provide important insight into the pathways regulating human zzso development, and may provide a novel therapeutic zzso for the treatment of cardiac zzso
