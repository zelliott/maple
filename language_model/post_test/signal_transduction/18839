Members of the low density zzso zzso zzso gene family are critically involved in a wide range of zzso processes including zzso and vitamin zzso cellular migration, zzso and synaptic zzso to name a zzso zzso receptors exert these diverse biological functions by acting as cellular zzso receptors or by inducing zzso signaling zzso It was discovered that a short sequence in the zzso region of all zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for zzso either zzso or signal zzso events, and that this motif serves as a binding site for zzso zzso domain containing scaffold zzso These molecular zzso connect the zzso receptors with the zzso machinery and regulate cellular trafficking, or function as assembly sites for dynamic zzso signaling zzso Whereas the LDL zzso represents the archetype of an zzso zzso zzso the structurally closely related zzso E zzso 2 zzso and very low density zzso zzso zzso activate a zzso zzso signaling cascade after binding to the zzso signaling zzso zzso This review focuses on two related zzso domain containing zzso proteins that mediate these divergent zzso zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and discusses the structural and molecular basis of this different zzso
