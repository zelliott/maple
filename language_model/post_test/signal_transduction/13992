The platinum zzso elements zzso represent a new kind of environmental zzso and a new hazard for human zzso Since their introduction as zzso zzso their emissions into the environment have grown considerably compared with their low natural concentration in the earth zzso zzso emissions from vehicle zzso can be also in the form of zzso particles zzso zzso zzso These zzso both in their metallic form or as zzso zzso in biological media, are now recognized as potent zzso and zzso Human skin is always exposed to toxic zzso therefore, in the present study we addressed the question of whether zzso zzso may have any negative effects on skin cells, including predominantly zzso zzso In this study, zzso of two sizes were zzso zzso zzso and 57 zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and 25 zzso Both types of zzso were protected with zzso zzso zzso were treated for 24 and 48 hours, then zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and changes in the zzso of signaling pathways were investigated in zzso zzso We found that zzso trigger toxic effects on primary zzso decreasing cell zzso but these changes have no effects on cell viability or zzso Moreover, smaller zzso exhibited more deleterious effect on DNA stability than the big zzso zzso zzso of zzso we found changes in activity of zzso 9 and zzso zzso triggered mainly by smaller zzso Changes were not so significant in the case of larger zzso zzso we found that zzso have zzso properties, as is the case with silver zzso zzso In comparison to our previous study regarding the effects of zzso on cell biology, we found that zzso do not exhibit such deleterious effects on primary zzso as zzso and that they also can be used as potential zzso agents, especially in the treatment of zzso coli, representing a group of zzso zzso
