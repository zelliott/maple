We tested the hypothesis that removing zzso zzso zzso zzso impacts the zzso relationship zzso of zzso zzso and dissected the signaling that zzso this zzso zzso of rat zzso was selectively damaged by brief zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso Force, zzso zzso transient zzso and activity of protein zzso A zzso and protein zzso C zzso were zzso In control muscles, force and zzso increased as the stimulation frequency increased in steps of zzso zzso up to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso muscles exhibited a markedly blunted zzso Neither zzso zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso alone restored the slope of zzso in zzso zzso zzso however, a positive zzso was restored in zzso preparations by combining low zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso In intact muscles, zzso and zzso activity increased zzso with the increase in zzso This effect was completely lost in zzso zzso Again, combining zzso and zzso fully restored the zzso rise in zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso In conclusion, selective damage of zzso leads to significantly blunted zzso A combination of low zzso of zzso and zzso successfully restores zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in this process indicates zzso between the zzso and zzso pathways for a normal zzso zzso The results also imply that dysfunction of zzso and/or zzso zzso may contribute to flat (or even zzso zzso in heart zzso
