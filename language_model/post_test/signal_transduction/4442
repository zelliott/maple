zzso is a zzso signaling zzso and its function in cell fate determination is crucial in embryonic development and in the maintenance of tissue zzso during adult zzso zzso zzso depends on zzso interactions that are essential for the generation of cell diversity from initially equivalent cell zzso In the adult zzso zzso is undoubtedly a very efficient promoter of zzso zzso and this has masked for a long time the effects of zzso on other blood zzso which are gradually being zzso However, the adult zzso stem cell zzso remains mostly zzso to zzso intervention in experimental zzso In contrast, zzso is essential for the generation of the zzso which takes place during embryonic zzso This review summarizes the knowledge accumulated in recent years regarding the role of the zzso zzso in the different stages of zzso zzso from embryonic life to fetal and adult bone zzso stem zzso In addition, we briefly examine other systems where zzso regulates specific stem cell zzso in an attempt to understand how zzso functions in stem cell zzso
