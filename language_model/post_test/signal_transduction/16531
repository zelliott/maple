The second zzso zzso and zzso are of central importance in signal zzso zzso To assure zzso specificity zzso and zzso zzso are highly selective for their zzso zzso and zzso zzso The universal class III zzso are equipped with a variety of zzso zzso which have been identified by structure determination and zzso Most selection mechanisms rely on a pair of zzso which form hydrogen bonds to zzso and the zzso or zzso group of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, selection is supported by hydrogen bonds involving the zzso backbone and by constraints imposed by zzso zzso
