zzso zzso zzso B), also known as zzso is a key component of insulin zzso zzso in zzso zzso lead to insulin resistance and zzso disorders, whereas zzso zzso has been linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have thus been developed for cancer treatment, but also represent useful tools to probe the roles of zzso in insulin zzso In the present study, we examined the acute effects of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1/2 zzso on zzso zzso in incubated rat zzso zzso We also assessed the effects of the compounds on zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso downstream targets (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 40 zzso and zzso zzso of 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso activity were also decreased by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso with high doses of zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso associated with increased zzso zzso zzso factor 2) zzso In contrast, zzso only modestly inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso target of zzso zzso with little or no effect on zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso rather than zzso would thus be the tool of choice for studying the role of zzso in insulin action in skeletal zzso The results point to a key role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and protein synthesis in skeletal zzso
