zzso is among the most dynamic animal zzso modulated by a variety of internal and external zzso zzso differences are associated with large-scale changes in gene zzso but little is known about how these changes are zzso Here we show how a zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the insect zzso of the zzso X zzso working in complex zzso networks, can regulate behavioral plasticity and associated changes in gene zzso We first show that zzso zzso of zzso in honey bee abdominal fat bodies delayed the transition from working in the hive zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We then demonstrate through zzso experiments that zzso induced many zzso zzso changes in the fat bodies by zzso zzso responses to juvenile zzso These zzso zzso responses to zzso occurred without changes in zzso zzso binding sites, as revealed by zzso Instead, zzso related gene expression is likely determined by zzso interactions between zzso and other zzso whose zzso motifs were enriched at zzso binding zzso Many zzso of zzso and zzso genes were zzso in both the fat body and brain, predicting that zzso and zzso influence shared zzso networks in both of these zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate how zzso gene zzso on behavioral plasticity can involve complex zzso networks, in both brain and peripheral zzso
