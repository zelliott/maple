Two types of calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso waves of increasing zzso zzso concentration zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in a variety of cell zzso To investigate this difference in zzso zzso airway zzso cells were loaded with zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited propagation of zzso zzso waves but not zzso of zzso In zzso cells, zzso waves zzso through cells displaying zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso pools with the zzso inhibitor zzso also inhibited the propagation of zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the release of zzso by zzso is necessary for the propagation of zzso zzso waves and suggest that zzso moves through gap junctions to communicate zzso zzso zzso
