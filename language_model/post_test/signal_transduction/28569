The zzso zzso zzso is one of the major regulators of zzso zzso and the target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso It has been recently cloned but the signaling pathways triggered by this zzso are still poorly zzso Here, we show that stimulation of the human zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells activates two major zzso signaling mechanisms leading either to cell proliferation or to zzso zzso zzso Both effects were blocked by the active zzso of zzso a specific zzso of zzso The zzso stimulation of proliferation required the zzso zzso zzso of zzso upstream of zzso A partial contribution of a zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso was also zzso zzso the zzso reorganization of the zzso zzso was zzso requiring zzso of zzso and zzso Our results provide new insights into the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso These data may prove to be useful for a better understanding of the zzso role of zzso particularly in zzso and zzso cells which express this important therapeutic zzso
