zzso is a strong zzso that acts by zzso DNA mismatch repair, while its toxic effect seems to be related to an indirect zzso stress that involves zzso zzso zzso Among the roles of zzso is the protection of proteins against zzso damage, by forming zzso mixed zzso with zzso zzso a process known as protein zzso and zzso by zzso zzso In this current study, zzso zzso cells deficient in zzso growing in 80 zzso zzso showed high zzso zzso rate, determined by frequency of zzso that had lost zzso function zzso zzso high tolerance and lower zzso zzso The zzso strain also showed decreased levels of zzso after cadmium exposure, which might difficult the signaling to zzso leading to increased zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is involved with the zzso death induced by cadmium, a form of cellular suicide that might lead of removal of zzso zzso
