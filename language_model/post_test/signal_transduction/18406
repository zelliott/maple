zzso radiation zzso signal zzso at both early zzso zzso and late zzso zzso times after zzso The inflammatory and zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha is induced at late times, and is induced by zzso DNA damage, as defects in DNA repair increase, and enhanced zzso repair zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso Here we show that late tumor necrosis factor alpha gene expression is sensitive to zzso implicating zzso zzso a member of the DNA protein zzso family, as a signal zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso protein was localized in the nucleus of zzso and its level was increased following ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso DNA to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso reduced ultraviolet induction of zzso by zzso zzso further inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso protein downstream target zzso zzso In mice, topical application of zzso before ultraviolet exposure protected against suppression of the contact hypersensitivity that is a hallmark of zzso zzso gene zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso DNA protein zzso zzso the signal of zzso DNA damage into production of zzso zzso at late times after ultraviolet zzso
