zzso zzso zzso Smith, a wild edible ginger species or locally known as zzso commonly used in the zzso traditional medicine as an appetizer or to treat stomachache, zzso muscle zzso and as a cure for swelling sores and zzso 

The present study was conducted to investigate the possible mechanism of actions underlying the systemic zzso activity of the essential oil of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tests in zzso 

zzso zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso paw licking tests in mice were employed in the zzso In all experiments, zzso was administered zzso at the doses of 50, 100, 200 and 300 zzso 

It was shown that zzso given to mice via zzso and oral routes at 50, 100, 200 and 300 zzso produced significant dose dependent zzso when assessed using zzso zzso abdominal writing test with calculated mean zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso administration of zzso at similar doses produced significant dose dependent zzso of zzso pain induced by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with calculated mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It was also demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso oxide precursor significantly reversed zzso produced by zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso oxide zzso In addition, zzso blue zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso produced by zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso channel zzso significantly reversed zzso activity induced by zzso 

Together, the present results suggested that zzso zzso activity was possibly related to its ability to inhibit zzso system, zzso receptors as well as through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso
