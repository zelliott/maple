The major zzso DNA zzso induced by zzso and other zzso agents used in zzso zzso and zzso melanoma therapy is zzso zzso This primary DNA damage is converted by mismatch repair into secondary zzso which block replication and in turn induce DNA zzso breaks that trigger the DNA damage response zzso Key upstream players in the zzso are the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso related zzso Here, we addressed the question of the importance of zzso and zzso in the cell death response following zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso cells are hypersensitive to zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso enhances cell kill in zzso and zzso melanoma cells with a stronger and significant effect in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso abolished zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso cell death was more prominently enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso compared with zzso The data suggest that zzso and, even better, zzso zzso is a useful strategy in zzso cancer cells to zzso and presumably also other zzso zzso
