Recent zzso zzso the youngest T cells in the zzso zzso undergo a 3 zzso period of functional and zzso maturation before being incorporated into the pool of mature, zzso T zzso Previous studies indicate that this maturation requires T cell exit from the zzso and access to secondary zzso zzso but is zzso We now show that zzso T cell maturation is independent of zzso and zzso zzso requiring neither signals delivered by zzso nor zzso Furthermore, while zzso zzso of recent zzso zzso to the T cell zones within the secondary zzso zzso is not required for zzso T cell zzso an intact zzso cell compartment zzso this zzso It is thus clear that, unlike T cell development and zzso zzso maturation is focused not on interrogating the T cell zzso or the cell's responsiveness to zzso or zzso signals, but on some as yet zzso zzso
