zzso has been implicated in a number of zzso processes important for human zzso and zzso zzso involves the formation of a zzso zzso zzso an zzso Central to the formation of the zzso is the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein 1 light chain zzso in zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso shows the greatest change in expression of any of the proteins required for zzso The magnitude of zzso is, in part, controlled by the amount of zzso thus, controlling zzso protein levels is one potential mechanism for modulating zzso zzso We have identified a negative regulator of zzso transcription, zzso which acts along with a zzso zzso complex including zzso and zzso to regulate zzso zzso deletion of any of these components leads to an increase in zzso and a zzso increase in zzso zzso A similar regulatory mechanism is present in zzso cells, indicating that this process is highly zzso
