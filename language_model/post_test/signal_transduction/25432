The zzso factor zzso regulates zzso in the embryonic zzso as well as a number of other zzso zzso While zzso continues to be expressed in zzso zzso and through adulthood, its role in fully differentiated zzso is not zzso The current study demonstrates that zzso promotes the survival of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso primed to undergo zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso expression of zzso blocks zzso death, whereas suppression of its expression zzso death in otherwise healthy zzso The first 36 zzso of zzso are necessary for its zzso effect, while the zzso half of the protein is zzso zzso of zzso a zzso necessary for DNA zzso abrogates survival promotion by zzso Survival promotion is also eliminated by zzso of zzso a zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocks the survival effects of zzso zzso but not forms in which zzso is replaced with zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with IGF-1, a zzso factor that promotes zzso survival by zzso zzso prevents the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso forms of zzso blocks the ability of IGF-1 to maintain zzso survival suggesting that zzso is a downstream zzso of zzso zzso Our study identifies a new and important function for zzso in differentiated zzso
