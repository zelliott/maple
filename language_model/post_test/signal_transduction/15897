The heat shock response continues to be layered with additional complexity as interactions and zzso among heat shock proteins zzso the zzso oxygen network and hormonal zzso are zzso However, comparative analyses exploring variation in each of these processes among species remain relatively zzso In controlled environment experiments, zzso response zzso were conducted from 22 to 42 zzso and indicated that temperature optimum of zzso photosynthesis was greater for zzso max relative to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso profiles were taken at defined states along the temperature response curves, and zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso variation in the zzso stress and the minor zzso zzso zzso A weighted gene zzso network approach was used to group individual genes into network zzso linking zzso measures of the zzso system to zzso photosynthesis among zzso zzso zzso max and zzso zzso zzso results revealed an expansion in the zzso max zzso protein family and divergence in the regulation of the zzso and heat shock zzso relative to zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that although the heat shock response is highly zzso there is considerable zzso variation in its zzso
