zzso cell losses occur during late B zzso zzso reflecting zzso selection coupled with requisites for viability promoting zzso How selection and survival cues are integrated remains zzso but a key role for B zzso zzso zzso trademark of Human Genome Sciences, zzso is suggested by its marked effects on B cell numbers and zzso formation as well as the B zzso expression of zzso zzso Our analyses of the B zzso zzso mouse have established zzso as a gene controlling zzso B cell life span, and recent reports show zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso Here we show that zzso B cells are unresponsive to zzso zzso interrogation of how zzso influences B cell zzso Mixed zzso zzso indicate zzso peripheral B cells compete poorly for peripheral zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso labeling shows that zzso zzso zzso B cells have an intermediate but uniform life span, indicating viability requires continuous signaling via this zzso Together, these findings establish the zzso zzso as a dominant zzso of B cell survival, suggesting competition for zzso signals regulates zzso B cell zzso
