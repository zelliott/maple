The generation of zzso cells from stem cells obtained from adult bone zzso is of significant clinical interest in order to design new cell therapy protocols for several neurological zzso The recent identification in adult bone zzso of stem cells derived from the neural crest stem cells zzso might explain the zzso zzso plasticity shown by bone zzso zzso However, little information is available about the nature of these cells compared to zzso stem cells zzso including their similarities and zzso In this paper, using zzso as well as zzso technologies, we compared zzso to zzso and zzso zzso cells, all of them isolated from adult bone zzso We demonstrated that the zzso cell population, which was the first to be described as able to differentiate into functional zzso was a mixed population of zzso and zzso More interestingly, we demonstrated that zzso shared with zzso the same ability to truly differentiate into zzso cells when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Altogether, those results suggest that both zzso and zzso can be considered as important tools for cellular therapies in order to replace zzso in various neurological zzso
