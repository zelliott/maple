zzso by energetic stress, zzso protein zzso zzso controls several cellular zzso It was discovered here that infection of zzso cells with avian zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Being an energy status zzso zzso is potentially an upstream regulator of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso of zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso or zzso did not induce zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is not a determining factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by compound C antagonized the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso or compound C also suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, thereby providing a link between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cells was not merely due to zzso zzso a probable zzso of zzso In the current study, direct zzso of zzso zzso by zzso decreased the level of zzso zzso formation in zzso and zzso cells, and decreased the protein levels of zzso zzso A and zzso C and the progeny zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso is beneficial for zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggested that zzso could facilitate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that is beneficial for zzso zzso Although well studied in energy zzso this study provides evidence for the first time that zzso plays a role in modulating zzso and zzso zzso
