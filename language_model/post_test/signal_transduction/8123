This study investigates whether zzso converting zzso zzso zzso can block high zzso increase of zzso II zzso zzso levels in cultured rat zzso zzso zzso of cells with high zzso for 5 days increased zzso II in the cell media zzso and cell zzso zzso by approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso zzso blocked high zzso increase in zzso zzso II levels but not in zzso zzso II zzso Since the inability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso II in intact cells could be explained by failure of the drug to enter the cells, further studies were performed using zzso from cells zzso with high zzso for 5 zzso zzso of zzso to cell zzso was indeed able to inhibit zzso I conversion to zzso II but only zzso These findings suggest the involvement of zzso mechanisms in zzso II formation from zzso I in zzso zzso
