To explore whether immune complex zzso can directly induce zzso zzso zzso proliferation and the role of zzso B signal zzso in the zzso 

The mice were divided into control, stimulation and zzso zzso In zzso group, zzso isolated from mice were zzso with zzso sense, mismatched or zzso zzso for 8 zzso respectively, by using zzso control and stimulation groups were incubated with zzso for 8 zzso Then stimulation and zzso groups were incubated with zzso zzso standard zzso zzso while the control group with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso zzso Distribution of zzso in cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso zzso D1 zzso and its protein expression were determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso activity of zzso B in zzso was determined by zzso 

zzso activated zzso B, zzso zzso D1 zzso and its protein zzso and induced majority of zzso to enter zzso in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically decreased zzso zzso B zzso zzso D1 zzso and its protein zzso and then inhibited zzso to progress to zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso and mismatched zzso had no such zzso 

zzso can directly stimulate zzso proliferation through zzso B signal pathway, suggesting that zzso B probably be a useful zzso for targeted therapy in zzso zzso zzso
