zzso zzso is the second most common solid childhood zzso an aggressive disease for which new therapeutic strategies are strongly zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso in most zzso cells, but not in normal zzso and therefore represents a valuable candidate in zzso zzso zzso is silenced in a subset of highly zzso zzso cells, which results in full TRAIL zzso In addition, despite zzso zzso zzso or its possible restoration by different strategies, zzso cells remain zzso sensitive to TRAIL indicating a need to develop strategies to zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a new class of zzso agent inducing zzso or cell cycle arrest in zzso cells with very low toxicity toward normal zzso Although zzso were recently shown to increase death induced by TRAIL in zzso zzso zzso cells, the precise involved zzso mechanisms have not been fully zzso 

zzso cell lines were treated with various doses of zzso and zzso then zzso was zzso by zzso proliferation zzso zzso was measured by the zzso zzso method, zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins by zzso 

zzso doses of zzso strongly zzso zzso positive zzso cell lines to TRAIL induced zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Combined treatments increased the zzso of zzso and Bid, and the zzso of the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby increasing the zzso to zzso protein zzso It also enhanced the zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins is accelerated by combined treatment with TRAIL and zzso compared to TRAIL zzso In contrast, cell surface expression of zzso or TRAIL is not affected by zzso doses of zzso 

zzso were shown to activate the zzso zzso and to zzso zzso cells to TRAIL by enhancing the zzso of the zzso cascade and by restoring an zzso ratio of zzso to zzso zzso Combining zzso and TRAIL could therefore represent a zzso toxic and promising strategy to target zzso zzso such as zzso
