We have previously shown that zzso growth factor zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of growth factors, is a zzso and survival factor for zzso zzso in cell culture and blocks their differentiation at the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1996, zzso 17, zzso We now show that zzso is able to induce differentiated zzso to undergo a zzso zzso characterized by loss of zzso zzso zzso of the intermediate filament protein zzso reorganization of the zzso zzso and a dramatic reduction in the number of processes per zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso is not zzso for mature zzso but rather enhances their zzso zzso also zzso the rapid zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso These results further support a role for the zzso in promoting the proliferation and survival of and zzso the differentiation of cells in the zzso lineage and demonstrate that zzso that differentiate in culture retain a substantial degree of zzso zzso
