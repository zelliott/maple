zzso Y zzso zzso the zzso of cultured rat zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso cultures under hypoxic conditions zzso zzso possibly by binding to the zzso zzso zzso The present study evaluated the effects of zzso compared to vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso were cultured on the upper chamber base of a zzso culture system, zzso zzso was introduced into the chamber, and zzso into the lower chamber was zzso Treatment was with 3 zzso zzso M zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 2 h along with specific zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso I zzso suppressed the zzso increase in zzso zzso but not that caused by zzso Furthermore, although the action of zzso was blocked in a zzso manner by zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso it was less sensitive than zzso However, the effects of both zzso and zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso were blocked with equal concentration dependence by zzso zzso zzso which is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in the nucleus and/or zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso by approximately zzso whereas the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso could decrease to below the zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is specifically linked to the effects of zzso on zzso cells, and that zzso a sympathetic zzso may increase vascular zzso in association with altered zzso or nuclear signal zzso
