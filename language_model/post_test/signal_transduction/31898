zzso zzso is zzso after zzso zzso therefore, we hypothesized that fish zzso contributes to zzso production during immune responses against zzso To verify this hypothesis, we first cloned zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the present zzso The membrane and soluble forms of zzso were identified by the identification of zzso clones of zzso zzso Three zzso sites were found in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso B cells, suggesting that zzso B cells are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the gene expression of zzso zzso by zzso B cells in zzso The zzso and soluble form of zzso activated zzso zzso in the B cells and a cultured cell line zzso with zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso enhances zzso production in the zzso lineage via zzso and zzso zzso
