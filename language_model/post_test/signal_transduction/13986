zzso coupled zzso 34 zzso which belongs to the zzso coupled receptors zzso is reportedly expressed highly in the spread of several solid zzso However, its expression in gastric primary tumor and potential role in gastric cancer development and progression have not been zzso 

zzso real-time zzso and western zzso methods were used to determine zzso expression in human gastric cancer zzso lines and matched adjacent zzso normal zzso cell zzso A statistical analysis was performed to establish the potential correlation between zzso expression and the patients' zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines with either zzso zzso or zzso were constructed to determine the effect of zzso on gastric cancer cell invasion and migration, and to explain the preliminary molecular mechanism of zzso in gastric cancer zzso 

zzso is zzso in primary gastric cancer zzso lines compared with matched adjacent zzso zzso cell line, and when the relationship between zzso expression and the the zzso characteristics was zzso it was shown that zzso expression is significantly correlated with tumor zzso zzso depth, and zzso zzso status and had a significant influence on zzso Furthermore, zzso increased while zzso inhibited zzso cell invasion in zzso by zzso zzso 

Taken together, zzso of zzso expression in human gastric zzso may play a critical role in tumor progression and in determining patient zzso zzso may be a useful diagnostic or zzso molecular zzso and a potential target for therapeutic zzso
