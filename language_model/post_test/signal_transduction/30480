zzso zzso a medicinal fungus is thought to possess and enhance a variety of human immune zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso exhibited potent zzso effects upon human peripheral blood zzso zzso However, zzso signal zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression within human T cells is largely zzso Here we cloned the zzso gene of zzso zzso and expressed the zzso zzso protein zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso protein expression zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso gene expression via the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso via zzso oxygen species zzso and differential protein zzso pathways within human primary T cells and cultured zzso T zzso In essence, we have established the nature of the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso C zzso zzso and zzso pathways in the regulation of zzso gene expression within human T zzso Our current results of analyzing zzso signal zzso in T cells might provide a potential application for zzso as a pharmacological zzso zzso
