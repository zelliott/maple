One of the most important and challenging problems in zzso and zzso is how to identify the disease zzso In this study, we developed a zzso method to identify zzso zzso genes based on zzso the gene expression profiles, and zzso the shortest path analysis of functional protein association zzso The former has been used to select zzso expressed genes as disease genes for quite a long time, while the latter has been widely used to study the mechanism of zzso With the existing zzso interaction data from STRING zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso a weighted functional protein association network was zzso By means of the zzso zzso zzso Minimum zzso approach, six genes were identified that can distinguish the zzso tumors and normal adjacent zzso zzso from their gene expression zzso Meanwhile, according to the shortest path approach, we further found an additional 35 zzso of which some have been reported to be relevant to zzso cancer and some are very likely to be relevant to zzso Interestingly, the genes we identified from both the gene expression profiles and the functional protein association network have more cancer genes than the genes identified from the gene expression profiles zzso Besides, these genes also had greater functional similarity with the reported zzso cancer genes than the genes identified from the gene expression profiles zzso All these indicate that our method as presented in this paper is quite zzso The method may become a useful zzso or at least plays a complementary role to the existing method, for identifying zzso cancer zzso It has not escaped our notice that the method can be applied to identify the genes of other diseases as zzso
