zzso 43 zzso is essential for survival and is tightly regulated at the zzso and zzso zzso A number of previous studies have demonstrated altered expression in zzso zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso of zzso zzso and found no effect on zzso promoter activity in cells transformed with zzso or zzso On the other hand, we identified and characterized a novel sequence that mediates zzso promoter regulation in cell lines engineered to zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells, both zzso zzso and protein levels are increased in zzso zzso The zzso cells also have enhanced zzso promoter zzso which is inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is via the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed a zzso region downstream of the zzso zzso start site as the minimal sequence essential for the zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso pair zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso we identified one main protein complex that binds efficiently and is more abundant in nuclear extracts from zzso and zzso cells compared with their matched zzso This complex selectively recognizes a consensus zzso zzso located at positions zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso heat shock protein zzso and zzso as constituents of this zzso zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in repression of the zzso promoter activity, and zzso binding of the complex to the zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso This study provides evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso via the interaction of a novel zzso promoter element with a protein complex that contains both zzso and zzso
