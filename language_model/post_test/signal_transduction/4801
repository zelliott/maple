zzso zzso cancer zzso is a lethal solid tumor with poor prognosis because of its zzso and its resistance to current zzso Recently, zzso cells were found to have cancer stem cell zzso properties and were suggested to be important contributors to zzso and cancer zzso However, the molecular pathways and therapeutic targets in zzso zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, zzso cells were isolated and found to have increased zzso zzso and higher expression of both embryonic stem zzso and drug zzso genes compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso could be important in regulating the zzso signature in zzso zzso therefore, the effect of the potent zzso inhibitor zzso I in zzso cells was evaluated in this zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso I diminished their zzso abilities, inhibited their zzso gene signature, and facilitated their differentiation into zzso zzso Of note, treatment of zzso cells with zzso I zzso the expression of zzso genes and significantly enhanced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso I treatment increased the sensitivity of zzso cells to radiation and zzso drugs through zzso Finally, zzso experiments revealed that zzso I plus zzso significantly suppressed zzso and improved survival in zzso mice into which zzso cells were zzso In zzso these results show that the zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso properties in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso I in zzso may provide a new approach for therapeutic treatment in the zzso
