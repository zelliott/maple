The future management of patients with allergic asthma is poised to change in the coming one to two zzso This prediction is based on fundamental new insights into the zzso of disease, gained through the study of both humans and experimental models of zzso These studies have revealed that allergic asthma is an zzso disease which, despite the zzso characteristic of all immune responses, may be induced through a single dominant signaling cascade called the zzso zzso signaling zzso In addition to the zzso zzso this zzso includes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor, signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso signaling zzso controls the most important cellular zzso zzso events that zzso zzso These include T helper zzso type 2 cell zzso B cell zzso and zzso zzso E zzso mast cell development, and zzso zzso events related exclusively to immune effects on the lung such as zzso cell zzso and airway zzso Any of the zzso signaling molecules are potentially amenable to pharmacological intervention, but a detailed understanding of the entire zzso is required to appreciate their actual potential for drug zzso For example, zzso strategies that target only zzso are unlikely to succeed because they leave zzso free to continue the signaling zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso may represent a more feasible strategy, as it should prevent signaling by both zzso and zzso The therapeutic potential of targeting zzso zzso zzso has already been achieved with the use of small zzso suggesting that this approach may be realistically adopted for the treatment of zzso However, well designed asthma clinical trials are warranted to determine with zzso the efficacy of therapies based on zzso zzso
