The zzso in zzso zzso evoked in pancreatic zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have very different zzso zzso In the present study we use digital video imaging of zzso zzso to map the spatial distribution of zzso during the zzso responses to these two zzso The spatial patterns induced are very different for each of these zzso zzso zzso are zzso and initiated at the zzso pole of these zzso and functionally polarized zzso As they spread across the cell, pronounced zzso in zzso develop that persist throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso a series of discrete zzso zzso of longer duration and lower zzso These zzso in zzso arise slowly, throughout the cells and without any zzso zzso in zzso We consider that the different zzso patterns can be explained on the basis of a zzso relevant interaction between zzso and protein zzso C in second zzso zzso zzso
