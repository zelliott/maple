zzso plays a central role in cell zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso The spatial distribution of zzso zzso signaling is not zzso rather it is zzso zzso and it has been speculated that spatial patterns of zzso signals may function as a form of cellular information transmitted to downstream zzso To address this issue, we studied the zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso and zzso in the same zzso The former was zzso by monitoring zzso zzso of a zzso protein zzso using zzso and zzso zzso while the latter was examined by zzso zzso zzso Local zzso signals induced zzso zzso by zzso localized in the same zzso On the other hand, zzso waves in zzso induced global zzso of zzso by zzso A small population of zzso filaments highly zzso by zzso underwent structural zzso into short filaments at electron microscopic zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso spatial patterns of zzso signals to zzso as cellular zzso The possibility is discussed that spatial patterns of zzso zzso may be important for zzso organization of zzso filament zzso
