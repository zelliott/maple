We have recently shown that a high zzso zzso concentration raised zzso cholesterol zzso transport and metabolism in zzso zzso zzso The objective of the present work is to determine whether the stimulus for increased zzso zzso by zzso originates from the zzso site zzso to the zzso zzso or from the zzso site zzso to blood zzso We tackled this issue by using differentiated zzso zzso Only zzso zzso supplemented with 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso of the critical zzso zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by its specific zzso inhibitor that abolished the rise in zzso zzso zzso No significant changes were noted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with an increase in the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso along with a fall in zzso Interestingly, although the zzso concentration in the zzso medium caused modest changes in zzso processing, its impact was zzso with that of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso concentration influences positively zzso zzso zzso when present in the zzso zzso In addition, excessive consumption of diets containing high levels of carbohydrates may strengthen zzso zzso zzso in zzso syndrome, thereby contributing to elevated levels of circulating zzso and, consequently, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso
