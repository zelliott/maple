Basic zzso growth factor zzso a zzso acting as a zzso in different cell types, is able to induce a long lasting non zzso calcium influx from the zzso medium in zzso zzso mouse zzso This effect is zzso by the zzso zzso activity of zzso receptors and the opening of zzso independent, zzso activated calcium zzso In this paper we investigate the signal zzso steps involved in this process using single cell calcium zzso and zzso zzso One of the pathways initiated by the binding of growth factors to their zzso zzso receptors is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the release of zzso acid zzso from the plasma membrane with the subsequent production of zzso We show here that, in our preparation, this zzso is involved in the opening of the zzso calcium permeable channels, through the zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso and zzso Evidence for direct involvement of AA is given by the finding that: zzso zzso zzso AA release from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of AA metabolism are not zzso and zzso the application of either zzso acid or its non zzso analogue zzso acid zzso reproduces the responses described for zzso Finally, single channel analysis indicates that zzso AA and zzso can activate the same calcium permeable zzso
