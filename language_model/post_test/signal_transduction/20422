This study investigated if zzso oxide zzso and/or zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso during warm zzso zzso stimulation zzso 

For two zzso two zzso zzso were placed in the zzso zzso zzso In the first protocol zzso the sites were randomly assigned and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an NO zzso inhibitor or zzso solution zzso zzso Similarly, two zzso zzso were placed in the zzso zzso skin in the second protocol zzso One site was zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other site was zzso with zzso solution zzso zzso In both zzso zzso zzso was induced using zzso with an electronic warm zzso treatment zzso After 10 minutes of baseline recording, zzso was applied to the zzso skin for 20 minutes and recovery was monitored over a period of 20 zzso zzso blood flow zzso at each site was measured using zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso 

The study was conducted in a laboratory at the Kansai University of Health zzso 

The subjects were 14 healthy male zzso 

zzso was applied to the zzso zzso skin using an electronic warm zzso treatment zzso 

zzso skin temperature zzso core body temperature zzso heart rate zzso and zzso were outcome zzso 

In the first zzso peak zzso values during zzso at the site zzso with zzso were significantly zzso compared to those at the control site zzso In the second zzso peak zzso values during zzso did not differ between the control site and the zzso site zzso 

These data demonstrate that NO is involved in the mechanism of zzso zzso induced by zzso Furthermore, increases in zzso despite zzso of the zzso zzso suggest that PG does not contribute to zzso zzso during zzso
