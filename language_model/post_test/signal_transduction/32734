Growth and patterning of the zzso wing is controlled in part by the long-range organizing activities of the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso by cells that line the anterior side of the zzso compartment border of the wing zzso zzso From this source, zzso is thought to generate a concentration zzso that patterns both anterior and zzso zzso Among the gene targets that it regulates are zzso blind zzso zzso zzso and daughters against zzso zzso We report here the molecular cloning of zzso zzso and show that zzso expression is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a protein that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso indicates that zzso can also repress the targets of a zzso zzso of zzso bone zzso protein 4 zzso The evolutionary conservation of zzso function underscores the importance of its negative role in zzso zzso zzso
