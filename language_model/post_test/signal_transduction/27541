zzso of protein synthesis leads to zzso in the zzso zzso layer of the zzso of newborn zzso We have shown previously that an increase in the zzso concentration of zzso zzso prevented zzso induced in the retinal zzso layer by zzso of protein zzso In this study, we tested the effects of zzso on retinal zzso and related these effects to the zzso concentration of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso induced in the zzso layer by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso The zzso effects of the zzso zzso were not reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso induced a five- to zzso increase in the zzso concentration of zzso zzso in the zzso of newborn zzso The concentration of zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso was still at least two- to zzso as high as control values, showing that the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso was reversed only partially by the specific zzso The zzso zzso (20 zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso protein zzso partially prevented the zzso effect of zzso The data show that an early effect of zzso in the developing zzso is the control of programmed cell zzso The zzso effect of zzso is zzso at least in part, through an zzso zzso zzso coupled to stimulation of zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso
