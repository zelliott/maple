The role of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the neural responses of zzso zzso to mechanical zzso was examined using an isolated zzso preparation in a rat zzso zzso and its intact zzso were harvested from the zzso thigh of the zzso and placed in a dish containing synthetic zzso zzso Using a standard teased nerve preparation, the neural responses of single slowly or rapidly adapting zzso zzso or zzso zzso were identified and the zzso zzso according to standard protocols zzso response to constant zzso The most sensitive spot of a zzso receptive field was identified and then zzso using controlled zzso stress zzso or dynamic loads between threshold and zzso load for zzso and zzso zzso zzso were applied before, zzso and after passive diffusion into the skin of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or one of two types of control zzso zzso G or a zzso zzso with a secondary zzso The sensitivities of both zzso and zzso zzso were profoundly reduced in the presence of the zzso while not changing the zzso of their action zzso or their adaptation zzso Both control zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso Following removal of the zzso the effects in some zzso were partially zzso Taken together, the data from this study support the hypothesis that zzso zzso plays a significant role in modulating zzso response to zzso zzso
