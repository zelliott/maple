zzso zzso is one of the key regulators of zzso zzso In the present work, realization pathways of the previously revealed modulating influence of zzso zzso on the zzso mechanisms of zzso regulation in bovine zzso were zzso A comparative investigation of individual and combined effects of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso on the zzso zzso and nuclear maturation completion in zzso and zzso zzso was zzso It has been shown that the pattern of zzso influence on the zzso resumption in zzso devoid of zzso cells depends on the presence of zzso in the culture zzso Furthermore, realization of this influence is not associated with the zzso of zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso It has been also found that zzso zzso the zzso action of zzso on the completion of zzso nuclear maturation in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso The findings suggest that zzso may zzso the functioning of the zzso mechanism of zzso regulation by the direct action on bovine zzso with realization of the action being independent of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso
