zzso is a cell surface zzso that also functions as an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso zzso factor, zzso functions as a zzso upon zzso by tumor zzso zzso is zzso through a zzso and zzso raft zzso zzso to the smooth zzso however, the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity remains zzso zzso zzso to the smooth zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso is reduced in zzso zzso cells and zzso the zzso zzso of its cell surface zzso zzso zzso is zzso and is inhibited by expression of zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso and is therefore distinct from zzso and zzso raft zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso but this is reduced by zzso treatment and is absent in zzso zzso therefore, zzso activities require zzso zzso zzso also prevents zzso degradation of the zzso fusion zzso zzso 1 and 2 in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso activity, and this is also reversed by zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso therefore, promotes zzso signaling that feeds back to promote zzso zzso and also zzso the ability of zzso to target the zzso for degradation, thereby preventing zzso zzso zzso Through regulation of an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso represents an zzso regulator of zzso fusion and zzso
