zzso zzso zzso stimulation in the nucleus zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso receptors antagonize the effects of zzso zzso stimulation on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The goal of the present study is to determine the effects of zzso zzso zzso stimulation on zzso of zzso behavior in zzso 

zzso were trained to lever press for cocaine in daily zzso sessions on a zzso 1 schedule for 3 zzso After 1 week of zzso lever pressing was extinguished in six daily extinction zzso We subsequently assessed the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to cocaine zzso We also assessed the effects of zzso zzso on zzso seeking in rats extinguished from zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso blunted zzso zzso (15 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso and zzso zzso A minimally effective dose of zzso zzso failed to alter zzso locomotor activity or zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso of cocaine seeking zzso by cocaine, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso stimulation may oppose zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso that mediates cocaine zzso
