zzso a class of natural zzso found in all zzso organisms, are involved in a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso has been well studied zzso the genetic basis of the zzso is not well zzso Here, we report the characterization of two zzso zzso zzso spontaneous cell zzso zzso and zzso The weak zzso zzso zzso showed characteristics of zzso leaves, zzso of zzso and mosaic cell zzso The strong zzso zzso zzso caused a complete arrest of plant growth and development shortly after zzso leading to a zzso zzso zzso and molecular analyses indicated that zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso revealed that several major zzso compounds downstream of zzso were substantially reduced in zzso suggesting that zzso is a functional zzso zzso with the zzso expression of zzso and zzso the zzso content was decreased in zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso zzso and zzso was absent in zzso suggesting the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso retrograde zzso The zzso zzso also displays an zzso zzso that can be partially rescued by the zzso supplied zzso These results suggest that zzso is essential for zzso of zzso and plays a crucial role in plant growth and zzso
