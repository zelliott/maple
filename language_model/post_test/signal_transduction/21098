We prepared single cell clones from two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and analyzed the effect of zzso treatment on cell division, DNA zzso and cell cycle stage distribution of these single cell zzso Our results show that despite the well-known zzso nature of these cell lines, all single cell clones of zzso cells are resistant to the growth zzso effects of zzso In contrast, all single cell clones of zzso cells were growth inhibited by zzso However, the extent of growth zzso did vary somewhat from clone to zzso Additional studies employing flow zzso showed that zzso blocked zzso cell cycle progression in the zzso zzso Finally, zzso was able to inhibit zzso progression in zzso zzso cells following stimulation with fetal bovine serum, insulin, IGF-1, or zzso Since each of these growth factors is known to act via distinct signal zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso blocks zzso progression by targeting a downstream process or event which occurs at a point after the zzso estrogen, and serum signal zzso pathways zzso
