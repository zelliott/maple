zzso growth factor beta zzso proteins play important roles in zzso of many zzso zzso however, detailed biological mechanisms of zzso action, particularly in zzso are still poorly zzso Here, we deleted the zzso type I zzso gene zzso specifically in the embryonic zzso and neural crest cell zzso Failure in signaling via this zzso either in the zzso or in the zzso caused severe zzso defects including zzso zzso Moreover, the facial zzso of neural zzso zzso zzso included devastating facial zzso and appeared significantly more severe than the defects seen in corresponding zzso lacking the zzso type II zzso zzso a zzso binding partner of zzso Our data indicate that zzso plays unique, zzso zzso roles during facial zzso zzso divergence between zzso and zzso zzso together with our zzso in zzso data, imply that zzso zzso mediates signaling of a diverse set of zzso not limited to the three zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acts also in conjunction with type II receptors other than zzso
