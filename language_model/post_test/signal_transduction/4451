During evolution, zzso have developed remarkably similar molecular mechanisms to respond to external challenges and maintain zzso Critical regulators of these mechanisms are the family of zzso that consists of the zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso integration of an intricate series of zzso responses involving the zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular and zzso systems, which induce a spectrum of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso exert their actions by zzso two types of zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso which belong to the zzso family of zzso The zzso exhibit zzso zzso facilitated by their ability to couple to multiple zzso and regulate diverse zzso networks that involve zzso zzso such as zzso and an array of zzso in an zzso and zzso manner, a property that allows them to exert unique roles in the integration of zzso zzso We only now begin to unravel the plethora of zzso biological actions and the zzso and zzso mechanisms such as alternative zzso zzso or zzso zzso developed to tightly control zzso biological activity and regulate their zzso zzso This review summarizes the current understanding of zzso zzso complexity and regulatory mechanisms that zzso cellular responses to zzso and zzso
