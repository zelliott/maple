Before they zzso red blood cells and cause malaria, zzso zzso undergo an zzso and clinically silent expansion phase in the liver that is supposedly zzso by the zzso Here, we demonstrate the engagement of a type I zzso zzso response during zzso replication in the zzso We identified zzso zzso as a previously zzso zzso molecular pattern zzso capable of zzso a type I zzso response via the zzso pattern recognition zzso zzso This response, initiated by zzso cells through the zzso zzso for zzso zzso sensors, zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso is zzso by zzso in an zzso zzso zzso This signaling zzso is critical for immune zzso host resistance to zzso zzso infection, which we find can be primed with other zzso including zzso C virus zzso Together, our results show that the liver has sensor mechanisms for zzso that mediate a functional zzso response driven by type I zzso
