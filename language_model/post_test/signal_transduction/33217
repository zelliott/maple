The effect of zzso zzso zzso on the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell was investigated at an zzso of approximately zzso zzso The results depended upon the type of zzso zzso AM zzso of 16 zzso and 60 zzso produced a transient increase in zzso activity that reached a peak at 8 h of exposure and returned to control levels after 24 h of zzso In this case, zzso was increased by a maximum of zzso relative to control zzso A zzso increase in zzso activity was also observed after 8 h of exposure with a typical signal from a zzso digital cellular telephone operating in the middle of its transmission frequency range zzso 840 zzso This signal was burst modulated at 50 zzso with approximately zzso duty zzso By contrast, 8 h exposure with zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated with speech produced no significant change in zzso zzso Further zzso with 8 h of exposure to AM zzso as a function of zzso frequency, revealed that the response is frequency dependent, decreasing sharply at 6 zzso an 600 zzso Exposure with zzso zzso zzso frequency modulated with a 60 zzso zzso yielded no significant enhancement in zzso activity for exposure times ranging between 2 and 24 zzso Similarly, exposure with a typical signal from an zzso analog cellular telephone, which uses a form of frequency zzso produced no significant enhancement in zzso zzso Exposure with zzso zzso continuous wave zzso produced no effects for exposure times between 2 and 24 zzso except for a small but statistically significant enhancement in zzso activity after 6 h of zzso zzso of these results suggests that effects are much more robust when the zzso causes zzso periodic changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso
