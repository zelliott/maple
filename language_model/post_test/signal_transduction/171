zzso fatty acids zzso are known to induce inflammation and insulin resistance in zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso but the mechanisms are not well zzso Furthermore, the potential roles of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in inflammation in zzso have not been zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso induced insulin resistance in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso with the reduction of insulin sensitivity was an increased expression of zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso factors, nuclear factor zzso B, and zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso was also observed in zzso and zzso zzso treated zzso The zzso zzso zzso attenuated insulin resistance zzso by zzso and zzso zzso which corresponded with a diminished zzso response and reduced zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrated zzso involvement in zzso inflammation and therefore implicated the zzso as a potential target for zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso also appeared to be essential to zzso as well as zzso insulin resistance and zzso zzso
