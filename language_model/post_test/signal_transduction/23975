We have addressed the control of zzso zzso zzso in the developing zzso including the zzso projections of zzso and zzso zzso To test potential sources of guidance signals, we assessed zzso outgrowth from embryonic rat zzso zzso cultured in collagen gels at a distance from zzso of zzso boundary zzso zzso zzso or cervical spinal zzso Our results showed that the zzso inhibited zzso directed zzso outgrowth by zzso relative to controls, whereas zzso directed zzso outgrowth was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso or cervical spinal zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso markers indicated that the zzso but not the zzso projections of these zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso Companion studies in chick zzso showed that, when the zzso was surgically separated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso projections failed to form and that descending pioneer zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso or zzso signals from the zzso and zzso signals on the pioneer zzso zzso are involved in the zzso direction of zzso projections and might influence other zzso zzso projections in the zzso
