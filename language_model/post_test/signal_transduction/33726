Cancer is caused by genetic zzso such as zzso of zzso or tumor zzso zzso which alter downstream signal zzso pathways and zzso zzso Comparisons of the interactions of proteins in zzso and normal cells can shed light on the mechanisms of zzso 

We constructed initial networks of zzso interactions involved in the zzso of zzso and normal cells by use of two human zzso zzso data sets and four online zzso Next, we applied a zzso zzso model, maximum likelihood zzso zzso and zzso Information zzso zzso to eliminate zzso zzso interactions in our initial protein interaction networks by use of zzso zzso Comparisons of the networks of zzso in zzso zzso cervical zzso cells and in normal primary lung zzso provided insight into the mechanism of zzso and allowed identification of potential drug zzso The potential targets include zzso zzso and zzso Our comparison of zzso and normal cells also allowed derivation of several party hubs and date hubs in the human zzso interaction networks involved in zzso zzso 

Our method allows identification of zzso zzso interactions involved in zzso and identification of potential molecular targets for development of zzso zzso
