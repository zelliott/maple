zzso zzso is a common human zzso zzso colonizing zzso to zzso of healthy individuals, depending on zzso Despite a low invasive disease rate, widespread carriage ensures that infection occurs often enough to make zzso zzso a leading bacterial cause of respiratory disease zzso However, the mechanisms behind transition from zzso colonization to dissemination and disease in otherwise sterile sites remain poorly understood but are zzso strongly linked to infection with respiratory zzso In this report, we show that infection with influenza A virus and treatment with the resulting host signals zzso temperatures, zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso induce the release of bacteria from zzso in a newly developed zzso model on live zzso cells both in zzso and during in zzso zzso These dispersed bacteria have distinct zzso properties different from those of both zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, with the dispersed population showing differential zzso gene expression characteristics resulting in a significantly increased ability to zzso and cause infection of otherwise sterile sites, such as the middle ear, zzso and zzso The results offer novel and important insights into the role of zzso signaling between zzso and host during zzso zzso and transition to acute zzso 

This report addresses the mechanisms involved in transition from zzso zzso colonization to zzso In this study, we determined that changes in the zzso environment result in the release of bacteria from colonizing zzso with a gene expression and zzso zzso different not only from that of colonizing zzso bacteria but also from that of the zzso zzso bacteria commonly used for zzso zzso The work zzso also identifies specific host factors responsible for the release of bacteria and their changed zzso We show that these zzso signals are recognized by bacteria and are induced by influenza virus infection, which is zzso strongly associated with transition to secondary zzso zzso As virus infection is a common zzso of transition to disease among species occupying the zzso the results of this study may provide a basis for better understanding of the signals involved in the transition from colonization to disease in the human zzso
