zzso zzso zzso gene 5) is a zzso factor that is required for zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso plays additional roles in embryonic and zzso zzso processes in the zzso Through a zzso mouse zzso approach, we generated a sterile mouse line that carried a nonsense zzso in zzso 12 of the zzso zzso The zzso led to the conversion of zzso at position 412 into a premature termination zzso zzso within the zzso DNA binding domain of the zzso We showed that the zzso zzso produced a highly unstable zzso which in turn resulted in an zzso level of zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in male and female zzso as determined by breeding zzso zzso males were sterile due to a progressive loss of zzso which ultimately resulted in a zzso cell only zzso by 8 zzso Further, the zzso target genes zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in the maintenance and migration of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso resulted in several zzso abnormalities including an increased zzso of embryonic and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, our data define a zzso role for zzso in many aspects of development including embryonic and zzso survival, zzso growth, limb zzso kidney development and zzso
