zzso zzso and zzso are three closely related orphan members of the zzso hormone zzso zzso These receptors can bind to DNA as zzso and exhibit zzso zzso zzso Moreover, two of the zzso zzso and zzso have previously been shown to form zzso with the zzso X zzso zzso Such zzso as well as complexes formed between zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso bind to DNA response elements composed of direct repeats spaced by five zzso zzso However, whereas zzso acid zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso allow efficient zzso zzso through zzso elements and thus define a distinct zzso for vitamin A zzso In this study we demonstrate that the most recently identified member of the zzso zzso shows similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties as zzso and zzso In contrast, however, zzso is unable to promote zzso signaling due to its inability to form zzso with zzso To begin to understand the zzso implications of these functional differences we used in zzso zzso to compare the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during different zzso zzso The receptors are expressed in both distinct and overlapping patterns, predominantly in the central nervous zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the prenatal zzso zzso in a region that gives rise to zzso zzso zzso is also expressed during embryonic development, and all three receptors show a complex distribution in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso in the adrenal zzso and zzso two zzso in which zzso has been suggested to be functionally zzso These data may indicate zzso between members of the zzso zzso and could explain why no zzso disturbances have yet been found in mice in which the zzso gene has been zzso
