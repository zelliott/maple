zzso zzso exposure contributes to zzso lung injury, and airway zzso is characterized by enhanced contraction and impaired relaxation of airway smooth zzso Our previous data demonstrate that zzso in rat zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production in airway smooth zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso B zzso signaling plays a functional role in airway zzso via zzso of zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso were exposed to zzso oxygen or room air for 7 days and administered daily zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to block zzso signaling or zzso zzso were removed for zzso measurement of zzso or for in zzso force measurement of lung zzso zzso zzso content doubled in zzso compared with room zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso restored zzso content to room air zzso zzso increased contraction and impaired relaxation of lung strips in response to incremental electrical field zzso zzso administration to zzso zzso reversed this increase in contraction and decrease in zzso zzso or zzso was used to block the effect of zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso blocked the effects of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso levels in lung zzso and blockade of zzso signaling restored zzso but not zzso to control zzso zzso zzso increase in activity of zzso zzso signaling appears to play a critical role in enhancing zzso zzso zzso responses of lung zzso
