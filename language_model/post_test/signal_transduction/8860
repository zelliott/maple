zzso is a regulatory zzso implicated in embryonic development and in zzso Among the zzso zzso is zzso a protein with dual function in zzso signaling and cell zzso Previously, we reported that zzso activity is required for zzso stability and we identified zzso zzso zzso as a major zzso zzso site in zzso However, it is not known whether zzso at zzso increases zzso stability and if so, what is the zzso In this study we investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso stabilization through zzso at zzso We found that zzso of zzso at zzso resulted in a stable activated form of zzso with decreased affinity for zzso in zzso This zzso zzso also displayed decreased regulation by zzso in zzso in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso Further analysis showed that zzso at zzso did not prevent zzso zzso by zzso Interestingly, we found that in the presence of zzso zzso and another activated form of zzso the recruitment of zzso to zzso is zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso by zzso may affect the stability of zzso through decreased binding to zzso In addition, the increased recruitment of zzso to the destruction complex in the presence of activated zzso zzso could be a feedback mechanism to suppress zzso zzso zzso
