zzso have in principle the capability to cut at the level of a single cell, the fundamental limit to minimally invasive procedures and restructuring biological zzso To date, this limit has not been achieved due to collateral damage on the zzso that arises from zzso and shock wave induced collateral damage of surrounding zzso Here, we report on a novel concept using a specifically designed zzso zzso zzso zzso that selectively zzso water molecules in the tissue to drive zzso or cutting process faster than zzso exchange of energy and shock wave zzso without plasma formation or zzso radiation zzso The targeted laser process zzso the least amount of energy in the remaining tissue without any of the deleterious zzso or zzso effects that accompanies other laser zzso and pulse zzso Full thickness zzso and zzso wounds were generated in zzso mice using the zzso zzso Laser, a conventional surgical laser zzso zzso or mechanical surgical zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso showed that the zzso laser produced minimal tissue zzso with less damage of surrounding zzso than wounds formed using the other zzso The zzso of scars formed by wounds made by the zzso laser were half that of the scars produced using either a conventional surgical laser or a zzso zzso blue zzso showed higher levels of collagen in the early stage of the wounds produced using the zzso laser, suggesting that these wounds mature zzso There were more viable cells extracted from skin using the zzso laser, suggesting less cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are activated during the zzso phase of wound healing, and whose level of zzso zzso with the size of wounds was lower in wounds generated by the zzso zzso zzso created with the zzso zzso also showed a lower rate of cell zzso zzso comparison of wound healing responses to a conventional surgical laser, and standard mechanical instruments shows far less damage and near absence of zzso formation by using zzso zzso This new laser source appears to have achieved the long held promise of zzso in minimally invasive zzso
