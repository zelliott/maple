The role of protein zzso C zzso in stimulus recognition and insulin zzso was investigated after long-term (24 zzso treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso Three methods revealed that zzso was no longer zzso and zzso insulin zzso was zzso Such zzso cells displayed enhanced insulin zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as to zzso and zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso by zzso zzso was also greater in zzso zzso zzso caused membrane zzso and raised the zzso zzso concentration zzso both of which were unaffected by zzso zzso Except for that caused by zzso the zzso zzso zzso were similar in control and zzso zzso The zzso rise evoked by zzso was enhanced during the early phase zzso both in cell suspensions and at the single cell zzso and the stimulation of zzso production was also zzso These findings suggest more efficient zzso of zzso C by zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used to test whether the release process is facilitated after long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with only slightly increased responsiveness to zzso (2 zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso At 2 zzso zzso caused zzso which was also zzso by zzso zzso The difference between intact and zzso cells could indicate the loss in the latter of soluble factors which mediate the enhanced zzso zzso However, changes in zzso zzso production could not explain the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso not only exerts zzso influences on the zzso of receptors to zzso C but also interferes with more zzso steps implicated in insulin zzso
