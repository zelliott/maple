The binding of zzso to zzso zzso receptors zzso expressed on the surface of mast cells and zzso zzso a cascade of signaling events that results in the release of a wide array of zzso zzso In order to limit the intensity and duration of cell zzso zzso zzso has been understood to additionally generate negative signals through the coordinated action of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among them, zzso family proteins zzso regulate zzso signals mainly by promoting zzso of the activated zzso zzso and associated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has become recognized as an important signal for the zzso and delivery of engaged zzso complexes to zzso for zzso The surface expression of activated zzso complexes is further zzso through a zzso that is functionally zzso from zzso zzso activity and is dependent on the interaction of zzso proteins with adapters involved in zzso zzso In this article, we review recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso mast cell and zzso zzso
