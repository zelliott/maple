zzso zzso of several zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso form abundant numbers of zzso both in the light and dark due to the regulation of zzso production by the A and B mating type zzso Nevertheless, little is known about whether and how the mating type zzso and light signal regulate the zzso in zzso zzso zzso the experimental results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso strain, the zzso whose zzso carry zzso in both the A and B zzso can produce only a few zzso in the dark, whereas the formation of numerous numbers of zzso is induced by the zzso The zzso zzso zzso but not zzso has the production and behavior of zzso formation similar to those of zzso These findings indicated that in zzso strain the zzso at the A locus results in repression of zzso in the dark and the blue light zzso this effect, whereas the zzso B genes function has no zzso zzso the zzso production relies on both A and light zzso it is possible that A locus might be linked to the blue light zzso zzso The present results demonstrated for the first time that the secondary zzso knot formation zzso zzso body maturation zzso and zzso formation zzso genes which are essential in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are not involved in the regulation of asexual zzso In addition, the positive light effect on zzso could also occur in zzso zzso zzso
