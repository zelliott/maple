In cow zzso zzso unlike in other zzso zzso zzso zzso regulators of protein zzso zzso may be distributed in zzso and on the cell zzso This study was designed to determine whether zzso and the protein zzso C system (the zzso and its zzso zzso are present in cow zzso zzso zzso and to examine the effect of zzso detected in zzso on protein zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the highly zzso nuclear zzso The nuclear zzso pattern was different from those of whole tissue and zzso thereby suggesting the presence of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso C and its zzso proteins zzso 97, 56, 43, 38, and 36 zzso were extracted by zzso zzso treatment of zzso Both protein zzso C activity zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso were effectively inhibited by the three zzso Of the zzso zzso was the most potent in zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso These results suggest that signal zzso zzso by protein zzso C in cow zzso zzso zzso may be regulated by zzso
