zzso and medical zzso investigations suggest that zzso foods exert cardiovascular health zzso zzso dysfunction, a zzso relevant key event in zzso is characterized by a decreased zzso of zzso oxide zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso We show in healthy male adults that the zzso of zzso zzso was associated with acute zzso in levels of circulating NO species, an enhanced zzso response of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso In addition, the zzso and the chemical profiles of circulating zzso zzso were determined, and zzso zzso analyses identified zzso and its zzso zzso as independent zzso of the vascular effects after zzso zzso zzso A mixture of zzso resembling the profile and concentration of circulating zzso compounds in plasma after zzso zzso induced a relaxation in zzso rabbit zzso rings ex zzso thus mimicking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation, as well as the in zzso increases in zzso were abolished by zzso of NO zzso zzso administration of chemically pure zzso to humans closely zzso acute vascular effects of zzso zzso Finally, the concept that a chronic intake of zzso diets is associated with zzso zzso NO synthesis is supported by data that indicate a correlation between the chronic consumption of a zzso zzso diet and the zzso urinary zzso of NO zzso zzso our data demonstrate that the human zzso of the zzso zzso is, at least in part, zzso linked to the reported vascular effects observed after the consumption of zzso zzso
