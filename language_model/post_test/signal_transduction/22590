Analysis of zzso heat shock protein 70 zzso concentration in zzso zzso and differentiated rat zzso zzso cells revealed a striking reduction in the amount of zzso in differentiated zzso zzso cells showed a significantly higher zzso zzso particularly zzso during S phase in zzso zzso The activity of the zzso signaling zzso was enhanced in differentiated zzso zzso treatments both inhibited growth and reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso the reduced zzso expression in differentiated cells and zzso zzso Treatment with an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso We assume that zzso does not directly inhibit zzso expression by zzso repression, but by its zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso
