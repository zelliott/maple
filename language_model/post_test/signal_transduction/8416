The expression of zzso a zzso regulator and tumor zzso gene in prostate cancer, is zzso during early stages of prostate zzso However, little is known of the zzso in gene expression that occur as a result of this zzso We combined laser capture zzso and gene expression profiling to zzso the molecular consequences of zzso loss during prostate cancer initiation using zzso zzso This analysis identified a cohort of genes zzso zzso that are zzso zzso during zzso tumor zzso We studied the expression of these genes in independent zzso and zzso zzso prostate zzso mouse zzso zzso expression is lost in prostate zzso proliferation in both of these mouse zzso However, zzso loss is an early event of tumor development in the zzso model, whereas it occurs at later stages in zzso transgenic zzso A number of genes of the zzso signature, such as zzso and zzso zzso are highly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that also lack zzso in the zzso zzso but not in similar zzso in the zzso transgenic zzso zzso of multiple prostate cancer gene expression data sets, including those from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso prostate cancer models, further confirmed that genes associated with the zzso signature integrate with zzso signaling zzso but do not overlap with molecular changes associated with the zzso signaling zzso In human prostate tissue samples, loss of zzso expression and corresponding zzso zzso are zzso at sites of zzso inflammatory zzso a possible very early stage of human prostate zzso zzso these results suggest that the molecular consequences of zzso loss depend on the zzso zzso stage at which its expression is lost, and that zzso in the zzso axis are important for prostate cancer zzso
