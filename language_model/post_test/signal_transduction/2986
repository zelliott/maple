zzso stem cells zzso are a population of precursor cells that posses the capacity for zzso and zzso zzso In the bone zzso zzso zzso warrant blood cell zzso but at the same time a stable pool of functional cells must be constantly zzso For this, zzso constitute a model in which zzso of zzso and active adult stem cells co-exist in the same zzso in specific zzso called stem-cell zzso These zzso keep the stem cells at zzso zzso zzso for its zzso and activate the stem cells zzso zzso for proliferation and/or injury repair, maintaining a dynamic balance between zzso and zzso zzso reside in the bone zzso but can be forces into the blood, a process termed zzso used clinically to harvest large number of cells for zzso At the same time, zzso to the zzso is necessary to zzso cell zzso Here, we zzso current understanding of zzso niche zzso and the zzso and pathological mechanisms that guide zzso zzso both within the zzso and to distant niches in the zzso zzso and zzso are mirror process depending on an interplay between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The interaction between zzso and its zzso zzso is critical to retain zzso within the bone zzso Current zzso strategies used in clinic, mainly zzso zzso are well tolerated but often produce zzso number of collected zzso Novel agents zzso stem cell factor, zzso are being developed to enhance the zzso to modify the signaling into the niche and boost the stem cell harvest, increasing the number of zzso available for the zzso
