Changes in gene expression produced by the application of zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso plants were compared with changes produced by the zzso structural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The maximum expression of many rapidly zzso genes occurred prior to peak hormone zzso suggesting negative feedback regulation that may be zzso by the induction of genes zzso zzso protein zzso For most rapidly zzso zzso expression was delayed in zzso analog treatments although zzso accumulated to higher levels than did zzso For each zzso some genes exhibited a hypersensitive response to the analog and some genes were less sensitive to the analog than to zzso Variations in the sensitivity of gene expression to zzso and zzso reflect the different structural requirements of two or more classes of hormone zzso By using zzso zzso to reveal and confirm zzso zzso zzso we estimate that zzso of zzso genes are zzso in aerial zzso zzso with the analog zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of new zzso zzso As an example, the zzso factor zzso was significantly induced by zzso but not by zzso and is shown to play a role in zzso signaling by zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso
