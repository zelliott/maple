zzso zzso zzso zzso is the best known for its involvement in immune zzso zzso zzso by binding of zzso tandem zzso 2 zzso to tandem zzso in zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso tails mediate zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors and many zzso zzso including zzso Recent data point to zzso binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso This zzso binding increases upon zzso zzso and zzso and zzso plays a prominent role in zzso zzso in response to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso also plays an important role in zzso zzso responses to minimally oxidized zzso zzso zzso which is a form of oxidized LDL relevant to development of human zzso Interestingly, zzso effects in zzso which occur via zzso are predominantly zzso zzso This zzso the role of the zzso branch of zzso zzso which mediates modest zzso release via zzso of zzso zzso and robust zzso oxygen species generation and zzso zzso The latter results in extensive membrane zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso and foam cell formation, a hallmark of zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso activity, such as zzso are in advanced clinical trials for zzso arthritis and other zzso diseases, understanding the role of zzso in zzso via zzso is of immediate zzso This zzso zzso seems to be particularly important in zzso zzso by zzso zzso molecular pattern zzso such as zzso relevant to development of zzso and other chronic inflammatory zzso
