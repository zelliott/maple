Members of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso including zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso are essential for the maintenance of tissue zzso and zzso after zzso We have observed that the zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso 

To investigate the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso signaling in pulmonary zzso 

Progressive zzso zzso in the mouse was used as a model of human zzso zzso and zzso expression and signaling activities were measured from zzso and human zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso induction was analyzed in cultured lung zzso zzso In addition, the possible therapeutic role of zzso zzso was tested by administration of zzso to mice after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were zzso in the zzso mouse zzso which is in agreement with the human zzso biopsy zzso zzso of zzso signaling was demonstrated by reduced levels of zzso and enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses of cultured human zzso zzso cells indicated that zzso zzso expression could be prevented by zzso of the zzso zzso and also by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced zzso contents in the zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso signaling balance is important for lung zzso events and is significantly zzso in pulmonary zzso zzso of zzso signaling activity may represent a potential beneficial strategy for treating human pulmonary zzso
