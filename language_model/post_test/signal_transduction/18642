zzso zzso zzso is known as one of causes of occupational asthma and hypersensitivity zzso To investigate the zzso effect on zzso zzso cells in response to zzso the authors examined production of zzso by the zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso serum zzso zzso zzso The production of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and regulated on zzso normal T cell expressed and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cells were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso prevented zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso did not augment release of zzso growth factor zzso zzso from zzso These results suggest that TDI directly zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso without an zzso zzso Thus, TDI was shown to have a zzso effect on zzso zzso cells, suggesting the potent role of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso
