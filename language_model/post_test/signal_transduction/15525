The mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso is widely used as an in zzso and in zzso model of zzso zzso Little comparative data exist on the molecular and zzso responses of this cell line relative to human cell zzso We compared the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso cell line relative to responses previously observed in the human zzso zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso end points in zzso cells after zzso zzso exposure were signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression zzso and zzso zzso zzso and gene expression profiling at 6 zzso zzso response end points were direct zzso using dye zzso viability on zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and cell cycle zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso were activated in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso Gene expression profiles showed an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased cell viability and induced zzso cell cycle zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso induced zzso independent cell death while simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to zzso zzso Cell death was associated with release of the zzso cell death marker zzso zzso cells expressed zzso receptors and activated zzso zzso signaling pathways in response to zzso zzso 

zzso cells show molecular and zzso responses to zzso zzso that replicate those observed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells appear to be an excellent model in which to study zzso zzso as an zzso agent for zzso zzso
