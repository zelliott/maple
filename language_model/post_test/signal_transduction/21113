zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso which plays a central role in the development of zzso and zzso loss of function and dominant negative zzso in zzso beta lead to zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso We now provide evidence that zzso activates downstream components of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso Our data indicate that this zzso of the zzso zzso is a consequence of zzso of zzso beta by zzso Using a novel zzso for zzso beta in zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso beta from species as diverse as zzso zzso and zzso zzso providing a zzso mechanism for the action of zzso on the development of these zzso zzso treatment also leads to zzso of an zzso reporter in zzso zzso consistent with previous observations that zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a dominant negative form of zzso beta is inhibited by zzso similar to the previously described effect of zzso zzso with zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso both dominant negative zzso beta and zzso remains zzso
