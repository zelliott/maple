zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in both DNA repair and zzso zzso making it an attractive emerging therapeutic zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso inflammatory responses is largely zzso In this study, we report that zzso is a key upstream regulator in zzso zzso inflammatory zzso We found that nuclear expression of zzso in zzso layers was markedly zzso in zzso zzso zzso was essential for the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and zzso both of which are crucial for inflammatory signaling in zzso Moreover, zzso played a crucial role in the expression of zzso inflammatory zzso including zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and human primary zzso zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso 4 expression and zzso of zzso and zzso thereby affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species contributed to the nuclear zzso and expression of zzso suggesting an zzso circuit in which the zzso zzso of zzso is associated with the production of zzso per zzso through zzso oxygen zzso zzso Taken together, these findings establish a role for zzso as a master regulator of zzso inflammatory responses in human zzso
