During embryonic development zzso zzso occurs in two waves by producing first primitive zzso cells zzso and then definitive zzso cells zzso zzso zzso signaling is compared between zzso and zzso 

We studied the EPO signaling in zzso and zzso using an embryonic zzso culture system, which can zzso this in zzso development process and has thus been used as a convenient in zzso model system of zzso 

We found that EPO induced sustained zzso and nuclear zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso expressed dramatically higher amounts of EPO zzso compared with zzso indicating there was excessive signaling from the zzso upon EPO zzso In addition, reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso region 2 zzso zzso and decreased total zzso activity in zzso partly explain the persistent zzso of zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso which is essential for zzso of EPO signaling from the EPO zzso to zzso was observed in a transient but not a persistent zzso zzso of zzso activity resulted in partial suppression of transient zzso of zzso and no suppression of sustained zzso of zzso 

This study presents a unique feature of zzso as this is the first known example of sustained zzso of zzso in normal zzso Our results also imply the existence of a zzso zzso of EPO signaling to induce zzso zzso
