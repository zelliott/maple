zzso and acute exposure to zzso is associated with increased risks of various damages to zzso In the present study, zzso strip experiment was employed to investigate zzso guard cells zzso and the signal regulation in zzso zzso The results showed that with the increase of treatment concentrate of zzso zzso (a mixture of sodium zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the guard cells declined and cell death zzso While the concentration of zzso derivatives exceeded zzso zzso zzso the percentage of cell death increased significantly zzso Typical features of zzso including nuclear zzso nuclear zzso fragmentation zzso were zzso Meanwhile, zzso presence of zzso oxide zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso level zzso zzso However, zzso cell death can be effectively blocked by either of the following substances with their respective optimal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 200 U zzso zzso oxide zzso scavenger zzso 4, 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso or plasma membrane zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to a significant decrease in cell death rate, a reduction in the levels of zzso oxygen species zzso NO and zzso was zzso Further study showed that compared to treatment with zzso alone, zzso treatment led to a decrease in NO and zzso levels and zzso treatment led to a decrease in zzso and zzso levels, but the NO and zzso levels of the zzso treatment changed zzso All results suggested that zzso zzso and zzso were involved in the zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso The process might be related to the burst of NO or zzso which would activate the plasma zzso channel and result in the increase of zzso zzso
