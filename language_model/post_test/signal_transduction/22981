The Sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to play an important role in zzso tooth zzso We describe the spatial and zzso expression of genes in this zzso during early tooth development and interpret these patterns in terms of the likely roles of zzso zzso We show that the two putative receptors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in different cells, suggesting zzso may function in different ways as an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been zzso in other zzso to stimulate cell zzso In this paper we zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and propose a mechanism as to how zzso may regulate cell proliferation in tooth zzso
