Plants of the zzso zzso constitute one of the common components of Eastern as well as traditional American medicine against various human diseases, including zzso In this study, we examined the in zzso zzso activity of a leaf extract of zzso zzso zzso while also exploring their potential molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso administration of zzso extract delayed the growth of zzso zzso in zzso rats, both in zzso and subcutaneous tumor zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the subcutaneous tumors following treatment with zzso The zzso extract as well as the constituent zzso zzso also showed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell cultures in zzso as determined by western zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also significantly inhibited the in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells, indicating the key role of these signaling molecules in the growth of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso active zzso of zzso zzso however, did not significantly reverse zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso zzso either directly inhibited zzso zzso activity or acted downstream of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso extract or zzso could indeed bind to zzso and inhibit its zzso zzso This study provides the first in zzso evidence and zzso support for zzso activity of zzso zzso and has implications in potential usage of zzso zzso in zzso therapy for zzso tumors, including zzso
