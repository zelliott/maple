zzso levels of the zzso zzso of zzso protein cause spinal muscular zzso the main form of zzso disease in children and young zzso In cultured zzso reduced zzso levels lead to disturbed zzso growth that zzso with reduced zzso zzso and protein in growth cones, indicating that zzso transport and local translation of zzso zzso are altered in this zzso However, it is not fully understood how local translation of the zzso zzso is regulated in zzso zzso Here, we established a zzso zzso reporter construct to monitor local translation of zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso recovery after zzso zzso in living zzso revealed that zzso is locally translated in the growth cones of embryonic zzso Interestingly, local translation of the zzso reporter construct was zzso regulated by various zzso zzso indicating that zzso provide zzso cues for the regulation of local translation in growth zzso zzso local translation of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso from a mouse model for the most severe form of zzso zzso Taken together our findings suggest that local translation of zzso in growth cones of zzso is regulated by zzso zzso and that this zzso is disturbed in zzso
