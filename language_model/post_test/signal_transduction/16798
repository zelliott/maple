We examine whether complement factor zzso or zzso is zzso by human zzso mast cells and whether their synthesis is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso and proteins by flow zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were each zzso and baseline protein zzso cultured mast cells were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and located in the zzso outside of zzso zzso zzso accumulated in mast cell culture medium over time and by 3 d reached a concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso levels were not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mast cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not affect zzso protein levels in culture zzso whereas zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso enhanced levels of zzso zzso to zzso In contrast with zzso levels of zzso remained zzso zzso treatment with zzso together with either zzso or zzso zzso enhanced zzso (but not zzso production in culture medium by zzso or zzso zzso This zzso was blocked by attenuating the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso soluble zzso or an inhibitor of zzso or by attenuating the zzso zzso with zzso family or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect this zzso Thus, human mast cells can produce and zzso zzso whereas zzso can act on zzso to generate zzso and zzso raising the likelihood that mast cells engage complement to zzso immunity and inflammation in zzso
