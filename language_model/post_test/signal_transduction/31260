A zzso feature of aging is skeletal muscle zzso It is characterized by a loss of muscle mass and zzso zzso loss of muscle mass occurs through a reduction in the rate of protein zzso an increase in protein degradation or a combination of zzso However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso contributes to this phenomenon, we studied zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso muscle of aged zzso These two zzso zzso are considered as sensitive markers of muscle protein degradation by the zzso zzso Our results revealed that, in skeletal muscle of aged rats, the decline in muscle mass is accompanied by an increase in the level of oxidized proteins and zzso zzso zzso whereas the functionality of the zzso remains constant compared to young zzso Furthermore, the level of both zzso and zzso zzso is markedly zzso in aged muscle zzso zzso and zzso Taken together these data argue for the involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso muscle, in particular through increased expression of zzso and zzso Moreover, we observed a decrease in the zzso zzso pathways and elevated level of zzso zzso in aged rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent potential zzso implicated in the regulation of zzso and zzso genes during zzso
