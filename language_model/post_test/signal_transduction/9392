In obesity and type 2 diabetes, efficient skeletal muscle repair following injury may be required, not only for restoring muscle structure and function, but also for maintaining exercise capacity and insulin zzso The hypothesis of this study was that muscle zzso would be impaired in zzso and zzso mice, which are common mouse models of obesity and type 2 zzso Muscle injury was produced by zzso injection, and zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso zzso Muscle zzso was delayed in zzso and zzso mice, but not in a less severe model of insulin resistance - feeding a high-fat diet to zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso were also impaired in zzso and zzso mice, but not the high-fat diet zzso The zzso in muscle zzso were associated with impaired zzso zzso zzso have been shown previously to be required for efficient muscle zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso mice could be due partly to the lack of zzso zzso since zzso is expressed both in damaged muscle and in cultured muscle zzso In zzso impaired muscle zzso in zzso and zzso mice was associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity, and could have implications for insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle of obese and type 2 diabetic zzso
