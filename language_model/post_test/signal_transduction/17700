In this study, we demonstrated that a snake zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of binding to zzso receptors of the cultured primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We labeled zzso with fluorescent zzso zzso and showed that the binding of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the binding of zzso was also reduced by zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso produced a very potent zzso effect on mature zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso but was less effective in immature zzso We explored the signaling zzso of zzso death and found that it was apparently due to the excessive production of zzso oxygen species zzso induced by zzso zzso and antioxidants zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso attenuated not only zzso production but also zzso The downstream signaling of zzso was identified as the zzso of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and antioxidants depressed both zzso zzso and zzso Based on these findings and our previous reports, we conclude that the binding and zzso of zzso receptors by zzso was crucial step to produce the potent zzso zzso The binding of zzso receptors resulted in excessive zzso influx, followed by zzso production and zzso of zzso This snake toxin is considered not only to be a useful tool for exploring the zzso zzso of zzso but also provides a model for searching zzso zzso
