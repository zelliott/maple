The induction of action zzso in airway sensory nerves relies on events leading to the opening of zzso channels in the nerve terminal membrane and subsequent membrane zzso If the membrane zzso is of sufficient rate and zzso action potential initiation will zzso The action zzso are then conducted to the central nervous system, leading to the initiation of various sensations and zzso zzso zzso events in airway sensory nerves include mechanical zzso inflammatory zzso zzso temperature, and zzso acting through a variety of zzso and zzso zzso Action potential initiation can be modulated zzso or zzso through independent mechanisms caused mainly by zzso and other zzso zzso zzso Finally, gene expression of sensory nerves can be altered in adult zzso This zzso can change the function of sensory nerves and likely involve both zzso and zzso zzso Here we provide a brief overview of some of the zzso mechanisms underlying these zzso
