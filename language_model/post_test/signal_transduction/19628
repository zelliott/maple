zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that zzso regulate gene expression at the zzso and/or zzso level by binding loosely complimentary sequences in the zzso regions zzso of target zzso Increased expressions of several zzso specifically zzso have been reported to zzso zzso zzso Here we report zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso by administration of zzso mimics zzso reversed the biology of each of the three cell lines, zzso cell growth, inducing zzso phase arrest and increasing cell zzso Further, treatment with zzso mimics zzso diminished the invasive capacity of these cells, as the number of cells invading through zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression zzso and zzso expression increased in a zzso manner with zzso mimics zzso Taken together, these studies reveal zzso impacts zzso cell zzso invasion and zzso perhaps via regulation of the zzso signaling zzso We propose an essential role for zzso as a zzso of human zzso
