zzso acid zzso found in zzso has been reported to have zzso and zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that CA protects against zzso in zzso zzso In the present report, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which CA zzso lipids zzso both in zzso and in zzso 

In the in zzso study, zzso mice were fed a standard zzso diet with or without CA for 5 weeks, then their zzso zzso zzso was zzso The serum zzso of zzso the levels of zzso regulatory zzso and the zzso zzso and signaling molecules were also zzso In the in zzso study, zzso cells were used to further clarify the effects of CA on cellular zzso zzso and to confirm the signaling pathways involved in these zzso 

CA significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso This effect was associated with zzso levels of zzso zzso reduced expression of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso which regulate zzso zzso were activated in mice fed the CA zzso CA inhibited zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso with either the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso abolished the effects of CA on cellular zzso zzso and decreased both the protein expression and activity of zzso 

zzso signaling plays an important role in the zzso effect of CA on zzso zzso zzso
