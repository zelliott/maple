The zzso signaling zzso plays a fundamental role during blood vessel zzso zzso signaling regulates blood vessel zzso by promoting zzso zzso differentiation and providing spatial and zzso control over zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso have emerged as potential regulators of zzso development, joining the increasing examples of blood vessel regulators that are also involved in zzso zzso However, in zzso a role for the zzso signaling zzso during zzso development remains to be zzso In this report, we show that blockade of zzso and zzso with specific zzso zzso results in defective zzso zzso development in zzso zzso zzso blockade is associated with zzso of zzso zzso been shown to be critically involved in zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso zzso In addition, zzso blockade leads to compromised expression of distinct zzso markers and to zzso of collecting zzso vessels with reduced and zzso mural cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso wound closure and severely affects zzso during the wound healing in adult mouse zzso Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time in a zzso system that zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso zzso development and zzso zzso
