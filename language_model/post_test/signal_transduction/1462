zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in several zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso by catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso G protein of the zzso zzso This reaction is enhanced by another zzso zzso protein termed zzso factor or zzso that was zzso from bovine brain zzso zzso zzso Kahn and zzso zzso zzso Journal of Biological zzso zzso zzso zzso It was recently found that this zzso also increases the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso We have zzso and characterized two soluble proteins from bovine brain that act in a similar fashion to enhance zzso activity in each of these zzso The membrane and soluble factors are all proteins of approximately 19 zzso that require zzso or zzso zzso for activity and are zzso by the zzso The zzso proteins apparently interact directly with zzso in a zzso fashion to increase its zzso activity and thus are part of a G protein cascade through which the toxin activates zzso zzso The zzso function of the zzso zzso as well as their possible relationships to the zzso zzso products and/or the family of G proteins that includes zzso zzso remains to be zzso
