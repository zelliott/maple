The human zzso zzso and collagen zzso gene encodes three protein zzso of 46, 52, and 66 zzso that belong to a family of molecular adapters involved in several signal zzso zzso Recently, the zzso zzso has been shown to play a central role in controlling zzso oxygen species metabolism and life span in zzso Despite the large amount of information available on the biology and zzso of zzso zzso very little is known regarding the regulation of their zzso zzso Here we demonstrate the specific and selective zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso Through deletion mapping experiments, we show that targeting of zzso to zzso is zzso by its first 32 zzso zzso which behave as a bona fide zzso targeting zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso location of the signal zzso is critical for its zzso This accounts for the observation that zzso and zzso containing the same sequence but more internally located, display a remarkably different zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may exert a zzso biological function in signal zzso pathways involving zzso
