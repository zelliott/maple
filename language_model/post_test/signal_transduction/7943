A better understanding of tumor zzso requires development of animal models that authentically reproduce the zzso zzso By zzso an existing mouse model of breast cancer, we discovered that zzso protein promoted breast tumor growth and zzso to several zzso A special feature of our findings was the occurrence of zzso bone zzso which are prominent in human breast zzso To explore the clinical relevance of our model, we examined expression levels of three genes involved in zzso of the MSP signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human breast zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was a strong independent indicator of both zzso and death in human breast cancer patients and significantly increased the accuracy of an existing gene expression signature for poor zzso These data suggest that signaling initiated by MSP is an important contributor to zzso of breast cancer and introduce an independent zzso for assessing the prognosis of humans with breast zzso
