A great body of experimental evidence collected over many years indicates that calcium has a central role in a variety of zzso zzso In particular, calcium zzso in synaptic zzso a zzso process presumably correlated with cognitive brain functions such as learning and zzso In contrast, only recently, evidence has begun to emerge supporting a zzso role of zzso oxygen zzso and nitrogen zzso species in synaptic zzso This subject will be the central topic of this zzso The authors also present recent results showing that, in zzso zzso zzso including zzso generated by iron through the Fenton reaction, stimulate zzso zzso calcium release, and how the resulting calcium signals activate the signaling zzso that lead to the zzso of genes known to participate in synaptic zzso They discuss the possible participation of zzso receptors jointly zzso by calcium and zzso in the normal signaling zzso needed for synaptic zzso and how too much zzso production may contribute to zzso via excessive calcium zzso In addition, the dual role of iron as a necessary, but potentially toxic, element for normal zzso function is zzso
