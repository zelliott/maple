The zzso protein of zzso zzso is a zzso oxygen sensor responsible for initiating regulation of zzso of genes zzso proteins involved in nitrogen fixation and zzso zzso It consists of an zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain whose zzso activity depends on the zzso state of the zzso To investigate the molecular basis for this dependence and the dynamics associated with conversion between zzso and zzso states, we have conducted zzso zzso zzso studies of CO zzso in zzso zzso difference zzso maps from 1 zzso to 10 zzso after zzso of the zzso bond show movement of the side chain of zzso and the H and I zzso into the zzso binding pocket formerly occupied by zzso zzso zzso changes are evident in the zzso driven by relaxation of zzso interactions between the bound zzso and zzso acid side chains and/or changes in zzso zzso These structural changes fully reverse as CO zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of CO zzso zzso in zzso zzso relate the behavior of zzso zzso to solution and provide a framework for our zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso difference zzso maps by singular value decomposition reveals that only one significant singular value accounts for the zzso Thus only two structural states are present, the zzso and the zzso zzso The first left singular zzso represents the difference in density between these two states and shows features common to difference maps calculated from the zzso CO and zzso zzso The first right singular zzso represents the time course of this difference density and agrees well with the CO zzso zzso measured zzso We refine the structure of the zzso state present in the zzso time range and find that it does not differ significantly in zzso from static, zzso zzso Thus, structural relaxation from zzso to zzso zzso is complete in less than 1 zzso
