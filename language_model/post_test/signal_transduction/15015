The zzso zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is important for adaptation and growth of zzso zzso in the mouse brain, where oxygen concentration and nutritional conditions are zzso for zzso zzso The extent of conservation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso or in any other zzso however, has not been zzso We generated zzso susceptible to low oxygen and identified six genes that play a role in the zzso zzso Three of these genes zzso zzso and zzso are not known to be involved in the zzso zzso in other zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso contains an additional zzso zzso which functions in the zzso zzso but is yet to be zzso zzso associated with the steps prior to formation of the nuclear zzso form dramatically reduced zzso of the nuclear form under zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the previously isolated zzso strain showed reduction in zzso levels, hypersensitivity to several chemical agents, including zzso zzso zzso and compounds producing zzso oxygen or nitrogen species, and most importantly, reduced zzso in zzso zzso affecting genes involved in later steps of the zzso pathway, such as those required for import and zzso of proteins in the nucleus, showed less compelling zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso zzso and it serves as an important link between zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso in zzso zzso
