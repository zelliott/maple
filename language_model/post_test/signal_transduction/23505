The zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso has been reported to be a zzso gene in cultured zzso implicating an important role of zzso in the zzso of zzso fatty liver disease zzso zzso expression is known to be regulated by a variety of zzso factors, including zzso hormone zzso zzso X zzso and zzso zzso zzso Emerging in zzso evidence also points to a critical role of liver X zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, we showed that zzso was zzso in zzso of zzso mice and zzso mice, two models of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso with enhanced zzso in zzso of zzso mice, whereas zzso zzso gene zzso attenuated the fatty liver zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly enhanced zzso zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso zzso expression and activity in zzso mice, but failed to induce zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed four zzso zzso elements and one zzso regulatory element zzso site within a zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso failed to zzso whereas zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso promoter zzso Moreover, deletion of the zzso site completely abolished zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso gene in the liver that is induced by the zzso zzso through an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
