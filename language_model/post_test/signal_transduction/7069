The mouse zzso consists of six functional zzso genes of which the expression patterns are temporally and zzso regulated during development and in the adult zzso zzso of zzso in mouse is lethal during embryonic development, although there is zzso expression of other zzso zzso This suggests different zzso specific functions and, more in particular, an important function for zzso during early zzso zzso We here report a role for zzso during neural crest zzso Although zzso zzso neural crest cells show expression of neural crest zzso less cells zzso and their migration arrests shortly zzso These zzso were associated with elevated zzso levels in neural crest cells, whereas proliferation levels were zzso zzso the zzso neural crest cells displayed higher levels of zzso suggesting increased zzso in the neural tube accounts for the decreased amount of zzso neural crest cells seen in the zzso zzso zzso These cells additionally displayed a lack of membrane bound zzso and dramatic decrease in zzso expression which was more pronounced in the zzso neural crest population, potentially indicating linkage between the zzso expression and zzso By zzso ROCK ex zzso the knockout neural crest cells regained migratory capacity and zzso expression was zzso We conclude that the presence of zzso is vital for survival, specifically of zzso neural crest cells, their proper zzso from the neural tube and their subsequent zzso Furthermore, the absence of zzso affects zzso and zzso function, which could partly be alleviated by ROCK zzso zzso the zzso signaling in a feedback loop with zzso
