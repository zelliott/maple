zzso zzso zzso is a zzso strategy of animal behavior in which zzso rate increases when population density is zzso zzso zzso shows positive zzso to a set of zzso but the zzso switches from attraction to zzso after prolonged exposure to the zzso We show here that this plasticity of zzso behavior is dependent on population density and that this regulation is zzso by zzso zzso We show that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso plasticity and that its expression is zzso by the zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this function is essential for zzso zzso These results suggest that population density information is transmitted through the external zzso and zzso zzso signaling to zzso zzso zzso
