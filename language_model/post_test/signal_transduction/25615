zzso response to lung injury depends on development of a zzso population of zzso The importance of resident zzso zzso and role of transforming growth factor zzso zzso in this process is zzso 

To define the importance of zzso signaling in resident lung zzso in the development of experimental pulmonary zzso 

A compound genetic strategy in which mice zzso for a zzso zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso were crossed with a transgenic strain harboring a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso was deleted by zzso administration of tamoxifen over 5 days to compound zzso mice with appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso gene profiling and quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction were used to confirm zzso to zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso lung injury was used to induce lung fibrosis, which was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to define cell populations after lung zzso 

There was significant zzso of zzso in mice after deletion of zzso in resident zzso At 7 days after injury the number of zzso and zzso was substantially zzso Potential regulators of zzso were suggested by gene expression profiles that identified key candidate zzso zzso including zzso tissue growth factor and zzso expressed by zzso but not zzso lung zzso 

zzso zzso signaling in resident pulmonary zzso is essential for pulmonary zzso to zzso Our data support a key regulatory role of these cells in determining zzso recruitment and zzso zzso
