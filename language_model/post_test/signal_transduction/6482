In the present work, the expression patterns of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family were characterized in the developing mouse zzso In zzso zzso on sections from zzso zzso showed an expression of zzso in the zzso and zzso in the cortical hem and zzso At later zzso stages zzso zzso and zzso little or no expression of zzso zzso and zzso was found in the zzso while zzso expression was detected in the zzso zone zzso of the lateral and III zzso cortical zzso zzso cells of the primary and secondary zzso migration, and the zzso layer of the zzso In the adult zzso zzso expression was detected in the lateral zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and cortical zzso We also provide evidence indicating that only zzso and zzso along with two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso are involved in a feedback mechanism to restrain zzso zzso in transgenic mice carrying a conditional zzso of zzso in the zzso
