zzso generated acid is the major zzso stimulus for increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso which leads to a decrease in zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso zzso is increased in zzso by acid zzso and in zzso by an zzso pH zzso In zzso kidney cells the acid zzso effect and the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate zzso activity are both blocked by the zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso Acid feeding had no effect on brush border membrane zzso activity in mice in which zzso zzso expression was knocked out, whereas a zzso effect was found in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso tail truncated zzso zzso stimulation of zzso required a zzso zzso tail from either zzso or zzso The zzso effect was greatest when either the zzso zzso domain and zzso tail were present or the zzso zzso tail was linked to the zzso zzso zzso This effect was smaller when the zzso zzso domain was linked to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso activity requires a functional zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso as does acid stimulation of zzso zzso Since increased zzso and zzso activities constitute part of the zzso zzso adaptation to an acid load, these studies indicate that there are similarities in the signaling zzso zzso these zzso
