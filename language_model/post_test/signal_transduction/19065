zzso is a dynamic feature of the tumor zzso that contributes to cancer zzso In order to adapt and overcome hypoxic stress, tumor cells activate survival pathways that attempt to couple zzso processes to reduced energy availability due to oxygen zzso While the zzso factors zzso and zzso are critical to the cellular response to zzso zzso processes are known to contribute to this zzso Recent evidence demonstrates that zzso activates components of the zzso zzso Response zzso a coordinated program that regulates cellular adaptation to increased levels of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Here we review the evidence implicating the zzso zzso zzso its downstream target translation initiation factor zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso in this zzso Not only are cells with compromised zzso signaling more sensitive to hypoxic stress in zzso but they also form tumors that grow slower in zzso with smaller hypoxic areas, indicating that the zzso zzso zzso a survival advantage for tumor cells under zzso These results, together with evidence for an involvement of other zzso pathways and zzso stress proteins in zzso tolerance and tumor zzso point to a central role for zzso zzso in tumor progression and suggest that this response may offer an attractive target for new zzso zzso
