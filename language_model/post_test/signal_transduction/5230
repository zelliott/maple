zzso zzso is a widely used zzso zzso The clinical application of the medication is limited by its side effect which can elicit zzso zzso and cardiac zzso However, the underlying mechanism by which zzso causes zzso zzso is not zzso The aim of present study is to investigate the role of zzso group box 1 zzso in zzso zzso injury, and signal zzso involved in regulation of zzso expression in zzso with zzso We found treatment of isolated zzso and zzso mice with the zzso resulted in an increased zzso expression which was associated with increased zzso cell zzso zzso zzso or genetic blockade zzso zzso zzso of zzso attenuated the zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso In addition, our study showed that zzso resulted in an zzso in the generation of zzso zzso and an zzso in zzso of zzso N terminal zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso a zzso decomposition zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso zzso or pharmacological zzso zzso of zzso ameliorated the zzso zzso expression and diminished zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso mediates the zzso injury induced by zzso and zzso is a key regulatory zzso of zzso zzso expression induced by zzso
