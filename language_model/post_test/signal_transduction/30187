zzso is an essential zzso factor for zzso differentiation from early commitment step to final zzso Based on its crucial role in zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso protein implies more valuable information for zzso differentiation than any other zzso such as zzso zzso or protein zzso Thus, a sensitive, specific, and consistent method to determine the zzso zzso activity has long been zzso Here we suggest a stable cell line that carries zzso reporter zzso would be a good evaluation system to determine biological zzso zzso zzso The proliferation rate, cell shape, and the zzso differentiation potential of the cloned cell line were similar to those of parental zzso zzso zzso The cells specifically responded to zzso modulating agent such as zzso The stable cell line responded 5-6 folds more sensitively than the zzso zzso cells with zzso Though zzso of any zzso gene zzso the zzso activity, zzso enhanced the reporter activity the zzso zzso the zzso stable cells would be a good biological evaluation system to assess the activity of zzso zzso modulating zzso as well as the signal zzso pathways involved in the zzso
