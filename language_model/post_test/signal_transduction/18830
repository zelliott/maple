The zzso central nervous system is organized by a variety of cells, such as zzso and zzso cells, that are generated from a common zzso the neural stem cell zzso zzso are defined as zzso neural cells that are characterized by their high zzso potential while retaining the capacity for zzso and zzso zzso and their progeny may be distinguished by the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso carried by zzso are mainly localized on the plasma membrane surface of the cells and they serve as excellent zzso for various stages of cellular zzso Thus, they have been zzso as zzso for sorting zzso or their progeny by cell zzso zzso have been established for utilizing zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso and zzso for cell zzso Furthermore, zzso have also been suggested to have a wide range of zzso and signaling functions in zzso For example, basic zzso growth factor, an important zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso C for zzso zzso zzso which regulates a wide variety of zzso processes in various cells including zzso is modulated by the zzso zzso zzso In peripheral nervous system zzso the human natural zzso zzso zzso regulates the migration of neural crest cells, cell populations containing the stem zzso Thus, zzso serve not only as marker zzso but also as functional molecules as zzso In the present review, we discuss the expression pattern and possible functions of zzso in zzso
