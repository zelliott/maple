zzso necrosis zzso zzso has been shown to induce the expression of zzso molecules in airway resident cells and contribute to inflammatory zzso Here, the roles of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso in zzso expression of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso were investigated in human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso expression of zzso protein and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was significantly blocked by a selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the nucleus and degradation of zzso was blocked by zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso promoter activity was enhanced by zzso in zzso zzso with zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most surprisingly, zzso expression was also significantly blocked by a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso were associated with the zzso promoter, which was zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso enhancement of zzso expression increased the zzso of zzso cells zzso to zzso of zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso zzso or zzso These results suggest that in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso
