zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor that contains a winged zzso DNA binding zzso Both the gene and overlapping zzso zzso this factor have been cloned and completely zzso We have mapped the start of zzso by primer extension to a site 600 base pairs zzso to the start of zzso zzso is transcribed in one open reading frame that contains the DNA binding domain, nuclear zzso signal and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence encodes a zzso zzso protein with a zzso of zzso zzso of the DNA binding domain with other zzso zzso reveal that this gene falls into Class II of the winged zzso zzso zzso We have identified a unique zzso motif of unknown function that is present in all winged zzso Class II zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the DNA binding zzso shows that, within the Class II, zzso groups with the zzso as opposed to the zzso Analysis of the sequence zzso to the start of translation revealed binding sites for a large number of different zzso factors, many of which are present in multiple zzso The constellation of binding sites in the zzso region indicates that zzso is regulated by a complex set of factors, some of which are known to be zzso zzso Included among these are binding sites for factors downstream of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso implicating these pathways in both regulation of zzso and zzso of zzso
