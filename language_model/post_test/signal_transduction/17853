zzso signaling zzso by the zzso zzso beta zzso has potential implications in normal and abnormal prostate zzso Few studies have addressed this issue in human prostate tissue leaving conflicting results on the zzso of the zzso in benign and zzso zzso 

Using a new zzso zzso the current study reports on the differential expression of the zzso in tissue sections from 132 patients with prostate zzso 

The zzso zzso expressed the zzso extensively in zzso zzso cell types and at lower levels in zzso zzso zzso changes of the peripheral zone zzso were more zzso than zzso zzso of the transition zone zzso When compared with zzso tissue of the zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed decreased levels of the zzso in 30 of 47 cases and was zzso in six zzso In zzso cases with suitable internal controls, all primary tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso 5) expressed the zzso at variable zzso No correlation was found between the zzso status, the primary zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and the pathological stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed markedly decreased levels in 15 of 40 cases and was zzso negative in five zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is a major target of zzso zzso signaling in the human zzso Its zzso in zzso is consistent with zzso effects that the zzso may exert on the zzso zzso The continuous expression of the zzso protein at significant levels in zzso primary and zzso zzso indicates that these tumors can use zzso through an zzso zzso The partial loss of the zzso in zzso tumors after zzso may reflect the zzso of zzso gene expression in human prostate zzso
