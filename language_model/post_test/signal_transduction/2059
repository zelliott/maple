NO is related to the pathological condition acute zzso failure, in which we previously observed that the level of soluble zzso in urine was zzso In this study the role of NO in the shedding of the zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The NO donors sodium zzso zzso and zzso rapidly inhibited the release of zzso from zzso kidney zzso zzso The zzso of NO zzso zzso also inhibited the release of zzso and this effect was reversed by the NO zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso raised against zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso formed on zzso C zzso of the zzso anchor demonstrated that zzso zzso its zzso effect on the release of zzso via a zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or reducing agent zzso did not affect zzso zzso of the release of zzso Exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect in the presence of a low concentration of zzso and the effect was completely reversed by zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso zzso involving zzso which is produced by NO zzso following zzso of a zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso that zzso and releases zzso zzso this indicates a role for NO as an zzso regulator of the shedding of the zzso zzso in acute zzso zzso
