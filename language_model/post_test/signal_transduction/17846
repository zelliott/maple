zzso react to microbial pathogens by mounting a defensive response that includes the production of zzso zzso In this study, we show that, in human zzso cultures, zzso coli zzso was a very weak direct zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso but the induction was greatly amplified when zzso cells zzso acted as intermediaries between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso largely reversed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso indicating that, from among the many products of zzso zzso was the dominant zzso of zzso zzso In normal fresh human skin, which contains zzso cells and other zzso cell types, in addition to zzso zzso also induced zzso in an zzso zzso In DNA zzso expression studies, zzso was one of the most abundant zzso induced in zzso by zzso zzso and its induction was reversed by zzso Thus, zzso response to zzso is zzso amplified by zzso through zzso zzso leading to a selective increase in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso This pattern of responses establishes a key role for both zzso and zzso in the host defense reaction of the zzso
