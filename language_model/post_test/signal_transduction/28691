The rapid induction of alpha zzso zzso and zzso expression plays a critical role in the innate immune response against viral zzso We studied the effects of transforming growth factor beta zzso and its zzso zzso the zzso on the function of zzso an essential zzso factor for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso but not zzso cooperated with zzso to activate zzso zzso This zzso cooperation occurred at the zzso sequences in the zzso promoter, and zzso interference with zzso zzso signaling and zzso function decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, elimination of zzso expression in zzso zzso delayed and decreased zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso whereas restoration of zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted from the regulation of the zzso activity of zzso by zzso and zzso interference with zzso function decreased zzso zzso zzso with the regulation by zzso the zzso activity of zzso depended on and was regulated by zzso zzso Our studies underscore a role of zzso signaling in zzso induction of zzso zzso
