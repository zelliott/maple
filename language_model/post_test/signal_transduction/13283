The effects of zzso zzso zzso on human and mouse skeletal muscle zzso in primary culture were zzso zzso changes in zzso calcium concentration zzso were measured and compared with those induced by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso was effective on both zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso range, zzso failed to induce any change in zzso at early stages of zzso In contrast, zzso with peripheral zzso showed little response to zzso but responded to zzso with a large change in zzso The responsiveness of the zzso to zzso paralleled that to zzso The removal of external calcium abolished the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso with the order of potency being zzso zzso Under zzso conditions zzso induced an inward current that showed little zzso These results are consistent with the existence of zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in cultured zzso skeletal muscle zzso
