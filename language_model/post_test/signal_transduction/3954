The C2 domain is a zzso zzso motif originally discovered in protein zzso C and recently identified in numerous zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso signals recruit the C2 domain of zzso to cellular zzso where the zzso domain zzso specific lipids to release zzso acid, thereby initiating the inflammatory zzso zzso binding and zzso kinetic experiments reveal that the C2 domain of human zzso binds two zzso zzso with positive zzso yielding a zzso change and membrane zzso When zzso is removed, the two zzso zzso zzso rapidly and virtually simultaneously from the isolated domain in zzso In contrast, the zzso sites become zzso in the zzso complex such that zzso binding and zzso are zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso from the zzso domain is an ordered sequential process, and release of the domain from the membrane is simultaneous with zzso of the second zzso Thus, the zzso cycle of the C2 domain passes through an active, zzso state possessing two zzso zzso zzso one of which is essential for maintenance of the zzso zzso
