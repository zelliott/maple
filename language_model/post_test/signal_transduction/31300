During the evolution of zzso only one zzso zzso either from the zzso or the invaded zzso is zzso zzso and environmental factors are usually invoked to explain this gene zzso How zzso parameters can play a role in the selection of genes that code for zzso that constitute a zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered whose kinetic parameters are randomly generated to construct two parallel zzso pathways to account for the contributions of the invaded and the zzso zzso zzso as targets of natural selection are zzso zzso are eliminated one by one so that the total flux through the zzso is least zzso Analysis of the results, done by different criteria, indicate that the zzso zzso both forward and backward, are more influential in selection than the respective zzso zzso This inclination disappears as zzso zzso are zzso It is shown that kinetic selection criteria can result in a zzso of zzso in the same zzso in terms of their genetic zzso Analysis of the results using the control zzso paradigm disclosed an expected robust correlation between flux control zzso of zzso and their selective zzso Similar zzso performed for the case of single gene transfer or for gene replication with subsequent zzso yielded essentially similar zzso The results conform with the phenomenon of genetic zzso found in zzso analyses of single or double zzso and lateral gene zzso
