The zzso zzso protein zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso system zzso is a major signal zzso that mediates the intricate interplay among zzso signals zzso and zzso zzso zzso and membrane proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso To further define the central role of zzso in these multiplex signaling mechanisms, we have used zzso zzso to construct three zzso zzso proteins containing single zzso acid changes; zzso was replaced with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso were replaced with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resembles the zzso protein in most properties and should be valuable for zzso zzso In contrast, clear differences between zzso and zzso proteins were observed with both zzso and zzso in in zzso sugar zzso zzso As predicted, zzso with a modified active site cannot be zzso zzso zzso accepts but cannot transfer zzso groups, suggesting zzso may also be a critical zzso acid for zzso signaling zzso The zzso effects of these zzso are briefly zzso
