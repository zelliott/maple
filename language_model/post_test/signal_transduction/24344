A functional hybrid zzso zzso the common gamma chain zzso with the zzso zzso factor zzso beta zzso chain is found in mobilized human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primed zzso blood zzso precursors zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, but not in normal natural killer zzso cells, the zzso zzso cell line or zzso zzso We demonstrated, using zzso zzso cells, which express an zzso zzso zzso that within the hybrid zzso the zzso chain zzso the zzso zzso signaling controlling zzso cell zzso However, the zzso chain is part of a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and the proliferation of zzso zzso The hybrid zzso is functional in normal zzso zzso in which both zzso control zzso zzso Finally, the parental zzso cell line, which lacks the zzso chain, nevertheless expresses both a functional hybrid zzso that controls zzso zzso and a novel zzso complex that triggers nuclear factor zzso zzso The zzso distribution and function of these receptors suggest that they are involved in zzso because they modify zzso pathways that play a major role in the differentiation of zzso zzso
