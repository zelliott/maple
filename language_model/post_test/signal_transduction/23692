Acute lung injury zzso is a devastating disorder of the lung that is characterized by zzso overwhelming pulmonary zzso and a high mortality in the critically zzso zzso has been implicated as an zzso signaling zzso and previous studies showed that zzso zzso zzso are increased in inflamed zzso zzso signaling is terminated by the zzso of zzso from the zzso into the zzso compartment via zzso zzso zzso zzso However, their role in controlling zzso signaling during pulmonary inflammation remains zzso After inflammatory in zzso experiments, we observed a repression of zzso and zzso that was associated with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using short, interfering zzso zzso confirmed a significant contribution of zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso Furthermore, an examination of the zzso promoter implicated zzso as a key regulator for the observed zzso zzso Additional in zzso experiments using a zzso model of inflammatory lung injury showed that the pharmacological zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in improved pulmonary barrier function and reduced signs of acute inflammation of the zzso Whereas experiments on zzso or zzso mice revealed lung protection in zzso lung injury, an examination of bone zzso zzso for zzso pointed to the zzso expression of zzso as the underlying cause of dampened pulmonary inflammation during zzso Taken together, these findings reveal the zzso repression of zzso as an innate protective response during acute pulmonary zzso The zzso of zzso could be pursued as a therapeutic option to zzso inflammatory lung zzso
