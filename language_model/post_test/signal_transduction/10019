zzso disease zzso is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded zzso zzso tract within the zzso protein zzso zzso the pathways that are altered in response to the zzso protein is crucial for understanding the cellular processes impacted by the disease as well as for the rational development of effective pharmacological zzso Here, expression profiling of a cellular HD model identifies genes that zzso altered zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and pharmacological zzso of these zzso pathways suggest that zzso zzso affects signaling at upstream points such that both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suggests that this zzso is associated with cell survival, whereas zzso of zzso was found to effectively suppress zzso These studies suggest that pharmacological intervention in zzso zzso particularly at the level of zzso zzso may be an appropriate approach to HD zzso
