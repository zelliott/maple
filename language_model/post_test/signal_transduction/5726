zzso zzso plays a crucial role in T cell zzso zzso of the nuclear factors of activated T cells zzso by zzso is essential for zzso zzso gene expression and, consequently, the immune zzso Current zzso protocols are based mainly on zzso zzso zzso A and zzso Unfortunately, these drugs are associated with severe side zzso zzso zzso agents with higher selectivity and lower toxicity must be zzso The zzso role of the family of proteins regulators of zzso zzso formerly known as zzso which regulate the zzso signaling pathway, has been described zzso Here, we identify and characterize the minimal zzso sequence responsible for the zzso of zzso signaling in zzso The zzso zzso spanning this sequence binds to zzso with high zzso This interaction is zzso by a zzso spanning the zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso does not inhibit general zzso zzso activity, which suggests that it may have a specific zzso effect on the zzso signaling zzso As such, the zzso zzso could either be considered a highly selective zzso compound by itself or be used as a new tool for identifying innovative zzso zzso We developed a low zzso zzso based on the zzso interaction, which identifies zzso as an efficient in zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso that does not affect zzso zzso zzso
