zzso zzso are becoming widely used tools for the characterization of the complexity of zzso immune zzso Current zzso profiling techniques provide modest and indirect information about the zzso functions of the zzso that bind to particular zzso Here we introduce an zzso zzso approach for obtaining immune profiles reflecting zzso zzso This technology relies on the parallel measurement of zzso binding and complement zzso by features of the zzso By comparing zzso from animals zzso against the same zzso under different conditions, we show that identifying the position of an zzso in a zzso space, derived from zzso binding and complement deposition, permits distinction between immune profiles characterized by diverse zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the technology provides a biologically zzso zzso representation of the relationship between zzso and zzso Our data suggest that zzso immune profiling could enrich the data obtained from zzso scale serum profiling zzso
