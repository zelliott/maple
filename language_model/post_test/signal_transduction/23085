zzso membrane zzso such as zzso and zzso play important roles in zzso functional zzso They are the receptors for specific zzso zzso for von zzso factors, and zzso for zzso and the zzso interaction is the first step that elicits downstream zzso zzso signals which finally culminate in zzso zzso Although a variety of signal zzso pathways may be involved, zzso zzso appear to be most closely related to zzso zzso zzso by membrane zzso Since its discovery in early zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso has been recognized to play a role in regulating the cell function of various zzso zzso have several zzso family zzso zzso with an zzso domain and an zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso also appears to play an important role in zzso zzso especially in its early zzso The zzso domain binds to a zzso zzso zzso of other zzso and the zzso domain recognizes zzso zzso of target zzso thus providing the zzso sites for zzso zzso In this article, some of the recent developments in the signal zzso pathways related with zzso zzso are zzso Several signaling molecules involved in zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Interestingly, the members participating in these processes are zzso suggesting a diversity of signal zzso zzso
