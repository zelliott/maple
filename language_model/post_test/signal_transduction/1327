zzso zzso zzso has numerous cellular functions, including cell survival and zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of the active form of zzso induced zzso differentiation and axis zzso and strongly induced the expression of neural zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso activity by its dominant negative zzso induced the zzso of losing zzso structures and the expression of zzso zzso zzso is an essential target of zzso for zzso The expression of the active form of zzso induced axis zzso and increased the expression of neural zzso zzso of the zzso activity abolished the zzso double heads and zzso This signal zzso through its target, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to mediate zzso signaling for zzso zzso These results identify a new function of zzso signaling in axis formation and zzso during zzso embryonic development and provide a direct link between growth zzso zzso signaling and zzso signaling during embryonic zzso
