zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso channel zzso thought to be associated with zzso (a zzso zzso in a zzso molecular complex in specialized touch sensory zzso A key question is whether analogous molecular complexes in higher organisms zzso mechanical zzso To address this question, we selected zzso of the rat zzso zzso complex in the zzso pad and the zzso zzso for an zzso and molecular biological zzso zzso of zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in rat zzso zzso Using zzso we found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are localized in the zzso of the zzso zzso and in a minor fraction of their termination site in the zzso zzso complex, where zzso zzso endings are zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the candidate interacting protein zzso are zzso in a zzso zzso a location consistent with a possible role in zzso
