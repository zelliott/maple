The zzso zzso zzso regulate cell growth through the zzso pathway, and are targeted by zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso It is now apparent that protein zzso play an important role in zzso zzso and tumor response to zzso However, the exact zzso and cellular location of these zzso remain unclear because of the lack of technologies to zzso zzso In the present work, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with quantitative spatial analysis, provides sufficient resolution to directly zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that zzso exists predominantly as zzso zzso under resting conditions but forms zzso as well as zzso and zzso at the cell membrane in the presence of active zzso In contrast, zzso truncated zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso forms zzso zzso and occasional zzso in the zzso whereas a zzso zzso with a disrupted zzso zzso interface does zzso Finally, artificially forcing zzso to the membrane by fusion to a zzso zzso motif zzso zzso formation but activates zzso only if the zzso interface is zzso Together, these quantitative results directly confirm the existence of zzso zzso and potentially zzso zzso and their involvement in cell zzso and showed that zzso zzso formation can result from multiple mechanisms and is a critical but not sufficient step for zzso zzso
