A good number of zzso zzso have been proposed for grouping gene expression zzso Many of them have adopted zzso norms to define the similarity score of a zzso We shall show that almost all zzso metrics can be converted into zzso norms while preserving the rank zzso zzso norms provide a much more efficient vehicle for zzso analysis and zzso The advantages are two zzso ease of analysis and saving of zzso Most existing zzso zzso have also implicitly assumed the use of zzso zzso single zzso evaluation for identifying zzso Such an approach however overlooks the fundamental principle that genes (even though they may belong to the same gene zzso zzso may be subdivided into different zzso and zzso they may be zzso via a diversity of zzso models (a gene may participate in multiple pathways that may or may not be zzso under all zzso The former leads to the adoption of a zzso analysis, while the latter to the zzso zzso This paper will show that the proposed zzso and zzso analysis is very effective in identifying and zzso biologically relevant groups in genes and zzso For example, it has successfully yielded highly zzso and accurate zzso based on known zzso gene zzso
