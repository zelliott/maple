zzso zzso diseases such as zzso and coronary zzso are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed zzso Common features associated with these zzso disorders involve zzso zzso and subsequent abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells into the zzso zzso leading to zzso formation and vascular zzso This zzso response has largely been attributed to the release of multiple zzso and growth factors by inflammatory zzso Previously, we demonstrated that the disruption of the zzso zzso leads to defective zzso zzso Here, we propose that zzso is a potent zzso regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell activity and that this regulation is important for preventing zzso zzso Using vascular smooth muscle cells from mice lacking zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso stress fiber organization, zzso zzso regulates migration and signals via a zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso coronary model of zzso the therapeutic delivery of zzso zzso to injured vessels in zzso significantly reduces zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso the zzso structure by inducing a zzso zzso state in vascular smooth muscle zzso Together, this work demonstrates that signaling pathways crucial for zzso zzso can play an important role in the zzso and treatment of vascular zzso
