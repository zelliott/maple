zzso control of organ size is crucial during animal development and zzso In zzso and zzso studies over the past decade have uncovered a critical role for the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of organ zzso zzso of this zzso leads to massive overgrowth of zzso The zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and limits organ size by zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso key regulators of proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso also has a critical role in the zzso and expansion of stem cells and zzso zzso cells, and has important functions in tissue zzso Emerging evidence shows that the zzso zzso is regulated by cell zzso cell zzso and cell junction zzso In this review we zzso current understanding of the composition and regulation of the zzso pathway, and discuss how cell polarity and cell zzso proteins inform the role of this zzso in organ size control and zzso
