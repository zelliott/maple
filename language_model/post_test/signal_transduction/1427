zzso class I proteins in zzso solution can be directly immobilized on plastic by a simple dilution zzso The immobilized zzso retains its native structure and will trigger specific, zzso zzso of cloned zzso zzso of the response is dependent on the surface density of zzso and displays a critical threshold density below which response does not zzso Individual clones differ with respect to the threshold density required for zzso but these differences are not zzso With one exception, the cloned lines examined respond to zzso zzso comparable to that found on normal zzso cells, and critical threshold zzso varied over about a fourfold zzso zzso of zzso and zzso class I protein of a different specificity has the effect of decreasing the threshold density of zzso required for response to zzso This zzso is specific for class I, zzso class II protein does not affect responses, and is very likely zzso by zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso on the class I zzso Thus, class I zzso is the necessary and sufficient zzso for zzso of most zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso interactions contribute to the zzso The results described here for zzso zzso are compared with those previously found in examining the zzso requirements for zzso of precursor zzso
