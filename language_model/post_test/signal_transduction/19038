Recent studies in a variety of species including zzso showed that zzso zzso 5, zzso treatment and caloric restriction increased silent information regulator zzso 1 activity, which zzso increase in life zzso zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso and a well-documented zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be both zzso and zzso against subsequent zzso zzso A major emphasis in this field is to understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate this zzso The goal of this study was to define whether zzso can emulate zzso zzso against cerebral zzso zzso an in zzso model of cerebral zzso the zzso zzso slice culture, we report that zzso zzso mimics zzso via the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso after zzso or zzso zzso abolished their zzso A better understanding of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso tolerance in a zzso manner may provide a novel therapy against stroke or zzso zzso
