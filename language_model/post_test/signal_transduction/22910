zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso progression of many types of cells by arresting them in zzso phase through zzso of the active zzso complexes that lead to zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso treatment induced enhanced expression of zzso zzso which inhibited the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso and blocked zzso zzso zzso also enhanced the stability of zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso and increased stability of zzso contribute to zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are major downstream targets of zzso in zzso cells and that a zzso zzso zzso mediates growth zzso by zzso in these zzso
