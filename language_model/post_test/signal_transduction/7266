The zzso significance of activity zzso within the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso was assessed in two independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso treated with a zzso zzso We specifically assessed expression signatures in a unique set of zzso and zzso tumor zzso 

zzso expression was assessed in samples of two independent zzso of 107 zzso 1) and 46 zzso 2) zzso cases zzso treated with zzso induction chemotherapy followed by zzso zzso from two different institutions, assembled on tissue zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to marker of proliferation zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso and correlated with overall survival zzso and zzso survival zzso To assess zzso zzso status, zzso in zzso zzso was zzso 

Survival analysis showed that high zzso and zzso expression in samples of treatment zzso patients of cohort 1 was associated with shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression after chemotherapy remained associated with shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of marker expression in samples before and after induction chemotherapy of cohort 1 revealed that decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso expression was associated with a worse zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso 

These novel data reveal a zzso significance of expression changes of zzso zzso components during induction chemotherapy if confirmed in other patient zzso and support the growing evidence to target the zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso
