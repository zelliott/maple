zzso and zzso recognize the zzso microbial patterns zzso and zzso DNA, zzso The recent discovery that these receptors also recognize zzso zzso from zzso material has drawn increased attention to their involvement in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso have been assigned with pivotal roles in the regulation of such zzso zzso zzso is the hallmark zzso of the recently discovered zzso zzso cell subset zzso By contrast, the expression of zzso does not seem to be limited to a single distinct zzso cell zzso We investigated the expression of zzso and zzso in human zzso T cells in response to stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We discovered that zzso induced synthesis of both zzso and zzso Moreover, we found that zzso was able to drive the differentiation of zzso zzso cells into an zzso but not into an zzso zzso and did this without affecting the levels of zzso factors zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso orphan zzso zzso Finally, we found that the zzso cells that were differentiated in response to zzso expressed the zzso zzso zzso which is important in the recruitment of T cells into inflamed zzso in zzso zzso This is the first report to show that the zzso zzso zzso can directly induce the synthesis of zzso and zzso and drive differentiation of human zzso zzso T zzso
