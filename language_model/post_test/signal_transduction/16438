Signaling through the zzso zzso zzso complex is a crucial mechanism in the development of zzso asthma and chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso In zzso zzso cells, this signaling zzso leads to changes in the expression levels of several genes that are possibly involved in protection against and/or zzso of these zzso The expression of zzso zzso a candidate for the latter category, is zzso by zzso and leads to overproduction of zzso and increased zzso of the airway surface liquid zzso zzso zzso the zzso regulation of zzso could aid in the development of new pharmacological leads for asthma and/or COPD zzso Here we show that zzso significantly increased human zzso promoter activity in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Phoenix zzso that zzso of the zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso rendered the promoter insensitive to zzso and that addition of the zzso zzso motif to an zzso sequence of the human zzso promoter zzso sensitivity to both zzso
