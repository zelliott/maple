Many different diseases and toxins can cause liver damage, which is difficult to treat and often leads to the development of liver zzso or even zzso The key event in this process is the zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso During such zzso zzso undergo a dramatic transformation in zzso and behavior, changing from a zzso to a zzso zzso After zzso zzso increase their proliferation rate and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which contains mainly collagen type I, is a direct cause of liver zzso zzso also produce substances which inhibit zzso activities, such as zzso enhance zzso deposition in the zzso On the molecular level, zzso are activated by zzso factors, and zzso stress, which are abundant in afflicted zzso These factors induce zzso signals transmitted by many zzso the most important of which are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transmitted via these pathways change the activities of zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso This in turn causes changes in gene zzso and ultimately alters the whole cell's behavior and zzso The cell begins the production collagen type I, zzso and zzso zzso zzso can sustain their own zzso by producing growth factors such as zzso and zzso Despite the vast knowledge about the mechanisms causing liver zzso and zzso there is still no effective zzso Further studies are therefore needed to solve this zzso
