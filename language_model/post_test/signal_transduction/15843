The literature on zzso has grown tremendously in recent years, and the mechanisms that are involved in this programmed cell death zzso have been zzso It is now known that zzso takes place starting from early development to adult stage for the zzso of zzso organisms, during disease development and in response to different stimuli in many different zzso In this review, we attempted to zzso the current knowledge on the circumstances and the mechanisms that lead to induction of zzso while going over the molecular details of the zzso and zzso of zzso as well as drawing the lines between programmed and zzso cell death zzso The review will particularly focus on zzso family zzso the role of different zzso in the process of zzso and their zzso as well as the importance of zzso during different disease zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso better will make a big impact on human diseases, particularly cancer, and its management in the zzso
