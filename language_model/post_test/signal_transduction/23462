zzso have been observed in various physical zzso Here, we show that the distinct characteristics of zzso are present in the mass cell movement of zzso zzso of the cellular slime zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso forms zzso structures that differentiate into spore or stalk cells and, eventually, a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not form zzso zzso however, they do undergo mass cell movement in the form of a zzso zzso structure zzso We also found that zzso induction is zzso by adhesive zzso zzso These observations provide novel insights into the mechanisms of biological zzso in zzso zzso
