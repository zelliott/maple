We previously reported that a zzso in zzso hormone zzso zzso during the early last zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays a role in leading to very low zzso levels in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In the present study, the role of juvenile hormone zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso was zzso When zzso analog zzso was applied to early last zzso larvae, the development of larvae was greatly zzso It was found that it was not zzso release, but zzso zzso competency in both zzso generation and zzso to the stimulation of zzso which was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso zzso in zzso larvae showed no response in zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso until day 7, 4 days later than those of control zzso zzso application showed the same effects as those of zzso By contrast, zzso on day 0 of the last zzso accelerated development, and zzso showed the zzso response to either zzso or zzso in both zzso generation and zzso 1 day after zzso From these results, we conclude that the absence of zzso is a prerequisite for successful zzso zzso and for acquisition of the zzso generating system of zzso zzso
