Human zzso stem cells zzso are popular candidates for tissue zzso zzso are defined by their properties in two-dimensional zzso culture zzso zzso in zzso are known to differ from their in zzso counterparts in cell shape, zzso and gene zzso Little is so far known about the zzso and gene expression of cells in three-dimensional zzso culture zzso To begin to unravel the impact of zzso versus zzso culture conditions on zzso we have established zzso from zzso tissue and bone zzso in zzso cultures in zzso beads zzso modified with the zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso motif found in several molecules within the zzso zzso The zzso changed from their zzso shape zzso to a small, compact shape when embedded in zzso zzso zzso High viability was maintained throughout the zzso The zzso retained expression of zzso known to bind zzso and practically ceased to zzso zzso analysis revealed that the gene expression in cells in zzso zzso was different both from the cells cultured in zzso and from zzso isolated, zzso zzso but more similar to zzso zzso As zzso may be entirely zzso leaving the cells as single cell suspensions for various zzso this represents a useful model for the study of cells in zzso zzso
