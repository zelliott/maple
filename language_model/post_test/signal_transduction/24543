Relying on quantitative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso we construct a simplified kinetic model to describe the properties of this zzso zzso rate zzso to fit key kinetic and equilibrium data, we find that the model reproduces a variety of in zzso and in zzso zzso In combination with zzso activity for zzso zzso into the zzso zzso the model leads to zzso zzso in zzso concentration at fixed zzso concentration and only a single pool of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso mechanism of zzso on zzso production by zzso C zzso the properties of the zzso and leads to zzso in zzso concentration accompanied by zzso in zzso zzso We discuss the possible significance of these results for the interpretation of zzso
