zzso functional zzso T cell memory is highly dependent upon zzso T cell zzso zzso T cells play a critical role in inducing the expression of zzso the zzso for zzso on zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso stimulation during primary zzso T cell responses regulates the ability to mount secondary zzso T cell zzso zzso stimulation during zzso and zzso cell zzso controls the expression of the zzso zzso which has been shown to be necessary for memory zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulation during primary zzso T cell responses to zzso virus restrained the late expression on memory precursor cells of zzso receptors that support terminal zzso The formation of zzso T cell memory precursors and secondary zzso T cell responses was restored in the absence of zzso zzso when zzso zzso was not zzso Similarly, the zzso in zzso T cell memory that occurs in the absence of zzso T cells did not occur in mice lacking zzso These data indicate that zzso T cell help and, by extension, zzso stimulation support zzso T cell memory by modulating the expression of zzso receptors that influence the differentiation and survival of memory zzso T zzso
