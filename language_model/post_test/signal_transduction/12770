Human zzso cells when grown in cell culture assume a zzso zzso and do not form tubes or zzso zzso We have recently identified a culture zzso containing basement zzso proteins that promotes zzso differentiation of human zzso vein and human zzso zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso This differentiation is zzso beginning within 1 h and is complete by 8-12 zzso On electron zzso these cells form a zzso derived from zzso of multiple cells and also by forming holes in the zzso of individual zzso The zzso cells no longer zzso when cultured on this zzso known as zzso but can be induced to do so when cultured on zzso We have also identified a critical molecular signal for zzso cell differentiation induced by zzso zzso a prime constituent of zzso and to lesser extent collagen IV appear to be key elements in the differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso
