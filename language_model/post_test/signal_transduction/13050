The zzso heat shock protein zzso the target of the zzso class of zzso drugs, is required for the zzso zzso of a specific group of signal zzso including zzso In this report we have identified a zzso zzso protein as zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain is replaced in zzso by a much zzso zzso zzso preceded by a putative zzso zzso We demonstrate that, although much less abundant, zzso binds zzso with a higher affinity than zzso In sharp contrast to zzso zzso does not associate with zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to activate zzso in zzso zzso cells, while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso exhibited elevated activity of the zzso and downstream zzso zzso This may be due to zzso binding to zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso to the zzso To examine whether zzso could therefore substitute for Ras in zzso recruitment to the cell zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that, as shown before for activated Ras or zzso the introduction of even low levels of zzso through zzso in zzso zzso causes a dramatic block of zzso Higher levels of zzso expression resulted in zzso zzso including interruption of gap zzso zzso communication, and zzso zzso These results indicate that the observed zzso of zzso by zzso has a profound biological effect, which is largely zzso With the recent finding that zzso is zzso in transgenic mice, these results reinforce the intriguing observation that the family of heat shock proteins represents a novel class of molecules with zzso zzso
