zzso located on zzso 3 band zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso not detected in normal zzso cells but expressed in several normal zzso zzso is inappropriately activated in zzso zzso following zzso zzso involving band zzso The zzso lead either to gene zzso and to expression of the zzso zzso zzso as seen in the zzso and zzso or to gene fusion, as seen in the zzso which results in the fusion protein zzso This fusion protein contains the zzso domain of the zzso factor zzso fused zzso to the entire zzso with the exclusion of its first 12 zzso zzso In this report, we have analyzed the response of the zzso precursor cell line zzso expressing either the normal protein zzso or the fusion protein zzso to factors that control cell differentiation or cell zzso The zzso cells are zzso for growth and they differentiate into zzso when exposed to zzso They are zzso by zzso We show that whereas the expression of zzso has no effect on zzso differentiation induced by zzso expression of zzso blocks differentiation resulting in cell zzso This effect is similar to that previously described by others for zzso cells that express transgenic zzso Furthermore, we show that whereas the expression of the fusion protein zzso completely abrogates the zzso effect of zzso and allows zzso cells to zzso expression of the normal protein zzso has the opposite effect, and it strengthens the response of cells to the zzso effect of zzso By using the zzso zzso system, we also show that zzso zzso in its entirety in zzso and zzso physically interacts with zzso which is an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we have correlated the response of the cells to zzso or zzso with the ability of the normal and fusion proteins to activate or repress promoters which they can directly regulate by binding to the promoter zzso We propose that zzso of zzso either by gene zzso resulting in the zzso zzso zzso or by gene fusion to zzso lead to an altered cellular response to growth and differentiation factors that could result in zzso zzso The different response of zzso cells zzso expressing the normal or the fusion protein to zzso and zzso could depend on the different zzso properties of these proteins resulting in divergent expression of downstream genes regulated by the two zzso
