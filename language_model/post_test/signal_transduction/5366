The zzso B cell compartment is comprised of two major, functionally zzso mature B cell subsets, zzso zzso mature zzso and marginal zone zzso B zzso Whereas zzso B cells exhibit a robust zzso response following stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso B cells display markedly delayed and reduced levels of proliferation to the identical zzso The current study was designed to identify a potential zzso accounting for this differential zzso In contrast to the delay in cell cycle entry, zzso and zzso B cells exhibited nearly identical zzso zzso in the expression level of cell surface zzso zzso Furthermore, both the zzso and zzso signaling zzso were similarly activated by zzso stimulation in zzso vs zzso B cells, while zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were nearly absent in both zzso zzso B cells, however, exhibited higher zzso levels of zzso and zzso consistent with a zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly reduced in zzso vs zzso B cells and enforced zzso expression fully restored the defective zzso response in zzso B zzso These data support a model wherein zzso responses in zzso B cells are tightly regulated by limiting zzso levels, thereby providing an important checkpoint to control zzso zzso B cell zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
