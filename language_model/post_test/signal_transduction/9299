zzso processes play an important role in tumor initiation and zzso In this review, we focus on three critical processes by which zzso function may contribute to zzso through zzso in zzso zzso the production of zzso oxygen species zzso and compromise of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso metabolism include the Warburg effect, leading to a shift in metabolism away from zzso zzso toward zzso even when sufficient oxygen is present to support zzso Such zzso in cellular metabolism may favor tumor cell growth by increasing the availability of zzso zzso needed for cellular growth and zzso zzso in specific zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso have been linked to human zzso zzso zzso may contribute to cancer via DNA damage and the zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso stabilization of the zzso factor zzso factor zzso may be a particularly important event for zzso zzso function of intrinsic zzso removes an important cellular safeguard against cancer and has been implicated in zzso tumor zzso and zzso Each of the major zzso processes is zzso In this review, we outline the connections between them and address ways these zzso pathways may be targeted for cancer zzso
