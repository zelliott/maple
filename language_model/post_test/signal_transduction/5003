zzso zzso has been used for over a decade to characterize signaling zzso controlling innate immune zzso However, what zzso these responses in the zzso has remained zzso To gain a better understanding of the initiating events we delineated zzso immune responses to the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso in worms zzso by the pathogen versus worms visibly not zzso We found that infection responses in both groups were zzso suggesting that immune responses were not correlated with colonization and its associated zzso zzso zzso zzso further showed that pathogen zzso factors were not able to induce an immune response, but exposure to a zzso zzso species zzso These findings raise the possibility that the zzso immune response is initiated by recognition of zzso molecular zzso In the absence of zzso of known pattern recognition zzso zzso zzso may rely on novel mechanisms, thus holding the potential to advance our understanding of zzso zzso strategies for pathogen zzso
