zzso sense their environment using receptors of the zzso sensor zzso family, but how zzso activity is regulated by zzso binding is not well zzso zzso zzso a zzso signaling zzso originally identified in studies of the marine zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso responses and allows communication between different bacterial zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso requires the integral membrane zzso zzso comprised of zzso binding protein zzso and zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso Combined X-ray zzso and functional studies show that zzso binding causes a major zzso change within zzso which in turn zzso a zzso arrangement in which two zzso zzso are zzso zzso We propose that formation of this zzso zzso structure is responsible for zzso the zzso activity of both zzso zzso and triggering the transition of zzso zzso into zzso zzso
