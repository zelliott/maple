zzso cell death zzso is essential for proper growth, development, and cellular zzso in all zzso The regulation of zzso is of central importance in zzso zzso notably, zzso and features associated with zzso are observed in many host resistance zzso zzso pathogen induction of inappropriate cell death in the host results in a susceptible zzso and zzso Thus, the party in control of zzso has a distinct advantage in these zzso zzso processes appear to be of ancient origin, as indicated by the fact that many features of cell death strategy are zzso between animals and plants; however, some of the details of death execution zzso zzso core zzso zzso such as zzso are not present in plant zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso zzso regulatory elements are absent in plants, but, zzso when expressed in plants, successfully impact plant zzso Thus, subtle structural similarities independent of sequence zzso appear to sustain operational zzso The zzso is emerging as a key zzso in the zzso of plant zzso Under different signals for cell death, the zzso either zzso with the zzso membrane or zzso Moreover, the zzso appears to play a key role in zzso evidence suggests a zzso function for zzso but other studies propose a zzso zzso Here, we describe and discuss what we know and what we do not know about various zzso pathways and how the host zzso signals to activate salicylic acid and zzso oxygen pathways that orchestrate cell zzso We suggest that it is not cell death as such but rather the processes leading to cell death that contribute to the outcome of a given zzso zzso
