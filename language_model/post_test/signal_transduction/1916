We have developed a zzso zzso zzso screening system zzso that incorporates zzso zzso zzso multiple positive ( zzso zzso zzso and negative ( zzso selection schemes to reduce the zzso of negative and false positive zzso and automation of laboratory procedures to increase zzso This zzso system has been applied to the study of zzso interactions that are involved in rice defense signal zzso zzso More than 100 genes involved in plant defense responses were selected from DuPont's rice expressed sequence tag zzso databases as zzso for zzso zzso zzso from zzso screening of eight of these rice genes are presented in this zzso Not only have we identified known zzso zzso but we have also discovered novel zzso which may ultimately reveal the regulatory network of host defense signal zzso zzso We have demonstrated that our zzso method can be used to map zzso interaction networks and signal zzso pathways in any zzso In combination with other approaches, such efficient zzso screens can help us zzso to study the functions of known and unknown genes in the zzso zzso
