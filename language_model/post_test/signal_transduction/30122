zzso of zzso zzso signaling has been proposed to involve zzso zzso across the plasma membrane followed by zzso zzso Here, we tested this hypothesis directly by zzso the PG zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso in various cell types with and without human PG 15 zzso zzso In zzso cells, which express neither zzso nor zzso zzso added zzso or zzso were rapidly oxidized to the 13, zzso zzso zzso only when zzso and zzso were zzso directly confirming the zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso that were broken open formed more PG zzso than cells in which the zzso could gain access to zzso only via zzso Similar results were obtained using the human prostate cancer cell line zzso in which zzso zzso is induced after exposure to zzso Because zzso in zzso is expressed in zzso collecting duct zzso we also expressed zzso in zzso canine kidney cells grown on zzso where it zzso both the active zzso of zzso across the zzso membrane and the zzso transport of zzso to the zzso zzso When zzso was zzso with zzso in these zzso zzso about half of the zzso taken up zzso was oxidized to 13, zzso zzso which in turn exited the cells zzso into both the zzso and zzso zzso Our data represent zzso of the longstanding model of PG metabolism consisting of sequential zzso PG zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the PG zzso
