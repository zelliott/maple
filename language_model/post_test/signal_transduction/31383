G zzso receptors zzso mediate cellular responses to a variety of zzso but how specific responses are regulated has been zzso as the types of zzso vastly zzso the classes of G protein zzso available to initiate downstream zzso In our analysis of signaling proteins containing zzso zzso ( approximately 90 zzso sequence motifs first recognized in fly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso are responsible for specific recognition of zzso We examined the zzso regulator of G protein signaling zzso protein zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso in zzso mediate binding to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso by placing the zzso protein in proximity to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso tail, but only its zzso state, allowing for release and recycling of this regulator upon zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeting of zzso and regulators to specific zzso provides a means to dictate the nature, zzso and specificity of the zzso
