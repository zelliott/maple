In zzso fish the male zzso fin has been transformed into a zzso an zzso organ required for internal zzso zzso testosterone levels induce metamorphosis of a subset of zzso fin rays to grow and form the specialized terminal structures of the zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are largely zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso acid zzso signaling is involved in zzso development in the zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso fins during zzso zzso expression is regulated by testosterone in a zzso manner and is zzso in both zzso and naturally developing zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative regulator of zzso development, is zzso with zzso and the zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso experimental increase of zzso signaling promoted growth of the zzso and increased the number of new zzso Based on gene expression analyses and pharmacological manipulation of zzso development, we show that the zzso signaling zzso is activated in response to zzso signaling and promotes fin ray growth and development during the metamorphosis of the zzso fin into the zzso
