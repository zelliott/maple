Cell cycle transitions depend on protein zzso and zzso The discovery of zzso zzso zzso and their mode of zzso by their zzso partners explained many important aspects of cell cycle zzso As the cell cycle is basically a series of zzso of a defined set of events, protein zzso must obviously be as important as zzso However, our knowledge about zzso lags well behind that of zzso We still do not know which zzso zzso truly responsible for zzso zzso zzso and we know very little about whether and how protein zzso are zzso Here, we zzso our present understanding of the zzso that are important in the control of the cell cycle and pose the questions that need to be answered as regards the regulation of protein zzso
