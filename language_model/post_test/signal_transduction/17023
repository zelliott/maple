The extraction of directional motion information from changing retinal images is one of the earliest and most important processing steps in any visual zzso In the fly zzso zzso two parallel processing zzso have been zzso zzso leading from two zzso zzso zzso and zzso via T4 and zzso cells onto large, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso T4 and zzso cells are thought to have a pivotal role in motion zzso however, zzso to their small size, it is difficult to obtain electrical recordings of T4 and zzso cells, leaving their visual response properties largely zzso We circumvent this problem by means of optical recording from these cells in zzso using the genetically zzso calcium indicator zzso zzso zzso Here we find that specific zzso of T4 and zzso cells are zzso tuned to one of the four zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Depending on their preferred direction, T4 and zzso cells terminate in specific zzso of the zzso zzso T4 and zzso functionally segregate with respect to contrast zzso whereas T4 cells selectively respond to moving brightness increments zzso zzso zzso cells only respond to moving brightness zzso zzso zzso When the output from T4 or zzso cells is zzso the responses of zzso zzso plate zzso to moving ON zzso zzso or OFF edges zzso zzso are selectively zzso The same effects are seen in turning responses of zzso walking zzso Thus, starting with zzso and zzso the visual input is split into separate ON and OFF zzso and motion along all four zzso directions is zzso separately within each zzso The output of these eight different motion detectors is then sorted such that ON zzso and OFF zzso motion detectors with the same directional tuning zzso in the same layer of the zzso plate, jointly providing the input to downstream circuits and zzso zzso
