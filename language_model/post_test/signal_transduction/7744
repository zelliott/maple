zzso Ras zzso can induce either proliferation or zzso depending on the cellular zzso To determine whether Ras zzso has zzso effects in the zzso zzso we generated zzso transgenic mice that permit Ras zzso to be zzso Low levels of Ras zzso - similar to those found in zzso mouse zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso - stimulate cellular proliferation and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, high levels of Ras zzso - similar to those found in zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso - induce cellular zzso that is zzso dependent and irreversible following Ras zzso zzso low-level Ras induction results in zzso formation, but only after the spontaneous zzso of activated Ras and evasion of zzso zzso Thus, zzso but not zzso Ras zzso activates zzso zzso pathways and triggers an irreversible zzso growth arrest in zzso We suggest a zzso model for zzso zzso consisting of an initial zzso Ras zzso zzso of the activated Ras zzso and, finally, evasion of zzso zzso zzso
