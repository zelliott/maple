This study investigated changes in gene expressions related to zzso when mineral zzso zzso zzso is applied in zzso to human dental pulp cells zzso 

zzso in a Teflon tube zzso 10 zzso height 2 zzso was applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as negative zzso Total zzso was extracted at 6, 24, and 72 hours after zzso application for zzso zzso The results were confirmed selectively by performing reverse zzso chain reaction for genes that showed changes of more than zzso or less than zzso 

Of the zzso zzso 109 genes were zzso more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 69 genes were zzso below 50% zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These results suggest that rather than being a zzso material, zzso affects pulp cells in various zzso zzso appears to affect zzso and zzso slight inflammation and protective role against slight zzso
