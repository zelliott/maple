Through acute enteric infection, zzso invades host zzso and reproduces zzso into specialized zzso This involves changes in host cell signaling zzso by bacterial proteins delivered via type III zzso systems zzso One of the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso triggers bacterial zzso Among the zzso proteins zzso by this zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are known to play key roles in these zzso To better understand their contribution to zzso host cell zzso we used zzso zzso protein array technology, which allows printing zzso zzso zzso that can be analyzed with zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso of signaling zzso zzso were obtained at different times after infection of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso single and double zzso as well as different zzso zzso zzso Our analysis detected zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso mainly dependent on zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso and its targets zzso and zzso This is the first time that zzso protein array technology is used in the cellular zzso field, demonstrating its value to screen for host signaling events through bacterial zzso
