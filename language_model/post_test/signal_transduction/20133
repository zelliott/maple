We found that a mechanism of hypertension in zzso type II zzso caused by a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso of the zzso signal zzso However, the zzso effect of zzso deletions in zzso genes also observed in zzso patients remains zzso To understand the zzso roles of zzso in zzso zzso have been zzso because zzso zzso knockout is embryonic zzso Although zzso mice have been reported to have zzso detailed analyses of the zzso signal cascade in the kidney and other zzso of zzso mice have not been zzso 

We assess the effect of zzso deletion of zzso on the zzso signal cascade in the kidney and blood zzso 

zzso to the previous report, the blood pressure of zzso mice was not zzso even under a zzso zzso Under a zzso background, the zzso deletion of the zzso gene did not reduce the high blood pressure zzso We then evaluated the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso but no significant decrease in the zzso was observed in zzso mice or zzso zzso In contrast, a significant decrease in zzso zzso in the zzso and a decreased zzso zzso response in the zzso arteries were observed in zzso zzso 

The contribution of zzso to total zzso zzso activity in the kidney may be small, but that zzso may play a substantial role in the regulation of blood pressure in the zzso
