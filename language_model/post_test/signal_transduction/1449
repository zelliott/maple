zzso hormones elicit diverse cellular responses by zzso plasma membrane receptors coupled to zzso zzso regulatory proteins that promote zzso of zzso C and zzso of zzso The zzso products of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso act as primary signals for calcium zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso The metabolism of zzso zzso to several higher zzso zzso provides additional compounds with potential regulatory actions on calcium movement and cell responses, and the discovery of multiple zzso of protein zzso C reveals a mechanism for diversification and specificity of hormone action among target cells controlled by the same basic zzso zzso In addition to its rapid zzso by many hormones and zzso the zzso signaling system is zzso by several growth factors and zzso consistent with its pervasive role in the control of both immediate and long-term responses of cells to external zzso zzso
