von zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso is essential for zzso and zzso however, the molecular mechanisms are poorly zzso Interestingly, we observed increased bleeding in zzso mice that could be zzso by infusion of human zzso Blood from zzso mice exhibited significantly reduced zzso levels but normal zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso formation, indicating that zzso plays a prominent role in zzso zzso zzso required for zzso and zzso In isolated zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced in zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was defective in both zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso in cultured human zzso vein zzso and human pulmonary artery zzso depletion of zzso and soluble zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of activated zzso promoted zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso Finally, in zzso binding zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso and an engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso and evoked zzso zzso Discovery of obligatory and complementary roles of zzso and zzso in zzso vs evoked zzso zzso zzso may provide promising new therapeutic strategies for treatment of zzso zzso
