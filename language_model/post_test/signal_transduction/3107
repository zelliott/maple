zzso zzso factor 6 zzso is one of three principle zzso zzso zzso stress response proteins and becomes activated when zzso zzso is zzso zzso functions to increase zzso capacity by stimulating zzso of zzso zzso genes such as zzso Using an zzso that recognizes active zzso we found that active zzso was detected in zzso cells and zzso zzso even under zzso conditions and the levels were further increased by zzso zzso To examine the function of zzso we depleted zzso zzso levels using small interfering zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels by zzso resulted in a reduction in the zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso resulted in an zzso zzso We hypothesized that removal of the zzso branch of the unfolded protein response zzso would result in zzso zzso However, neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso requiring zzso 1 zzso pathways of the zzso were significantly activated in zzso zzso cells, although these cells were more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were elevated in zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso or zzso zzso prevented zzso These results suggest that zzso may have a role in maintaining zzso survival even in the absence of zzso zzso
