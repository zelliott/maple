zzso zzso is the model zzso for the zzso a group of zzso zzso bacteria with members that are notable both for their industrial importance as zzso producers and for their zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of sensor zzso that is genetically linked to zzso zzso at least one of which functions as an accessory protein to its zzso zzso Another member of this zzso zzso is widely zzso in the zzso along with its presumed zzso response regulator zzso and the zzso zzso Here, we zzso a possible role for zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso We discuss what is known about this zzso in the zzso and offer insights into why an essential response regulator does not necessarily need its zzso sensor zzso for zzso
