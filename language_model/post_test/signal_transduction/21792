The effect of surface topography and chemistry on cellular response is of fundamental importance, especially where living systems encounter device surfaces as in medical zzso tissue engineering, and zzso zzso To understand these biological processes on surfaces, there is a widespread interest in tailored zzso materials produced by a combination of surface chemistry coupled to advanced patterning zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso as molecular templates with zzso spatial resolution to engage and cluster zzso receptors on rat zzso leukemia zzso mast zzso zzso templates consisted of gold zzso on silicon with patterns from 1 zzso down to 45 zzso These gold zzso served as molecular zzso sites, enabling zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso of zzso The free ends of the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso which interact specifically with zzso zzso bound to its high affinity cell surface zzso zzso on zzso mast zzso Present results on structures 1 zzso down to 600 zzso in size indicate that these zzso patterned zzso can function as a powerful tool for zzso and systematic characterization of cell membrane involvement in zzso zzso immune cell zzso
