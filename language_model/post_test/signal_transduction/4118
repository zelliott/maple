zzso have been zzso as a center for signal zzso because many signaling molecules are concentrated in zzso zzso We took zzso as an example and examined whether it is zzso concentrated in zzso First, the behavior of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was zzso By collecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to distribute zzso zzso by novel zzso methods it was found that the labeling density of zzso was zzso times higher in zzso than in the zzso plasma zzso The results indicate that the concentration of zzso in zzso is lower than deduced from most zzso zzso
