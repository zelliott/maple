The zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is a promising target for the treatment of type II diabetes zzso because of its role in zzso zzso In recent years, difficulties with zzso therapies have driven the search for zzso compounds to zzso the activity of this zzso We recently identified zzso a naturally occurring zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the human zzso we have now extended this work to identify the structural requirements of zzso to modify zzso binding and signaling zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the clinically used zzso zzso zzso zzso This study identified a chemical series of zzso zzso with the ability to selectively augment calcium zzso signaling in a zzso zzso manner, with effects only on truncated zzso peptides zzso and zzso and zzso but not on zzso or full-length zzso peptides zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso group on the zzso backbone zzso a zzso was essential for this activity, however insufficient on its own, to produce the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso signaling but zzso modulated zzso zzso formation in a zzso zzso These data represent a detailed examination of the action of different zzso on zzso zzso at the zzso and may aid in the development of future small zzso compounds targeted at this zzso
