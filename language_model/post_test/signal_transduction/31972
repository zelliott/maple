zzso transfer proteins zzso are versatile proteins required for signal zzso and membrane zzso The best characterized zzso zzso are the Class I zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are single domain proteins with a zzso cavity that binds a zzso zzso or zzso zzso In this study, we report the zzso binding properties of an zzso soluble zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso name, zzso of the Class II zzso We show that the zzso binding properties of this protein are distinct to Class I zzso because, besides zzso zzso binds and transfers zzso acid zzso but hardly binds zzso zzso when zzso from zzso coli is preloaded with PA and zzso When zzso was incubated with zzso zzso cells, zzso was released, and PA and zzso were now incorporated into zzso After an increase in PA levels following zzso of zzso zzso D or after addition of bacterial zzso D, binding of PA to zzso was greater at the expense of zzso zzso We propose that zzso when containing zzso regulates an zzso protein or can facilitate zzso transfer between membrane zzso
