zzso is the major component found in zzso zzso zzso a widely used herb in traditional Chinese zzso Although it has been used for thousands of years to treat stroke, the mechanisms of action of zzso zzso have not been clearly zzso In this report, we studied the zzso of zzso as one possible mechanism by investigating the effects of these agents on expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso a critical factor for zzso 

The effects of zzso and an extract of zzso zzso on zzso expression were tested in several cell zzso Both agents induced zzso expression in all cells without increasing expression of zzso zzso zzso The expression of reporter genes was also activated under the control of the zzso promoter containing either a functional or a defective zzso response element zzso Only minimal effects were observed on reporter zzso under the zzso zzso Instead, both agents significantly induced zzso zzso zzso expression as well as the activity of reporter genes under the control of zzso zzso Their ability to induce zzso expression was suppressed once zzso expression was knocked down by zzso or zzso sites were deleted in the zzso zzso We also found that both agents zzso cell migration and vessel zzso formation from the zzso 

Our results zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso by inducing zzso expression through the zzso of the zzso zzso These data may facilitate a better understanding of the potential health benefits of these agents in the treatment of cardiovascular zzso
