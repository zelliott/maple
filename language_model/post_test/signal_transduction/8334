During brain development, functional zzso is achieved by the concerted action of various steps that include the expansion of zzso cells, zzso zzso and establishment of appropriate zzso Brain patterning and zzso is regulated by a variety of zzso signals and zzso that, together with zzso activity, orchestrate and regulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the adult brain, zzso zzso receptors are expressed at very high levels in selective areas and are engaged by zzso which act as retrograde zzso controlling zzso function and preventing excessive synaptic zzso In addition, the zzso system is present at early zzso stages of nervous system zzso Recent studies have provided novel information on the role of this zzso zzso system in the control of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso receptors and locally produced zzso regulate neural zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of projecting zzso zzso receptors also control zzso zzso migration, and positioning of zzso and zzso zzso Loss of function studies by genetic zzso or pharmacological blockade of zzso receptors interferes with long-range zzso projections and, likewise, prenatal zzso exposure zzso different functional zzso in the adult zzso Potential implications of these new findings, such as the participation of the zzso system in the zzso of zzso disorders zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso in brain depression, are discussed zzso
