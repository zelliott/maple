Resistance to death zzso zzso (such as zzso and zzso and zzso treatments is a hallmark of cancer zzso zzso a biologically active zzso zzso cell growth and promotes zzso and zzso forms of cell zzso The zzso levels of zzso are highly regulated via complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 convert zzso to zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso in zzso A growing body of evidence in the literature indicates that zzso likely zzso zzso cell growth and sensitivity to zzso zzso On one hand, complete and sustained zzso of zzso activity is likely to alter membrane composition and properties through membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways and leukemia cell growth and zzso partial resistance to death zzso zzso On the other hand, different patents & reports point to zzso functions for zzso In patients with zzso zzso a decreased zzso zzso level was associated with a higher zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may constitute original pharmacological targets to treat zzso
