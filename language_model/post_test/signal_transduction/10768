Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 6 zzso play a crucial role in the zzso of zzso and zzso which might be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We zzso reported that the zzso zzso reaction significantly decreased in zzso zzso mice in zzso model mice induced by intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent skin testing with zzso We therefore hypothesized that synthetic zzso DNA with a high affinity for zzso could be introduced in zzso as decoy zzso elements to bind the zzso factor and block the gene zzso contributing to the onset and progression of zzso thus providing effective therapy for zzso Treatment by the zzso of zzso decoy zzso zzso but not scramble decoy zzso after zzso by zzso zzso had a significant zzso effect on not only zzso binding to zzso but also on the zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso significantly decreased in zzso decoy zzso zzso To examine the mechanism of the in zzso effect of zzso decoy zzso we employed an in zzso mast cells culture zzso After zzso zzso engagement, mast cells zzso by zzso decoy zzso exhibited normal zzso release, but their zzso release zzso zzso markedly zzso We zzso report the first successful in zzso transfer of zzso decoy zzso to reduce the zzso reaction, thereby providing a new therapeutic strategy for zzso
