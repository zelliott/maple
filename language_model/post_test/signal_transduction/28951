zzso editing in the bone zzso contributes to B cell tolerance by orchestrating secondary zzso zzso in zzso B zzso We have recently shown that loss of the zzso or a zzso blockade of zzso zzso signaling pathways results in a global zzso response in which immature B cells zzso genes important for the mature B cell program and zzso genes characteristic of earlier stages of B cell zzso These observations led us to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso of the zzso and not zzso positive signals, lead to zzso induction and hence zzso zzso Supporting this hypothesis, we found that immature B cells from zzso zzso zzso mice induce zzso of a zzso bacterial artificial zzso reporter as well as zzso immature B cells following zzso zzso zzso of immature B cells with zzso leads to a striking reversal in differentiation to the zzso stage of development, consistent with the idea that zzso results in the zzso of genes required for L chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso response to zzso and editing in immature and zzso cells are inhibited by a combination of zzso zzso and calcium zzso agents that bypass zzso signaling pathways and mimic zzso zzso Thus, mimicking positive zzso signals actually zzso zzso zzso These findings support a model zzso zzso zzso editing is inhibited by zzso zzso signaling on developing B zzso zzso zzso removes this zzso zzso thereby initiating zzso zzso
