Recently, a simple procedure was zzso drinking in the dark zzso in which zzso mice zzso ethanol to the point of zzso The test consists of replacing the water with zzso ethanol in the home cage for 2 or 4 h early during the dark phase of the zzso zzso 

To determine whether the model displays zzso zzso with zzso and whether zzso or zzso mechanisms mediate excessive drinking in the zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso were administered via zzso injections immediately before offering ethanol solutions, plain tap water, or zzso sugar water to male zzso mice, and consumption was monitored over a zzso or zzso period using the DID zzso 

zzso zzso 1, or 2 zzso dose zzso decreased ethanol drinking but these same doses had no significant effect on the consumption of plain water or zzso sugar zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, and 20 zzso dose zzso reduced the consumption of ethanol and sugar water but had no effect on plain water zzso 

The DID model demonstrates zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso signaling are involved in ethanol drinking to zzso Different zzso pathways mediate high ethanol drinking as compared to water or sugar water drinking in zzso DID may be a useful screening tool to find new alcoholism medications and to discover genetic and zzso mechanisms relevant to the human zzso
