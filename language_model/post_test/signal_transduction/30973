In a recent report, we introduced zzso Range zzso Analysis zzso an intermediate approach between zzso and bottom-up zzso for the comprehensive characterization at the trace level zzso zzso of large and complex zzso In this study, we extended zzso to determine zzso the zzso changes that occur in the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso upon zzso zzso A 431 cells were zzso with zzso growth factor after which zzso was zzso at stimulation times of 0, zzso 2, and 10 zzso as well as 4 zzso High sequence coverage was obtained zzso and methods were developed for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso A total of 13 zzso sites were identified, and the estimated zzso was determined over the stimulation time points, including zzso and zzso sites in addition to zzso zzso A total of 10 zzso domain zzso sites were also identified, and major zzso at each site were zzso No change in the extent of zzso with stimulation was observed as zzso Finally potential binding partners to zzso were identified based on changes in the amount of protein pulled down with zzso as a function of time of zzso Many of the 19 proteins identified are known binding partners of zzso This work demonstrates that comprehensive characterization provides a powerful tool to aid in the study of important therapeutic zzso The detailed molecular information will prove useful in future studies in zzso
