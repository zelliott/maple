We have prepared transgenic mice whose T cells zzso express a zzso zzso combining zzso human zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso can transmit zzso signals in response to human, but not zzso zzso We used these animals to explore to what extent functional zzso expression controls the capacity of T cells to zzso in response to zzso zzso After zzso with Con A, zzso transgenic zzso and zzso T cells respond to human zzso as well as to zzso Without prior zzso they failed to zzso in response to human zzso although human zzso did prolong their zzso Thus, zzso proliferation of activated T cells requires at least one other zzso change apart from the induction of a functional zzso However, a fraction of zzso T cells zzso in human zzso without zzso stimulation or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso T cells are not zzso responsive to human zzso We conclude that although all transgenic T cells express a functional zzso zzso only some zzso T cells contain all molecules required for entry into the cell cycle in response to human zzso or zzso
