zzso the zzso of the neural zzso of fear is clearly one of the most important aims in zzso zzso zzso in response to external stimuli is considered a major mechanism underlying dynamic changes in neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic plasticity and activates signal zzso pathways mainly through two zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular pathways required for fear learning and zzso synaptic plasticity downstream of zzso we used highly defined genetic mouse models carrying single point zzso at one of these two sites zzso or zzso to examine the zzso relevance of pathways activated through these sites for zzso fear conditioning zzso as well as for synaptic plasticity as measured by field recordings obtained from zzso of different zzso zzso We show that a zzso point zzso zzso acquisition of zzso zzso synaptic zzso and zzso signaling at zzso In contrast, a zzso point zzso affects consolidation but not acquisition of zzso to tone, and also alters zzso zzso Thus, zzso receptors zzso specific zzso of fear learning and zzso synaptic plasticity through two main zzso zzso zzso
