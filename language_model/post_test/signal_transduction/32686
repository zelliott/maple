We analyze in detail the statistical properties of the spike zzso process of a zzso zzso zzso with a linear zzso and a lower bound for the zzso as often used in zzso zzso zzso zzso The spike statistics of such zzso appear to be zzso similar to conventional zzso zzso zzso which exhibit a wide variety of characteristics observed in cortical zzso We also show that, contrary to current opinion, the dynamics of a network composed of such zzso has two stable fixed points, even in the purely zzso network, corresponding to two different states of zzso zzso The zzso results are compared with zzso simulations and are found to be in good zzso
