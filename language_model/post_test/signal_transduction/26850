In this report we describe the contribution of zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso drive in tumor zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso a zzso factor induced by zzso zzso this zzso The zzso rise provoked the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and enhanced zzso zzso These changes were suppressed either by zzso zzso or by upstream blockade of zzso or zzso zzso Further, in a zzso zzso on tumor cells, zzso induced a florid zzso zzso which zzso when zzso was silenced or knocked zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell reduced zzso zzso whereas enhancing that of zzso suggesting an zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso the zzso in mice bearing the zzso zzso the zzso expression and the tumor growth, exhibited a parallel zzso In conclusion, these findings provide novel evidence that a tight cooperation between the zzso and zzso leads to a significant zzso gain in zzso cells, and provide clues for controlling the vicious zzso
