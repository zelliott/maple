Within the zzso system, zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso tissue typically causes a zzso response accompanied by an zzso induction of new blood vessels from existing ones, thereby providing nutrients and oxygen to the growing zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso however, has shown a differential effect on zzso zzso An increase in zzso growth is present, while the zzso zzso a decrease in size, even though the effect is accompanied by a characteristic zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The focus of the current study was whether the observed differences in tissue growth between zzso and zzso in response to zzso administration were paralleled by a corresponding disparity in the expression of those growth factors zzso of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso families and their zzso that are involved in the zzso zzso zzso adult zzso female rats were administered zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 or 3 zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was performed under strictly controlled conditions for zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor (as an index of zzso Image acquisition and zzso assessments of zzso intensity were conducted under blind zzso The results showed zzso zzso increases in the expression of zzso and zzso changes consistent with a normal zzso response to zzso zzso For zzso zzso tended to be most pronounced in the zzso region, although there did not appear to be a progressive increase with zzso zzso expression showed significant zzso trends in zzso and zzso zzso by 1 zzso Similar effects at 1 week were evident for zzso in zzso zzso In the anterior zzso a zzso increase in zzso was present for the 1 and 3 week treatments, and the number of zzso vessels per unit area was also increased after 3 zzso The effects indicate that even though the zzso has not been found to cause an zzso in zzso growth, a zzso rise in the expression of at least one principal zzso factor is present that may be associated with an increase in vascular zzso
