The highly expressed zzso zzso of DNA zzso protein promotes zzso in zzso and is a well established target for zzso therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso can abrogate zzso interactions to inhibit zzso zzso is the direct downstream zzso of bone zzso proteins zzso which are zzso and zzso zzso Thus, targeting zzso by HS zzso may inhibit zzso via attenuating zzso zzso We report here that a HS zzso zzso zzso inhibited the tube formation of zzso cells on zzso and their zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso zzso nearly completely blocked zzso expression in the zzso cells as demonstrated by zzso zzso analysis and further confirmed by zzso and Western zzso zzso signaling also was blocked by zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells caused the disruption of their tube formation on zzso By employing zzso crystal zzso analysis, we found that zzso strongly bound to zzso Moreover, zzso impaired zzso tube formation of zzso cells on zzso and zzso in zzso transplanted into zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells zzso in male nude zzso zzso analysis showed that both the expression of zzso and the zzso cell marker zzso were lower in the zzso tumor tissue than in the zzso zzso zzso is a potential drug candidate for zzso therapy as a tumor zzso zzso
