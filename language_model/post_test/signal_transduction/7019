zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso play critical roles in regulating zzso processes during development, zzso zzso inflammation and tissue zzso zzso signaling is best characterized in zzso cells, but a subset of human and zzso circulating zzso essential to solid tumor formation express zzso and display zzso properties consistent with zzso zzso zzso However, we have recently shown that zzso is strongly activated in zzso zzso present in zzso arthritis patient zzso zzso Here we examined the relationship between zzso expression and function during human zzso zzso zzso expression was observed under all polarization conditions, but was highest in zzso and zzso zzso zzso While zzso enhanced expression of a common restricted set of genes involved in zzso and inflammation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of multiple zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was further zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso via zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso medium from zzso zzso with zzso or zzso in combination with zzso sustained zzso zzso Our findings suggest a general role for zzso in zzso promoting the inflammatory zzso of zzso independently of polarization zzso
