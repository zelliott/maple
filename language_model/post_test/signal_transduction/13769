zzso zzso zzso is a systemic zzso disease that often has a fatal zzso Although zzso the molecular zzso is essential for its zzso an understanding of its molecular mechanism has remained zzso To search for new markers of active zzso that might help better understand the molecular basis of zzso and aid in its diagnosis, we here performed DNA zzso analysis with peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Compared to normal control, several genes were zzso or zzso in zzso patients, including zzso of the zzso level of zzso zzso or zzso an innate pattern recognition complement zzso The amount of zzso as detected by zzso was higher in the zzso of another group of zzso patients than in the zzso of control patients who zzso almost normal zzso Many of the zzso dots were also positive for zzso suggesting that the zzso cells were zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso This is not due to the difference in the number of zzso or zzso in the blood samples of zzso and control zzso Taken together, we conclude that increased zzso expression could serve as a new marker for the characterization of zzso especially when it is associated with local active zzso
