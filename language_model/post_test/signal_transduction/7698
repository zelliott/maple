zzso acid zzso is a well-known zzso hormone, but its biological function and mechanism in rice root development are less zzso Here, we describe a zzso putative zzso protein zzso zzso functioning in root development in zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that the gene was expressed largely in roots, and a fusion protein showed its zzso on the plasma zzso The primary roots in zzso transgenic rice plants zzso and curled more easily than zzso zzso roots under zzso zzso Thus, this gene was renamed zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso The transgenic primary roots were zzso the number of zzso roots increased and the number of lateral roots decreased as compared to the zzso As well, the second sheath was reduced in zzso Growth of both primary roots and second zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso No significant change of zzso level appeared in the roots between the transgenic rice line and zzso zzso of zzso involved in the zzso zzso pathway, was induced in transgenic zzso Western zzso revealed zzso induced by zzso Our results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso involved in zzso signal zzso mediates root development and zzso regulates root zzso in zzso
