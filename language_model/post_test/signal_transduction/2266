zzso zzso cells accumulate at high zzso in the skin of patients with zzso zzso zzso where they contribute to the induction and maintenance of the zzso that are characteristic for the zzso zzso of these zzso in response to successful therapy is associated with a reduction in zzso zzso cells and the appearance of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that engagement of the signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso during zzso expansion of highly polarized zzso cell populations derived from skin zzso of zzso patients, results in the generation of stable populations of zzso zzso zzso reversal of zzso cell zzso has important zzso consequences, because zzso of these zzso zzso zzso cells fail to induce zzso synthesis by zzso B cells zzso by zzso zzso Thus, highly zzso zzso zzso cell populations derived from the skin of zzso patients can be reversed into zzso cell populations that contain zzso cells and that do not support zzso zzso These results define a new mechanism to promote zzso differentiation and suggest a potential role for zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso allergic zzso
