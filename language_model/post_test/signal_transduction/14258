To study the regulation role of with neutral property to zzso zzso in the rats with cold and heat blood stasis syndromes and it's zzso 

60 rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group, 12 rats per zzso The three herb groups were orally given relative herbs zzso whose zzso were equal to 10 times the human clinical dose, normal and model control groups were orally given water, 2 zzso 20 zzso for 7 zzso zzso in rats with cold and heat blood stasis syndromes were carried on zzso In heat blood stasis zzso except normal control group, the other groups were zzso injected zzso zzso 5 zzso 1 zzso for 3 zzso hours after the last injection, zzso injected zzso dry zzso suspension, 10 zzso In cold blood stasis zzso except normal control group, the other groups were put into zzso zzso zzso 2) degrees C, 2 zzso times, 2 zzso for 7 zzso zzso draw 5 zzso abdominal zzso blood and taken abdominal zzso 6 hours and 12 hours after finishing the model in the two zzso Tested the zzso content by zzso tested the zzso protein expression by Western zzso 

zzso zzso with neutral property, could decrease the content of zzso in plasma zzso zzso zzso inhibit the expression of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in rats with heat stagnation and blood stasis syndrome, increase the plasma content of zzso zzso zzso zzso and increase the expression of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in rats with cold stagnation and blood stasis zzso zzso zzso had zzso adjustment action on zzso signal zzso 

In different internal environment of heat stagnation and blood stasis syndrome, cold stagnation and blood stasis syndrome, zzso zzso with neutral property has zzso adjustment to zzso signaling channel, which may be one of the mechanism of it's zzso zzso
