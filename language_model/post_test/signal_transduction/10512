It is now widely accepted that discrete regions of the adult brain contain stem cells that continue to generate new zzso However, it remains unclear what molecular signals define the zzso niche and how such signals act on the zzso cell populations within these zzso Here we discuss two recent studies that demonstrate the role of zzso and Sonic zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso act on zzso precursors that mature and contribute to the zzso zzso zzso whereas Sonic zzso affects the bona fide stem cells and transit amplifying cells (the partially committed progeny of stem zzso These studies further define how discrete populations of cells react to specific zzso signals provided within the zzso niche to survive, zzso and form functional mature cell zzso
