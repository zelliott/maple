zzso is a zzso for protein zzso C in activated zzso that contains at its N and C zzso two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been proposed to mediate zzso and zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso requires an intact zzso zzso domain zzso 6 to zzso In the present studies, we have identified the sites of zzso in zzso and examined their contribution to zzso zzso In human zzso activated with zzso or zzso zzso and in zzso cells expressing zzso a combination of zzso analysis and zzso zzso shows that three zzso in the intervening sequence between the two zzso zzso zzso become zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all three of these sites with zzso decreased zzso by zzso zzso and reduced zzso ability to inhibit zzso zzso by as much as zzso zzso the zzso sites with zzso zzso had a similar effect, while substitution with zzso zzso or zzso zzso produced zzso zzso that were fully active even in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances zzso activity by introducing a cluster of charges into a region adjacent to, but not zzso the zzso zzso zzso This may have an zzso effect on the zzso zzso domain, regulating its interaction with other molecules necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso
