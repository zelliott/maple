zzso are involved in key zzso processes in rice zzso zzso including the regulation of cell proliferation and grain zzso However, the in zzso action of zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso in rice zzso signaling remains zzso This study examined the function and characteristics of zzso 4 and 6 in zzso zzso was highly sensitive to zzso zzso and was capable of restoring zzso zzso reporter expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso upon treatment with 1 zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso and zzso while zzso scarcely induced zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling cascade of zzso to induce zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed in zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso might play key roles in grain zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso in rice zzso although the zzso activity between zzso was much lower than the zzso zzso zzso This indicates that the action mechanism of zzso is zzso zzso from bacterial zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in rice zzso promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot zzso further supporting an zzso in zzso function as a zzso zzso From the results of this study, zzso are zzso zzso receptors with distinctive zzso preferences in zzso
