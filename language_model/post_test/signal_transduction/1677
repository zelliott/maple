The expression of zzso zzso by the zzso resistance zzso gene is associated with the emergence of the zzso zzso in cancer zzso Human zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in liver zzso However, the underlying mechanisms are largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso efficiently activates rat zzso expression in cultured cells and in Fisher 344 zzso We recently reported that zzso of rat zzso in cultured cells by zzso involves a zzso element containing a zzso binding site located zzso to zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso resulting in degradation of zzso and zzso of zzso In this study, we report that zzso could also activate the human zzso gene in human zzso and embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso by DNA sequence located at zzso which contains a zzso binding zzso Treating zzso cells with zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso activated zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso also activated another zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a dominant activated zzso also enhanced the zzso of zzso promoter zzso by zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso by the multiple zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
