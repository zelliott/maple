zzso proteins participate in interactions between several cell types involved on the zzso of numerous cell fates during zzso We previously showed that enforced zzso of zzso expression prevented zzso of zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso cells can be induced by zzso zzso we studied whether this was also the case in zzso cells with decreased levels of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso transformation and not differentiation of zzso cells with diminished levels of zzso This result suggests that zzso is implicated in the interpretation of signals leading to zzso of zzso zzso
