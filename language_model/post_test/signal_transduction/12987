A full-length zzso of mouse type 10 17 zzso zzso (17 zzso was cloned from brain, representing the accurate zzso sequence information that rendered possible an accurate deduction of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso A comparison of sequences and three-dimensional models of this zzso revealed that structures previously reported by other groups carry either a truncated or zzso zzso zzso Fusion of the first 11 zzso of the zzso zzso to the green fluorescent protein directed the reporter protein into zzso Thus, the zzso was identified as a zzso targeting signal that accounts for the zzso zzso of the mouse zzso This zzso is normally associated with zzso not with the zzso zzso as suggested by its trivial name zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso After its zzso region was used to raise rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso showed that an abundance of this zzso could be found in zzso synaptic zzso of zzso transgenic mice, but not in normal zzso High levels of this zzso may disrupt steroid hormone zzso in zzso and contribute to zzso loss in the zzso of the mouse Alzheimer's disease zzso
