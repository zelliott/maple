Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the zzso zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso zzso formation and the development and progression of zzso and zzso zzso in a rabbit model of zzso The present study demonstrates an zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the signal zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso of the carotid artery by balloon zzso Continuous infusion of zzso (30 zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso in injured arteries in zzso Similarly, smooth muscle cells in zzso treated with zzso exhibited a zzso reduction in zzso protein expression and the subsequent reduction in zzso of the zzso zzso However, in the presence of an intact zzso zzso was zzso in response to zzso and accordingly the downstream induction of zzso expression was also zzso Thus, zzso exerts more potent zzso effects in the zzso when the zzso is zzso
