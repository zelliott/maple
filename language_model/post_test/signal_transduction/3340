Triple negative breast cancer with zzso like features zzso do not benefit from hormonal and zzso zzso As a considerable fraction of zzso shows zzso deregulation, zzso therapies have been proposed as an zzso The characterization of zzso and zzso members may therefore provide important zzso zzso 

Based on zzso and zzso features, we identified 38 zzso that were subsequently investigated for zzso in zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were studied by zzso zzso gene status by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso expression characterized the majority of zzso zzso and zzso of patients, zzso zzso gene copy number gain zzso was identified in 51% of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were detected in three cases zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes showed no zzso Overall, out of 17 patients classified as zzso 12 cases zzso showed a zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These results provide evidence that the efficacy of zzso drugs in zzso patients could be impaired by frequent zzso in the zzso zzso and suggest that zzso could benefit from tailored treatments against this zzso
