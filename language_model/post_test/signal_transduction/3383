The zzso system zzso harbors elaborated protein quality control systems in zzso zzso Recently, the UPS is emerging as an important regulator in controlling the magnitude and the duration of the steroid hormone zzso Upon steroid hormone zzso their zzso steroid zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso not only mediate zzso zzso but also undergo zzso and zzso zzso zzso Many reports have strongly suggested that UPS machinery, particularly the zzso zzso zzso are closely involved in the zzso gene expression zzso Both zzso and zzso recruitment of zzso zzso zzso often prompt the degradation of target steroid receptors and correct zzso zzso Here, we review that the deep zzso connections between zzso and zzso zzso and the UPS for the correct expression of target zzso We also emphasize that this regulatory system has a significant potential for future clinical application, including the treatment of breast and prostate zzso by zzso the degradation of related hormone zzso
