Animal models of drug discrimination have been used to examine the zzso effects of addictive zzso The zzso system is a crucial downstream signaling zzso implicated in the long-lasting zzso induced by addictive zzso We examined effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso antagonists, all of which have been reported to zzso zzso level in zzso on the zzso effects of methamphetamine zzso and zzso in zzso All these compounds inhibited the zzso effects of zzso while only zzso and zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso In addition, neither zzso nor zzso two zzso calcium channel blockers, was found to zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso may not involve the zzso of calcium zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signaling cascade may play a key role in the zzso effects of zzso and zzso and may be a potential target for the development of zzso to counter drugs of zzso
