zzso virus zzso zzso infection of normal B zzso by binding to zzso a complement zzso Since zzso unlike most zzso zzso zzso resting zzso cells, the present studies were undertaken to evaluate the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso triggered by zzso binding to zzso activate the expression of certain cellular zzso as well as the initially expressed viral zzso and thus enable zzso to zzso resting B zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso 1 zzso show that zzso binding to zzso on resting B cells increases zzso zzso levels independently of viral gene zzso A panel of five protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso all with different modes of action, exhibited a distinctive pattern of effects on the zzso induced induction of zzso zzso ranging from nearly complete zzso to no zzso The results suggest that distinct zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso zzso triggered by zzso binding to zzso zzso the five zzso showed the same pattern of effects on the earliest stages of infection zzso zzso and B cell transformation zzso and colony zzso The identical pattern of effects of these zzso and zzso zzso with diverse mechanisms of action on the zzso induced increase in both zzso and zzso zzso levels strongly suggests that their zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso which shares, at least in part, common zzso
