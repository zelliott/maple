zzso is a leading cause of death zzso zzso zzso can be a cause of severe pneumonia alone or a common pathogen in secondary pneumonia following zzso Recently, we reported that preceding influenza attenuated the Type 17 pathway, increasing the zzso zzso to secondary zzso zzso is known to regulate host defense, including playing a role in zzso zzso We examined whether zzso signaling is required for zzso zzso host defense and whether influenza infection impacted zzso zzso zzso production and subsequent Type 17 zzso zzso Mice were challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without preceding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had significantly higher zzso zzso burden, increased zzso and decreased Type 17 zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had significantly decreased zzso production versus zzso zzso infection alone at early time points following bacterial zzso zzso influenza did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was early suppression of zzso zzso suggesting an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in influenza and zzso zzso mice rescued the induction of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and improved bacterial zzso Finally, zzso zzso did not significantly rescue zzso zzso host defense during zzso in zzso mice or in mice in which zzso and zzso activity were zzso These data reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso production, resulting in zzso of Type 17 immunity and increased zzso to bacterial zzso
