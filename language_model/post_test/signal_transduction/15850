Plant disease resistance proteins commonly belong to the zzso zzso rich repeat zzso protein zzso These specialized immune proteins mediate recognition of diverse zzso zzso proteins and initiate potent defense zzso zzso exhibit a zzso architecture and each domain appears to have discrete functions depending on the stage of zzso zzso Novel proteins that were found to interact with the core zzso zzso complex regulate zzso and zzso of zzso immune zzso Recent studies have also advanced our understanding of how accessory proteins contribute to zzso zzso The dynamic nature of zzso zzso to different zzso compartments before and after zzso suggests that zzso may activate immune responses in multiple parts of the zzso In this review we highlight recent advances in understanding zzso zzso
