zzso in the zzso and the adult zzso consists of a highly organized and regulated sequence of cellular processes to form or repair muscle tissue that include cell zzso migration, and zzso Data from cell culture and in zzso experiments zzso both zzso and zzso as critical regulators of these zzso Both factors require zzso zzso zzso for signaling from their respective zzso Since zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are implicated in zzso signaling and skeletal muscle zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and adult muscle zzso as well as on primary adult muscle fiber zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in developing skeletal muscle tissue and that zzso and zzso expression is highly restricted in adult skeletal muscle to cells retaining zzso zzso These two zzso appear to be expressed exclusively and universally on zzso adult satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle zzso suggesting a role for zzso in satellite cell maintenance or zzso Once zzso all satellite cells maintain expression of zzso and zzso for at least 96 zzso also implicating these zzso in muscle zzso zzso of zzso zzso by treatment of intact zzso with zzso results in delayed proliferation and altered zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is required for proper progression of the early satellite cell zzso zzso These data suggest that, in addition to providing potentially useful new markers for satellite cells, zzso and zzso may play important regulatory roles in satellite cell zzso zzso zzso and differentiation during skeletal muscle zzso
