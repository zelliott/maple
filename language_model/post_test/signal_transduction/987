zzso zzso oxide zzso is commonly used to inhibit zzso zzso zzso However, zzso can affect a variety of different processes because of its ability to promote zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects that zzso has on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity in isolated cardiac zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso channel activity, whereas it zzso inhibited protein zzso A zzso regulation of channel activity by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited channel activity zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso effects of zzso were affected by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A, suggesting that zzso zzso is not zzso zzso zzso application of the zzso agent zzso zzso antagonized both the zzso and zzso effects of zzso Yet, following zzso dialysis with zzso only the zzso effect of zzso was zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso by zzso but not zzso application of the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso effect of zzso results from zzso of zzso zzso at an zzso site and the zzso effect is due to zzso regulation of an zzso site that affects the response of the channel to zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso state of the cell may play a critical role in modulating zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso channel in cardiac zzso
