More than two decades ago, the discovery of the first C2 domain in conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso and of its role as a zzso motif began to shed light on the zzso mechanism of this family of zzso zzso which are involved in several critical signal zzso zzso In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of the structure and the function of the different C2 zzso in zzso The C2 domain of zzso is a calcium sensor and its zzso binding to zzso is crucial for zzso zzso While the functional role of the zzso C2 domain is better zzso zzso analysis revealed that the novel C2 domain is more ancient and related to the C2 domain in the zzso zzso family, while the zzso C2 domain is first associated with zzso in zzso The C2 domain of novel zzso zzso does not contain a zzso motif but still plays a critical role in zzso zzso by regulating zzso domain interactions and consequently C2 zzso zzso in both the zzso of the zzso family and the zzso of the delta zzso Moreover, the C2 domain of the zzso of the delta family was shown to recognize zzso in a novel mode different from the ones observed for the zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso binding zzso zzso By binding to zzso the C2 domain regulates the zzso of this zzso of zzso The C2 domain was also shown to be involved in zzso interactions and binding to the zzso for activated zzso zzso thus contributing to the zzso zzso of zzso In zzso the C2 domain is a critical player that can sense the activated signaling zzso in response to external stimuli to specifically regulate the different conventional and novel zzso zzso
