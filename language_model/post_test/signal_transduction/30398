The signaling zzso Sonic zzso zzso is required for differentiation of the zzso zzso In the developing zzso zzso zzso expression is initiated at the zzso region, from where it spreads as a wave through the zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this coordinated expression of zzso we mapped the zzso region and identified a novel regulatory sequence in the first zzso of the zzso zzso This sequence contains binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso that are known zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the binding sites or zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso signaling regulates zzso expression in the zzso We provide evidence that zzso and zzso control initiation of zzso while zzso is crucial for the propagation of zzso expression through the zzso zzso experiments indicate a continued requirement of zzso and zzso zzso signaling for zzso expression after initiation at the zzso aspect of the zzso We propose a model, in which zzso and zzso initiate expression and zzso and zzso signals cooperate subsequently to promote establishment of expression throughout the zzso
