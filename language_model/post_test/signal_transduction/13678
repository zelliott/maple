zzso the pathways that are significantly impacted in a given condition is a crucial step in understanding the underlying biological zzso All approaches currently available for this purpose calculate a zzso that aims to zzso the significance of the involvement of each zzso in the given zzso These zzso were previously thought to be zzso Here we show that this is not the case, and that many pathways can considerably affect each other's zzso through a zzso zzso Although it is intuitive that various pathways could influence each other, the presence and extent of this phenomenon have not been rigorously studied and, most importantly, there is no currently available technique able to zzso the amount of such zzso Here, we show that all three major categories of zzso analysis methods zzso analysis, functional class scoring, and zzso zzso are severely influenced by zzso zzso Using real pathways and data, we show that in some cases pathways with significant zzso are not biologically zzso and that some biologically meaningful pathways with zzso zzso become statistically significant when the zzso effects of other pathways are zzso We describe a technique able to zzso zzso and correct zzso effects, as well as identify independent functional zzso We assessed this novel approach on data from four experiments involving three zzso and two zzso This method is expected to allow a better understanding of individual experiment results, as well as a more refined definition of the existing signaling pathways for specific zzso
