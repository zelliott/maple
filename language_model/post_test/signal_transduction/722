zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are emerging as potential protectors against inflammatory cardiovascular diseases including zzso and diabetic zzso However, their molecular mechanism of action within zzso remains zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso class drugs zzso or zzso zzso zzso were capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso levels and zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was completely blocked by a zzso zzso of zzso indicating an essential zzso zzso zzso the suppression of zzso signaling zzso was functional linkage to the zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso characterized by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and adherence of zzso to the activated zzso induced by high zzso These findings thus demonstrate a novel molecular action of zzso zzso to suppress the zzso signaling zzso via zzso of an zzso zzso zzso
