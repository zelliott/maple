zzso and diabetic zzso are attributable to high zzso induction of zzso cell zzso Whereas zzso signaling has been found to regulate zzso zzso and zzso the zzso role of zzso signaling in controlling high zzso zzso cell zzso is not well zzso zzso is reported that zzso signaling is required for protecting zzso zzso cells from high zzso cell zzso High zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and the subsequent nuclear zzso of zzso whereas it increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or increase in nuclear zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso or stable zzso zzso reversed zzso zzso and reduced the high zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso or zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso and zzso expression and zzso of cells adjacent to zzso in diabetic zzso and attenuated urinary protein zzso in diabetic zzso Taken together, zzso cells responded to high zzso by zzso that zzso zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is beneficial for promoting survival of zzso cells that are exposed to high zzso zzso
