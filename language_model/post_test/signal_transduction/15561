Bone zzso human zzso stem cells zzso are known to survive in zzso media, when most normal zzso cells do not zzso We found that the zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in this cellular zzso Under this culture condition, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of this zzso is localized in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso of this zzso with zzso a zzso zzso elicits a zzso zzso death in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso added zzso zzso the zzso effect, restoring cell survival, and suggesting that zzso signal is essential for zzso survival under serum deprivation zzso zzso these findings demonstrate for the first time an zzso survival zzso of zzso driven by a zzso zzso Such a survival mechanism might be involved in the maintenance of the zzso population within their bone zzso zzso
