The mechanisms underlying zzso neurotransmitter release remain zzso Here, we found that zzso exposure of zzso cortical zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso release in a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso release occurred through the zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso I, zzso and zzso but not of zzso or zzso increased through the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso release and zzso expression depended on zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was necessary for the zzso of zzso release and zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso but not of zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor attenuated zzso long-lasting zzso zzso As zzso rapidly zzso zzso transmission through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso activity might sustain zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso the zzso and zzso system zzso which may be important for the regulation of synaptic zzso
