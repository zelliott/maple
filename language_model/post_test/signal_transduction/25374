Rice zzso is a sequence zzso of zzso zzso However, its molecular function is zzso We show here that zzso zzso plants, which developed spontaneous zzso on the leaves, have enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causing bacterial blight zzso This resistance was associated with increased zzso of salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso genes and suppressed zzso of zzso acid zzso the direct precursor of zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso plants also showed suppressed production of zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso gene family, which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso the formation of zzso The zzso zzso and enhanced bacterial resistance of the zzso plants was partly zzso by the treatment with zzso zzso treatment was associated with decreased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso the inhibitor of zzso zzso promoted expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a negative zzso zzso in rice bacterial zzso In the zzso interaction, zzso zzso promotes the synthesis of zzso that, in turn, suppresses zzso and zzso zzso zzso
