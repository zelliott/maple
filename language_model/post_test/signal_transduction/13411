The level of zzso expression closely zzso with the zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells, the proliferation of human cancer cells, and the differentiation of zzso and muscle zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso cell proliferation and differentiation remains zzso Here, we have shown that zzso growth factors that stimulate zzso cell proliferation lead to dramatic reductions in zzso zzso In addition, using an in zzso zzso zzso system, we studied the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso formation zzso zzso cell zzso using human zzso zzso cells zzso We showed that the level of zzso zzso expression increased in a zzso manner when zzso cells underwent differentiation and that the maximum level of zzso expression occurred just prior to the formation of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso via an zzso gene delivery system, clearly accelerated zzso cell zzso formation and led to a dramatic approximately zzso increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso via an zzso zzso approach, reduced the number of zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso with the unique function of zzso in interacting with key signaling zzso delivery of the zzso scaffolding domain into the zzso of living zzso cells was also sufficient to enhance zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that zzso and the zzso scaffolding domain play an important positive role in the regulation of zzso cell zzso a prerequisite step in the process of zzso
