The zzso zzso signaling zzso is crucial for pattern formation during zzso zzso Although zzso characterized in zzso zzso zzso have been identified for zzso but not all, genes in the zzso Analysis of zzso in zzso demonstrates that zzso of fused zzso interacts genetically with genes zzso proteins in the zzso signal zzso pathway, and its protein product physically interacts with two of the proteins in the zzso zzso We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of chicken and mouse zzso of zzso The chick and mouse proteins are zzso identical and zzso similar at the zzso acid level to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in the developing zzso with higher levels in zzso that are known to be patterned by zzso zzso The chick zzso protein can physically interact with factors known to function in zzso signal zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regulators zzso and zzso This interaction may be significant for zzso regulation, as zzso zzso enhances the ability of zzso proteins to bind DNA in zzso mobility shift zzso
