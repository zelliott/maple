The growth cones of developing zzso respond to specific guidance cues in their zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso signaling molecules from protein families that are best known for their roles as zzso in specifying cell fate can function as zzso guidance zzso These signaling molecules seem to act directly on the growth cone and thus are likely to activate zzso signaling pathways that are coupled to the zzso
