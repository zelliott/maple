Recent research has revealed a zzso role for the zzso zzso in the regulation of aging and zzso among zzso Here we show that the stabilization of the zzso zzso caused by deletion of zzso or zzso leads to zzso of the Ras signaling zzso The zzso rise in zzso zzso zzso levels leads to the loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and cell zzso We have established a zzso link between Ras signaling and zzso by demonstrating that zzso production in zzso cells is dependent on the zzso binding region of the zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the artificial zzso of zzso directly mimics the zzso zzso displayed by zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso in inducing zzso zzso functions primarily through the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso This zzso represents the first defined link between environmental zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
