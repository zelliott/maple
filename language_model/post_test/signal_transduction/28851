zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are important for zzso recognition and signal zzso We used zzso zzso to identify the role of two novel and adjacent zzso in the zzso zzso II domain, zzso and zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso charged zzso at position zzso in zzso zzso zzso function by substituting it with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the effect of the zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso zzso on the affinity and potency of structurally diverse zzso was zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, were zzso for zzso affinity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso behaved similar to wild zzso The zzso zzso zzso attenuated the potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the stimulation of zzso zzso without affecting their binding zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso selectively altered zzso potency without altering zzso zzso It was surprising to note that the double zzso zzso displayed a drastic and synergistic increase (by approximately zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso The profound loss of function in the zzso double zzso suggests that, although these zzso are not obligatory for zzso recognition, they play a synergistic and crucial role in modulating signal zzso
