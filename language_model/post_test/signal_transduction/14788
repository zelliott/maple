To zzso the role of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso colitis zzso and provide experimental evidence that zzso inhibitor zzso can be used as a possible novel approach for treatment of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso were collected from 30 UC patients, 22 males and 8 zzso aged 35 zzso 11, during zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso 10 zzso beyond the zzso zzso were collected from 15 patients with zzso cancer, 9 males and 6 zzso aged 40 zzso 9, as normal zzso The samples underwent pathological examination and zzso Another zzso of zzso zzso were cultured and divided into 3 groups: UC + zzso group, zzso zzso 10, zzso an inhibitor of zzso pathway, of the concentration of zzso zzso was zzso UC control group zzso zzso 10, without addition of zzso and zzso normal zzso tissue group zzso zzso zzso zzso hours after the culture, zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso was used to detect the content of tumor necrosis factor zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso The A value of zzso in the zzso zzso of the UC control group was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of the normal control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the positive area of the UC control group was zzso zzso 58, significantly larger than that of the normal control group zzso zzso 29, P zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso in zzso zzso of the UC + zzso group was 135 zzso 11, significantly lower than that of the UC control group zzso zzso 39, P zzso zzso however, still significantly higher than that of the normal control group zzso zzso 5, P zzso zzso zzso The A value of zzso in the zzso zzso biopsy specimens of the UC + zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that of the UC control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso however, still significantly higher than that of the normal control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the positive area of the UC + zzso group was zzso zzso 50, significantly lower than that of the UC control group zzso zzso 94, P zzso zzso however, still significantly higher than that of the normal control group zzso zzso 30, P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is a critical factor in regulating the expression of zzso zzso and plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the levels of relevant zzso in UC by zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, zzso may be a novel approach for the treatment of zzso
