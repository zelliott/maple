The development of zzso zzso and spines is essential for zzso information processing, and abnormal zzso structures and/or zzso in spine zzso are consistent features of zzso in patients with mental zzso We identify the neural zzso family member zzso as a critical zzso of zzso tree complexity and spine zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso branching and increases the complexity of zzso spines and zzso zzso and functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and spine zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso in an otherwise unaffected zzso in the intact mouse zzso by in zzso zzso confirm these zzso The zzso domain of zzso drives both zzso branching and spine zzso The zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso and protein zzso C zzso are important for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso spine zzso is independent of zzso but depends on zzso Thus, our findings reveal a novel switch of specificity in signaling leading to zzso process differentiation in consecutive zzso zzso
