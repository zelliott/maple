The zzso family member zzso zzso is critical for optimal zzso expansion and survival of T zzso However, the zzso targets of zzso in zzso T cells are not fully zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso family zzso is regulated by zzso in zzso zzso T zzso In contrast to zzso T cells, zzso zzso T cells failed to maintain A1 expression driven by zzso zzso enforced zzso stimulation promoted A1 zzso In both situations, the expression of A1 directly correlated with zzso T cell zzso In addition, zzso expression of A1 in zzso zzso T cells reversed their survival zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, forced expression of A1 in zzso T cells from zzso mice restored the ability of these T cells to suppress tumor growth in a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso signals regulate zzso T cell survival at least in part through maintaining expression of the zzso zzso zzso and provide new insight into the mechanism by which zzso may impact zzso zzso
