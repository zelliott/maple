zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso are central to normal zzso function and are implicated in zzso disease initiation and zzso Regulators of zzso signaling zzso are critical to defining zzso signal zzso yet the role of zzso proteins in the liver is poorly zzso The aims of this study were to determine zzso expression in normal and transformed zzso tissue and cells, and address the function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was determined in human and rat zzso tissue and cell zzso zzso approaches were used to alter zzso expression in zzso cells, effects on cell function measured, and zzso association with specific zzso zzso Using these approaches zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso in human and rat zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in normal zzso isolated zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso cells demonstrated that zzso proteins were not zzso modified in zzso cells, and zzso expression is governed by protein degradation and not via zzso Notwithstanding inherently low zzso protein levels, altering zzso expression profoundly affected zzso cell zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso interaction demonstrated zzso associates with both zzso and zzso in zzso cells of human and rat zzso In conclusion, these data demonstrate that, despite difficulties in measuring zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso and plays a central role in regulating transformed zzso zzso
