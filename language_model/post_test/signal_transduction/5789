Nuclear factor zzso zzso has been clearly linked to the zzso of multiple inflammatory diseases including zzso The central role that zzso zzso zzso plays in regulating zzso signaling in response to inflammatory stimuli has made this zzso an attractive target for therapeutic zzso Although diverse chemical classes of zzso zzso have been identified, the binding zzso of these zzso has limited the scope of their zzso In addition, safety assessments of zzso zzso based on a comprehensive understanding of the zzso relationships have yet to be zzso Here, we describe a novel, zzso and highly selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso which binds zzso tightly with a relatively slow off zzso In zzso cells and animal models, zzso suppresses zzso cellular events, including zzso zzso and degradation, zzso zzso and DNA binding activity, the expression of inflammatory zzso and joint zzso zzso was zzso in a chronic model of arthritis with no adverse effects at zzso zzso zzso zzso from its ability to bind tightly to zzso as a novelty, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso activity correlated very well with its ability to zzso the fate of zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso We ultimately directly linked zzso activity ex zzso and in zzso to markers of inflammation with the inhibitor plasma zzso Thus, zzso represents a powerful tool to further gain insight into the mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso signaling and zzso zzso as a therapeutic zzso
