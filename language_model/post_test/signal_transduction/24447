Mice zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso challenged zzso 21 days later, and compared with zzso allergic zzso The zzso mice showed significant decreases in airway zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, pulmonary levels of zzso were decreased in the zzso mice, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, levels of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as well as serum zzso levels were similar in the two zzso Transfer of zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice into zzso zzso mice did not restore zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso production and zzso zzso were not restored during the cellular transfer zzso Thus, it appears that zzso expression contributes to a type 2 process such as zzso zzso production and zzso In additional studies, competent allergic mice were treated with zzso locally in the airways at the time of zzso zzso These latter studies also demonstrated a decrease in zzso Altogether, these data suggest that zzso pathways play a role locally within the airway for the zzso of the zzso zzso
