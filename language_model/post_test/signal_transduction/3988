zzso is an inner membrane protein present in zzso coli that is important for zzso and required for zzso gene zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which then binds to the zzso promoters to regulate their zzso An zzso truncated form of the zzso zzso was used to characterize the zzso reaction in zzso Using a filter binding zzso we report the first direct zzso of the zzso activity, including the apparent affinity for zzso of 200 zzso The zzso reaction is dependent on zzso and the zzso has the expected stability of a zzso zzso it is stable in base and less stable in acid at room zzso The addition of zzso and zzso to solutions containing zzso resulted in an zzso zzso zzso activity that was not zzso The in zzso zzso activity of zzso and two zzso that were deficient in zzso expression were studied using an immune complex zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso exhibited zzso activity that was identical to that of the zzso zzso while a zzso located close to the zzso site showed a significant decrease in both zzso and zzso zzso These data provide support for models of zzso consisting of separate sensing and zzso zzso
