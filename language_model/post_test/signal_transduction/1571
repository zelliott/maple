The zzso of three members of the zzso calcium sensor zzso family were studied in zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso it was found that their zzso differed dramatically in resting zzso zzso had a distinct predominantly zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso was present zzso throughout the zzso Upon the zzso of zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso to the same zzso compartment as zzso Another member of the family, zzso zzso also zzso to this region after a rise in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells using zzso caused loss of zzso and zzso delta in the absence of zzso but in the presence of 10 zzso zzso both proteins zzso to and were retained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was unchanged in zzso cells regardless of calcium zzso The zzso of zzso was unaffected by zzso in all functional zzso hands, indicating that its zzso was independent of zzso A minimal zzso motif zzso fused to zzso resulted in similar zzso zzso showing that zzso of these proteins is because of the exposure of the zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso of the zzso motif of zzso and zzso that resulted in both proteins remaining zzso even at elevated zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso and zzso zzso concentration in zzso zzso cells demonstrated the zzso of the zzso switch in living cells and showed that zzso rapidly zzso with a zzso of approximately 12 s after a short lag period when zzso was zzso These results demonstrate that closely related zzso sensor proteins use their zzso groups in distinct ways in zzso in a manner that will determine the time course of zzso signal zzso
