zzso of zzso with zzso tuberculosis or exposure to zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso for zzso h zzso gamma zzso zzso major zzso complex class II zzso expression by a mechanism involving zzso receptors zzso zzso tuberculosis was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso processing activity induced by zzso but not by zzso zzso suggesting zzso of zzso gene zzso We designed an approach to test the ability of zzso zzso cells to respond to zzso To model chronic infection with zzso tuberculosis with accompanying prolonged zzso zzso zzso were infected with zzso tuberculosis or incubated with zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso for 24 h prior to the addition of zzso zzso gene expression studies were then used to determine whether prolonged zzso signaling by zzso tuberculosis broadly zzso zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso Of 347 zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso inhibited induction of 42 and zzso zzso Key genes or gene products were also examined by quantitative reverse zzso and flow zzso confirming and extending the results obtained by zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis inhibited zzso induction of genes involved in zzso zzso processing, zzso zzso and recruitment of T zzso These effects were largely dependent on zzso differentiation factor 88, zzso a role for zzso Thus, prolonged zzso signaling by zzso tuberculosis zzso certain zzso responses to zzso particularly those related to zzso zzso zzso This zzso may promote zzso tuberculosis evasion of zzso responses and persistence of infection in zzso
