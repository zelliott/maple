zzso bypass zzso surgery zzso a controlled systemic inflammatory response characterized by a zzso storm, zzso and transient zzso zzso However, the responsiveness of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases throughout the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the major signaling zzso involved in zzso zzso of zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso production by zzso 

zzso patients that underwent zzso surgical correction of simple zzso heart defects were enrolled zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso and plasma samples were isolated at consecutive time zzso Patient plasma samples were added back to zzso obtained zzso for ex zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso production was measured by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso by patient plasma was assessed by Western zzso A zzso zzso inhibitor was used to block zzso zzso We found that plasma samples obtained 4 h after surgery, regardless of zzso zzso treatment, zzso inhibited zzso zzso but not zzso synthesis by zzso This was not associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso production in the presence of zzso patient zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso signaling plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso synthesis by human zzso in the course of systemic inflammation in zzso Thus, zzso might be a potential molecular target for pharmacological intervention in clinical syndromes characterized by systemic zzso
