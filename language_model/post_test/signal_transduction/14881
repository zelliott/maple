zzso protein zzso zzso is a key component of a zzso cascade that regulates energy balance at the cellular zzso Our recent research has raised the possibility that zzso may also function to couple hypoxic zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso channel zzso and hence zzso carotid body type I cell zzso Thus, in addition to maintaining the cellular energy state zzso may act as the primary zzso sensor and zzso of hypoxic zzso in type I zzso These findings provide a unifying link between two previously separate theories pertaining to zzso in the carotid body, namely the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that in addition to its effects at the cellular level the zzso zzso cascade can mediate vital zzso mechanisms essential for meeting the zzso needs of the whole zzso
