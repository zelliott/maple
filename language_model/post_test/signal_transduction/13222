The protein hormone zzso zzso was first discovered as an anterior zzso factor capable of stimulating milk production in zzso We now know that zzso has over 300 different functions in zzso In fish, zzso plays an important role in freshwater zzso by preventing both the loss of zzso and the zzso of zzso This paper will review what is currently known about the structure and evolution of fish zzso and its mechanisms of action in relation to the maintenance of zzso zzso Historically, functional studies of fish zzso were carried out using zzso zzso and the results varied greatly between experiments and zzso In some cases this zzso was due to the ability of these zzso to bind to both growth hormone and zzso zzso In fact, a recurring theme in the literature is that the actions of zzso cannot be generalized to all fish due to marked differences between zzso Many of the effects of zzso on zzso balance are specific to zzso fish, which is appropriate given that they frequently experience sudden changes in environmental zzso Much of the recent work has focused on the isolation and characterization of fish zzso and their zzso These studies have provided the necessary tools to obtain a better understanding of the evolution of zzso and its role in zzso
