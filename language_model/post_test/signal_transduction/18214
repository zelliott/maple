zzso zzso of zzso calcium concentration zzso and tension were performed to clarify whether the mechanisms which cause the zzso Y zzso contraction and zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso responses are linked to a single or different zzso zzso in rat zzso small zzso In resting zzso zzso moderately elevated zzso and zzso These effects were antagonized by the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a near 3 fold increase in sensitivity to zzso but did not significantly modify the zzso relationship for this zzso zzso zzso competitively antagonized the zzso response to zzso in arteries zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In arteries activated by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso induced a maximum relaxation and a return of zzso to resting zzso zzso completely inhibited these zzso The zzso responses to zzso in arteries zzso relaxed with either sodium zzso zzso or zzso were not significantly higher than those evoked by the zzso at resting tension, in contrast to the zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso competitively antagonized the contraction to zzso in zzso arteries with a zzso of zzso zzso field stimulation zzso at zzso zzso caused large zzso in arteries relaxed with either zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso These responses to zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso Similar zzso in resting, zzso arteries did not produce any zzso The present results suggest that different zzso pathways are linked to a single zzso zzso zzso in intact rat zzso small zzso and provide little support for involvement of other zzso zzso receptors in the zzso responses to zzso zzso released zzso also seems to act through zzso zzso and may serve primarily as an inhibitor of zzso
