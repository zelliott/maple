In this study, we determined zzso preferences for compound 43, a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso potent zzso zzso in many experimental in zzso zzso Their effects have been suggested to be zzso through binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso 1 or the zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the two members of the zzso family expressed in zzso zzso 43 activates all zzso functions investigated, whereas zzso zzso a unique zzso zzso suggested to involve zzso binding as an early zzso step, but not a transient rise in zzso zzso We show that compound 43 can activate not only zzso but also zzso the other zzso zzso in the zzso family, and zzso is actually the preferred zzso in human zzso and possibly also in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from two commercial sources were used, and neither of these induced any zzso of zzso as measured in an zzso zzso zzso zzso The conclusions drawn from these experiments are that neither compound 43 nor zzso works as zzso zzso in zzso findings of importance for a proper interpretation of results obtained with these compounds as regulators of zzso
