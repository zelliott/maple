zzso and zzso zzso targets of the zzso zzso zzso are components of a highly zzso signaling network that couples zzso availability and cell zzso To gain insight into the molecular basis underlying zzso zzso we used cell zzso and zzso zzso to examine the physical environment of zzso We found that the majority of zzso associates with a zzso compartment along with at least four other zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso electron zzso we observed that zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso clusters to regions adjacent to the plasma membrane and within the cell interior, often in association with characteristic zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and zzso electron zzso experiments confirmed that zzso associates with both zzso as well as zzso at these zzso zzso In contrast, we find that zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso interacts zzso with zzso These findings provide evidence for the existence of zzso signaling complexes that contain distinct as well as overlapping zzso That these complexes zzso to a zzso compartment suggests an intimate relationship between zzso signaling and zzso zzso
