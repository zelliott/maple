The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a stem zzso protein presumed to be a precursor of a zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso applied to in zzso zzso zzso determined the structure of a modified zzso acid zzso zzso which was derived from a zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced shoot and root zzso consumption as cells differentiated into other zzso displaying the typical zzso of transgenic plants zzso zzso These results suggest that the functional zzso of zzso is zzso
