We examined zzso protein synthesis after a prolonged blockade of action zzso alone and after a blockade of both action zzso and miniature zzso synaptic events zzso Relative to controls, zzso exposed to a prolonged blockade of action zzso showed diminished protein zzso zzso in which both action zzso and zzso were blocked showed enhanced protein zzso suggesting that zzso inhibit zzso zzso When zzso were acutely blocked or zzso an immediate increase or decrease, respectively, in zzso translation was zzso Taken together, these results reveal a role for miniature synaptic events in the acute regulation of zzso protein synthesis in zzso
