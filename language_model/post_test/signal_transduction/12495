Recent progress in basic research has enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of normal zzso zzso and their zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute to an entire spectrum of zzso liver diseases and can cause zzso zzso syndromes or determine zzso and disease progression in acquired zzso zzso zzso is associated with complex zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso participating in zzso zzso zzso nuclear receptors for zzso acids and other zzso compounds play a key role in the regulation of genes required for zzso zzso zzso interventions in zzso may aim at modulating such novel regulatory zzso This review will zzso the principles of molecular zzso in zzso and will give an overview of potential clinical zzso
