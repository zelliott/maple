The present study aimed to explore the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso production and zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso under zzso insult and the related signaling zzso 

Using transient right middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and zzso deprivation for 2 h as the model of zzso injury in zzso and in zzso zzso quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso zzso linked zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate location of zzso zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and the changes of signaling zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso with the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso production and increased zzso production in the zzso group as compared with simple zzso group both in zzso and in zzso zzso deprivation and zzso of zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso and zzso response element binding protein zzso and reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso and deprivation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso as well as expression of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso and zzso the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso an important zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathway, decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso plays a role in the production of zzso and zzso in zzso under transient zzso condition and the related signaling pathways may be zzso and zzso respectively, and that zzso probably exists between zzso
