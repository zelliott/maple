Increased zzso is commonly observed in zzso plaques and associated with zzso of zzso zzso This study aims to investigate whether zzso accumulated at the site of zzso promotes zzso through affecting the growth and function of zzso zzso cells zzso and the possible mechanism zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso promoted a significant increase in zzso formation in zzso plugs embedded in zzso and enhanced the proliferation and zzso gene expression in zzso in zzso zzso migration response and the capability to incorporate into the vascular networks were markedly enhanced in zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso zzso significantly attenuated the effect of zzso on cell zzso However, the enhanced migration response induced by zzso was significantly suppressed by the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso induced significant increase in zzso oxygen species zzso production and zzso zzso response of zzso was substantially reduced by treatment with zzso zzso these data support that zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso and zzso signaling zzso which in turn promotes the cell proliferation and function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
