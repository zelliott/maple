zzso amplification in signal zzso zzso regulated by zzso cycles and zzso results from a new type of zzso which is fundamentally different from that of zzso This type of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 105, zzso is analyzed in this paper through zzso models for molecular zzso zzso analysis is developed through a series of models with different levels of complexity, from which a simple conceptual model based on linear zzso is zzso The following are zzso zzso When both zzso and zzso are zzso the distribution of the number of activated zzso molecules is zzso With increasing zzso activity, the peak of the distribution continuously moves toward zzso zzso zzso When the zzso is zzso zzso zzso order, the distribution is zzso zzso When both zzso are zzso the distribution is zzso zzso zzso to an abrupt switching of the peak position of the distribution from 0 to zzso The theory is zzso to a wide range of processes in cell signaling including the specificity and sensitivity of zzso zzso
