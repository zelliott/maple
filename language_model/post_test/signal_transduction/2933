The zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates tissue patterning during development, including patterning and growth of limbs and face, but whether zzso signaling plays a role in adult kidney remains zzso In this study, using a panel of zzso mice, we show that the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and sonic zzso zzso are expressed in zzso zzso zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed exclusively in adjacent zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a zzso signaling zzso In two models of zzso fibrosis, Indian zzso zzso was zzso with a dramatic zzso of downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells underwent zzso zzso expansion during fibrosis, and both zzso and zzso cells differentiated into zzso muscle zzso zzso In the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso triggered cell zzso suggesting a possible role for this zzso in the regulation of cell cycle progression of zzso zzso during the development of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso induction in zzso but did not decrease kidney zzso However, the zzso induction of zzso was unaffected by zzso suggesting the existence of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso This study is the first detailed description of zzso zzso signaling in adult zzso which indicates a possible role for zzso signaling in zzso chronic kidney zzso
