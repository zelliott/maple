Marginal zone B cells zzso participate in the early immune response to several zzso In this study, we show that in zzso mice infected with zzso zzso zzso T cells displayed a greater zzso potential and generated more zzso memory cells compared with infected wild type zzso The frequency of zzso zzso zzso T cells was also increased in zzso zzso B cells were able to capture zzso which was associated with zzso of surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso presented zzso zzso to zzso T cells in zzso zzso of zzso also enhanced T cell responses and led to a decrease in the zzso burden but did not alter the generation of zzso memory T zzso Thus, zzso appear to suppress protective T cell responses during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso
