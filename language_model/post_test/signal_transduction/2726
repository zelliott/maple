We carried out studies with zzso coli to determine the site at which the zzso pathways for taxis to oxygen and to zzso of the zzso zzso transport system zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Using genetic zzso of the pathways in a zzso strain, we determined that all pathways examined required the products of the genes zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we conclude that both the zzso and zzso pathways zzso at zzso the zzso zzso product of zzso
