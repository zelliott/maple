zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently discovered zzso zzso zzso thought to be zzso zzso In this work, we have investigated whether zzso has a key role in zzso zzso VI zzso zzso This study indicates that zzso is expressed in human and zzso zzso and is able to associate with zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso zzso as well as enhanced zzso zzso functional zzso In addition, shorter bleeding times and a zzso zzso were observed in mice lacking zzso We therefore propose that zzso is the primary zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and thus functions as a negative regulator of zzso signaling in zzso
