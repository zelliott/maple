Many genetic zzso that contribute to zzso zzso and progression have been zzso One goal of such studies is to identify zzso that would serve as diagnostic zzso markers or zzso A significant advance is the observation that zzso zzso loss identified zzso zzso and a subset of high-grade zzso patients who responded to chemotherapy and had longer survival zzso Combined zzso and zzso loss was a predictor of prolonged survival of patients having pure zzso Such markers eventually may be used to identify patients upfront who would benefit from treatment, while sparing patients who would not zzso Although many molecular participants involved in the zzso pathways that promote zzso zzso and invasion have been zzso there are still many gaps in zzso zzso It is expected that the use of the human zzso project information and databases such as zzso in combination with techniques such as zzso zzso and zzso will facilitate greatly the identification of novel genes that contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso will permit the construction of zzso screening tools that will permit the identification of zzso zzso and zzso so that zzso therapies can be zzso
