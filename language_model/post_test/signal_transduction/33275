Plasma zzso profiles, intermittent in adult male and continuous in adult female rats, respectively, activate unique patterns of gene zzso in male and female rat zzso zzso but not zzso zzso exposure activates liver zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso leading to nuclear zzso and is proposed to play a key role in zzso zzso zzso liver gene zzso The mechanisms underlying the zzso pattern dependence of zzso zzso are presently investigated using a rat zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso or zzso zzso leading to zzso of the zzso activity of zzso the major zzso form present in these zzso zzso zzso zzso required a full 20 zzso at a zzso zzso concentration of 50 zzso suggesting that hormone binding leading to zzso zzso is a relatively slow zzso Repeat cycles of zzso zzso led to repeat cycles of zzso zzso followed by zzso similar to rat liver in zzso Full responsiveness to succeeding zzso zzso required a minimum zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso but was independent of new protein zzso Continuous zzso exposure led to zzso of activated zzso consistent with the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso observed in female rat zzso The rapid zzso of zzso after termination of a zzso pulse involved zzso zzso as a key first step and could be blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso These studies establish that zzso is responsive to the zzso pattern of zzso stimulation and demonstrate a role for both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso this zzso signaling apparatus so that it may respond to subsequent rounds of zzso pulse zzso
