Nerve injury leads to the release of a number of zzso which have been shown to play an important role in cellular zzso after peripheral nerve zzso The members of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso gene family are the main zzso in the signal zzso zzso of zzso After zzso zzso proteins are transported into the nucleus and exhibit zzso zzso Following zzso in rat zzso facial and zzso zzso a transient increase of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected using in zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Of the investigated zzso zzso only zzso protein was significantly zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by zzso on position zzso and enhanced nuclear zzso was found within 3 h in zzso and after 1 day in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obvious for more than 3 zzso In contrast, none of these changes was found in response to zzso of zzso Clarke's nucleus zzso although all the investigated models express zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules after peripheral nerve zzso suggests changes in the responsiveness of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso as a zzso factor, which is expressed early and is activated persistently until the time of zzso might be involved in the switch from the zzso gene expression to an zzso zzso activated only after peripheral nerve zzso
