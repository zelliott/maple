zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso factors, whereas similar induction of the zzso gene is thought to require additional zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso failed to activate zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso of neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso was zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso was traced to a low cellular level of this protein because of its higher rate of degradation in zzso zzso As anticipated, in several zzso derivatives of zzso cells expressing different levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and induction of zzso zzso by zzso was restored fully, although the defects in other responses to zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso also was induced strongly in these cells in response to zzso demonstrating that the zzso of zzso and zzso is not zzso This conclusion was confirmed in zzso cells zzso zzso by blocking zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is sufficient to induce the zzso of genes with simple promoters such as zzso as well as complex promoters such as zzso
