The zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso influencing zzso zzso migration, and survival of the zzso zzso However, pathways of zzso zzso signaling and molecular mechanisms, which regulate specific cellular responses to the zzso of the zzso in zzso remain incompletely zzso Here, by using the genetically altered mouse zzso expressing an zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated zzso cellular responses to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It was anticipated that such zzso would either trigger uncontrolled proliferation of the zzso or stimulate zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso we found that zzso signaling from the zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso and zzso but significantly promoted migration of the zzso both in zzso and in zzso We also showed that such signaling is not associated with zzso transformation of the zzso zzso Taken together, our observations suggest that, in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily responsible for transmission of zzso signals, which may antagonize proliferation and zzso Our data also provide an additional explanation as to why zzso zzso lose zzso expression during melanoma zzso
