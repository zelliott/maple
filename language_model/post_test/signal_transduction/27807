Even though the zzso of zzso receptors by zzso is well zzso it is not known where on the cell surface zzso between the two zzso systems takes zzso The recent finding that both populations of receptors are concentrated in cell surface zzso zzso that the confinement of the two receptors to this space might facilitate their zzso Here we show that stimulation of zzso receptors in zzso with zzso causes a zzso of zzso receptors in the same membrane fraction to become zzso on zzso zzso with zzso zzso the binding of zzso to its zzso markedly zzso Loss of zzso binding is partially blocked by zzso zzso zzso Despite the close proximity of the two receptors in zzso we saw no evidence that zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that these two zzso systems are highly organized in zzso
