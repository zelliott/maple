zzso regulation plays a significant role in the biological response of bacteria to changing environmental zzso zzso mapping zzso regulatory networks is an important step not only in understanding how bacteria sense and interpret their environment but also to identify the functions involved in biological responses to specific zzso Recent experimental and zzso developments have facilitated the characterization of regulatory networks on a zzso scale in model zzso In addition, the zzso of complete zzso sequences has encouraged comparative analyses to detect zzso regulatory elements and zzso regulatory networks in other less well-studied zzso However, zzso regulation appears to evolve zzso thus, creating challenges for the transfer of knowledge to zzso zzso Nevertheless, the mechanisms and constraints driving the evolution of regulatory networks have been the subjects of numerous zzso and several models have been zzso Overall, the contributions of zzso zzso and horizontal gene transfer are zzso Finally, the rapid evolution of regulatory networks plays a significant role in the remarkable capacity of bacteria to adapt to new or changing zzso zzso the characteristics of environmental niches determine the selective pressures and can shape the structure of regulatory network zzso
