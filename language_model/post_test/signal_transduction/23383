The zzso zzso zzso is essential in zzso of the central nervous system, as was revealed by the analysis of conditional zzso mouse zzso The molecular basis of its zzso functions, however, is still incompletely zzso Here we show by zzso electron zzso and zzso density preparation that zzso is located zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso as well as zzso target gene zzso are reduced in zzso zzso In control zzso zzso promotes zzso release of the zzso zzso domain zzso However, pull-down and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no direct interaction between the zzso and either zzso or target gene zzso On the other hand, zzso degradation of the zzso scaffold protein zzso was impaired in the absence of zzso whereas its zzso was increased, indicating that zzso influences the composition of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was impaired in zzso zzso These results show a role of zzso in the regulation and turnover of synaptic zzso which may contribute to the reduced zzso branching and to the neurological zzso observed in the absence of zzso
