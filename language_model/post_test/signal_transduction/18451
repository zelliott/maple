zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso has growth promoting activity on human peripheral T cells and analyzed the possible underlying signal zzso zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso or zzso normal human zzso in a zzso manner but not that of resting zzso It was noted that zzso alone could induce a significant proliferation of zzso T zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the zzso of zzso proliferation in each zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso Considering that zzso signals have been reported to involve zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso has zzso effects on T cells that are possibly zzso by zzso zzso and may play a role in not only migration but also the zzso or maintenance of T zzso
