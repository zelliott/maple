zzso II zzso zzso is an zzso with a central role in cardiovascular zzso and actions in several zzso including the adrenal zzso zzso brain, heart, smooth muscle cells and sympathetic nervous zzso At these levels it is involved in cellular proliferation and zzso cellular migration, zzso synthesis and release of various zzso such as zzso growth factor and zzso and in the synthesis of zzso zzso Traditionally, zzso II was considered a systemic hormone regulating blood pressure, zzso release and sodium zzso However, nowadays it is known that this zzso is also formed at the tissue level in the brain, kidney and heart, suggesting local zzso and zzso zzso At the vascular level, with the exception of zzso all other components of this system are locally produced in vascular zzso smooth muscle cells or zzso zzso In the heart all the components have also been found and their response to zzso nervous and mechanical stimuli suggests a working local zzso zzso II exerts its biological action through two main zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is responsible for many of the zzso effects of zzso II in zzso zzso zzso brain and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is higher in fetal zzso especially in zzso tissue (like the zzso zzso and zzso decreasing after zzso Its effects are frequently opposite to those zzso zzso the zzso zzso Its role in cardiovascular zzso is not yet zzso zzso II recruits a complex cascade of zzso second zzso with different patterns of zzso zzso immediate (in zzso early (in minutes) and late (in zzso Clinical trials using zzso converting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown improvement in morbidity and mortality in hypertension, zzso heart failure and after zzso zzso Although many of the mechanisms underlying these actions are not fully zzso there are no doubts about the beneficial effects of zzso this system in the treatment of several cardiovascular zzso
