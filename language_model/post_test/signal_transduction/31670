In this article, we describe our work on graph mining as applied to the cellular signaling pathways in the Signal zzso zzso Environment zzso We present new zzso and a zzso tool that can help biologists discover relationships between pathways by looking at structural zzso within the zzso We address the problem of determining zzso relationships by using two data mining zzso zzso and zzso In the first approach, our tool brings similar pathways to the same zzso and in the second, our tool determines intermediate overlapping pathways that can lead biologists to new hypotheses and experiments regarding relationships between the zzso We formulate the problem of discovering zzso relationships as a zzso discovery problem and propose a new technique called zzso Generation zzso which zzso the traditional zzso zzso Discovery zzso approach by zzso Our tool provides an interface to compare these two approaches with a variety of similarity measures and zzso techniques as well as in terms of zzso performance measures such as zzso and memory zzso
