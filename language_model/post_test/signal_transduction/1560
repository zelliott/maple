zzso factors zzso belong to an evolutionary zzso family of zzso factors, the activity of which is tightly regulated by oxygen zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso in some cell types, and other works have suggested that this zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso In the present work we studied the role of this zzso in the induction of zzso by zzso Under hypoxic conditions the zzso zzso was activated in some zzso and zzso but not all cell types zzso tested, whereas the zzso protein was induced by zzso in all zzso zzso analysis showed that, when observed, the zzso of zzso occurred after zzso zzso In addition, the chemical zzso of zzso had no significant effect on the induction of the zzso protein or its zzso activity but prevented zzso zzso zzso transient zzso of a dominant negative form of the regulatory zzso of zzso in zzso cells did not interfere with the induction of the zzso protein by zzso or affect zzso zzso in any of the cell types zzso Moreover, forced zzso of the zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity of zzso under zzso or hypoxic zzso Thus, our data suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso is cell zzso and, when observed, lies downstream of zzso zzso or in a parallel zzso Furthermore, the activity of the zzso is not sufficient for the zzso of zzso nor is it essential for its induction by zzso
