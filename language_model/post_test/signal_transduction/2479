zzso insult zzso by hydrogen zzso zzso was previously shown to increase the zzso zzso zzso concentration in zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso signal was zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso rise zzso by high zzso zzso with essentially two zzso the sudden sharp rise of zzso due to zzso zzso is enhanced and, instead of a decrease to a stable zzso a slow, steady rise of zzso follows the peak zzso zzso in the same concentration range lowered the zzso level and the zzso zzso When zzso cyanide zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso or zzso (2 zzso (10 zzso was applied initially to block zzso zzso production, the lowered zzso ratio was further reduced by subsequent addition of zzso zzso zzso The decline of the zzso ratio was parallel with but could not explain the enhanced zzso zzso zzso indicated by experiments in which the zzso ratio was decreased by zzso zzso zzso or zzso (2 zzso to a similar value as by zzso without causing any zzso in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso stress, in its early phase, gives rise to a complex dysfunction in the zzso zzso and, parallel with it, to an impaired energy zzso
