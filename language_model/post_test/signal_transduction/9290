The primary goal of the study was to investigate how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso played a critical role in the protection of zzso cell, one of the zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells with zzso resistance, from transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso In the study, zzso resistance of zzso cell was first confirmed by analyses of zzso zzso its interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and survival of zzso zzso showed that enable to escape from zzso phase arrest, zzso cell had higher resistance to zzso zzso than zzso (a drug sensitive zzso zzso significantly increased zzso expression of zzso but not of zzso cell whereas nuclear zzso of zzso was only limited to zzso the latter was believed to contribute to the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at zzso phase and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell was further demonstrated to bind to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso could disrupt the zzso zzso also increased the nuclear zzso of zzso that eventually led to the reduction of zzso resistance of zzso A transient zzso of zzso with zzso revealed a similar effect as zzso In addition, zzso of zzso instead of zzso played a critical role in zzso expression of zzso which subsequently activated zzso in zzso zzso
