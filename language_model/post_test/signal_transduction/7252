zzso is an zzso molecular platform of the innate immunity that is a key zzso of zzso The zzso complex detects pathogens and different danger signals, and triggers zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso Previously, we have shown that water-damaged building associated zzso zzso including zzso A, trigger zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso However, the molecular basis as well as mechanism behind this zzso zzso zzso has remained zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso in human primary zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso approach showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, gene zzso of zzso a negative zzso regulator of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso stimulation in human zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso A, a zzso zzso zzso acts as microbial danger signals that trigger zzso of zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling dependent zzso in human primary zzso
