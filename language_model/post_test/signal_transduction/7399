zzso branching is a prerequisite for the establishment of complex zzso circuits and their capacity for parallel information zzso Previously, we have identified a zzso signaling zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso of zzso root zzso zzso zzso in the spinal zzso Now we asked whether this cascade also controls zzso zzso elsewhere in the nervous zzso An zzso reporter mouse line was generated to clarify the pattern of the zzso zzso zzso It was found that during the period of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly labeled in zzso of all zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, strong complementary expression of zzso was detected in the zzso at the entry zones of sensory zzso To analyze zzso branching in individual zzso zzso we generated a mouse zzso expressing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed under control of the zzso zzso After crossing this strain with conditional reporter mouse lines, we revealed that the complete absence of zzso activity indeed prohibited the zzso of zzso sensory zzso in their entrance zzso zzso zzso only turned in either an ascending or descending direction, while collateral formation and growth of the peripheral arm was not zzso These findings indicate that in zzso of the zzso sensory zzso as in zzso zzso zzso signals are necessary for the execution of an zzso zzso zzso
