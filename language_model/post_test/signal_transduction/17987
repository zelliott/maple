zzso targeting of the 22 zzso zzso membrane protein zzso to the zzso membrane we have confined the targeting signal to zzso acid zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences revealed a zzso motif zzso which might represent the core of this targeting signal not found so far in other zzso Fusion of the zzso zzso tail to the zzso portion of zzso which per zzso is not targeted to zzso conveys zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is targeted to zzso by a new membrane targeting signal which is necessary and sufficient to target a zzso containing two zzso spans to zzso
