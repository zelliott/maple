The zzso spatial and zzso organization of zzso zzso signals was investigated in single cultured vascular zzso zzso zzso application of zzso initiated a rapid increase of zzso zzso concentration zzso in peripheral zzso processes from where zzso zzso as a zzso wave toward the central regions of the zzso The average propagation zzso of the zzso wave in the peripheral processes was zzso zzso whereas in the central region the wave zzso at zzso 10 zzso The time course of the recovery of zzso depended on the cell zzso In the peripheral processes zzso regions with a high zzso zzso zzso declined zzso whereas in the central region zzso decreased in an zzso zzso zzso zzso waves were preceded by small, highly localized zzso zzso originating from zzso to zzso zzso The average zzso of these elementary events of zzso release was 23 zzso and the underlying flux of zzso amounted to approximately 1-2 zzso zzso zzso or approximately zzso zzso consistent with a zzso flux through a single or small number of zzso zzso zzso zzso
