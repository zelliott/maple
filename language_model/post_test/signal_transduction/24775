The zzso protein is the product of the zzso zzso gene and loss of zzso function is detected in many types of human zzso zzso plays important roles in the regulation of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Here we show that zzso can physically interact with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso signals zzso by zzso Both in zzso binding and in zzso zzso studies suggest that a zzso domain of zzso containing zzso acids zzso might be crucial for zzso zzso In comparison, zzso did not affect zzso activity of either zzso zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso expressed zzso also zzso the zzso cell death induced by ultraviolet radiation or the zzso of zzso an upstream zzso that can stimulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso highlights a novel function of zzso which may provide a new mechanism by which zzso regulates cell zzso zzso is a major protein zzso that can be zzso in response to a variety of cellular zzso Our results, therefore, suggest that zzso by zzso zzso may act as a negative regulator in zzso zzso signaling zzso
