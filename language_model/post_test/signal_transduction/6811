zzso play an important role in plant adaptation to fluctuating environments as well as in the human diet by contributing to the prevention of chronic zzso zzso have been gained recently into the way individual factors, zzso environmental or zzso control the zzso zzso zzso at the molecular zzso The identification of the zzso steps of zzso has paved the way for zzso of zzso and zzso engineering, aimed at increasing the concentration of zzso in different crop zzso However, the complexity that arises from the interactions between the different factors as well as from the coordination between zzso remains poorly zzso This review focuses on recent advances in zzso responses to environmental stimuli and discusses how the interactions between the zzso factors and between zzso affect zzso zzso We develop the idea that zzso oxygen zzso status and zzso status can be considered as integrated factors that account for most effects of the major environmental factors influencing zzso zzso The discussion highlights the concept of zzso or zzso as stress signals that may be involved in feedback zzso We propose a conceptual model of the effects of environmental and zzso factors on zzso zzso in zzso
