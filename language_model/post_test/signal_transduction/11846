The purpose of this study was to investigate the Wharton's jelly zzso stem cells differentiation ability toward zzso zzso Human Wharton's jelly zzso stem cells zzso have been isolated from human zzso zzso of zzso zzso and characterized by flow zzso analysis for their stem zzso properties through specific surface markers expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lineage differentiation ability and zzso analysis were zzso The zzso of zzso into neural lineage was investigated in presence of zzso an agent known to increase the zzso levels of zzso A molecular profile of differentiated zzso was performed by zzso technology which revealed zzso statistically significant modulated genes respect to control zzso Most of these genes are mainly involved in functional zzso signaling pathways and part of them are specifically required for the zzso zzso zzso The acquisition of the zzso zzso was evaluated via zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed the significant induction of zzso zzso and zzso proteins expression in zzso zzso Moreover, the treatment with zzso zzso in zzso a strong zzso of the zzso zzso receptors related to the high release of zzso zzso zzso Taken together these findings show that zzso may be represent an optimal therapeutic strategy for neurological zzso
