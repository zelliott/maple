zzso sterile zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso are potent zzso zzso that are involved in cell proliferation and cell zzso To investigate the zzso functions of zzso and zzso we generated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were viable and fertile and developed zzso suggesting possible functional zzso between the two zzso A characterization of zzso and zzso combinations of zzso and zzso zzso mice showed that mice containing a single copy of either gene underwent normal organ zzso however, zzso zzso mice lacking both zzso and zzso genes started dying in zzso at approximately embryonic day zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited severe growth zzso failed zzso development, impaired zzso zzso vascular patterning and primitive zzso increased zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso These findings indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso play essential roles in early mouse development, regulating zzso development, vascular zzso primitive zzso and cell proliferation and zzso
