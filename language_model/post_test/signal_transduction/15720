A reduction in functional zzso mass leads to both major forms of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso activate signaling pathways that direct pancreatic zzso death and zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso death in this context is not well zzso In this report, we tested the hypothesis that individual cellular death pathways display characteristic zzso that allow them to be distinguished by the precise zzso and zzso responses that occur during zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso rat zzso cells and isolated rat zzso we provide evidence that zzso is unlikely to be the primary zzso underlying zzso death in response to zzso This conclusion was reached via the experimental results of several different interdisciplinary strategies, which zzso 1) tandem mass zzso to delineate the zzso differences between zzso exposure versus zzso induction by zzso and 2) pharmacological and molecular interference with either zzso activity or zzso zzso These approaches provided clear distinctions in cell death pathways initiated by zzso zzso and bona fide zzso of zzso zzso the results reported zzso demonstrate that pancreatic zzso undergo zzso in response to zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso
