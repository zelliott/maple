zzso data demonstrate a protective role by normal zzso levels on cardiovascular health and zzso zzso Low zzso levels are associated with zzso dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular zzso Both conditions recognize as zzso zzso a zzso structural zzso zzso zzso effects on male external zzso vascular wall, and zzso have been zzso 

To review current knowledge about zzso molecular signaling pathways and cellular events within penile and cardiovascular zzso involved in the zzso control of zzso tissue properties and in the development of structural zzso in presence of normal and low zzso levels, zzso 

A literature search was performed in November 2008 using the commercially available zzso online engine search to retrieve studies (from 1998 to zzso on the mechanisms zzso the role of zzso on penile and cardiovascular zzso zzso and zzso A combination of the following medical subject zzso was zzso zzso zzso vessel tissue architecture, zzso cardiovascular system, and zzso 

zzso exert direct beneficial effects on both cardiovascular and penile zzso zzso cells and zzso cells are the main cellular targets for direct zzso effects in both zzso and are involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso At vascular level, zzso promote zzso cell survival, reduce zzso expression of zzso zzso and inhibit proliferation and zzso migration of vascular zzso zzso At penile level, low zzso levels are associated with zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso Moreover, low zzso levels impair zzso migration, and zzso of zzso zzso cells as well as zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels promote vascular and penile zzso by direct mechanisms mainly involving zzso cells and zzso zzso Low zzso levels are associated with zzso of such mechanisms, leading to zzso structural zzso
