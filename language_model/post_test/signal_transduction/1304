With age, skeletal muscle experiences substantial zzso and zzso Although resistance training can increase muscle size and strength, the zzso response to exercise and the capacity for muscle zzso in older humans and animals is zzso In the present study, we assessed the ability of muscle zzso activity to activate cellular pathways involved in muscle cell growth and zzso in adult zzso 6 zzso old) and aged zzso 30 zzso old) Fischer 344 zzso Brown Norway zzso A single bout of rat zzso muscle zzso activity was zzso by zzso electrical stimulation zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso muscles were zzso for zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and total protein either at zzso immediately after, or 6 h after zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso immediately after zzso and to a lesser extent 6 h after zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in O zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and remained elevated 6 h later zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in O zzso zzso zzso was lower in O rats immediately after exercise in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and returned to baseline by 6 h in both Y and O zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are increased in skeletal muscle after a single bout of in zzso muscle zzso activity in aged animals, and the response is less than that observed in adult zzso These observations suggest that the anabolic response to a single bout of contraction is attenuated with aging and may help explain the reduced capacity for zzso in aged zzso
