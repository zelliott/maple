zzso also called zzso zzso Low zzso Weight zzso is a highly zzso zzso involved in the zzso of signal zzso by insulin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is controlled by a locus on zzso 2, with three common zzso zzso the corresponding six zzso show strong variations in total zzso zzso The purpose of our research was to determine the relationship of zzso with zzso level, zzso and zzso in children with Type 1 zzso 

We studied 189 consecutive children with Type 1 diabetes, from the zzso Clinic of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was determined by zzso and zzso by specific restriction zzso 

At initial diagnosis a strong negative correlation was observed between zzso level and zzso activity, with the highest levels in zzso with low zzso zzso and zzso show a similar pattern of relationship with zzso A comparative analysis of the data on Type 1 diabetes with previously obtained data on Type 2 diabetes shows an opposite pattern of relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, correlation between zzso and zzso in Type 1 diabetes is much weaker than in Type 2 zzso 

These differences suggest that the zzso might be involved in different signal zzso pathways relevant in the zzso of these two classes of diabetic zzso It would be interesting to study the possible correlation in Type 1 diabetes between zzso and zzso zzso
