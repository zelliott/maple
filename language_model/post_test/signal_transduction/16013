To prevent injury to host zzso complement zzso is regulated by a number of plasma and zzso zzso most of which limit zzso and zzso zzso An influx of circulating zzso from a zzso host into donor zzso deficient in zzso (a membrane protein that reduces zzso zzso zzso causes spontaneous complement zzso primarily in the zzso leading to zzso zzso To determine the roles of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso inflammation and fibrosis, zzso from zzso mice were transplanted into hosts lacking the zzso and/or zzso zzso While unrestricted complement zzso in the zzso was not affected by zzso status in the transplant recipient, zzso zzso zzso in the recipients led to significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and the extent of zzso inflammation and fibrosis, all of which led to preserved zzso zzso The absence of zzso receptors in recipients was not only inconsequential, but the protective effect of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso suggesting distinct roles of zzso and zzso zzso signaling in this zzso There was significant zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso cells and zzso T cells along injured zzso and zzso collagen I and III deposition, all of which were zzso zzso zzso Thus, blockade of zzso zzso signaling is a possible treatment to reduce zzso inflammation and preserve zzso function associated with complement zzso
