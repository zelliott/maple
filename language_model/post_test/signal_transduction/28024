Unlike in zzso zzso has not been established as a zzso regulator in avian zzso pancreatic zzso In the isolated duck pancreatic zzso 1 zzso zzso was required for stimulation of zzso zzso zzso effect being achieved at 10 zzso zzso zzso was without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone had no effect, but made zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso but made zzso zzso M effective zzso zzso and zzso both shifted the zzso zzso concentration from zzso to zzso zzso This zzso effect was zzso by zzso zzso dose zzso induced zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (10 zzso or zzso (10 zzso alone did not stimulate zzso increase, neither did they zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso but when they were added to cells simultaneously exposed to zzso zzso (10 zzso calcium spikes zzso zzso zzso induced by the simultaneous presence of 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso was completely blocked by removing zzso zzso but the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso (1 zzso was without zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso from zzso to zzso M did not stimulate zzso zzso nor did it zzso zzso induce zzso zzso The above data suggest that duck pancreatic zzso possess both zzso and zzso zzso simultaneous zzso of both is required for each to play a zzso zzso
