zzso of zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells results in rapid zzso assembly accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso of the cell body due to contraction of the cortical zzso zzso zzso action is zzso by activated zzso while it is blocked by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso analysis and high speed zzso we show that activated zzso is localized to the plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, are mainly zzso We find that zzso shape changes are preceded by zzso of zzso from the zzso to the cell zzso zzso also stimulates zzso of inactive zzso in the absence of ensuing shape zzso When membrane zzso of zzso is prevented by zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso or by zzso motif zzso zzso contraction is zzso However, the assembly of zzso into stress fibers is not affected under these zzso The effects of both zzso and activated zzso are blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso We conclude that: zzso zzso zzso contraction, but not stress fiber formation, requires zzso of zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs independently of its zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso
