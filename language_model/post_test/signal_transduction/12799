To delineate pathways for zzso zzso by growth hormone zzso in zzso zzso we incubated zzso zzso isolated from canine kidney with human growth hormone zzso or human zzso zzso and measured levels of zzso zzso zzso in suspensions and of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso with zzso but not zzso increased levels of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso effects occurred between zzso and 1 zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso were measured after as little as 5 zzso of incubation with 1 zzso zzso and increase was zzso after 15 zzso zzso were no longer zzso after 60 zzso because of zzso of zzso in membrane zzso zzso did not affect rates of zzso zzso increases in zzso were zzso in zzso suspended in 0, zzso and zzso zzso calcium but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes with Mr values of zzso and 140,000 were identified in isolated zzso zzso Our findings establish that zzso activates zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated canine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially after binding to a specific zzso This process could mediate zzso transmission by zzso across the plasma membrane of the zzso zzso cell and zzso
