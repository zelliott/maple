zzso zzso formation depends on the molecular control of zzso projection during zzso By screening with zzso light zzso in the developing mouse brain, we identified cartilage zzso zzso as a key zzso for lateral zzso tract zzso formation and named it zzso usher substance zzso We further identified zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso such as zzso which prevent neural zzso in the zzso zzso suppressed zzso binding and zzso growth cone zzso A zzso zzso was present in zzso mice but not in mice lacking both zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso antagonism of zzso by zzso is crucial for normal zzso zzso
