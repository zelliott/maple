zzso zzso was originally identified as a core component of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and a zzso zzso Here we have investigated the zzso that arises in mice with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We show that this zzso is a consequence of defective lens development at zzso zzso Using a series of regionally limited zzso zzso zzso for conditional deletion of zzso we show that zzso activity in zzso zzso lens zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all contribute to lens zzso In each case, zzso is required for normal expression levels of the crucial zzso factor zzso Finally, we provide multiple lines of evidence that although zzso can function in the zzso pathway, its activity in lens development is zzso zzso
