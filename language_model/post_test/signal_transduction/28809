To investigate the mechanism of zzso in gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso by zzso 

The zzso expression was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso The drug sensitivity was detected by zzso Cell zzso rate was measured by flow zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso was examined by Western zzso The expression of both proteins were detected in a tissue zzso containing zzso spots of cancer tissue and 27 spots of normal gastric tissue by SP zzso zzso method was used to analyze the correlation between zzso and zzso 

The drug sensitivity and cell zzso rate significantly increased zzso and the protein expression levels of zzso and zzso were zzso after the zzso of zzso by zzso in both zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The protein expression rates of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively in gastric cancer zzso which were significantly higher than those in normal gastric tissue zzso and zzso zzso The correlation of protein expression of zzso and zzso was positive zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with the regulation of zzso expression plays an important role in the zzso of gastric cancer, which may be a novel target for reversing zzso zzso
