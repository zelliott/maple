The zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a key component of a complex signaling zzso that zzso in multiple zzso zzso We have performed an F1 screen for zzso that cause dominant enhancement of wing vein zzso associated with zzso in zzso With this screen, we have recovered zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three apparently novel zzso All of the zzso we have identified show dominant interactions in zzso combinations with each other and with zzso of N or zzso suggesting that they are involved in zzso between the N and zzso signaling zzso Further examination of the zzso interactions between zzso zzso and zzso revealed that reductions in zzso activity enhanced both the bristle loss associated with H zzso and the bristle zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Double zzso combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso led to the formation of zzso compound eyes in a dosage sensitive zzso Our findings suggest that these zzso represent links between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso and that zzso activity can either promote or suppress zzso zzso depending on its zzso zzso
