During the last decade, network approaches became a powerful tool to describe protein structure and zzso Here we review the links between zzso proteins and the associated networks, and describe the consequences of local, zzso and global network disorder on changes in protein structure and zzso We introduce a new zzso of protein networks into zzso zzso those similar to zzso zzso clouds, and zzso zzso those similar to flat, dense zzso zzso clouds, and relate these network types to protein disorder dynamics and to differences in energy transmission zzso In the first class, there is limited overlap between the zzso which implies higher rigidity of the individual zzso there the zzso changes can be described by an zzso zzso zzso In the second class, the zzso presents a compact structure with significant overlap between the zzso there the zzso changes can be described by zzso that is, multiple highly populated zzso We further propose that zzso protein regions evolved to help other protein segments reach zzso zzso but zzso zzso We also show the role of disorder in zzso zzso of zzso zzso highlight the effects of zzso zzso proteins zzso on cellular networks and list some possible studies linking protein disorder and protein structure zzso
