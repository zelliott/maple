The number of targeted small molecules being developed in zzso is increasing zzso Many of these are designed to inhibit multiple zzso and thus the mechanisms of responsiveness and zzso zzso can be difficult to zzso In fact, with few exceptions, zzso zzso are developed with limited zzso patient zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor being studied in several zzso that we hypothesized would be active in zzso cell zzso of the head and neck, because it zzso classic and novel protein zzso C zzso Indeed, zzso reduced the growth of zzso and zzso tumor zzso decreased proliferation in these cell lines, inhibited putative target zzso and induced cell cycle zzso Gene expression zzso confirmed that expression of cell cycle zzso including zzso D and zzso were significantly altered by exposure to zzso However, testing a panel of zzso cell zzso of the head and neck cell lines revealed variable sensitivity to zzso which correlated significantly with baseline zzso D1 protein zzso Moreover, sensitivity and resistance could be zzso respectively, by expression or depletion of zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of sensitive and resistant cell lines revealed distinct differences in zzso D1 zzso zzso modulated zzso D1 synthesis through an zzso zzso in the former, whereas high-level zzso gene amplification was present in the zzso These results underscore the critical relevance of cellular signaling context in developing cancer therapies in general and suggest that zzso in particular would be most effective in tumors where baseline zzso D1 expression is low to moderate and zzso zzso
