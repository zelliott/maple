The response to neural induction depends on the presence of inducing signals and on the state of competence of the responding zzso The zzso of the chick zzso loses its ability to respond to neural induction by the organizer zzso zzso between stages 4 and zzso We find that the pattern of expression of the zzso zzso closely mirrors the changes in competence of the zzso in time and in zzso For the first time, we describe an experiment that can extend the period of neural zzso when zzso expression is maintained beyond its normal time by zzso zzso zzso cells, the competence to respond to zzso zzso zzso is zzso The host zzso forms a zzso neural tube, which expresses the zzso marker zzso (a zzso zzso zzso but not any zzso markers for the zzso zzso or spinal zzso Although zzso zzso cells can mimic signals from zzso zzso that maintain zzso zzso they cannot rescue the ability of the zzso to induce anterior structures (which is normally lost after stage zzso The zzso may acquire stable neural characteristics during neural induction by going through a hierarchy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our findings allow us to start to define these different states at a molecular level, and show that the competence to respond to neural induction is not entirely autonomous to the responding cells, but can be regulated by zzso zzso zzso
