The key role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso biology is highlighted by the zzso of primary zzso cultured on a soft zzso gel contrasted with that on a stiff, zzso zzso On zzso zzso maintain an zzso zzso and zzso cells within this population zzso In contrast, on zzso zzso rapidly lose zzso expression and spread zzso changes that depend on zzso of zzso zzso by engagement of zzso zzso The zzso zzso responding to zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso Although it remains uncertain to what degree zzso contributes directly to collagen 1 production, signaling pathways critical to zzso are important for repair and fibrosis, zzso that zzso is part of the general program of lung zzso zzso zzso requires not only zzso signaling but also zzso Generation of zzso requires assembly of complexes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and such assembly is a function of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in such contacts prevents complex zzso zzso induced zzso generation and zzso zzso of these contacts is a signal for the cells to initiate zzso Critical remaining questions center around better definition of direct versus indirect effects of zzso on collagen deposition and the nature of zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of specific zzso of zzso should further test the question of whether the process is important to zzso in zzso and a viable therapeutic zzso
