This study was designed to investigate whether zzso can regulate the expression of the zzso system, the zzso system, or zzso and zzso collagen fibers in a rat model of zzso heart failure zzso We also investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in this zzso 

zzso was induced in zzso rats by zzso injection of zzso zzso twice every 24 zzso After 2 months, the surviving rats were divided into three groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or PBS were injected five times every 48 h zzso One day after the last injection, all of the rats were zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to evaluate zzso fibrosis, and zzso was used to measure the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso collagen zzso We also treated adult rat cardiac zzso with zzso (10 zzso zzso (10 zzso (10 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso or PBS for 24 zzso zzso zzso was used to measure the expressions of zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso collagen fibers zzso and the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso increased in the zzso group compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that blockade of zzso can improve zzso zzso in zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso in cardiac zzso and zzso and zzso zzso could inhibit this function zzso Thus, zzso was dependent on the zzso system to induce zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso can regulate the zzso and zzso systems in this zzso The zzso system is one of intermediaries between zzso and zzso in cardiac zzso As a harmful zzso zzso treatment is a potential therapeutic strategy in zzso
