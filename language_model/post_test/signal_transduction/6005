Gene expression profiles during early stages of formation of symbiotic zzso zzso in a model zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by means of a zzso array of zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso of a total of zzso genes was significantly accelerated during the successive stages that represent infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the onset of nitrogen zzso These include 32 zzso and zzso genes as well as a number of genes involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso of fixed nitrogen that were previously known to be abundantly expressed in root zzso of many zzso We also identified a large number of novel zzso or enhanced zzso which include genes involved in many cellular processes such as membrane zzso defense responses, zzso synthesis and responses, signal zzso cell wall zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that the gene expression profile in early steps of zzso interactions is considerably different from that in subsequent stages of zzso zzso A number of genes involved in the defense responses to pathogens and other stresses were induced abundantly in the infection process, but their expression was suppressed during subsequent zzso zzso The results provide a comprehensive data source for investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying zzso and symbiotic nitrogen zzso
