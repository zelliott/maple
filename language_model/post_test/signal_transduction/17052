zzso zzso is the founding member of a zzso zzso of zzso proteins that serve as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit dramatically zzso zzso zzso It was proposed that zzso zzso maintains zzso stem cells zzso by promoting zzso zzso presumably via cap cells that form the zzso niche for zzso zzso However, we unexpectedly observed that zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso tumors that persist throughout adult zzso Multiple zzso demonstrated zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso including the failure to express the zzso differentiation factor zzso zzso and restoration of bam expression relieved zzso zzso zzso zzso rescue and zzso experiments indicate that zzso is not required in cap cells, the source of niche zzso but instead is required in zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso cells of escort zzso zzso zzso of zzso in escort cells substantially rescued zzso tumors, demonstrating that they are driven by excess zzso zzso However, the zzso requirement for zzso to restrict zzso numbers was much earlier, during the wandering zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited defective zzso and loss of zzso Our data indicate that loss of zzso causes defects in zzso and escort cells, leading to zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
