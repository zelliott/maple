The survival of pancreatic beta cells depends on the balance between external zzso and protective molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate certain functions of the zzso zzso including insulin and zzso zzso However, the mechanism of action of zzso as well as the identification of receptors involved in the pancreatic functions of the zzso remained to be zzso We demonstrate here that zzso is an efficient protective agent of pancreatic beta cells against zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso cell lines and the mouse pancreatic zzso cells express the three known zzso zzso The incubation of beta cells with zzso protects cells from zzso induced either by zzso or by zzso In zzso cells, zzso activates both zzso and zzso zzso pathways and strongly reduces the zzso or the zzso zzso activity by a mechanism involving zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displays the same protective effect than zzso whereas the zzso zzso is unable to block the effect of zzso suggesting the zzso involvement of the zzso in the action of zzso on beta zzso These results clearly indicate for the first time that zzso is able to protect zzso beta cells from external zzso agents, a role well correlated with its release in the circulation after a zzso
