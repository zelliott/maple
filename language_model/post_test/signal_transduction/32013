zzso into Bone zzso protein zzso functions during zzso development have been limited by a lack of zzso signaling zzso Here we used a novel zzso signaling reporter zzso zzso to study zzso signaling in the zzso zzso At early zzso zzso expression was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso At later zzso strong zzso expression occurred in zzso of the marginal zone and zzso zzso Comparisons to nuclear zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso expression occurred exclusively in neural cells with high-level zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso was confirmed in zzso cortical cells cultured with zzso and both in zzso and in zzso zzso expression was zzso or zzso In the early zzso zzso zzso expression zzso correlated with the cortical zzso gene zzso indicating a zzso expression border that zzso with the zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso neither zzso nor nuclear zzso increases were observed in zzso hem zzso These findings establish zzso as an zzso reporter of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso imply that hem fate can be specified at different zzso signaling zzso and suggest that zzso primarily regulates the responses zzso than the intensity zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso
