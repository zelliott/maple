Both the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso can contribute to tumor development and zzso through their effects on cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently in clinical use for the treatment of several types of zzso However, primary and acquired resistance to these agents often occurs and thereby limits the clinical efficacy of zzso targeted zzso zzso from both in zzso and in zzso studies indicate that zzso between zzso and zzso can lead to acquired resistance against zzso zzso This review describes the interface between the zzso and zzso signaling networks and the implications of the extensive zzso between these two zzso systems for cancer zzso zzso and zzso interact on multiple levels, either through a direct association between the two zzso by zzso the availability of each others zzso or zzso via common interaction partners such as G protein coupled receptors zzso or downstream signaling zzso This zzso zzso and its involvement in the induction of resistance to targeted therapies provide a clear rationale for dual targeting of zzso and zzso We discuss several zzso strategies to simultaneously inhibit zzso and zzso signaling as promising novel therapeutic zzso
