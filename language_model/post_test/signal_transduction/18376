zzso of skeletal muscle zzso follows an ordered sequence of events: commitment, cell cycle withdrawal, zzso zzso and finally cell fusion to form zzso zzso The molecular signaling pathways that regulate the progression are not well zzso Here we investigate the potential role of calcium and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell fusion are identified as distinct zzso steps, based on the zzso calcium concentration required for the expression of zzso and zzso markers specific to each of these zzso Furthermore, differentiation is inhibited at the commitment stage by either treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso or expression of zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso gene transfer of a zzso active form of zzso is able to induce zzso only in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that multiple zzso pathways are required for zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso differentiation includes zzso zzso of zzso but does not require the participation of zzso We conclude that commitment of skeletal muscle cells to differentiation is calcium and zzso but zzso
