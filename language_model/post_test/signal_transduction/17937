We propose a new statistical method for constructing genetic network from zzso gene expression data by using a zzso zzso An essential point of zzso network construction is in the zzso of the conditional distribution of each random zzso We consider fitting zzso zzso models with zzso error zzso to the zzso gene expression data to capture the zzso structures between zzso A problem still remains to be solved in selecting an optimal zzso which gives the best representation of the system among zzso We theoretically derive a new graph selection criterion from zzso approach in general zzso The proposed method includes previous methods based on zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of zzso zzso gene expression data newly obtained by zzso 100 zzso
