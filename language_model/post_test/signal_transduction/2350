The zzso family zzso zzso zzso is involved in signaling through zzso receptors utilizing the common zzso zzso Mice and humans lacking zzso have severe immune deficiencies, including defects in B and T zzso development and zzso In particular, zzso mice have mature T cells with an activated zzso yet these cells are functionally zzso In this work, we show that zzso T cells have no gross defects in early T cell zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso mice expressing a transgenic zzso have extremely low numbers of peripheral T cells with a zzso zzso indicating that both peripheral zzso and expansion of zzso T cells are driven by zzso zzso We show that, similar to zzso mice, T cells from zzso mice have an increased zzso to zzso Previously, we showed that when zzso in zzso by zzso plus zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso greatly reduced amounts of zzso and fail to zzso However, by measuring zzso zzso levels, we find that zzso T cells produce amounts of zzso similar to activated T cells from control mice, further supporting the notion that there is no zzso in zzso signaling in zzso T zzso
