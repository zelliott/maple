The growth zzso zzso zzso share an zzso mechanism based on three zzso zzso Of these, only the role of the zzso loop zzso in the zzso domain and the zzso motif zzso zzso in a zzso tail region are well zzso We investigated the role of the third, so-called turn motif zzso also located in the tail, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We report cooperative action of the zzso zzso and the turn motif zzso because it binds a zzso site above the zzso loop within the zzso domain, promoting zzso association of the tail with the zzso domain, serving to stabilize the zzso in its zzso binding zzso We present a molecular model for zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the turn motif zzso via zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso In zzso and zzso the turn motif zzso thereby also protects the zzso from zzso Our results suggest that the mechanism described is a key feature in zzso of zzso 26 human zzso zzso
