Environmental factors affect zzso of stem cells by modulating the components of zzso zzso Heat zzso an environmental factor, zzso heat shock factors zzso which zzso stress zzso zzso However, the link of heat shock to zzso of stem cells has not been zzso zzso Here, we present the direct link of heat shock to a core stem cell regulator, zzso in the zzso network through zzso and zzso zzso We first showed that heat shock initiated differentiation of human embryonic stem cells zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that heat shock increased the expression of many genes involved in cellular processes related to differentiation of stem zzso We then examined the effects of zzso induced by heat shock on core zzso zzso Among zzso heat shock induced mainly zzso in zzso The zzso zzso the expression of zzso leading to the differentiation of zzso and the above zzso gene expression zzso We further examined the effects of the upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the repression of zzso expression by zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso controlled predominantly the repression of the zzso expression by zzso The direct link of heat shock to the core zzso regulator through zzso and zzso provides a fundamental basis for understanding the effect of heat and other stresses involving zzso of zzso on the zzso program and further controlling differentiation of zzso in a broad spectrum of stem cell applications using these zzso
