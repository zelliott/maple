zzso zzso zzso zzso like many zzso can produce zzso oxygen species during its zzso zzso Apart from the zzso zzso zzso the regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of the zzso activity of zzso have not been zzso We show here that zzso oxygen species generated from the activity of zzso limit the levels of induced zzso zzso The mechanism involves the repression of the zzso gene promoter activity in a zzso zzso zzso Indeed, increasing the zzso activity by zzso zzso expression zzso into zzso cells zzso an zzso stress and led to the repression of a reporter gene driven by the zzso gene zzso This negative zzso is abolished by zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and by zzso (which zzso zzso zzso thus zzso that zzso is an zzso zzso is also abolished by the zzso of the zzso nuclear factor I zzso site in the zzso The zzso domain of zzso was found to act in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso during the induction of zzso by zzso Using an zzso fusion, we show that zzso zzso function is decreased by a high activity of zzso This regulation is also abolished by zzso or zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso is zzso in cells treated with zzso a novel finding indicating that the zzso domain of a zzso factor can be targeted by zzso zzso In conclusion, an zzso loop leads to the fine tuning of the zzso gene expression through the zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso This mechanism allows a limitation of the potentially toxic zzso activity within the zzso
