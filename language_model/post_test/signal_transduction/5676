Alzheimer's disease zzso the major contributor to zzso in the elderly, involves zzso in the brain of zzso plaques containing the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is also characterized by a loss of zzso particularly those expressing zzso zzso receptors zzso thereby leading to a reduction in zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is toxic to zzso is critical to the onset and progression of zzso The discovery of new drug therapies for zzso is likely to be accelerated by an improved understanding of the mechanisms zzso zzso causes zzso zzso We examine the evidence for a role in zzso toxicity of zzso zzso zzso can also protect zzso when activated by zzso zzso zzso peptides and nicotine zzso activate several zzso signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso pathway, the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso These pathways control cell death or survival and the zzso of zzso zzso We propose that understanding the differential zzso of these pathways by nicotine and/or zzso may offer the prospect of new routes to therapy for zzso
