The dynamics of zzso responses from zzso cells, as well as that of spike zzso were studied with the stimulus regimens and zzso procedures identical to those used to study the dynamics of the responses from horizontal and zzso cells zzso The stimuli used were large fields of red and green light given as a zzso input or zzso about a mean zzso by a zzso zzso Spike zzso evoked by a zzso stimulus were analyzed in exactly the same manner as that used for analysis of analog zzso The zzso nature of kernels allowed us to correlate the zzso and zzso components in a spike train with those of the zzso responses from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both red and green stimuli given alone in darkness produced zzso responses from all zzso zzso In the case of some cells, steady red zzso changed the polarity or zzso of the response to green zzso zzso zzso responded only to simultaneous color zzso zzso recovered from zzso responses, and spike zzso were similar to those found in responses from zzso cells and were of two types, one characteristic of the C zzso cells and the other characteristic of the N zzso zzso The zzso kernels of most zzso cells could be divided into two basic types, zzso and zzso The combination of kernels of these two basic types with different zzso can produce a wide range of zzso zzso of two types of zzso zzso could render color coding in this relatively simple zzso as an extremely complex zzso Color information appeared to be represented by the zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso The response dynamics is a means of transmission of color-coded zzso zzso components carry information about changes around a mean zzso regardless of the color of an zzso Some spike zzso produced a zzso zzso between red and green zzso to show that a particular time sequence of red and green stimuli was detected by the retinal zzso zzso The similarity between signatures of zzso kernels for both zzso and zzso cells indicates that signals undergo a minimal transformation in the zzso domain when they are transmitted from zzso to zzso cells and then transformed into a spike zzso Under our experimental conditions, a single spike train carried simultaneously information about red and green zzso as well as about linear and zzso zzso In addition, the spike train also carries a zzso zzso A spike train is a carrier of multiple zzso zzso many types of information in a stimulus are independently zzso into a spike zzso
