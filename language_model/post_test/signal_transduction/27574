zzso zzso zzso its cellular response by binding to the zzso zzso which triggers the zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso Cell culture studies of zzso zzso have suggested that zzso functions as a survival factor by zzso zzso at least in part through zzso an zzso protein of the zzso zzso In this report, we examine whether zzso can induce zzso of the zzso gene in response to zzso Two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in this zzso After zzso zzso we observed a correlation between expression of zzso and zzso of zzso as assessed by the expression of zzso M, a direct target of zzso and the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso Moreover, a zzso binding element in the zzso promoter was found to be active in response to zzso a finding that was further confirmed because zzso of this sequence motif zzso its promoter activity and zzso of a dominant negative zzso protein blocked zzso When zzso binding analyses were performed, we found that zzso not zzso or zzso was the protein bound to the zzso promoter in response to zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is a zzso zzso that can be used by zzso zzso cells to induce the expression of zzso and consequently to inhibit zzso
