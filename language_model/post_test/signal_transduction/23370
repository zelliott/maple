zzso cell zzso zzso is essential for the induction of immune defense against zzso yet needs to be tightly controlled to avoid chronic inflammation and exaggerated immune zzso Here, we identify a mechanism of immune zzso by which zzso zzso once zzso tempers DC zzso and prevents zzso zzso zzso once zzso produced zzso S zzso that signaled through zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to limit the magnitude of DC zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mouse zzso led to increased expression of zzso molecules and zzso in zzso and enhanced immune responses to zzso zzso as well as increased zzso Additionally, zzso was expressed in activated human zzso and its ability to regulate DC zzso was zzso Our results identify a zzso zzso zzso negative feedback mechanism at the interface of zzso and innate immunity that maintains the zzso magnitude of the immune zzso
