zzso and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing zzso zzso zzso On recognizing zzso stress, plant cells initiate zzso of a widespread signal zzso network involving second zzso such as zzso to trigger zzso defense responses including the induction of zzso zzso However, most of the components involved in these signaling networks still remain to be zzso Recently we identified and investigated zzso the sole zzso of the zzso family putative zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso characterization of the zzso cells as well as the zzso cells indicated that zzso is involved in the regulation of plasma membrane zzso influx and zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species zzso induced by zzso zzso Here we will discuss possible molecular mechanisms and zzso functions of the zzso protein in zzso zzso
