zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in different organisms has shown the importance of this family of zzso during zzso zzso screens in zzso have assigned specific roles for zzso in zzso differentiation and zzso but mainly as a result of a loss of its zzso We attempted to fully activate the zzso zzso by removing both receptors for the zzso zzso called zzso and 2, which are functioning as negative regulators in this zzso 

Here we describe a zzso zzso in zzso called zzso which in a zzso state results in a subtle eye and zzso zzso Since we recently zzso cloned a zzso zzso a zzso double zzso was generated, showing severely increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso confirming an zzso zzso of zzso zzso As a consequence, a number of zzso were observed that have not been reported previously using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso double zzso do not express zzso polarity zzso however initial zzso of the zzso itself is not zzso This is the first evidence that zzso and zzso zzso patterning of the zzso are genetically zzso zzso Furthermore, a novel negative function of zzso signaling is observed in the induction of the fin field, acting well before any of the previously reported function of zzso in fin formation and in a way that is different from the proposed early role of zzso in zzso bud zzso 

The generation and characterization of the zzso double zzso assigned novel and unexpected functions to the zzso signaling zzso Additionally, these zzso will provide a useful system to further investigate the consequences of zzso activated zzso signaling during zzso zzso
