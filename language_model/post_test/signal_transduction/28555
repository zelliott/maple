zzso immune dysfunction in patients with zzso zzso has been attributed to the altered expression of components of the zzso zzso zzso complex and their associated zzso protein zzso zzso In this study, zzso flow zzso was applied to study the surface bound molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso and the signal zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a functional zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso blood T cells of multiple myeloma zzso patients at different stages of the zzso Multiple abnormalities were demonstrated in the zzso and zzso zzso both under zzso and zzso zzso There was a marked reduction, particular in advanced stage zzso in the proportion of zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was normal or increased in zzso cells but zzso zzso production was zzso These results illustrated profound and multiple zzso zzso zzso from the surface and zzso consistent with involvement of a master zzso function, especially in advanced stage zzso These data should be taken into consideration when developing zzso therapeutic approaches and when applying new emerging technologies that aim to restore zzso zzso
