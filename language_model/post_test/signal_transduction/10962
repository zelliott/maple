The zzso center is the earliest signaling center during zzso pattern formation in zzso zzso and has been implied to function in induction of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity resides in the zzso zzso zzso layer zzso at the interface of the vegetal zzso cell and the zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the anterior zzso in frogs zzso the anterior visceral zzso in mice, and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we investigate the control of zzso expression in the zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is absolutely required for early zzso zzso while zzso of zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso revealing that zzso activity is required downstream of zzso signaling for zzso zzso Further, we show that the zzso induction of zzso is independent of the zzso repression of zzso Our data reveal that repressive effects of both zzso and zzso may be responsible for the exclusion of zzso expression from the zzso and lateral parts of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso appears to be activated by zzso in the zzso zzso where zzso acts in a zzso way to limit repression of zzso by zzso and zzso
