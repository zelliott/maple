We previously demonstrated that protein zzso zzso zzso mediates a zzso zzso zzso zzso response in human zzso zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso of both zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling pathways and an increase in cell zzso zzso of a zzso dead zzso zzso construct reduced the zzso and zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso targets zzso and zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso also reduced zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso construct in a zzso cell line with no zzso zzso zzso also provided evidence that zzso targets the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells was inhibited by zzso However, zzso of zzso but not zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso This study identifies zzso and zzso as downstream targets of zzso that are involved in zzso cell zzso
