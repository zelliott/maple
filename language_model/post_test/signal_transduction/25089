The zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso is an essential zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso brush border zzso zzso is also an zzso zzso To define the functional importance of zzso binding for zzso function as a zzso regulator, we zzso stable zzso cells expressing zzso with plasmids zzso zzso and truncated mouse zzso zzso zzso established that in zzso cells, zzso bound to full-length zzso the zzso domain, zzso and zzso which lacks the proposed zzso zzso The zzso domain, zzso failed to bind the zzso zzso was also zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity in cells that expressed zzso or zzso but had no effect on the formation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso exchange was unaffected by zzso in cells that expressed zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso was enhanced by zzso only in cells where zzso bound to both zzso and zzso The data suggest that zzso functions as a scaffold to link zzso with zzso and that this zzso complex is essential for zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso
