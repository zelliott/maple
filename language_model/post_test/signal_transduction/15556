zzso movement of zzso mosaic virus zzso involves the interaction of zzso zzso movement protein zzso with zzso In cells behind the infection front that accumulate high levels of zzso this activity is reflected by the formation of stabilized zzso zzso The ability of zzso to bind along and stabilize zzso is zzso upon expression in zzso zzso In zzso cells, the protein also leads to zzso of zzso and cell division through a zzso process correlated with the loss of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso Since zzso has the capacity to interact with plant factors involved in zzso nucleation and zzso we used zzso expression in zzso cells to test whether zzso expression zzso zzso and cell division also in zzso We demonstrate that zzso associates with all plant zzso zzso and, unlike in zzso cells, does not interfere with zzso Thus, zzso function and the interaction of zzso with factors of the zzso do not entail an zzso of zzso in zzso We also report that the protein targets primary zzso in zzso cells immediately upon or during zzso and that the zzso of zzso in zzso occurs in the presence of zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso
