zzso expression of a resident zzso zzso in adult mice revealed that most zzso are resistant to zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso expression only induced overt tumors in zzso To identify these zzso cells, we induced zzso expression in a very limited number of adult lung cells zzso and monitored their fate by zzso zzso a surrogate marker zzso with the zzso zzso Four weeks later, zzso of these cells had proliferated to form small zzso However, only zzso zzso type II zzso cells were able to form zzso zzso some of which progressed to zzso and zzso In contrast, induction of zzso expression in lung cells by zzso infection with zzso particles generated zzso in all regions except the zzso zzso zzso and zzso duct junction zzso were primarily made of zzso Clara zzso Some of them progressed to form benign zzso However, only zzso zzso exclusively made up of zzso zzso cells, progressed to yield zzso zzso zzso infection induced inflammatory infiltrates primarily made of T and B zzso This inflammatory response was essential for the development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not for the generation of zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso during embryonic development under the control of a zzso promoter yielded zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso These results, taken together, illustrate that different types of lung cells can generate benign zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso However, in adult mice, only zzso zzso cells were able to yield zzso zzso
