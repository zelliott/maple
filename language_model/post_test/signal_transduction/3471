The zzso senses nutrients to maintain energy and zzso zzso but little is known about the signaling and zzso mechanisms zzso We tested whether zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso is sufficient and necessary for zzso zzso signaling to trigger zzso zzso firing and regulate zzso zzso 

In rats, we selectively activated zzso zzso and evaluated changes in zzso zzso during the pancreatic zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso zzso The requirement of zzso zzso signaling in zzso regulation was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of infusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We also assessed the involvement of a zzso network and the zzso impact of zzso zzso zzso in rats placed on high-fat zzso 

zzso infusion of zzso activated zzso zzso and lowered zzso production, in association with increased zzso zzso firing in control zzso The zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso were negated by zzso with either the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso The zzso effect was also negated by zzso with zzso molecular and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors within the zzso zzso complex, or zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked the ability of zzso zzso to reduce zzso production in control rats, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance and activated zzso zzso and lowered zzso production in rats on high-fat zzso 

We identified a neural zzso function of zzso zzso zzso
