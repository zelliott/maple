Juvenile zzso leukemia zzso is an intractable pediatric leukemia with poor prognosis whose molecular zzso is poorly zzso except for zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the majority of zzso To obtain a complete registry of gene zzso in zzso zzso sequencing was performed for paired zzso DNA from 13 individuals with zzso zzso which was followed by deep sequencing of 8 target genes in 92 tumor zzso zzso was characterized by a paucity of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso involvement in 82 cases zzso The zzso and zzso genes were among common targets for secondary zzso zzso in the latter were often zzso and may be involved in the progression rather than the initiation of zzso and these zzso associated with poor clinical zzso Our findings provide new insights into the zzso and progression of zzso
