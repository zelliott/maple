The effects of zzso zzso on the zzso activity of the rat adrenal zzso have been investigated in zzso using an in zzso zzso technique of the intact left zzso The chemicals were dissolved in the zzso zzso and the zzso continued for 120 zzso zzso concentration zzso increased the zzso index and zzso incorporation into DNA in the zzso zzso zzso 6- and zzso increases, respectively, at a zzso M zzso but not in the inner zzso zzso where the zzso zzso activity was zzso The effect of zzso M zzso was blocked by the ETA zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced DNA synthesis in the zzso but their effects were less intense than that of zzso M zzso and were directly related to their binding potency for the ETA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso action of zzso M zzso was reversed by both the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a complete blockade was obtained at a zzso concentration of each zzso In contrast, neither the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso stimulate the proliferation of rat adrenal zzso cells, acting through ETA receptors coupled with protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso The results of the present study are in keeping with the view that in zzso zzso is the zzso layer involved in the maintenance of growth of the entire adrenal zzso and with the previous zzso demonstration that zzso is the only zzso layer provided with ETA zzso
