We have used high-resolution zzso imaging of cardiac zzso cells zzso in zzso to investigate the earliest zzso zzso movements during cardiac zzso zzso migratory behavior within the heart field was observed, resulting in a rotation of the heart zzso The zzso displacement and rotation of the tube requires zzso zzso 2 expression within the zzso Furthermore, by reducing or zzso zzso zzso signaling or by zzso of zzso beads we could demonstrate that zzso zzso which is zzso activated in the lateral plate zzso and regulated by early zzso signals, is required to direct zzso migration and cardiac zzso Together, these results support a model in which zzso migrate toward a zzso source during development of the linear heart tube, providing a mechanism by which the zzso axis drives zzso development of the zzso zzso
