zzso insulin resistance is a principal component of type 2 diabetes, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for its zzso remain zzso Recent studies have suggested that saturated fatty acids induce zzso insulin resistance through zzso of the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso in the liver, which in turn zzso activates zzso zzso synthesis leading to zzso of insulin zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso signaling is not directly required for saturated or zzso zzso zzso insulin resistance in both zzso zzso zzso treated and zzso knockout mice, and that zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso signaling or a primary event in zzso zzso and impairment of insulin zzso Further, we show that both saturated and zzso fats lead to zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and impairment of zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that saturated zzso insulin resistance is independent of zzso zzso and zzso
