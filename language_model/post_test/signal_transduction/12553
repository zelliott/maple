zzso stimuli regulate zzso differentiation and zzso zzso during brain development, although the zzso signaling pathways that mediate these processes remain largely zzso We now show that the zzso zzso regulates differentiation of zzso neural precursor cells zzso Active zzso promotes differentiation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene or expression of zzso forms of zzso suppresses zzso growth factor zzso enhancement of zzso differentiation into zzso in zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, active zzso increased the protein levels and zzso activity of zzso a zzso basic zzso protein required for the generation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso These results have unveiled an unexpected role of the zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso signals regulating the production of zzso zzso zzso
