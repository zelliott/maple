To investigate the effect of the inflammatory zzso zzso factor zzso in the induction of the zzso zzso H zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were incubated in organ culture with or without zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso synthesis inhibitor zzso D zzso zzso and tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Total zzso for zzso zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso analysis using mouse zzso zzso fragments labeled with zzso as zzso Western blots were performed using mouse zzso zzso zzso cultures of rabbit zzso zzso were loaded with the fluorescent dye zzso AM and changes in zzso calcium concentration zzso were analyzed by laser scanning zzso zzso 

zzso factor induction of zzso expression was zzso by Northern zzso analysis at 2 hours, peaked at 4 hours, and remained increased for as long as 8 zzso At 16 hours, there was a marked increase in zzso zzso The effect was abolished by the zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso gene zzso Neither zzso zzso expression was inhibited by zzso In a zzso zzso there was a 50% zzso of zzso gene induction by zzso The calcium zzso zzso also caused an increase in expression of zzso zzso zzso this did not occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that after the addition of zzso there was a transient increase in zzso in zzso zzso cells that peaked between 30 and 60 zzso The increase was inhibited in the presence of zzso or in a zzso zzso zzso also caused a transient increase in zzso that was not altered in cells previously treated with zzso or zzso 

zzso may enhance zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso by increasing zzso gene zzso This increase is by means of zzso zzso of the gene and results in increased zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso due to zzso stimulation is required to induce the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso all zzso effects and could be of therapeutic value by modulating zzso inflammation at the level of zzso gene zzso
