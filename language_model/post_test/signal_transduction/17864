The zzso is a highly zzso zzso of cells regulating numerous zzso and pathological functions that maintain the zzso and zzso functions of the zzso The structure and function of the zzso zzso prevents vascular disease by regulating the structure of the zzso to act as a resting molecular barrier to zzso proteins and by becoming an activated layer of zzso cells to repair zzso zzso The purpose of this review is to examine the structure of the zzso zzso and its roles in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and regulation of wound zzso Studies focused on the cellular and molecular biology of the structure and function of the zzso zzso and in wound repair are zzso The zzso is a key regulator in maintaining zzso integrity and in restoring integrity following zzso zzso such as those that occur in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their associated zzso junctions and focal zzso are important regulators of cell zzso cell zzso cell zzso and wound repair zzso Various proteins have been implicated in controlling zzso zzso function and repair such as zzso zzso and the zzso family of zzso The normal function of the zzso is highly dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and dysfunction of the zzso may result in impairment of zzso function, subsequently tipping the balance towards vascular zzso Thus, an understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of the zzso zzso is essential in our understanding of the zzso of vascular disease, especially zzso
