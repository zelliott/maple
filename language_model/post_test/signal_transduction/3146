zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso is an zzso dominant disease caused by a zzso point zzso in the transforming growth zzso gene zzso However, the cellular role of zzso and the regulatory mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso are still poorly zzso zzso acid zzso refers to a small zzso zzso zzso produced in various cell types, and binds G zzso receptors to enhance numerous biological responses, including cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso levels are elevated in injured cornea and zzso is involved in proliferation and wound healing of cornea zzso zzso zzso evidence has indicated a crucial role for zzso expression of zzso protein zzso through zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso In the current study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso derived from normal or zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was completely inhibited upon zzso with the zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso expression with small hairpin zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso type I zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or an zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso requires zzso proteins for the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso specific inhibitor zzso or zzso depletion of zzso zzso abrogates zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso induction requires zzso zzso but not zzso signaling zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulates zzso expression through zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling pathways and provide important information for understanding the role of zzso involved in cornea related zzso
