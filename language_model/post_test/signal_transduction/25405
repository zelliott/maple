There is much evidence supporting the role of zzso zzso in zzso but the mechanisms underlying their effects have not been zzso zzso we studied zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice zzso in zzso and explored possible molecular mechanisms in zzso 

zzso artery zzso zzso was performed in zzso and zzso mice and zzso responses to chronic zzso zzso were zzso blood flow was measured by ultrasound and zzso of dyed zzso bone zzso muscle zzso and skin thickness were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso delivery of an zzso zzso the human zzso zzso was used to reinstate zzso in zzso zzso zzso mechanisms were investigated in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso focusing on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was severely impaired in zzso mice subjected to zzso but was restored by gene therapy with zzso The zzso responses to a variety of stimuli were impaired in zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, removal of zzso impaired the zzso of zzso a zzso factor that promotes zzso neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso response element binding protein zzso a zzso factor that counter regulates zzso was zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso administration restored zzso membrane density, reduced zzso activity and reinstated the zzso response to zzso and zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso control zzso through the tight regulation of nuclear zzso zzso
