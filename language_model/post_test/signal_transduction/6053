A zzso modification of the zzso chamber zzso originally developed for use on rats is zzso This modified zzso permits improved zzso due to subcutaneous zzso implants of constant shape and zzso We have zzso assessed the zzso potential of the growth factors basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso with special emphasis on their mutual zzso A zzso zzso relationship for zzso was established for doses between 150 and 1000 zzso per chamber, whereas zzso did not display zzso activity on its own in the tested dose of up to 200 zzso per zzso zzso we found a strong synergistic action of zzso and zzso when combined in a zzso zzso Two other combinations zzso with greater zzso doses were also tested, but the synergistic effect was only observed when 50 zzso of zzso was added to 150 zzso per chamber of zzso This synergistic effect of zzso and zzso was significantly reduced by further addition of 100 zzso zzso zzso of the response to zzso and zzso was confirmed by in zzso zzso migration experiments, which, together with our in zzso results, indicates that zzso may target zzso responses to zzso and zzso in zzso
