Heart formation in zzso and fruit flies requires signaling by bone zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso precursor zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are the earliest known markers for the cardiac zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in the cardiac lineage is dependent on a zzso zzso that binds zzso zzso which activate zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso which maintains its own expression through an zzso zzso Here, we show that an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene contains multiple zzso binding sites, as well as a binding site for zzso A single zzso site is required for zzso activity at early and late stages of heart development in zzso whereas the zzso site is not required for zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso like zzso is a direct target for zzso zzso by zzso zzso however, the independence of this zzso zzso of zzso binding suggests a fundamental difference in the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso expression during zzso in zzso and fruit zzso
