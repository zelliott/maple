Short periods of zzso zzso zzso significantly suppress the frequency of zzso zzso zzso in adult male zzso zzso zzso of food intake zzso zzso after zzso rapidly restores zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the resumption of zzso zzso after zzso results from the zzso consequences of food intake rather than from relief of the psychological stress associated with zzso To differentiate between these two possible types of signals, we attempted to provide zzso monkeys with the nutritional signals of a zzso meal without zzso the psychological stress associated with zzso To do this, we provided monkeys with a zzso meal via zzso gastric zzso while continuing to deny them access to monkey zzso Nine adult male zzso monkeys with zzso gastric and zzso zzso were zzso for 1 day, and on the following day they received a liquid zzso infusion zzso in caloric content and zzso composition to a normal zzso at the normal feeding time zzso zzso via the gastric zzso Blood samples were collected from zzso h at zzso zzso zzso infusions caused a restoration of zzso zzso zzso that was not different from the restoration caused by zzso a normal meal of zzso monkey zzso In contrast, zzso zzso remained suppressed on a second day of zzso Additionally, monkeys receiving zzso infusions displayed behavioral agitation similar to zzso zzso while monkeys zzso monkey zzso showed very little zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso signals, rather than the relief of psychological stress, lead to the resumption of zzso zzso zzso after zzso
