zzso stress resulting from unilateral zzso obstruction zzso may be aggravated by increased production of zzso Previous studies have demonstrated increased zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in response to zzso We investigated, both in zzso and in zzso the role of zzso in the induction of zzso in rats subjected to zzso and in zzso exposed to zzso and mechanical zzso zzso subjected to zzso zzso were treated with two mechanistically distinct zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the complex I inhibitor zzso zzso to interfere with zzso zzso We found that zzso induction of zzso in the inner zzso was attenuated by both zzso In addition, zzso and zzso reduced zzso damage and zzso stress after zzso Moreover, mechanical stretch induced zzso and zzso stress in zzso Likewise, zzso exposed to zzso as an zzso of zzso stress showed increased zzso expression and activity, both of which were reduced by zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso production, which was increased after exposure of zzso to zzso was also reduced by zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was blocked by both zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso attenuated the induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso further exacerbated the zzso stress level in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stress as a consequence of zzso stimulates zzso expression through the zzso of multiple zzso and that the induction of zzso may exert a zzso function in zzso
