Here we present a successful transplantation of the zzso genetic regulatory zzso into the zzso signaling zzso in zzso The zzso zzso represents a strictly regulated zzso mechanism that we have transplanted into zzso to create a highly robust induction system to assist the detection of zzso switching in zzso zzso In our system, we engineered zzso to drive the positive zzso regulatory gene in response to zzso zzso signaling and to induce zzso of a green fluorescent protein zzso reporter gene under the control of the zzso structural gene zzso zzso in response to zzso stimulation of zzso receptors zzso the engineered zzso achieved more than a zzso increase in reporter intensity in up to zzso of cells, as determined by flow zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso induction of the zzso reporter gene was higher than that by zzso Our approach to boost reporter gene induction could be zzso in establishing more efficient zzso flow zzso screening systems for zzso zzso for zzso zzso
