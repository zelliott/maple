zzso zzso zzso are the zzso oldest zzso animals, their evolution dating back to 600 million years zzso Here we demonstrate that sponges express zzso zzso activity, which converts zzso into zzso zzso a potent and universal zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by temperature increases by means of an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso triggering this signaling cascade was a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complete zzso zzso in sponges highlights a number of features zzso in higher zzso zzso the zzso channel zzso sensitive to heat, mechanical stress, zzso and zzso shares all of the functional characteristics of the zzso zzso background zzso channel responsible for central and peripheral zzso zzso involvement of the zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso as its second zzso is reminiscent of the drought stress signaling zzso in zzso These results suggest an ancient evolutionary origin of this zzso cascade in a common precursor of modern zzso and zzso
