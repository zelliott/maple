We demonstrate here that zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso zzso for zzso zzso are increased by a highly selective zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice within zzso zzso upon zzso treatment, kidney zzso zzso activity increases zzso The zzso zzso hormones, zzso acid and zzso acid, and the synthetic zzso acid zzso compound, zzso also stimulate zzso Additionally, we show that zzso stimulates zzso of a zzso reporter zzso driven by zzso promoter sequences in the presence of zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso This first demonstration of a gene that is regulated in the intact animal through an zzso zzso confirms earlier hypotheses that zzso is a bona fide hormone zzso zzso of a key gene in the vitamin D signaling zzso by a zzso zzso may provide a molecular basis for some of the documented biological effects of vitamin A on bone and vitamin D zzso
