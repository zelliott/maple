zzso zzso zzso responses are a crucial first line of defense against viral infections and are critical for generating both innate and zzso zzso zzso viruses have necessarily evolved mechanisms to impede the zzso zzso zzso was found to completely abolish zzso zzso signaling via multiple zzso zzso Although the extent and zzso of this zzso were indistinguishable between the various zzso zzso there were distinct differences in the mechanisms zzso employed to zzso zzso among the zzso These zzso differences could be zzso into two categories dependent on the phase of the zzso zzso cycle that was responsible for this zzso zzso early zzso cells which exhibited zzso of zzso prior to viral DNA zzso zzso late zzso cells where early phase zzso mechanisms were not functional, but viral functions expressed following DNA replication compensated for their zzso In early zzso cells, zzso infection targeted zzso protein for zzso degradation and prevented de zzso expression of zzso by degrading its zzso In contrast, zzso infected late zzso cells exhibited no apparent changes in zzso transcript or protein zzso However, in these cells zzso was not activated by zzso and failed to zzso to the cell nucleus, thereby preventing zzso of zzso zzso In primary human zzso zzso failed to fully degrade zzso and therefore, both early and late phase mechanisms functioned zzso to zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Taken together, these results indicate the importance that zzso has assigned to zzso investing significant zzso currency throughout its zzso zzso for continuous targeted destruction and zzso of this zzso
