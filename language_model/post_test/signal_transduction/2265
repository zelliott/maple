zzso is a zzso surface zzso found in association with the zzso zzso complex on both T and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immune responses, but the molecular mechanisms of its action remain zzso In this respect, the assessment of the relative and unique contribution of zzso in cell signaling events is a crucial zzso We have used zzso zzso and zzso zzso to show that the zzso signaling zzso is distinct from that used by the zzso zzso We hereby identify two independent mechanisms of zzso zzso release by virtue of their different zzso 1) an early and transient zzso increase that results from the zzso of a zzso zzso C, and 2) a late and sustained increase that requires de zzso zzso zzso Studies performed on a zzso zzso cell zzso indicate that only the zzso zzso zzso C zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso demonstrate that both mechanisms are dependent on the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a signaling zzso per zzso that uses mechanisms resembling those used by some zzso receptors (such as zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
