The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is best known for targeting zzso zzso containing premature termination zzso for rapid degradation, but it is also required for regulation of many zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were originally identified by forward genetic screens in zzso and zzso zzso In other organisms, the zzso zzso has been investigated by studying the zzso of these zzso We present here the first unbiased genetic screen in zzso designed specifically to identify genes involved in zzso By using a highly efficient genetic mosaic approach, we have screened zzso of the zzso zzso and isolated more than 40 zzso of genes required for zzso We focus on zzso we have obtained in two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our analysis of multiple zzso of the core zzso component zzso reveals that the zzso requirement in zzso may be separate from its requirement for zzso indicating additional critical cellular roles for this zzso Our zzso of zzso are the first point zzso obtained in zzso and we find that zzso has both zzso and zzso roles in zzso Thus, our genetic screens have revealed that zzso zzso factors play distinct roles in target regulation, similar to what is found in zzso but distinct from the relatively similar requirements for zzso genes observed in zzso zzso and zzso
