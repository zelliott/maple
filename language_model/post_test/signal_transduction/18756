The role of zzso receptors zzso in pathogen recognition has been zzso advanced in recent zzso However, investigations into the function of zzso in zzso tissue injury have just zzso Previously, we and others have demonstrated that fragmented zzso zzso accumulates during tissue zzso zzso is required to clear zzso during tissue injury, and impaired clearance of zzso results in unremitting zzso Additionally, fragmented zzso stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes by inflammatory cells at the injury zzso Recently, we identified that zzso fragments require both zzso and zzso to stimulate mouse zzso to produce inflammatory zzso and zzso In a zzso lung injury model, mice deficient in both zzso and zzso show an impaired zzso migration of inflammatory cells, increased tissue injury, elevated lung zzso cell zzso and decreased zzso Lung zzso cell zzso of high molecular mass zzso protected mice against acute lung injury and zzso in part through zzso zzso zzso of zzso The exaggerated injury in zzso and zzso deficient mice appears to be due to impaired zzso interactions on zzso zzso These studies identify that host zzso component zzso and zzso interactions provide signals that initiate inflammatory responses, maintain zzso cell integrity, and promote recovery from acute lung zzso
