zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules in type 2 zzso We hypothesized that zzso and zzso may interact to contribute to the evolution of vascular inflammation and zzso dysfunction in coronary zzso in type 2 zzso To test this hypothesis, we administered zzso to block zzso signaling in genetically modified mice with type 2 diabetes zzso and in zzso zzso zzso lean zzso zzso partially restored zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in isolated, zzso and zzso coronary zzso in zzso mice but did not affect zzso in m zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso production and the protein expression of zzso which is an indicator of zzso production, in isolated coronary zzso of zzso zzso zzso results showed that the expression of zzso and vascular cellular zzso zzso is zzso with zzso cells and zzso zzso or zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso interact to amplify the signaling process that leads to vascular zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso dysfunction occurring in type 2 diabetes is the result of the effects of the inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the expression of zzso and zzso zzso which further zzso vessel inflammation and zzso zzso
