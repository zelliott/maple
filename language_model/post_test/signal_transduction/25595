zzso zzso treatments with zzso acid can effectively protect zzso plants against zzso zzso through a mechanism based on a stronger and faster zzso of zzso zzso Plants impaired in zzso salicylic acid, zzso acid or zzso pathways showed intact protection by zzso acid upon zzso zzso zzso zzso no significant changes in the zzso marker gene zzso in either the zzso or zzso hormone balance were observed in the infected and treated zzso In contrast, the zzso signaling zzso showed dramatic changes after zzso acid treatment, mainly when the pathogen was zzso The impaired zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to display zzso acid zzso against the zzso In addition, zzso zzso plants infected with zzso zzso showed zzso in the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes implicated in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso levels were primed at early stages by zzso zzso zzso also zzso increased zzso zzso in response to the zzso Although zzso zzso has proved an effective zzso mechanism against zzso zzso it is apparently not essential to express zzso zzso resistance zzso because the zzso zzso zzso synthesis defective zzso is protected by zzso We recently described how zzso acid treatments can protect tomato plants against zzso zzso by stimulating zzso zzso deposition and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso We clearly demonstrate here that zzso is a dependent plant species, since this acid protects zzso plants against the same zzso by zzso zzso defenses without enhancing zzso zzso
