zzso zzso cells depend on zzso for survival and zzso In zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso also regulate tumor growth, which is exploited by hormonal therapies in zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize the zzso zzso zzso response in hormonal zzso zzso cells and identify potential disease zzso 

Human zzso zzso were used to establish the zzso expression profile of zzso zzso cells and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, 107 transcripts were zzso in zzso and derivatives after zzso or zzso zzso The zzso expression profiles reflected the zzso modifications of respective zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in stronger and broader zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with deficient response of zzso genes and the zzso zzso resulted in zzso response to both zzso and zzso This zzso signature was linked to multiple publicly available cell line and tumor derived zzso databases, revealing that distinct functional clusters were zzso modulated during zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions were zzso in primary zzso but zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso Finally, the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were selected as potential disease markers for zzso zzso in a distinct set of human prostate zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso in high-grade and zzso zzso while zzso was zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso modifications altered the zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, selective zzso of genes involved in differentiation and zzso of genes promoting proliferation and invasion suggest a disturbed balance between the growth and differentiation functions of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso These findings may have implications in the current treatment and development of novel zzso approaches for zzso zzso
