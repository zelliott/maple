Gene expression in cells is a dynamic process but is usually examined at a single time zzso We used gene expression profiling over time to build zzso models of gene zzso after zzso zzso zzso signaling in healthy and zzso B cells and chose this as a model since zzso zzso zzso both cell proliferation and zzso with increased zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso compared to healthy B zzso To determine the basis for this, we examined the global zzso gene expression profile for zzso stimulation and developed a linear combination method to zzso the effect of zzso simulation over all the time points for all zzso zzso learning identified common early events in healthy B cells and zzso zzso Although healthy and zzso B cells share a common genetic pattern early after zzso zzso a specific genetic program is engaged by the zzso cells at later time points after zzso zzso These findings identify the molecular basis for the different functional consequences of zzso zzso in healthy and zzso B zzso Analysis of gene expression profiling over time may be used to identify genes that might be rational targets to zzso these zzso
