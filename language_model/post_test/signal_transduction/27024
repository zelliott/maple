The zzso of zzso D in the kidney could be detected in zzso in rats treated with ethanol by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso D in the remaining kidney as indicated by an increase in the level of zzso A significant increase in zzso level was observed as early as 5 zzso after zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso of zzso was observed after 15 zzso The zzso level decreased again to the zzso level after 2 zzso The zzso of zzso was specific for kidney and the product was localized primarily in the zzso zzso D activity in kidney cortical slices from zzso rats was zzso in zzso by plasma obtained from unilaterally zzso rats, indicating that circulating factors in the plasma are responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso D zzso by plasma from zzso animals was selectively inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso It is concluded that zzso D activity is zzso as an early signal zzso event in zzso kidney zzso
