zzso and zzso zzso complexes were observed in regard to the growth of primary and secondary solid tumors and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The complexes were detected by electron zzso resonance zzso at liquid nitrogen zzso zzso solid tumors and secondary solid tumors or zzso were zzso on the same day, or with a zzso The primary tumor inhibited growth of the secondary solid tumor only if the latter was zzso with a zzso which did not correlate with the change of the types, nor with the increase in the level of zzso complexes detected in the zzso suggesting a zzso character of this zzso In some animals with solid tumors, spontaneous zzso zzso This process resulted in a marked decrease in the level of zzso complexes in the solid tumor zzso The primary solid zzso however, did not influence the growth of secondary zzso but intensified NO generation in the zzso of animals with partial removal of zzso zzso This experimental group survived zzso days longer than the control group without primary solid zzso Our research revealed that the presence of zzso complexes in the interaction between primary and secondary tumor strongly depends on the form of the zzso solid or zzso and that zzso zzso zzso may serve as a convenient model for the research on zzso zzso against in zzso growing zzso This is the first zzso study on zzso zzso in regard to zzso and zzso interactions in zzso
