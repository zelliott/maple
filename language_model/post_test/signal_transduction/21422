We identified zzso Ras protein 1 zzso as a negative regulator of protein zzso C zzso zzso and the consequences of this regulation have been examined for zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso expression in human embryonic kidney zzso cells completely abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity, which is consistent with previous reports of its ability to block zzso zzso signaling zzso In addition, zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity but did not alter zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to inhibit zzso stimulation of zzso by interfering with zzso zzso This effect was selective for the delta zzso because zzso did not alter zzso of zzso or zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso resulted in a significant blockade of zzso zzso activity as measured by zzso incorporation using a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso did not alter the membrane zzso of zzso however, the ability of zzso to interfere with zzso zzso was zzso as determined using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also not affected by zzso zzso Taken as a whole, these data suggest that zzso functionally interacts with zzso at the cellular membrane through an zzso mechanism to zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso our study suggests that zzso acts to zzso the zzso of zzso in an indirect fashion by zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The current study provides a novel role for zzso in signal zzso
