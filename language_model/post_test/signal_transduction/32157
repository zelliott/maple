Our group has previously shown that zzso wound healing is delayed and zzso abnormal in a mouse model of zzso zzso is not only required to stop bleeding at the time of zzso but also produces zzso substances that promote appropriate inflammatory and zzso responses during zzso Low intensity laser therapy zzso has been reported to enhance impaired wound healing in a variety of animal and human zzso The current studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that zzso can improve healing in a zzso B mouse zzso Three daily treatments with zzso zzso of zzso laser zzso reduced the time to closure of a zzso zzso punch biopsy wound in the zzso zzso All wounds were closed at 13 days in the zzso zzso mice, compared with 10 days in the zzso zzso mice, and 9 days in zzso zzso While zzso can speed healing by enhancing proliferation of zzso cells, we found that an additional mechanism likely contributes to the efficacy of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso enhanced the mechanical rigidity and zzso activity of clots formed from human zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso increased the zzso membrane potential and enhanced binding of zzso factors to the surface of activated zzso Thus, while zzso can directly promote zzso responses during healing, it also appears to enhance zzso in an animal model with impaired zzso These data suggest that trials of zzso as an adjunct to the usual zzso therapies in zzso are zzso
