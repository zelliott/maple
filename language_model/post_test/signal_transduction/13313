zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown either to stimulate or to inhibit neural cell proliferation depending on the origin of the cell zzso We show here that, depending on the presence or absence of zzso growth zzso zzso also called basic zzso zzso may either stimulate or inhibit DNA synthesis in neural precursors isolated from embryonic day zzso mouse zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation in a zzso zzso This zzso action was unaffected by zzso of protein zzso A and C but was abolished in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso was present, zzso inhibited DNA zzso This zzso action was insensitive to zzso but was fully blocked by the protein zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso The differential zzso by zzso and zzso zzso indicate that the zzso switch in zzso action on DNA synthesis was accomplished by a change in zzso signaling zzso We zzso that the actions of zzso in the specific parts of the developing nervous system are determined in part by the presence or absence of zzso and other growth zzso
