We recently identified a novel zzso zzso protein zzso for zzso and zzso interacting zzso zzso To unravel the cellular functions of zzso we used a zzso zzso system and identified zzso zzso zzso as a specific binding partner for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso also interact with zzso Upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the T zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is not observed in an zzso line, zzso indicating that zzso is the major zzso family zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with in zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso creating a zzso binding zzso zzso has also been identified as a zzso zzso zzso in the nucleus involved in zzso regulation, therefore we propose that zzso may serve as a zzso zzso to relay cellular signaling to the zzso and from the zzso to the zzso
