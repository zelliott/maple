The role of transforming growth zzso zzso in zzso T cell functions has been studied with zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso however, the full impact of zzso signaling on T cells and the mechanisms by which zzso signals remain poorly zzso Here we show that mice with T zzso deletion of zzso zzso II developed lethal inflammation associated with T cell zzso and zzso In addition, zzso signaling positively regulated T cell development and zzso Development of zzso T cells and zzso cells, maintenance of peripheral zzso regulatory T cells, and survival of zzso T cells all depended on zzso zzso Both T helper 1 zzso differentiation and survival of activated zzso T cells required zzso the zzso zzso factor, which controlled zzso expression and zzso signaling in zzso zzso This study reveals zzso functions of zzso signaling in T cells that may ensure a diverse and zzso T cell repertoire in zzso
