zzso growth factor zzso is a member of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso family that binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso has remained unclear and some in zzso studies suggest that zzso signaling may also play a role in zzso zzso To clarify these issues we evaluated zzso responses in a zzso zzso zzso model using zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We also investigated the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso technique, zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was transferred to the zzso of New Zealand White rabbits alone or together with zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso or soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso All animals were killed 7 days after gene zzso Increased zzso formation, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a significant inflammatory response were seen in zzso zzso The zzso were large and well zzso zzso and zzso suppressed the zzso response of zzso by 80 and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso gene transfer to vascular tissue increases zzso zzso expression and produces significant zzso Both zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso is a potentially useful candidate for the induction of therapeutic zzso in zzso
