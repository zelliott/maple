zzso of zzso cells, zzso formation of a vessel zzso is a prerequisite for zzso The underlying molecular mechanisms are ill zzso We have studied a brain zzso zzso cell line zzso established from zzso transgenic zzso These cells form hollow tubes in three-dimensional type I collagen gels in response to zzso growth zzso zzso Culture of zzso on collagen gels in the presence of zzso protected cells from zzso and allowed tube formation zzso zzso but not growth of the zzso zzso zzso but not cell survival, was inhibited by treatment of the cells with an zzso zzso Changes in zzso expression in the zzso cultures could not be zzso Rather, zzso interactions critical for zzso cell differentiation were created during the culture, as indicated by the gradual increase in zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the collagen gels led to zzso formation of tube structures, but cells were not protected from zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso signal zzso in this cell model results in cell zzso Through mechanisms dependent on zzso zzso possibly involving the zzso and zzso produced by the zzso zzso cells, zzso stimulation also leads to differentiation of the zzso
