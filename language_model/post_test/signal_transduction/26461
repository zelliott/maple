zzso peptides are increasingly being linked to processes controlling the maintenance of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Y family, is zzso in some states that also display low bone zzso zzso zzso has high affinity for zzso particularly zzso and zzso which are known to regulate bone zzso zzso conditions and zzso surgery for obesity influence circulating levels of zzso and have a negative impact on bone mass, but the precise mechanism behind this is zzso We thus examined whether zzso in zzso expression affect bone zzso 

Bone zzso and cellular activity were analyzed in zzso zzso knockout and conditional zzso zzso zzso mice at zzso and zzso sites using zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso displayed a negative relationship with zzso zzso Male and female zzso knockout mice showed enhanced zzso activity, with greater zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso lowered zzso activity in zzso via a direct zzso zzso zzso mechanism involving zzso stimulation evident in zzso In contrast to zzso knockout mice, zzso over expression also altered bone zzso as indicated by greater zzso surface, despite the lack of zzso expression in zzso zzso While evident in both zzso cellular changes were generally more pronounced in zzso 

These data demonstrate that the gut zzso zzso is critical for the control of bone zzso This regulatory axis from the zzso to bone has the potential to contribute to the marked bone loss observed in situations of extreme weight loss and higher circulating zzso levels, such as anorexia and zzso obesity surgery, and may be important in the maintenance of bone mass in the general zzso
