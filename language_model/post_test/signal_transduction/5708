zzso zzso a major zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso including zzso production, inflammation and airway zzso Although zzso through its binding to zzso zzso alpha zzso uses the zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 6 zzso zzso to mediate these tissue responses, recent studies have demonstrated that other signaling pathways may also be involved zzso In the present study, whether zzso zzso an zzso of nuclear factor zzso inflammatory zzso factor, was investigated in human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso 

Nuclear proteins were extracted from cultured zzso treated with tumor necrosis factor zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso for activated zzso and zzso by Western zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso induced a zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso In addition, zzso with zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso of zzso 

Our results suggest for the first time that zzso activates zzso in zzso
