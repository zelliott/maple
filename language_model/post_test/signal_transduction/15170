zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling in acute zzso leukemia zzso blasts and zzso stem cells may enhance their sensitivity to zzso zzso We sought to determine the safety and describe the toxicity of this approach by adding the zzso zzso zzso zzso to intensive zzso induction zzso 

We performed a phase I dose escalation study of zzso with the chemotherapy regimen zzso zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso or zzso secondary zzso 

zzso subjects received zzso and zzso across five dose zzso zzso zzso were irreversible zzso zzso and zzso zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso was determined to be a 12 zzso loading dose on day 1 followed by 4 zzso on days 2 to 7, concurrent with zzso zzso Complete or partial zzso occurred in 6 zzso of the 27 subjects who completed chemotherapy, including 3 zzso of the 12 subjects treated at the zzso At the zzso measured zzso trough levels were within the therapeutic range for solid organ zzso However, direct measurement of the zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso blasts from these subjects only showed zzso target zzso in one of five zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso is an active and feasible zzso However, as administered in this study, the zzso between zzso and zzso was not zzso Future studies are planned with different schedules to clarify the clinical and zzso effects of zzso in zzso and to determine whether target zzso predicts chemotherapy zzso
