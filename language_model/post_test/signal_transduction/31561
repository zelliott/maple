Chemical and plant growth studies of zzso strains zzso and zzso revealed that the volatile components zzso and zzso trigger plant growth promotion in zzso zzso in growth promotion when zzso zzso are exposed to zzso versus zzso zzso suggest a divergence in chemical signaling for these two bacterial zzso To provide a comprehensive chemical profile of bacterial zzso zzso from these biologically active zzso zzso solid phase zzso zzso coupled with software extraction of overlapping zzso components was zzso Ten volatile zzso already reported from zzso and zzso were identified as well as 28 compounds not previously zzso Most of the newly identified compounds were zzso alcohols released from zzso at much higher levels than in zzso Principal component analysis clearly separated zzso from zzso with zzso producing higher amounts of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso alcohols share a similar functional motif to that of zzso and may afford alternative structural patterns for zzso from bacterial zzso
