The role of zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso expression has been a subject of great interest because of reports indicating that it controls the slow muscle zzso To delineate the role of zzso in zzso zzso particularly its role in driving expression of the type I zzso heavy chain zzso zzso we used a novel strategy zzso a profound transition from fast to slow fiber type is induced and examined in the absence and presence of zzso A zzso a zzso zzso To induce the zzso transition, we first subjected rats to 7 days of zzso suspension zzso + zzso hormone zzso zzso to suppress nearly all expression of type I zzso zzso in the zzso zzso HS + zzso was then zzso and rats resumed normal zzso and zzso state, during which vehicle or zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered for 7 or 14 zzso The findings demonstrate that, despite significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein abundance of type I zzso increased markedly during zzso relative to HS + zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso expression was, however, attenuated by zzso compared with vehicle zzso In addition, type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and relative protein levels were increased in zzso compared with zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso has a zzso role in zzso transcription, rather than a role as a primary regulator of slow zzso gene zzso
