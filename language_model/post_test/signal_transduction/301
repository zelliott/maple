Mouse zzso tumor virus zzso long terminal repeat zzso transgenic mice are excellent models for breast cancer as they allow for the targeted expression of various zzso and growth factors in zzso transformation of zzso zzso Numerous zzso transgenic mouse models of breast cancer have been created in the past three decades, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These transgenic mice develop zzso tumors with different zzso zzso and zzso reflecting the zzso pathways activated by the zzso Recently, zzso sequences of the zzso gene of zzso have been identified in approximately zzso of human breast zzso but not in normal breast or other types of zzso suggesting possible involvement of zzso tumor virus in human breast zzso zzso evidence demonstrates the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso Thus, the detection of zzso sequences may have diagnostic value to predict the clinical outcome of breast cancer zzso
