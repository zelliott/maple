In seed plants, lateral zzso such as leaves and floral zzso are formed from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso they have an inherent zzso zzso organ zzso have an zzso side next to the zzso and an zzso one away from the zzso zzso and genetic studies suggest that a zzso zzso which originates in the zzso converts the inherent polarity into a functional zzso Once an zzso axis of polarity is established within organ zzso it provides cues for proper zzso growth and zzso zzso Several key participants in this process have been identified, and analyses of these genes support and refine our views of axis formation in zzso The complex relationships between and within various members of these zzso gene families zzso III zzso zzso and zzso might account for a substantial part of the zzso variation in lateral zzso of seed zzso
