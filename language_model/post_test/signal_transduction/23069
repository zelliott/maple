Environmental stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species activate zzso signaling zzso such as the zzso zzso protein zzso and nuclear factor zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated by zzso zzso In the present study, we show that besides zzso also the zzso zzso zzso became zzso upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and its upstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 6 zzso resulted in an enhanced zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso of zzso and zzso largely decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that a zzso zzso zzso different from zzso is involved in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso shock activates zzso and zzso via zzso and its upstream zzso zzso
