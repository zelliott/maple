In the nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are critical to the hypoxic zzso zzso However, the signal zzso pathways underlying the hypoxic zzso response remain zzso To assess the effect of a moderate hypoxic stimulus zzso zzso on zzso zzso of proteins in the nucleus zzso zzso tissue zzso were harvested by repeated punch sampling at 0, 1, 10, and 60 zzso of zzso and examined for the presence of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso increases occurred in proteins zzso at regions corresponding to molecular masses of zzso 50, 55, and 60 zzso which were attenuated by zzso with the zzso zzso channel blocker, zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may induce zzso and zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined in the nucleus zzso zzso and zzso during zzso and following administration of zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso activity in the cortex, but not in the nucleus zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso and zzso occurred in the nucleus zzso zzso during zzso whereas both zzso and zzso were recruited in zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding in the nucleus zzso zzso and the widespread zzso of all zzso zzso in the zzso was also zzso We conclude that in conscious rats, a moderate hypoxic stimulus elicits zzso widespread zzso protein zzso zzso in cortex, but selective zzso and zzso zzso in the nucleus zzso zzso thereby suggesting a functional role for the zzso zzso
