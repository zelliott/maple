The zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby implicated in the zzso zzso cascade and regulation of zzso zzso Later on, zzso was showed to be another major zzso providing zzso with a role in cell zzso Other unrelated zzso have been subsequently reported including for example factor zzso and zzso expanding the functions of zzso to unexpected biological areas such as the initiation of the zzso cascade or the regulation of language zzso Due to its zzso zzso anchor, zzso has no zzso domain and thus exerts its signaling capacity through lateral interactions with other components of the plasma membrane that actually mediate zzso zzso As yet, a total 42 proteins interacting directly with zzso can be numbered zzso 9 soluble zzso and 33 lateral zzso The fact that zzso interacts with members of three major families of membrane receptors zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso implies that the actual number of components zzso the zzso zzso is extremely zzso For example, 156 factors belong to the zzso zzso Moreover, in the light of the wide diversity of the components of the zzso zzso zzso appears to be an essential player of major biological systems including the blood zzso complement and plasma zzso zzso This review describes the soluble zzso and lateral partners of the zzso zzso the mechanisms regulating zzso interactions and their proved and/or potential biological zzso
