Many adult tissue stem cells, such as the cells of the zzso system, gastrointestinal zzso brain, zzso zzso zzso and lung have now been identified, all of them fulfilling a crucial role in zzso organisms with mature cells during normal zzso as well as in times of tissue generation or zzso Two unique features characterize adult stem zzso the ability to generate new zzso stem cells (to zzso and the ability to give rise to differentiated progeny that has lost its zzso zzso Our understanding of the mechanisms that determine whether, where and when a stem cell will zzso or differentiate is still zzso but recent advances have indicated that the stem cell zzso or zzso provides essential cues that direct these cell fate zzso Moreover, loss of control over these cell fate decisions might lead to cellular transformation and zzso This review addresses the current zzso of the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso stem cell zzso in the niche and how zzso transformation might change the dependency of zzso stem cells on their zzso for zzso and zzso
