zzso coupled receptors zzso are the largest family of cell surface zzso they activate zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Although many zzso have been shown to form zzso and/or zzso on the cell zzso the purpose of this zzso is not zzso Recent research has shown that zzso zzso may have a role in organization of receptors on the cell zzso In addition, zzso on the cell membrane termed zzso zzso have been shown to play a role in zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso and deterministic zzso we propose a novel mechanism for zzso raft zzso of zzso based on zzso zzso of receptors and then demonstrate that such zzso can affect zzso zzso Modeling results are consistent with a variety of experimental data indicating that zzso zzso have a role in amplification or zzso of zzso zzso Thus our work suggests a new mechanism by which zzso or zzso characteristics of zzso can influence zzso signaling by controlling zzso organization on the cell zzso
