Most zzso circumvent the zzso response by blocking zzso signaling and limiting the production of zzso by zzso zzso Here we report that the highly zzso zzso zzso domain of the V proteins of a wide variety of zzso binds melanoma zzso gene 5 zzso zzso zzso is an zzso host cell zzso box zzso that contains a zzso recruitment domain at its N zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso promoter in reporter gene zzso and significantly enhanced the zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso Both these activities were zzso by zzso of the V proteins of zzso virus 5, human zzso virus 2, zzso virus, zzso virus, and zzso zzso Similar results to the reporter zzso were obtained by measuring zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference or by dominant interfering forms of zzso significantly inhibited the zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso It thus appears that zzso plays a central role in an zzso signal zzso zzso that can lead to the zzso of the zzso promoter, and that the V proteins of zzso interact with zzso to block its zzso
