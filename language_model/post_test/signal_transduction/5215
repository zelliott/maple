zzso differentiation of human zzso stem cells zzso is classically thought to be zzso by different zzso such as the bone zzso proteins zzso Here, we report that cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso and its effects on cell shape and zzso mechanics, regulates zzso signaling and zzso differentiation of zzso Using zzso zzso to progressively restrict cell spreading and zzso against zzso we demonstrated that zzso osteogenesis is progressively antagonized with decreased cell zzso zzso triggered rapid and sustained zzso protein zzso zzso activity and zzso tension only in spread cells, and this signaling was required for zzso zzso zzso the molecular basis for this effect, we found that restricting cell zzso reducing ROCK zzso or zzso zzso tension prevented zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso Together, these findings demonstrate the direct involvement of cell spreading and zzso zzso tension generation in zzso signaling and early stages of in zzso zzso and highlight the essential interplay between zzso and mechanical cues in stem cell zzso
