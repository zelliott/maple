While the acute zzso effects of zzso zzso factor zzso have been well demonstrated, little is known regarding possible zzso effects that occur within a short period of zzso The acute effects of zzso on zzso spine zzso were examined in zzso cells in cultured main zzso bulb zzso zzso slices prepared from zzso rats were cultured for 1 day, and zzso was applied at varying time points prior to zzso zzso cell zzso were labeled with a membrane dye and observed with a zzso laser scanning zzso The addition of zzso into the culture medium 6 h before fixation decreased the mean diameter of the zzso processes zzso but the length and density of the processes were not zzso Both zzso in the external zzso layer and those in the zzso cell layer exhibited similar zzso Considering the slow penetration into the zzso zzso was then applied to the top of each zzso When applied 1 h before zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced the same changes in the external zzso layer and the zzso cell layer, zzso The changes became zzso as early as 30 zzso when 50 zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso with zzso toxin or an zzso zzso zzso abolished the acute effects of zzso on spine zzso These results indicate that zzso can alter spine zzso within a shorter period of time than previously observed and that the effects are zzso by enhanced zzso zzso
