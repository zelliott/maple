In order to zzso the overlapping and diverse pharmacological protective mechanisms of different Chinese medicinal compounds, we investigated the zzso of gene expression and zzso of signaling pathways in the mouse zzso after treatment of cerebral zzso injury with various zzso A zzso including zzso genes was used to identify zzso expressed genes among six treatment groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso sham, and zzso The US Food and Drug Administration zzso zzso system and zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso database were used to screen significantly altered genes and pathways zzso zzso zzso fold change zzso zzso treatment alone resulted in zzso of 726 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the sham treatment zzso BA, zzso and CA treatments, but not CM treatment, were effective in reducing zzso volume compared with vehicle treatment zzso zzso zzso Compared with the CM group, a total of 167 zzso zzso 94 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 181 zzso zzso 105 zzso altered genes were found in the BA, zzso and CA groups, zzso The numbers of overlapping genes between the BA and zzso BA and CA, and zzso and CA groups were 28 (16 zzso 12 zzso 14 (4 zzso 10 zzso and 31 (8 zzso 23 zzso zzso Three overlapping genes were identified among the BA, zzso and CA treatment groups: zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso analysis, two, seven, and four pathways were significantly activated in the BA, zzso and CA groups, respectively, when compared to the CM zzso The zzso cassette (ABC) zzso general zzso was activated by BA and zzso treatment, and the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso was activated by zzso and CA zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression was found by real time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, confirming the results of the zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso profiles of zzso altered genes exist in the mouse zzso treated with different compounds known to be zzso effective in cerebral zzso injury, and we were able to identify overlapping genes and pathways among these zzso zzso these different compounds may function through both overlapping and distinct pharmacological mechanisms to exert their therapeutic zzso
