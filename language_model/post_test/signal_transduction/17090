zzso zzso structures formed by zzso zzso zzso are implicated in many zzso and pathological zzso zzso sequences are abundant in zzso DNA, and zzso have recently been shown to exist in the zzso of zzso zzso However, how zzso are formed in the zzso remains largely zzso Here, we show that zzso formation can be remotely induced by downstream zzso events that are thousands of base pairs zzso The induced zzso alter protein recognition and cause zzso termination at the local zzso These results suggest that a zzso sequence can serve as a sensor or receiver to sense remote DNA tracking activity in response to the propagation of mechanical zzso in a DNA double zzso We propose that the zzso formation may provide a mean for long-range sensing and communication between zzso zzso locations to coordinate regulatory transactions in zzso zzso
