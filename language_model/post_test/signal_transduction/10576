In this paper, we present a novel framework for zzso regulatory and zzso information from gene zzso zzso The key idea of our methodology is the systematic integration of network zzso and network zzso analysis approaches for uncovering biological zzso 

We determine the gene zzso network of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso data and show how the zzso network zzso can be linked to zzso information hard-wired in the zzso zzso We propose a systematic way for determining the correlation threshold at which two genes are assessed to be zzso using the zzso zzso and we expand the scope of the gene zzso network by proposing the slope ratio metric as a means for incorporating zzso on the zzso We show through specific examples for zzso zzso that by incorporating expression level information in addition to the zzso expression patterns, we can uncover zzso biological zzso In particular, we are able to identify a number of cases where zzso the zzso genes are part of a single zzso unit or zzso and zzso the zzso zzso arises due to the presence of zzso zzso termination zzso
