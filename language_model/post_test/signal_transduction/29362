zzso studies indicate that zzso asthma is initiated by stress zzso and zzso obesity and zzso zzso despite our understanding of the various zzso that promote chronic zzso zzso most of which are known to elevate cortisol production via the zzso zzso zzso zzso and systemic zzso are the mainstay for the treatment of chronic zzso This implicates other zzso or cellular changes independent of cortisol synthesis in zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso are thought to zzso zzso tone in zzso asthma is via zzso genes that increase zzso and zzso production which promote muscle zzso zzso any zzso condition that suppresses zzso zzso and zzso production would counter zzso muscle relaxation and potentially trigger zzso zzso zzso zzso obesity and menopause act on three interrelated zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which operate through receptors to zzso zzso and zzso metabolism in smooth muscle cells zzso We propose that the level of zzso zzso as determined by overall signaling through zzso zzso zzso receptors and the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso will regulate zzso tone zzso the zzso zzso Model of zzso zzso Thus, decreases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling and increases in zzso zzso signaling relative to zzso signaling would decrease cellular zzso zzso and promote muscle zzso This model can explain the zzso zzso data zzso stress, zzso depression and menopause with zzso asthma and is supported by basic and clinical zzso Treatment of depressed or zzso zzso with selective zzso zzso zzso or hormone replacement therapy, respectively, zzso zzso Future therapeutic strategies might therefore target the zzso zzso and zzso pathways in regulating cellular zzso production and zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
