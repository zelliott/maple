The effects of zzso zzso on tumor growth are zzso We investigated whether a decreased level of zzso affected tumor growth using zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, which showed zzso zzso When cancer cells were injected zzso into both zzso and zzso mice, the tumor growth was markedly attenuated in zzso zzso zzso levels in the blood, zzso and tumors of zzso mice bearing tumors were significantly smaller than those of their zzso zzso However, zzso did not increase cancer zzso proliferation in zzso When we applied zzso zzso to the wild mice bearing tumors, they did not inhibit tumor zzso The zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expressions in tumors were reduced in zzso mice compared with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expressions in human zzso vein zzso cell zzso in a zzso zzso When we measured zzso of multiple signaling pathways by using a zzso zzso zzso platform, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso in zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso level of zzso induced zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso Human zzso vein zzso cell expressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso did not in zzso zzso reduced zzso density in tumors and inhibited the proliferation of zzso in zzso These results suggest that regulation of zzso and zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso may serve as a therapeutic strategy in cancer zzso
