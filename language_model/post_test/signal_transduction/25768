zzso is the key zzso of the zzso signal and also a component of zzso complexes at the zzso adhering zzso which mediates zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso might be involved in the long-lasting changed zzso of zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and could play a role in the zzso of zzso In this study we investigated the expression of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso were obtained during joint replacement surgery or zzso from six patients with zzso six patients with zzso zzso and six patients with joint trauma zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed in the zzso zzso from the three zzso zzso zzso from three patients in each group were selected at random for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso from the three groups was evaluated at the protein level by western zzso and at the zzso level by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso revealed that the expression of zzso in zzso lining cells of the zzso samples was significantly greater than that of the zzso or trauma samples zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso showed that zzso expression was elevated in zzso compared with that in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at the protein level but no difference was found at the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso is elevated in zzso not only in zzso but also in zzso The increase is due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated in zzso and contributes to the stable zzso of zzso
