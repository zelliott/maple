The major neural stem cell population in the developing cerebral zzso is the zzso zzso cells, which generate zzso and zzso zzso The mechanisms that zzso the maintenance of the zzso zzso stem cell zzso or its zzso are not completely zzso We previously demonstrated that transforming growth zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso differentiation into zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here we investigated the zzso signaling pathways involved in the zzso zzso zzso fate zzso We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying the zzso effect on zzso zzso cell differentiation or zzso potential maintenance zzso Whereas zzso zzso differentiation into zzso is zzso by the zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, zzso is modulated by different levels of zzso and zzso zzso Our work demonstrates that zzso zzso cells are a zzso population and a potential target of zzso and suggests that its effect on zzso zzso fate commitment is zzso by the recruitment of a complex zzso mechanism that controls zzso and zzso generation in the developing cerebral zzso
