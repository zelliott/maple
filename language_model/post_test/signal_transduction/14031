In an effort to circumvent resistance to zzso zzso zzso searched for novel zzso that may be key players in the response of cancer cells to zzso We found that zzso at zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells, but had only a minimal effect on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased zzso and induced zzso cell death, suggesting that excessive zzso of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso Treating cells with zzso enhanced zzso increase in zzso zzso and zzso death and showed that zzso cells are more sensitive to increased zzso zzso than zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to radiation, and both zzso zzso increase in breast cancer type 1 zzso zzso thus implicating enhanced zzso of zzso in zzso of DNA zzso Indeed, zzso inhibited zzso end joining as well as zzso zzso repair of double strand breaks that were induced by zzso in green fluorescent protein reporter zzso In addition to its effect on radiation, zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso death in response to the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso demonstrating further the involvement of zzso activity in modulating zzso zzso These experiments suggest that excessive zzso of zzso decreases survival of cancer zzso making zzso a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the zzso effects of established zzso therapies and circumvent resistance to zzso and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the zzso zzso
