The functional role of zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso is not entirely understood but it was linked to an increased propensity for triggered zzso The aim of this study was to determine how zzso receptors can translate zzso release into a zzso of the plasma membrane and consequently zzso zzso We used embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso as a model system since their spontaneous electrical activity depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso was monitored with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was achieved by targeted expression of zzso in the nucleus zzso or expression of zzso zzso zzso localized to the plasma zzso zzso activity of zzso was monitored simultaneously as zzso zzso zzso zzso and action zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso zzso was paralleled by an increase of zzso and spontaneous activity was modulated by zzso A zzso and zzso increase of zzso zzso ratio and zzso and zzso fold increase in beating frequency was recorded upon stimulation with zzso zzso 100 zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso had no effect on the zzso frequency while zzso of zzso signaling throughout the cell zzso or at the plasma membrane zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso decrease in beating zzso In zzso expressing cells the response to zzso was completely zzso zzso released from zzso is more effective than zzso released from zzso to enhance zzso The results support the hypothesis that in zzso zzso form a functional signaling domain with zzso that translates zzso release efficiently into a zzso of the membrane zzso
