The signals that control the zzso ability of zzso stem cells zzso in response to damage are zzso Here, we demonstrate that downstream zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso cycling and expansion of primitive bone zzso zzso cells under zzso conditions and during acute zzso However, this effect is at the expense of zzso function, because continued zzso zzso during zzso zzso expression of specific cell cycle regulators, leading to zzso zzso In zzso treatment with an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso these zzso and functional defects in zzso Our study establishes zzso signaling as a regulator of the zzso cell cycle machinery that balances zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
