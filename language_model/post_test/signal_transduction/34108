zzso patterning of zzso structures is a fundamental process during embryonic organization and zzso Studies have shown how gene networks are employed to pattern butterfly zzso fly zzso and zzso zzso zzso such as teeth, feathers, hair and zzso zzso Despite knowledge of how these features are zzso little is known about how diversity in periodic patterning is generated in zzso We address this problem through the molecular analysis of oral jaw dental diversity in Lake Malawi zzso where closely related species exhibit from 1 to 20 rows of teeth, with total teeth counts ranging from around 10 to zzso 

We investigate the expression of zzso gene networks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to pattern zzso structures and teeth in other zzso We show that zzso variation in expression pattern reflects adult zzso diversity among three closely related Malawi zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso appears to govern the competence both of initial tooth sites and future tooth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso and zzso regions, and likely regulate the spacing of these zzso zzso Finally, we used chemical zzso to demonstrate the fundamental role of zzso zzso and initial zzso formation in the organization of the periodically patterned zzso dental zzso 

zzso patterns of gene expression differ among Malawi species and prefigure the zzso distribution of functional teeth of specific size and zzso This variation in gene expression among species occurs early in the zzso zzso for dental zzso These data show how a complex zzso zzso zzso is organized and how zzso tinkering of zzso gene networks during zzso pattern formation can impact upon the evolution of zzso zzso
