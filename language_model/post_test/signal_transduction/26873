zzso zzso activates a zzso zzso signaling zzso similar to the one activated by zzso via zzso which is the drug target of zzso zzso levels are increased under several disease conditions associated with impaired zzso zzso 

Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and from 40 patients under chronic zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso at least partially mimicking the effect of zzso via zzso In zzso zzso increased zzso zzso index in zzso patients indicating potential zzso of downstream targets of zzso When zzso patients by their zzso levels, patients within the highest zzso of zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso had the weakest response to zzso zzso zzso index, 68 zzso zzso and patients within the lowest zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso had the strongest response zzso zzso index, 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso by itself induced zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso at zzso zzso versus zzso 

In addition to desensitizing zzso to zzso E1 via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso protein similar to zzso signaling through zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso response in zzso zzso Once released from an zzso zzso this mechanism could contribute locally to impaired zzso responsiveness at the vulnerable zzso
