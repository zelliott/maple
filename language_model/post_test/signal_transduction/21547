zzso is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso not only zzso inflammatory responses in the vascular zzso but also induced fatty liver and zzso via zzso zzso One of the zzso factors activated in the liver during zzso was zzso element binding protein zzso zzso regulates the expression of many genes including those involved in zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which zzso activated zzso in rat liver and in zzso zzso 

zzso was induced in rats by feeding zzso diet for 4 zzso There was a significant increase in zzso zzso levels, protein zzso A zzso activity and an zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso to 100 zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and subsequently increased zzso binding zzso zzso was activated in zzso cells as a result of increased cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso not only reduced the zzso zzso levels elevated by zzso treatment but also inhibited zzso zzso and prevented zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
