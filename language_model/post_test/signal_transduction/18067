zzso zzso of zzso disease virus zzso have been widely used for the treatment of zzso zzso Apparently, this zzso and zzso zzso can alter the zzso of tumor zzso To determine the influence of zzso infection on a zzso zzso response on a functional level, we used zzso primary melanoma cells infected with the zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells and zzso zzso were prepared from a freshly zzso zzso and zzso zzso were subjected to limited dilution zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell clone zzso zzso showed that the zzso clone was rendered zzso against its zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso melanoma zzso even remaining unresponsive to subsequent stimulation by zzso zzso infection of the zzso melanoma cell line not only completely restored the zzso response of zzso to zzso comparable with stimulation by zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also inhibited the induction of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso of zzso cell zzso revealed the induction of the zzso complex by zzso with zzso melanoma zzso Because the induction of this complex of nuclear proteins shows specificity for the zzso of the zzso zzso but functional zzso expression was not zzso on zzso melanoma cells at any zzso we propose the induction of a zzso factor different from B7 by zzso viral zzso
