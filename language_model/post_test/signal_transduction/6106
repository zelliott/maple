zzso zzso expressed on zzso the zzso cells of the central nervous system, promote either differentiation and survival or proliferation by amplification of growth factor zzso Here, we report that the zzso family zzso zzso zzso and Lyn regulate each of these distinct zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and is required to amplify zzso growth factor survival zzso to promote zzso membrane formation, and to switch zzso signaling from a zzso zzso to a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso changing the response from proliferation to zzso However, earlier in the lineage zzso not zzso is required to drive zzso zzso zzso The two zzso respond to zzso zzso by different zzso zzso by increased zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso by reduced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These findings illustrate how different zzso can act as zzso for specific cell responses during development within a single cell zzso and, zzso provide a molecular mechanism to explain similar zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
