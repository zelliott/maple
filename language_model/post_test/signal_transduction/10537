While zzso zzso zzso is an infamous zzso it is also an effective zzso agent for acute zzso leukemia and some solid zzso In human zzso zzso zzso cells, we found that zzso induced cell death in zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, dependent regulation of the zzso zzso promoter, zzso zzso and zzso protein expression was also zzso Additionally, zzso of a small interfering zzso of zzso could block the zzso cell growth zzso The zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Using a reporter zzso we demonstrated the involvement of the zzso zzso in the promoter zzso In contrast, zzso inhibitor enhanced the zzso zzso zzso also in a zzso zzso zzso of a dominant negative zzso zzso likewise also enhanced this zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibitor attenuated the zzso effect of zzso In contrast, in combination with zzso inhibitor and zzso enhanced cellular zzso zzso we conclude that in zzso cells the zzso and zzso pathways might zzso contribute to zzso zzso expression and then due to cellular zzso
