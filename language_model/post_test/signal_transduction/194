zzso receptors are membrane zzso channels gated by zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed in excitable and zzso cells of zzso They play key roles in zzso zzso zzso signaling (including zzso regulation of zzso blood flow, vascular zzso and inflammatory zzso We zzso the evidence for these and other roles, emphasizing experimental work with selective zzso zzso or with knockout zzso The receptors are zzso membrane zzso Studies of the zzso properties of zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells have indicated parts of the zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso (including calcium zzso and membrane zzso We review our current understanding of the molecular properties of zzso zzso including how this understanding is informed by the identification of zzso related zzso receptors in simple zzso
