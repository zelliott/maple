Drug resistance remains a critical problem in the treatment of patients with multiple zzso Recent studies have determined that zzso signaling plays a major role in bone zzso zzso zzso protection of myeloma cells from de zzso drug-induced zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso zzso of zzso signaling could affect the viability of myeloma cells and their sensitivity to zzso Treatment with a zzso inhibitor zzso alone induced zzso of myeloma cells via specific zzso of zzso zzso At zzso toxic for myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells, zzso did not affect normal zzso or peripheral blood zzso zzso Treatment with zzso prevented zzso zzso protection of myeloma cells from drug-induced zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso via zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso In zzso experiments using zzso and zzso models of multiple myeloma demonstrated substantial zzso effect of zzso In addition, zzso significantly improved the zzso of the zzso drugs zzso and zzso Thus, this study demonstrates that zzso of zzso signaling prevents zzso drug resistance and zzso myeloma cells to zzso This may represent a promising approach for therapeutic intervention in multiple zzso
