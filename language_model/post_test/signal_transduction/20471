In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding how zzso family zzso regulate the formation and function of zzso zzso are organized zzso structures that contain an zzso core surrounded by an adhesive ring and mediate invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso either directly or zzso each phase of the zzso life cycle including zzso zzso maturation and zzso degradation and zzso Complex zzso of zzso zzso proteins are involved at different stages of zzso maturation and their zzso activity must be tightly regulated to achieve effective invasive zzso In this review, we highlight some recent progress and the challenges of understanding how zzso is regulated temporally and zzso to orchestrate the dynamics of zzso and mediate cell zzso
