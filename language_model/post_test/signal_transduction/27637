zzso is a growth factor membrane of the vitamin zzso family of proteins which is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso was previously reported to induce cell cycle re-entry of zzso zzso cells and to prevent cell death after complete growth factor withdrawal, the survival effect being zzso from zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that both zzso zzso and survival effects are zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Here we report that Ras is required for zzso zzso but is zzso for its survival zzso zzso survival requires the activity of the small zzso of the zzso family, zzso and zzso together with the downstream zzso zzso zzso of the respective dominant negative zzso abrogates zzso survival zzso zzso of zzso to serum starved cells results in the zzso of zzso and in the zzso of the zzso family member, zzso By zzso expression of a zzso inactive form of zzso we demonstrate that zzso is necessary for zzso survival zzso We further show evidence that zzso stimulation of serum starved zzso cells results in a transient zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso survival, suggesting that such zzso is not involved in zzso protection from cell zzso On the contrary we found that the late zzso increase of zzso zzso activity associated with cell death was zzso in zzso zzso cells thus suggesting that zzso might promote survival by interfering with this zzso Taken together the evidence here provided identity elements involved in zzso zzso more specifically zzso the zzso responsible for zzso cell survival under conditions that do not allow cell zzso
