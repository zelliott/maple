The zzso zzso gene encodes a member of the zzso family involved in the zzso zzso signaling zzso that controls the establishment of zzso cell polarity zzso in zzso zzso is the only known zzso gene in zzso with a restricted spatial pattern of expression in zzso discs from early stages of zzso zzso In the wing disc, zzso is first expressed zzso and later is restricted to the hinge and lateral regions of the zzso zzso zzso for strong zzso zzso zzso display previously zzso zzso consisting of a reduction of the hinge territory and an zzso zzso These zzso resemble those caused by reduction of the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso during early wing disc zzso An increase in zzso activity can rescue these zzso indicating that Ds is required for efficient zzso zzso This is further supported by genetic interactions between zzso and several components of the zzso zzso in another zzso zzso Ds and zzso show a complementary pattern of expression in early wing discs, suggesting that Ds acts in zzso zzso These results thus provide the first evidence for a more general role of Ds in zzso signaling during zzso development, not only affecting cell polarization but also modulating the response to zzso during the subdivision of the wing disc along its zzso zzso zzso
