The zzso zzso disease, systemic lupus zzso zzso has been known to be associated with zzso of zzso chain, a component of the zzso zzso zzso Comprehensive analysis has shown that expression of the zzso zzso chain is attenuated or absent in over half of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transcripts of the zzso zzso chain, including spliced zzso lacking zzso 7 or having a short zzso region, have been detected in zzso T zzso Although attenuated expression of the zzso zzso chain is also observed in cancer patients, infections and other zzso diseases, sustained zzso of the zzso zzso expression accompanied with zzso transcripts are only observed in zzso In this study, the authors review the unique features of zzso zzso defects observed in zzso and discuss the molecular basis of the defects by recent findings in animal models, zzso zzso and zzso association zzso
