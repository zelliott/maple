The purpose of the current study was to examine the signal zzso pathways activated and zzso zzso by zzso stimulation to zzso zzso of insulin zzso beta and insulin zzso zzso 1 was tested in pull-down zzso and zzso of zzso zzso B zzso on zzso zzso was measured by Western zzso Participation of zzso zzso in the zzso was tested by addition of zzso zzso zzso was measured on zzso of cell zzso as well as by zzso imaging on fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso were measured by Western zzso and zzso We showed that zzso treatment resulted in an zzso level of zzso on insulin zzso beta and insulin zzso zzso 1, and zzso site in zzso zzso acted zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as inhibitor of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso to membrane and zzso protein level increased upon zzso zzso zzso also zzso more sustained zzso zzso than insulin zzso This study provided evidence of the dual effects of zzso It improved insulin resistance by the zzso of the classical insulin zzso pathway, and increased zzso zzso
