zzso shuttling of zzso receptors zzso is disrupted in zzso cells leading to the zzso of zzso receptors from the nuclear to zzso zzso We show here that zzso from zzso cells are zzso on a specific zzso and maintain zzso zzso upon a prolonged hormone treatment that is associated with disruptions in its zzso zzso Since similar effects on zzso zzso shuttling and zzso were exerted upon treatment of zzso cells with the protein zzso inhibitor zzso acid, we examined whether zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, measured using various zzso in zzso was identical in zzso extracts prepared from zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso turnover in zzso from either the sum of all zzso zzso sites or from individual sites using zzso analysis, did not reveal any significant difference between zzso cells versus zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso in zzso cells does not appear to result from zzso of zzso zzso but rather from stimulation of zzso zzso
