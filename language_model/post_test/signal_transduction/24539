We examined the possibility that whole cell currents are involved and possibly trigger the response of zzso cells to heat zzso zzso cells from a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were heated at 45 degrees C for zzso zzso We observed induction of zzso currents after heating in the zzso zzso These currents decayed to zzso levels over a period of 6 zzso In zzso cells, however, zzso currents were zzso during heating only; these currents then decayed zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso changing the concentration of zzso zzso modified the zzso zzso zzso These zzso therefore, resulted from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso during heating zzso zzso cells to heat but had no effect on the heat response of the zzso zzso Continuous exposure of the zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 days induced the expression of additional functional, zzso zzso zzso these gave rise to currents that were measurable after zzso In zzso these cells became heat zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells blocked channels and returned the heat response almost to the zzso zzso Our data show a correlation between heat resistance and expression of zzso zzso Because resistance to heat very likely relates to the heat shock response, our data suggest that zzso of channels may be a very early event in initiation of the heat shock zzso
