Severe zzso zzso zzso is a zzso condition characterized by a drastic reduction in circulating zzso and a maturation arrest of zzso zzso cells in the bone zzso Usually this condition can be successfully treated with zzso zzso factor zzso Here we describe the identification of a novel point zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso in an zzso patient who failed to respond to zzso zzso When this zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells, it was defective in both proliferation and survival zzso This correlated with diminished zzso of the zzso complex as determined by signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso although zzso of zzso was more affected than zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso showed normal affinity for zzso but a reduced number of zzso binding sites compared with the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso in the zzso domain affects zzso complex formation with severe consequences for zzso signal zzso Together these data add to our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso emphasize the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso such zzso in zzso zzso
