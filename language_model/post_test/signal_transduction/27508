The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is an zzso expressed regulatory protein involved in the cycling of zzso proteins between zzso and soluble zzso Here, we characterized the zzso zzso activity of a zzso zzso zzso - zzso fusion protein in a zzso system derived from rat zzso zzso of zzso to kidney brush border zzso resulted in the specific release of zzso and zzso from the zzso while zzso and Ras were not zzso The release of zzso and zzso by zzso was dose dependent and zzso with about 50% of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins were tightly bound to zzso and could not be zzso by repeated zzso zzso These results demonstrated that kidney brush border zzso contained two populations of zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso and zzso was abolished at zzso conditions of salt and temperature in all zzso zzso When using zzso zzso zzso did not reduced the binding of zzso zzso However, washing brush border zzso with zzso prior treatment by zzso inhibited the extraction of zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso occurs easily under zzso zzso strength conditions, but a complementary factor is required to extract these proteins from zzso These observations suggest that the shuttling activity of zzso upon zzso proteins could be normally zzso under zzso zzso
