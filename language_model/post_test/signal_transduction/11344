zzso targeting is increasingly being recognized as a mechanism to ensure speed and specificity of zzso signal zzso in a variety of biological zzso zzso this is of particular importance for zzso protein zzso with a broad spectrum of zzso such as the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso second zzso of these zzso can be produced or released in response to a large variety of zzso signals, and they can, in turn, regulate a large variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso can link certain incoming stimuli with specific outgoing signals by restricting the zzso compartment at which zzso and/or action of a signaling zzso can take zzso zzso research on zzso and zzso reinforced the biological importance of such zzso We will focus here on zzso as recent advances in the understanding of its targeting have some significant general implications for signal zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso for instance, shows that a targeting protein can not only specify the zzso zzso of a signaling zzso but can also directly influence its zzso
