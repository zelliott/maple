The zzso zzso in mice is caused by zzso zzso in zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso These mice are characterized by defects in zzso hearing loss and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might play a role in zzso trafficking and hair cell zzso Recent evidence has shown that zzso is a zzso channel and its activity is regulated by zzso Here we show that zzso primarily zzso to early and late zzso in human zzso zzso This distribution at the less zzso portions of the zzso zzso is consistent with the reported zzso of the channel by low zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso causes dramatic zzso in the zzso pathway, including enlargement of zzso zzso delayed degradation of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso and defective zzso zzso whereas depletion of zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso pH is higher in cells zzso zzso and propose a model in which zzso release from zzso zzso by zzso might be important for efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso channel that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cargo trafficking along the zzso zzso
