Leaf zzso is regulated through a complex regulatory network triggered by internal and external signals for the zzso of gene zzso In plants, the major zzso phase transitions and stress responses are under zzso zzso In this review, the underlying molecular mechanisms are briefly discussed and evidence is shown that zzso processes are also involved in the regulation of leaf zzso Changes in the zzso structure during zzso differential zzso modifications determining active and inactive sites at zzso genes and DNA zzso are zzso In addition, the role of small zzso in zzso regulation is zzso
