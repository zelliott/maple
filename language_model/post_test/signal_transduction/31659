Little is known about the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the pathological hallmark of zzso valve zzso associated with symptomatic zzso zzso heart failure, and zzso Excess transforming growth factor zzso signaling is known to cause zzso valve zzso and zzso in a mouse model of zzso zzso We examined if zzso signaling is zzso in clinical specimens of sporadic zzso valve zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso valves and we tested the effects of zzso II zzso zzso on zzso signaling in cultured human zzso valve zzso 

zzso zzso cultured valve zzso and cultured zzso zzso cells were obtained from patients with zzso valve zzso undergoing zzso valve repair or from organ donors without zzso valve zzso Increased zzso zzso in diseased valve tissue correlated with an zzso of zzso expression and signaling as evidenced by zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and signaling zzso zzso primarily to zzso zzso cells suggesting zzso zzso In cultured valve zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso production, whereas zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in cultured zzso zzso cells was dependent on zzso and zzso signaling and was inhibited by zzso II zzso zzso 

zzso has a zzso role in the zzso of sporadic zzso valve zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso II zzso zzso may represent a mechanistically based strategy to zzso the pathological progression of zzso valve zzso in zzso
