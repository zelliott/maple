zzso zzso is a well-known human zzso agent whose exposure sources are mainly environmental and zzso zzso zzso is reported to induce central nervous system zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso zzso is still zzso In this study, to investigate which cell death signaling zzso is related with zzso zzso the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso were evaluated in zzso human neural stem cells zzso Human zzso were treated with 1 zzso of zzso for 48 zzso and the effect of zzso on cell signaling zzso was zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling that led to induction of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Furthermore, zzso acid zzso zzso differentiation was inhibited by zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso the differentiation of human zzso by induction of zzso zzso and zzso
