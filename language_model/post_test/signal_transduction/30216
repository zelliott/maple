The brain processes information about sensory stimuli and motor intentions using a massive ensemble of zzso arrayed in zzso Individual zzso receive zzso zzso from thousands of other zzso leading to the possibility that patterns of spikes across the input zzso might be crucial components of the neural zzso Recently, advances in zzso recording techniques have allowed several laboratories to investigate the nature of the interactions between zzso and their potential role in information zzso Several recent studies have found that the amount of information coded by correlated activity about sensory and motor variables is small, casting doubt on the hypothesis that correlations between pairs of zzso are important for information zzso However, other studies have documented the appearance of coherent zzso during particular task epochs and conditions that require selective processing of sensory information, supporting the hypothesis that coherent zzso between zzso might reflect the dynamic flow of information in the zzso
