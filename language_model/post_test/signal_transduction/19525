zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen that causes zzso invasive infections in zzso individuals and zzso persistent respiratory infections in individuals with zzso zzso zzso The differential progression of acute or chronic infections involves the production of distinct sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from patients with acute respiratory infection are generally zzso and express a variety of invasive zzso factors, including zzso the type III zzso system zzso type IV zzso zzso and multiple zzso toxins and zzso zzso zzso isolated from chronically infected zzso patients, however, typically lack expression of invasive zzso factors and have a zzso zzso due to the production of an zzso zzso The zzso zzso results from zzso zzso in zzso which encodes an zzso factor that normally prevents zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso is defective in zzso zzso and that the zzso occurs at the level of zzso zzso The CVS zzso regulates the expression of multiple invasive zzso factors, including zzso zzso A, zzso IV, and zzso We further demonstrate that zzso CVS zzso involves the alternative zzso factor zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso but does not depend on zzso zzso Our findings show that a single naturally occurring zzso leads to inverse regulation of zzso factors involved in acute and persistent zzso These results suggest that zzso conversion and zzso of invasive zzso zzso may both zzso a selective advantage to zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
