The zzso potency of zzso has been well zzso including its mediation by zzso zzso primary zzso We have previously shown that peripherally administered zzso activates the zzso cascade in a population of nucleus of the solitary tract zzso zzso and that preventing zzso zzso partly zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that exhibit zzso zzso of zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso administration increases the number of zzso that express zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and that zzso expression of zzso is increased in zzso zzso zzso Using Western zzso analysis, we show that the robust increase in zzso zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso is significantly attenuated in rats zzso with the zzso blocker zzso injected into the 4th zzso In addition, zzso injections increased zzso expression in zzso zzso in the zzso In contrast, only the rare zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity via the zzso zzso in the zzso likely contributes to zzso zzso zzso
