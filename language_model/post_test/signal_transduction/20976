The zzso protein zzso zzso cascade consisting of zzso and its direct zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for signaling of various zzso stimuli to the zzso Upon zzso zzso is zzso to the nucleus, whereas zzso stays in the zzso It has been shown recently that the zzso zzso of zzso is determined by its nuclear export signal zzso in the near zzso region zzso zzso However, the mechanism determining the zzso distribution of zzso has been poorly zzso Here, we show that introduction of zzso active zzso or zzso active zzso can induce nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cultured zzso Furthermore, we show evidence suggesting that zzso is localized to the zzso through its specific association with zzso and that nuclear zzso of zzso is accompanied by zzso of a complex between zzso and zzso following zzso of the zzso zzso We have identified the zzso site of zzso as its zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso encompassing the zzso site and the zzso sequence of zzso has been shown to be sufficient to retain zzso to the zzso These findings reveal the molecular basis regulating zzso distribution of zzso and identify a novel function of zzso as a zzso zzso protein for zzso
