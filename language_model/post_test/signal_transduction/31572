It is believed that large numbers of genes are involved in common human brain zzso Here, we propose a novel zzso strategy for simultaneously identifying multiple candidate genes for genetic human brain diseases from a zzso gene zzso zzso By zzso diverse zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso statistical model, we built a large-scale human zzso gene zzso Based on this network and minor prior knowledge of a specific brain disease, we can effectively identify multiple candidate genes for this zzso When four known Alzheimer's disease genes were used as the prior knowledge, among the top 46 zzso genes that we have found, 37 were previously reported to be associated with Alzheimer's zzso And the higher score a gene has, the more likely this gene is a zzso zzso The results suggest that the proposed method is effective, convenient, and zzso in the future genetic zzso
