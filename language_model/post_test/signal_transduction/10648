zzso stem cells zzso can differentiate into zzso if an appropriate cellular environment is zzso zzso signals exchanged between neighboring cells through the zzso zzso can eventually dictate cell zzso In our study, we show that zzso differentiation into zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso 

We created a zzso zzso model in rat by coronary zzso administered direct zzso injection of zzso zzso immediately, and observed the differentiation of zzso after 14 days by zzso zzso against zzso zzso We cultured zzso and zzso in four ways, respectively, in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso obtained from zzso rat zzso in a ratio of zzso zzso The two types of cells were cultured in two chambers separated by a zzso membrane as indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was added to indirect zzso zzso zzso Both zzso protein and zzso zzso were added to indirect zzso zzso Two weeks later, we observed the differentiation percentage, respectively, by zzso zzso 

We found the differentiation of zzso which were close to zzso in zzso The differentiation percentage of the four cell culture group was zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso can differentiate into zzso in zzso and in zzso if a zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso interaction is very important for the differentiation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso protein can activate zzso signal and enhance the differentiation of zzso into zzso while the effect can be inhibited by zzso
