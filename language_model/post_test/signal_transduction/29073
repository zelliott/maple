zzso is an efficient zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy is believed to involve different signal zzso zzso among which zzso zzso has been proposed as an important factor in the induced zzso In our study, based on real-time single cell analysis, we investigated the molecular involvement of zzso in zzso zzso in living human lung zzso zzso After zzso treatment, zzso was zzso resulting in Bid zzso at 4-5 zzso followed by Bid zzso and zzso c release, leading to cell zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso of zzso blocked Bid zzso zzso however, zzso c release was delayed by more than 2 zzso which was associated with the delay of zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso release of zzso c and cell death was significantly compromised in the Bid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to block the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso however, the progression of zzso were not affected, suggesting that zzso and zzso were not involved in this experimental zzso Taken together, the data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso in human lung zzso cells through zzso Bid, which then regulated the zzso zzso zzso The delays of zzso c release, zzso zzso and subsequent cell death by zzso zzso or zzso Bid exclude other earlier or parallel zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso zzso is the zzso earliest one, which dominates the zzso zzso
