The propagation of information through signaling zzso spans a wide range of time zzso including the rapid zzso interaction and the much slower response of downstream gene zzso To determine which dynamic range dominates a response, we used periodic stimuli to measure the frequency dependence of signal zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We applied system identification methods to zzso a concise zzso zzso We found that the dynamics of the zzso response are dominated by a zzso negative feedback through the zzso zzso that does not require protein zzso After large zzso shocks, an zzso much zzso negative feedback through gene expression allows cells to respond faster to future zzso
