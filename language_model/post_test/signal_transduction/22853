zzso stress activates the expression of many plant genes through zzso as well as zzso signaling zzso We report here the characterization of a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso which exhibits increased expression of the zzso stress responsive zzso zzso The expression of several other stress genes are also enhanced by the zzso zzso The enhanced expression is specific to zzso and zzso stress because low temperature regulation of these genes is not altered in the zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso in a single nuclear gene on zzso zzso Double zzso analysis of zzso and the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso stress hypersensitivity of zzso is not affected by zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, combined treatments of zzso with zzso and zzso stress had an additive effect on zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso stress hypersensitivity in zzso may be zzso The zzso of zzso seeds was more resistant to zzso However, the zzso zzso did not influence zzso control and only slightly affected the regulation of growth and zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso reveals a negative regulator of zzso zzso gene expression shared by zzso and zzso zzso stress signaling zzso
