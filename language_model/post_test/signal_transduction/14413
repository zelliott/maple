zzso zzso or zzso are a common benign smooth muscle zzso The tumor growth is well known to be zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of its zzso is not well zzso 

zzso expressed genes in human zzso zzso were either retrieved from published papers or from our own statistical analysis of downloaded array zzso zzso for the same genes on different zzso chips were mapped based on probe comparison information provided by zzso Genes identified by two or three array studies were submitted for zzso zzso Human and rat zzso genes were identified by using zzso gene databases, zzso and zzso and were confirmed by zzso analysis with zzso tool in the zzso zzso zzso 

By integrated analysis of three recently published DNA zzso studies with human zzso zzso genes were found to be zzso expressed in the same direction in zzso compared to adjacent zzso zzso by at least two research zzso Among these zzso twelve with rat zzso were identified as zzso from our array study investigating zzso expression in zzso rats treated with zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the twelve genes suggested multiple molecular mechanisms for zzso cell survival and tumor zzso zzso zzso increased expression of the zzso zzso gene and suppressed the expression of growth zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso may antagonize zzso zzso thought to inhibit zzso growth and survival, at two points in the zzso zzso 1) through increased zzso gene expression which can inhibit zzso zzso activity and in turn decrease zzso acid zzso and 2) by decreasing zzso expression which would reduce synthesis of zzso an zzso zzso for zzso Lastly, zzso affects zzso acid zzso synthesis and zzso by regulating expression of zzso and zzso zzso has been shown to play a significant role in the development of zzso zzso in an animal zzso 

Integrated analysis of multiple array zzso revealed twelve human and rat zzso genes that were zzso expressed in human zzso zzso and zzso responsive to zzso in the rat zzso zzso and zzso analysis of these genes suggest multiple potential molecular mechanisms for the poorly understood zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso understanding the exact molecular interactions among these gene products requires further study to validate their roles in zzso zzso This work provides new avenues of study which could influence the future direction of therapeutic intervention for the zzso
