zzso oxide zzso relaxation of zzso smooth muscle is crucial for the maintenance of human gut zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso smooth muscle relaxation involve zzso zzso zzso of zzso calcium zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as a novel target zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso calcium release in zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize zzso expression and its functional role in zzso signaling in human zzso smooth zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso and cultured zzso smooth muscle zzso In cultured human zzso smooth muscle cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso that were zzso and independent of zzso zzso The NO donor sodium zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso showed strongly decreased zzso protein zzso In these cells, sodium zzso and zzso both failed to zzso zzso calcium zzso Thus, zzso zzso appears to be essentially involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso smooth zzso
